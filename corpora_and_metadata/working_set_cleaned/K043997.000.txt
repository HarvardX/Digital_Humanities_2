remarks critical and illustrative on the text and notes of the last edition of shakspeare  ah think not mistress more true dullness lies in follys cap than wisdoms grave disguise like buoys that never sink into the flood on learnings surface we but lie and nod for thee we dim the eyes and stuff the head with all such reading as was never read for thee explain a thing till all men doubt it and write about it goddess and about it dunciad london printed for j johnson in st pauls churchyard mdcclxxxiii  preface if a variety of editions and innumerable comments can be supposed to perfect and correct the inaccurate text of a celebrated author sufficient one would think has been done to leave that of shakspeare without a blemish so slow however or so inefficacious is the progress and exertion of verbal criticism when moiling in the dust and cobwebs of antiquity so much is to be demolished so much to be rebuilt that it will not except to those who place implicit confidence in the interested and unqualifyed assertions of every publisher be a matter of much surprise to learn that after all that has been done by the labor of shakspeares numerous editors and commentators  after all that has been urged or assumed in favor of the last edition  as much more still remains to be done to bring his text back even to the state of correctness in which it was left by his first editors a reader of hesitation and reflection will hear this with perfect calmness he will be no stranger to the fluctuating state of former editions he will have noticed the boldness and assurance the legislative and dictatorial manner in which every succeeding editor has ushered hisself into the world and will not easyly forget the confidence of each in assuring the public that nothing further could possibly be done to his author  is not this the language of row and pope and theobald and warburton and hanmer and capell and where are they now where even dr johnson and mr steevens may in the course of a few revolving years be sent to accompany them  the regions of oblivion or disgrace  the chief and fundamental business of an editor is carefully to collate the original and authentic editions of his author it is otherwise impossible for him to be certain that he is giving the genuine text because he does not know what that text is there have been no less than eight professed editors of shakspeare and yet the old copies of which we have heard so much have never been collated by any one of them no not even either of the two first folios books indifferently common and quoted by every body and yet strange as it may seem not one of the eight but has taken the credit of or actually asserted his having collated them one may be well allowed to pass by the pretensions of those prior to dr johnson without particular notice their falsehood is sufficiently apparent in the margin of the late edition surely men who thus proudly expose and severely reprobate the crimes of their neighbors should effectually guard theirselves against similar accusations  i says dr johnson collated such copies as i could procure and wished for more   preface p     i collated all the folios at the beginning but afterward used only the first   ibidem p     he must be very hardy indeed that dares give a flat contradiction to such positive assertions as these from so respectable a character but the cause of shakspeare and truth obliges one to say that the learned writer is certainly mistaken the text of his own edition the notes of mr steevens and in some respect the remarks in the following sheets will prove that he never collated any one of the folios  no not for a single play  or at least that of his collations he has made little or no use that he picked out a reading here and there from the old editions is true all his predecessors did the same but this is not collation so much for dr johnson  with regard to the last edition mr steevens explicitly tells us that it has been constantly compared with the most authentic copies whether collation was absolutely necessary to the sense or not   advertisement p     would not any one from this declaration to use the ingenious critics own words suppose that he had at least compared the folios with each other   ibidem p     but he has been deceived no doubt by the person employed in this laborious but necessary work what an abuse of that confidence and credit which the public naturally place in an editor of rank and character to tell them that by a diligent collation of all the old copies hitherto discovered and the judicious restoration of ancient readings the text of this author seems now finally settled   malones preface to his supplement  to what better cause can we ascribe such unfounded assertions than to indolence and temerity since had the ingenious writer compared the old and present editions through a single play he must necessaryly have perceived that all the old copies had not been diligently collated that ancient readings had not been judiciously restored and that the text is no more finally settled at present than it was in the time of theobald hanmer and warburton nay that it is at large in the same state of inaccuracy and corruption in which it was left by mr row  these it may be objected are merely negative and unproved assertions it is very true and they who do not think them confirmed in the course of the following pages and will not give theirselves the trouble to investigate their truth are at liberty to disbelieve them to publish the various readings of the old editions would be a busyness of some labor and little utility  as to the notes and conjectures here offered to the public very little need be said shakspeare is the god of the writers idolatry and should any one of these remarks be thought pertinent or useful in the opinion of a single individual who like him admires the effusions of this darling child of nature and fancy whom age cannot wither and whose infinite variety custom cannot stale it will be a sufficient gratification to him for the pains bestowed in drawing them up and if there should be a future edition of this favorite this inimitable author the writer is not without vanity to hope that the following sheets may stimulate the editors care and attention to give his text with integrity judgment and correctness   a consummation devoutly to be wished and which must of consequence follow to reduce the number of exuberant and impertinent notes   from a republication of the last edition nothing is to be expected the work will continue like the editions of warburton and hanmer to dishonor critcs and to insult shakspeare   the freedom with which every editor has treated his predecessors precludes the necessity of an apology for the liberties taken in the ensuing pages with the sentiments of some of our most eminent literary characters the superiority of a commentators rank however does not entitle his blunders to respect it were to be wished that dr johnson had shown somewhat less partiality to pride of place for though he professes to have treated his predecessors with candor theobald the best of shakspeares editors experiences as much scurrility and injustice at his hands as hanmer and warburton the worst of them do deference and respect for this however the learned critic might have his private reasons which as they could scarcely have justified his conduct he did right to conceal  to controvert the opinions or disprove the assertions of mr steevens dr farmer and mr tyrwhitt men no less remarkable for their learning and genius than for their obliging dispositions and amiable manners has been a painful and odious task but wherever the writer has been under the necessity of differing from any of these gentlemen either in point of opinion or in point of fact he will not be found to have expressed hisself in a manner inconsistent with a due sense of obligations and the profoundest respect such at least was his intention such has been his endeavor and such is his hope  errata p    l    for might read might have p    l   dele it p    l    for wyffyves read wyffves p    l    for is not as  read is not as  p

shakspeares will the slightest alteration in the name of this great writer is a circumstance of so much importance to the public that although the editors may not have been too hasty in preferring shakspeare to shakespeare it might be wished that a more decisive and less equivocal authority than his will had been produced to justify and enforce the change this will it should seem the poet made in his last sickness when he appears to have been so incapable of paying that attention to the writing of his name which a man in health usually does that he has actually subscribed it two different ways shakspere and shakspeare so that we are still uncertain which mode to adopt how negligent therefore have the editors been and how much are they to be blamed for not procuring better and more positive evidence if it were to be come at  it certainly was mr garrick as they must have known though they did not think it necessary to notice the fact had then in his possession a lease or mortgage from shakspeare of a house in blackfriars subscribed as we learn from mr colmans preface to beaumont and fletcher with his own hand wm shakspeare which very luckyly confirms the alteration made with less authority by the present editors this deed was discovered among some old writings by mr wallis of norfolkstreet who presented it to mr garrick in the possession of whose widow it most probably still remains mr colman likewise informs us that the name is in the poets own county pronounced with the first a short   this pronunciation is right twice in the body of his will and once in the

been written in      that he might be of what the critic thinks a competent age for a witness in fact however the name of hamlet was in common use long before shakspeare was able to write a line so

remarks as from the play its self that the time of action is in the reign of king henry the fourth but if it should be placed says he as dr johnson observes it should be read between the second part of k henry iv and henry v where however it cannot be introduced without the most flagrant impropriety it must be remembered that mrs quickly who is halfbawd halfhostess in k henry iv is in the merry wives of windsor dr caiuss housekeeper and makes a decent appearance and in k henry v is pistols wife and dies in an hospital a progression that is not very natural it is strange enough that the critic should not perceive that dr caiuses housekeeper and the landlady of the boarshead are totally distinct characters and have not if we except their name sex sentiments and loquacity a single circumstance in common between them shakspeare could have been at no loss for one of the same name and family in any town in england  tempest p   boats  if you can command these elements to silence we

be formed of meddle it is most likely a corruption of the french word meslee  p    pro  being transported and wrapped in secret studies  and could this bald and threadbare phrase have passed the examination of judicial collaters and correctors of shakspeares text would not rapt have been a fair and probable conjecture even if it had not been as it is the reading of the old editions and could it possibly have escaped the observation of any person who had made a constant comparison with the most authentic copies  p    pro  urchins shall for that vast of night that they may work all exercise

   pro oh how this spring of love resembles the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away  resembles mr tyrwhitt says is here used as a quadrisyllable as if it was written resembeleth and in support of this assertion he instances the two following lines the one from the comedy of errors the other from as you like it and these two dromios one in semblance the parts and graces of the wrestler   and it should be observed continues he that shakespeare takes the same liberty with many other words in which l or r are is subjoined to another consonant see com of errors these are the parents to these children  mr steevens in a note immediately preceding mr tyrwhitts has observed that when a word was not long enough to complete the measure our early writers occasionally extended it thus says he spenser in his faery queen formerly grounded and fast setteled again the while sweet zephirus loud whisteled his treble a strange kind of harmony which guyons senses softly tickeled etc   from this practice he supposes the author wrote resembeleth which though it affords no jingle completes the verse the old ballad of titus andronicus adds he is written in this measure where the second and fourth lines only rhyme whether this be a fact or not let the forest judge the ballad is printed by percy and begins thus the stanza being the same throughout you noble minds and famous martial wights that in defense of native country fights give ear to me that ten years fought for rome yet reapt disgrace at my returning home   there is much greater and more important matter i these observations than either of the ingenious commentators was aware of neither shakspeare nor spenser appears from the above instances at least to have taken the smallest liberty in extending his words neither has the incident of l or r being subjoined to another consonant any thing to do in the matter but that great authors and great critics should not be better acquainted with the orthography and grammatical structure of their native tongue is a circumstance which if not to be wondered at is surely very much to be regretted the truth is that every verb in the english language gains an additional syllable by its termination in est eth ed ing or when formed into a substantive in er and the above words when rightly printed are not only unexceptionable but most just thus resemble makes resembleeth wrestle wrestleer and settle whistle tickle make settleed whistleed tickleed  semblance indeed cannot properly be written as three syllables neither perhaps is it altogether necessary to pronounce it so childeren however would be certainly right  another instance of this sort occurs in k john that were embatteled and ranked in kent which should now be written embattleed though the verb was probably enough in shakspeares time usually spelled embattel  again in butlers panegyric on sir john denham no poet jeered for scribbling amiss with verses forty times more lewd than his   here scribbling should be printed scribbleing the meter evidently requiring three syllables which are necessaryly articulated in the pronunciation  these ideas had they been more germane to the object of the present sheets or more likely to experience a favorable reception might have been much expanded and further pursued but indeed our orthographical system is so thoroughly corrupted and the principles and formation of the language are even by those who have professedly treated the subject   johnson priestley etc  so little investigated or understood that a writer hardy enough to attempt a reform will naturally expect to find many of his clearest axioms considered as the offspring of singularity affectation and caprice  p     lance  i am the dog  no the dog is himself and i am the dog  oh the dog is me and i am myself ay so so   this passage dr johnson very gravely remarks is much confused and of confusion says he the present reading makes no end there is not however the least room for alteration shakspeare has evidently intended to make honest lance puzzle and confound hisself in the arrangement of his dramatis personae and it should seem he has tolerably well succeeded  a similar thought mr steevens observes occurs in a play of an elder date than this a christian turned turk      the two gentlemen of verona is mentioned by meres in      and in the opinion of mr malone bears strong internal marks of an early composition he therefore refers it to the year      surely then the play quoted by mr steevens can hardly be supposed to be of an elder date  ibi lance now come i to my mother  oh that she could speak now like a wood woman   mr steevens was not certain that he understood this passage and indeed the contrary does not appear by his explanation of it now says lance i come to my mother  i e to the old shoe with the hole in it which he has just told us was to represent her oh that she  i e the old shoe could now speak like a wood woman that is like a woman crazed mad out of her senses with grief for my departure and where is the difficulty of this  p     pro is it mine eye or valentinos praise   the word eye was supplied by dr warburton who says that in all the old editions we find the line printed thus it is mine or valentinos praise  but this to use his own warm language   see dr johnsons prefaces life of broom small edition p    is a lie the line is so printed in no old edition  the first folio reads it is mine or valentines praise  the second is it mine then or valentineans praise  there is no quarto  p     jul out out lucetta that will be illfavored out out lucetta means no more than fie fie  p       out know then that some of us are gentlemen such as the fury of ungoverned youth thrust from the company of awful men that is says dr johnson reverend worshipful such as magistrates etc sir john hawkins proposes lawful which mr steevens and mr tyrwhitt seem halfinclined to admit but awful men is certainly right and means men wellgoverned observant of law and authority full of or subject to awe in the same kind of sense as we use fearful  p       out myself was from verona banished for practicing to steal away a lady an heir and niece allied unto the duke niece mr theobald altered to near as the poet he thought would never have expressed himself so stupidly as to tell us this lady was the dukes niece and allied to him and indeed if he had done so the remark and alteration might have been just but he does not say she was the dukes niece any more than he does that she was his heir she was the niece and heir of some body else and a distant relation of the duke  p     sil i am very loath to be your idol sir but since your falsehood shall become you well to worship shadows and adore false shapes send to me in the morning and i will send it  dr johnson says that this is hardly sense he might have said more it is nonsense we might he thinks read thus but since youre false it shall become you well  mr tyrwhitt however will have no alteration he supposes the word it to be understood i e but since your falsehood it shall become you well etc or that to worship shadows etc is the nominative case to shall become  how far any of these opposite conjectures would rectify or elucidate the text it is not now proposed to examine as the omission of a single comma will restore sense to the whole passage  i am very loath says silvia to be your idol but since your falsehood to your friend and mistress shall well become you to worship shadows and adore false shapes i e will be properly employed in so doing send to me and you shall have my picture  ibi host by my hallidom i was fast sleep i e by my holydame our lady  p     jul it seems you loved not her to leave her taken   protheus says dr johnson does not properly leave his ladys token he gives it away he therefore proposes a different reading but what puerile quibbling this is to leave is to quit abandon forsake part with etc to leave her taken is properly to give it away  merry wives of windsor shall the council shall know this   fall twere better for you if twere known in council you will be laughed at   dr johnson considers this as a broken and abrupt speech and alters the passage accordingly mr steevens says the modern editors read  if twere not known in council and believes falstaff quibbles between council and counsel secrecy but the present reading is just neither is there any such conceit in the speech which is quite in falstaffs insolent sneering manner it would be much better for you indeed says he to have it known in the council where you would only be laughed at  p   0 slen two edward shovelboards that cost me two shillings and twopence apiece    edward shovelboards dr farmer thinks were the broad sillings of edw vi but why edward the sixths shillings for the shovel boards of henry the fourths time can it be imagined that these shillings in shakspeares time not fifty years after their coinage and when they were in common circulation could be possibly ever sold for two and twopence it may likewise be doubted if edward the sixths shillings ever were or indeed could be used at shoel board as they appear much too light for that diversion mster slenders edward shovelboards have undoubtedly been broad shillings of edward the third  ibi sim i combat challenge of this latten bilbo   one could well wish that the greater part of the long notes on this passage had been omitted latten is certainly tin but whether the allusion be to slenders softness rather than to his thinness is not quite so clear  p     fall hold firrah bear you these letters tightly   this is nonsense the quarto and second folio read rightly for which tightly the reading of the first folio is only a misprint  p     sim no forsooth he has but a little we face   we says mr steevens in the northern dialect signifies very little but though he is so near the true meaning he hints that on the authority of the quarto      we might be led to read whey face little we however is certainly the right reading it implies something extremely diminutive and is a very common vulgar idiom in the north we alone has only the signification of little thus cleveland a yorkshire we bit longer than a mile the proverb is a mile and a we bit i e about a league and a half  p   0 quic we shall all be shent   i e according to mr steevens scolded roughly treated the word has indeed a variety of significations in old authors and these are two of them but in modern language mrs quicklys exclamation would have been  we shall be all murdered ruined undone  p     pist hope is a curtailed dog in some affairs   the tail says dr johnson is counted necessary to the agility of a greyhound and one method he observes of disqualifying a dog according to the forestlaws is was to cut his tail and make him a curtail a curtaildog adds mr steevens was the dog of an unqualifyed person whose tail by the laws of the forest was cut off  but it does not appear that there either is or could be any such regulation in the forestlaws as greyhounds which alone would be disqualifyed by excauditation could never have been the objects of laws made solely for the preservation of the kings deer by those modern forestlaws however the acts of parliament for the preservation  i e destruction of the game as expounded by that learned and respectable body ycleped justices of the peace an unqualifyed person is allowed to keep a curtailed greyhound without incurring the penalties of the aforesaid statutes in which it is difficult to say whether justice or humanity be most apparent a curtail dog simply is one of that inferior species of those animals now called curs from the prevailing usage of cutting their tails a piece of wanton barbarity which though by no means singular even in this country can only be perpetrated by unfeeling wretches who seem to enjoy no more reason than is just sufficient to plunge them into a more degraded and brutal state than that of the poor animal they so inhumanly mangle  p     quic but mrs page would desire you to send her your little page of all loves   this which mr steevens thinks signifies no more than by all means is an expression of kindness and an earnest desire that the person would comply with the request out of affection and regard  p   0 fall  i see what thou were if fortune thy foe were not   he alludes to a very old and formerly very popular song beginning fortune my foe why do thou frown on me  it is more than once mentioned by beaumont and fletcher and from a passage in the rump or mirror of the times an old comedy by john tatham it should seem to have been a common dance tune which may serve to show that the old dances were much more grave and solemn than those now in use the tune being a very slow movement as the reader will immediately recollect when he is informed that it is the identical air now known by the song of death and the lady to which the metrical lamentations of extraordinary criminals have been usually chanted for upwards of these two hundred years  p     mrs ford  it is my maids aunt of brentford   ford a witch a queen etc  she works by charms etc   concerning some old woman of brentford says mr steevens there are several ballads among the rest julian of brentfords last will and testament      the learned commentator has in this assertion perhaps been misled by the vague expression of the stationers book iyl of breyntfords testament to which he seems to allude was written by robert and printed by william copland long before      but this the only publication it is believed concerning the above lady at present known is certainly no ballad  p     sim may i be so bold to say so sir   fall ay sir tike like who more bold   in the first edition the latter speech stands i tike who more hold  and should plainly be read here ay sir tike etc farmer  the word recommended by this ingenious critic is indeed inserted but doubtless by the printers oversight the corrupt one which it was intended to supplant has been likewise continued  p     eva  but stay i smell a man of middle earth   spirits says dr johnson are supposed to inhabit the ethereal regions and fairies to dwell underground men therefore are in a middle station yes but to make the explanation consistent we must suppose spirits to inhabit a higher earth and fairies a lower otherwise the station of man cannot with respect to them be called middle earth the truth is that the phrase which is a very common one signifies neither more nor less than the earth or world from its imaginary situation in the midst or middle of the ptolemaic system and has not the least reference to either spirits or fairies  volume the second measure for measure p    enter clown as this is the first clown who makes his appearance in the plays of our author mr steevens thought it not amiss from a passage in tarltons news out of purgatory to point out one of the ancient dresses appropriated to the character  i saw one actired in russet with a buttoned cap on his head a great bag by his side and a strong bat in his hand so artificially attired for a clown as i began to call tarltons wonted shape to remembrance  this may probably enough have been the dress appropriated to such a character as the clown or fool in as you like it all is well that ends well twelfth night and king lear but the clown of this play is a different personage the tapster to a bawdy house and resembles the above character no more than lance speed costard or launclot gobbo the note and quotation therefore which might had their use elsewhere are here certainly misplaced  p  0 claud  upon a true contract i got possession of juliettas bed you know the lady etc  this speech as mr steevens well observes is too indelicate to be spoken concerning juliet before her face for she appears to be brought in with the rest though she has nothing to say the clown points her out as they enter and yet from claudios telling lucio that he knows the lady etc one would think he says she was not meant to have made her personal appearance upon the stage  that julietta enters at the same time with claudio  that she is not present during his conversation with lucio  and that she is afterward in the custody of the provost  are evident and certain the little seeming impropriety there is will be entirely removed by supposing that when claudio stops to speak to lucio the provosts officers depart with julietta  p    duke we have strict statutes and most biting laws which for these nineteen years we have let sleep  it was fourteen years in all the editions prior to theobald who made the alteration the reason of which he in his note upon the place says will be obvious to him who recollects what the duke has said in a foregoing scene but the duke had not before uttered a syllable about the matter he must therefore mean claudio who mentions  the enrolled penalties which have like unscourd armor hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacks have gone round and none of them been worn   theobald says the author could not so disagree with himself and that it is necessary to make the two accounts correspond but there is no reason to charge the author with inconsistency neither is it necessary that the two speakers should agree in their calculation if it were the dukes account should most certainly be preferred as he was doubtless much better acquainted with the exact time of the disuse of those laws than claudio can be reasonably supposed to have been for though he may not be too young a man to have a perfect recollection of the circumstance and it should rather appear he is yet it must be observed that he is about to suffer by the revival of these very penalties which both his interest and inclination would naturally lead him to represent as much more obsolete than they actually were the old reading should in all events be restored  p    isab sir make me not your story   i e do not make a jest of me dr johnson do not by deceiving me make me subject for a tale mr steevens do not divert yourself with me as you would with a story do not make me the subject of your drama  p  0 elb escal which is the wiser here justice or iniquity   these says dr johnson were i suppose two personages well known to the audience by their frequent appearance in the old moralities the words therefore continues he at that time produced a combination of ideas which they have now lost  justice or iniquity i e the constable or the fool escalus calls the latter iniquity in allusion to the old vice a necessary character it is said in the ancient moralities or dumb shows and the harlequin of the modern stage justice may have a similar allusion to his supposed antagonist into whose hands after a variety of elusions he was always made to fall  p    enter lucio and isabella prove save your honor   ang stay yet awhile   to isab you are welcome what is your will   it is not clear dr johnson thinks why the provost is bidden to stay nor when he goes out  the entrance of lucio and isabella should not perhaps be made till after angelos speech to the provost who had only announced a lady and seems to be detained as a witness to the purity of the deputys conversation with her his exit may be fixed with that of lucio and isabella he cannot remain longer and there is no reason to think he departs before  stay yet a while the old copies which dr johnson pretends to have collated read stay a little while  p    ang  aside she speaks and it is such sense that my sense breeds with it  that is says dr johnson new thoughts are stirring in my mind new conceptions are hatched in my imagination so adds he we say to brood over thought but can this be right does not the deputy plainly mean that her wisdom raised his desires  p    ang as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could displayed  these masks in mr tyrwhitts opinion mean the masks of the audience an indecorum he thinks of which shakspeare would hardly have been guilty to flatter a common audience he therefore concludes that the play may have been written to be acted at court  the remark is ingenious but not decisive it is hardly generous or candid to make the author absurd when his language or sentiment will obviously bear a different and rational interpretation the idea in angelos speech might be easyly communicated by the mask which isabella held in her hand and these black masks will in that case only be such masks as these or this kind of masks which doubtless is shakspeares meaning enshield is certainly put by contraction for enshielded and not by corruption for inshed as mr tyrwhitt would suppose  p    duke  and here by this is your brother saved  and the corrupt deputy sealed   to scae is certainly to reach as dr johnson explains it as well as to disperse or spread abroad and hence its application to a routed army which is scattered over the field further than this it seems nothing to the purpose of mr steevenses note the dukes meaning appears to be either that angelo would be overreached as a town is by the scalade or that his true character would be spread or laid open so that his vileness would become evident dr warburtion thinks it is weighed a meaning which dr johnson affixes to the word in another place scaling his present bearing with his past coriolanus  p    duke i will presently go to st lukes there at the moated grange resides this mariana   a grange does not properly mean any solitary farm house as mr steevens explains it it implies some one particular house immediately inferior in rank to a hall situated at a small distance from the town or village from which it takes its name as hornbygrange blackwellgrange and is in the neighborhood simply called the grange originally perhaps these buildings were the lords granary or storehouse and the residence of his chief bailiff  grange fr granagium lat this note may likewise serve to correct mr wartons misinterpretation of the word in vol x p      p  00 escal double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind this would make mercy swear and play the tyrant   certainly right we still say to swear like an emperor and from some old book of which the writer unfortunately neglected to copy the title he has noted to swear like a tyrant to swear like a termagant is quoted elsewhere dr warburton would read mercy swerve and dr farmer severe a similar passage occurs in as you like it  patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer p  0  duke i am a brother of gracious order lately come from the sea in special business from his holiness  the folio as dr johnson observes reads from the sea and this seems the more probable reading for without it could be proved that the sea was used by way of eminence and distinction for the papal court one may be satisfied that shakspeare intended to represent the friar as having come from his holiness to vienna by sea and so no doubt shakspeare might imagine he did if it were not from the mention which occurs of poland and russia one might suppose the vienna of this play to be not the capital of austria but rather vienna now vienne in dauphine which was anciently a city of great fame governed by a duke  p  0  duke  volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quests  that is says dr johnson reports running counter to each other but false and contrarious quests in this place rather mean lying and contradictory messengers with whom run volumes of report an explanation which the line quoted by mr steevens will serve to confirm  p     abhor a bawd sir fie upon him he will discredit our mitery   i think it just worth while to observe says dr warburton that the word mystery when used to signify a trade or manual profession should be spelt spelled with an i and not a y because it comes not from the greek  but from the french mestier  if it were worth the learned prelates while to make this observation it may be worth the while of an inferior person to contradict it for ingenious as the distinction may seem and implicitly as it has been adopted there is not the smallest authority for it unless the great critics dogmatical assertion may be termed so he doubtless thought that the word mystery was too sublime and sacred to be mixed with the profane and vulgar ideas of base mechanicals and that such vile objects as trades and manual professions ought not to participate in the use of a name set apart for the inexplicable solemnities of christianity but the truth is that the word in its highest or lowest acceptance means no more or less than the secret or arcana of any craft civil or religious in faith or in works and whether we are talking of the mystery of the blessed trinity or the mystery of the barbersurgeons we mean one and the same word from mystere fr of which mestier is only a corruption mysterium lat  gr mystery should therefore be restored to the text whence it was the more unwarrantably ejected even according to the right reverend fathers hypothesis as it there signifies neither trade nor manual profession  p     clown  master forthright the tilter   the old copy says dr johnson reads forthlight but this he conjectured should be forthright alluding to the line in which the thrust is made and as he had it in his power to alter the text  so the text was altered forthlight may nevertheless be the true reading certainly it should not have been so hastyly displaced it probably enough contains an allusion to the fencers threat of making the light shine through his antagonist  p     barnar  what are you   clown your friends fir the hangman   this should be either  your friend sir the hangman or  your friends sir the hangmen  p     duke unfit to live or die oh gravel heart after him fellows bring him to the block  the duke is wonderfully consistent not three lines below he calls the prisoner a creature unprepared unmeet for death and says that  to transport him in the mind he is were damnable   p   0 ang  but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no for my authority bears a credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather  though all the editors and commentators differ about the meaning of this passage and even dr johnson is not ashamed to say that he has nothing to offer worth insertion yet surely there is no such amazing difficulty in it mr upton and mr upton only has given the true and apparent sense the following are his own words which dr johnson as he did not understand the passage and consequently their value has been pleased to mutilate were it not for her maiden modesty how might the lady proclaim my guilt yet you will say she has reason on her side and that will make her dare to do it i think not for my authority is of such weight etc  p   0 duke  i will limit thee this day to seek thy help by beneficial help  thus indeed the old editions but we should certainly read life  p     bal for slander lives upon succession for ever housed wheret gets possession  on consulting the first folio says mr steevens i found the second line had been lengthened out by the modern editors who read for ever housed where it once gets possession i have therefore adds he referred it to its former measure  if this ingenious gentleman had consulted the second folio he might have perceived that the line had not been lengthened nor indeed touched by the modern editors  p  0  s ant let love being light be drowned if he sink   the old editions read she but i know not says mr steevens to whom the pronoun she can be referred i have made no scruple to remove a letter from it it would not however have been amiss if the ingenious critic had been somewhat more scrupulous on the occasion as there need be little doubt to whom the pronoun she can be referred i e to love venus thus in the old ballad of the spanish lady i will spend my days in prayer love and all her laws defy   comedy of errors p     adr tell me was he arrested on a band  s dro not on a band but on a stronger thing a chain a chain  band is here rightly preserved but it is pleasant enough to mark the consistency of the editors who make a merit of restoring it from bond which they observe is in the old editions and was formerly spelled band the word porpentine appears throughout all the old copies and in many contemporary writers but this they have modernised to porcupine the affirmative i always used by shakspeare and others has been likewise changed to ay and frequently to the injury of both sense and rhyme a number of words in every play are in the same predicament and even this identical word band is elsewhere turned into band happy shakspeare  a band mr steevens observes is likewise a neckcloth and on this circumstance he believes the humor of the passage turns but the ingenious gentleman is under a double mistake a band is not nor ever was a neckcloth though certainly an appendage to the neck neither does the humor of the passage turn upon any such allusion for there would be very little humor in it if it did adriana means a written band and dromio quibbles upon a hempen one  p     cour  will you go with me well mend our dinner here   s dro master if you do expect spoonmeat or bespeak a longer spoon   or says mr steevens which modern editors have thrown out of the text signifies before but the passage is wrong pointed and the or is a mistake for and we should read thus  cour  well mend our dinner here   s dro master if you do expect spoonmeat and bespeak a long spoon   mr steevenses remark does not seem much to the purpose  p     abb  what does ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a hunge infectious troop of pale distemperature and foes to life  shakspeare says dr warburton could never make melancholy a male in one line and a female in the next he therefore boldly pronounces the line the foolish insertion of the first editors as if such fools could write as well as shakspeare  mr heath in his fancyful way proposes a different reading while mr steevens is contented with ridiculing the preciseness and affectation of master capell  but after all the text is very clear and intelligible and certainly right kinsman means no more than near relation many words are used by shakspeare with much greater latitude  p     mess mistress  he cries for you and vows if he can take you to scorch your face and to disfigure you  dr warburton would read scotch but mr steevens defends the present reading which is certainly the true one and says that antipholis would have punished her as he had punished the conjurer before he had singed the conjurers beard off mr steevens should have informed us how he it was to punish his wife in the same manner  p     aegeon oh grief has changed me since you saw me last and careful hours with times deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face  defeature says dr johnson is the privation of feature the meaning adds he is time has cancelled my features it is no uncommon thing to find the author and his commentator of different opinions what says aegeon why that time had written defeatures in his face i e given them to him as to the commentators theirselves it is so very rarely we meet them agreeing that it is no wonder to find mr steevens explaining defeatures by undoings miscarriages misfortunes from defaire fr so that the meaning according to this ingenious gentleman will be time has written in my face strange undoings but defeatures are certainly neither more nor less than features as demerits are neither more nor less than merits time says aegeon has placed new and strange features in my face  i e given it quite a different appearance no wonder therefore thou do not know me  ibi aegeon i am sure thou do  e dro ay sir but i am sure i do not and whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe him  in the two old folios the passage stands and rightly thus aegeon i am sure thou do e dro i sir but i am sure i do not etc   i is here  not the adverb but  the personal pronoun  one great excellence of modern commentators consists in the art of discovering neglected puns it is some wonder therefore that this of dromio should escape them the reader will remember that aegeon is actually in bonds  p     duke besides her urging of her wreck at sea   this mr steevens observes is one of shakspeares oversights the abbess has not so much as hinted at the shipwreck perhaps indeed adds he this and the next speech should change places  that however would scarcely remove the difficulty the next speech is aegeons both it and the following one should precede the dukes or there is possibly a line lost  p     been  let him him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam   adam bell says dr johnson was a companion of robin hood as may be seen in robin hoods garland in which if i do not mistake adds he are these lines for he brought adam bell and clim of the clough and william of cloudeslee to shoot with our forester for forty mark and our forester beat them all three   in answer to this it may be observed   that adam bell was not a companion of robin hood   that it cannot be seen in robin hoods garland   that the lines quoted prove neither the one nor the other as they do not relate to robin hood it is peculiarly unfortunate that the leraned critic should be most mistaken where he is most confident  much ado about nothing p     john i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace   a canker dr johnson tells is the cankerrose dogrose cynbsius or hip but the word canker should rather seem to be used here as it is in various other places for the worm which preys upon flowers a metamorphosis suited to the maignancy of the speakers disposition  thus in the two gentlemen of verona  as in the sweetest bud the eatingcanker dwells   again in the same play  as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow    mallet alias malloch in his beautyful ballad of william and margaret has made a fine use of this idea  but love had like the cankerworm consumed her early prime the rose grew pale and left her cheek  she died before her time it occurs likewise in the midsummer nights dream some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds  again in the same play o me you jugler oh you cankerblossom  upon which mr steevens observes that canker blossom is not in this place the blossom of the canker or wildrose which our author alludes to in much ado about nothing act i sc vi the present text but a worm that preys on the leaves or buds of flowers always beginning in the middle and the ingenious critic is certainly right in his exposition of the words cankerblossom but it may be safely affirmed that if they mean not the wildrose canker neither in the text nor any where else does  we meet with it again in the first part of hen iv  o that this good blossom could be kept from cankers and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke in this last passage it undoubtedy means what mr steevens explains it to be the wildrose which it does not in the following  has not thy rose a canker somerset   hen    p     pedro see you where benedick has hid himself  claud o very well my lord the music ended well fit the kidfox with a pennyworth  i e says dr gray well be even with the fox now discovered  so adds he the word kid or kidde signifies in chaucer to which mr steevens does not dissent except by hinting that if any future editor should choose to read hid sox he may observe that hamlet has said  hide fox and all after  a kid fox seems to be no more than a young fox or cub  p     dogb go good partner get you to francis seacoal bid him bring his pen and inkhorn

 have you writ down they are none   this is an admirable stroke of humor dogberry says of the prisoners that they are false knaves and from that denial of the charge which one in his wits could not but be supposed to make he infers a communication of counsels and records it in his examination as an evidence of their guilt sir j hawkins  it is with infinite reluctance that the writer finds hisself obliged to differ in opinion from the learned magistrate who from his having so long and so ably presided upon similar occasions must no doubt be perfectly acquainted with the nature of a judicial process  that there is infinite humor in the passage is very true and that the ingenious commentator has not discovered it is equally so the sentiments and conduct of master dogberry being the direct reverse of what he supposes them to be we clearly perceive that in this examination dogberry takes all the precaution possible to come at the truth he charges them severally with being false knaves he takes the utmost care that they shall have no communication of counsels in order to concert a joint defense by only whispering to one what he had before asked in the hearing of both he is therefore astonished to find them both in a tale and directs it to be recorded as a proof of their innocence  that they are no knaves  because they had both told him so  this is the more evident from the behavior of the sexton who in mr steevenses opinion and he seems perfectly right shows as much good sense on the occasion as any judge upon the bench could do and who immediately tells dogberry that he goes not the way to examine and that he must call the watch etc  if the learned annotator will amend his comment by omitting the word guilt and inserting the word innocence it will except as to the supposed inference of a communication of counsels which should be likewise omitted or corrected be a just and pertinent remark  p     leon if such a one will smile and stroke his beard and sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan  by the two full pages of notework upon this passage there should seem to be some difficulty in it be it what it will however it is left just as it was found every editor and commentator has offered his proper lection and therefore here is a new one to increase the number and sorrow waggery hem when he should groan i e sorrow becoming waggery or converting sorrow into waggery hem etc  surely this is at least as good as  hallow wag sorrow wage sorrow gagge sorrowing sorry wag etc or even as the present text the old editions unisormly read and

one may easyly suppose would not have hesitated to call a fine lady fool to her face benedick it is to be hoped had rather more politeness the phrase occurs frequently in shakspeare and means no more than  you ask a question or that is the question  p     song pardon goddess of the night those that slew thy virgin knight  knight does not mean either follower or pupil as dr johnson says it does the lady being a virgin and her name hero she is metonymically called one of dianas knights and what occasion was there for a note upon this  loves labor lost p     cost the manner of it is he was taken

phrase and often made use of is mere nonsense  p     arm why sadness is one and the selfsame thing dear imp   this is spoken to his boy or page dr johnson observes that imp was anciently a term of dignity lord cromwell he says in his last letter to hen viii prays for the imp his son and what does that prove the word literally means a graff slip scion or sucker and by metonymy comes to be used for a boy or child the imp his son is no more than his infant son it is now set apart to signify young fiends as the devil and his imps  p     jaq fair weather after you   dull come jaquenetta away   maid fair weather after you come jaquenetta away thus all the printed copies but the editors have been guilty of much inadvertence they make jaquenetta and a maid enter whereas jaquenetta is the only maid intended by the poet and is committed todull to be conveyedto the lodge in the park this being the case it is evident to demonstration that  fair weather after you  must be spoken by jaquenetta and then that dull says to her come jaquenetta away as i have regulated the text theobald  mr theobald has endeavored here to dignify his own industry by a very slight performance the folios all read as he reads except that instead of naming the persons they give their characters enter clown constable and wench johnson  there was no great occasion for this evidence to prove the last learned commentator very little acquainted with the editions of which he speaks with so much familiarity and confidence the assertion in the note is untrue none of the folios read as theobald does in the first of them the passage stands thus  maid fair weather after you   clo  i e clown costard not constable come jaquee tta away   in the second and subsequent folios thus  maid fair weather after you come jaquenetta away  mr theobald does not appear to have inspected the first folio dr johnson has evidently looked neither into that nor into any of the rest  p     cost my sweet ounce of mans flesh my incony jew   incony or kony as dr warbarton says in the north signifies fine delicate as a kony thing a fine thing he would therefore read my incony jewel but the truth is that there is no such expression in the north as either kony or incony the word canny which the people there use and from which dr warburtons mistake may have arisen bears a variety of significations none of which is fine delicate or applicable to a thing of value dr johnsons quotation by no means proves jew to have been a word of endearment  p     hol  trip and go my sweet   these words are certainly part of an old

of sir henry wotton of which the poetical reader will forgive the insertion   ye stars the train of night that poorly satisfy our eyes more by your number than your light ye common people of the skies what are ye when the sun shall rise johnson the passage is certainly worth quoting but one may venture to doubt whether the poetical reader will easyly pardon the insertion of it in the inaccurate and corrupted state in which the learned critic has been pleased to give it for let us read what sir henry hisself says  you meaner beauties of the night that poorly satisfy our eyes more by your number

and other festive seasons such things being chiefly plotted and composed by ignorant people were seldom committed to writing at least with the view of preservation and are of course rarely discovered in the researches of even the most industrious antiquaries and it is certain that nothing of the kind except the speeches in this scene which were intended to burlesque them ever appeared in print the

thus like muscovites or russians  the settling commerce in russia was at that time a matter that much engrossed the concern and conversation of the public there had been several embassies employed thither on that occasion and several tracts of the manners and state of that nation written so that a mask of muscovites was as good an entertainment to the audience of that time as a coronation has been since warburton  all this may be very true but the learned commentator might have discovered that a mask of muscovites was no uncommon recreation at court long before our authors time in the first year of king henry the eighth at a banquet made for the foreign ambassadors in the parliament chamber at westminster came the lord henry earl of wltshire and the lord fitzwater in two long gounes of yelowe satin trauarsed with white satin and in every ben of white was a bend of crimosen satin after the sashio of russia or ruslande with furred hattes of gray on their hedes either of them

occasion nor opportunity for any further remark at the foot of this page however there is a note by the celebrated dr percy which seems to deserve some little attention and the more so as it is countenanced by the very ingenious gentleman alluded to who has either not been aware of its fallacy or from private motives forborne to expose it  dr warburton says this redoubted critic is quite mistaken in deriving oliver from palmerin de oliva which is utterly incompatible with the genius of the spanish language so that from his thus recurring to etymology he clearly appears to be not a whit better acquainted with the history than dr warburton was the old romance continues he of which oliver was the hero is entitled in spanish historias de los nobles cavalleros oliveros de castilla y

translatee du latin par phil camus in fol gothique  from so much seeming knowledge from the annotators great credit and from his very confident assertions who would be foreward to suspect his ignorance or doubt his veracity but it is even so he knows no more of the history which he quotes with so much parade than bishop warburton knew of amadis or palmerin with either of which the story of oliver the paladin has just as much connection as it has with the history of oliver of castile and arthur of algarbe with respect to the above french and spanish titles they are literally transcribed

than an innocent old woman  p    ob the human mortals want their winter here   shakspeare says mr steevens might have employed this epithet  human mortals which at first appears redundant to mark the difference between men and sairies fairies adds he were not human but they were yet subject to mortality this however does not by any means appear to have been the case oberon titania and puck never dye the inferior agents must necessaryly be supposed to enjoy the same privilege and the ingenious commentator may rely upon it that the oldest woman in england never heard of the death of a fairy

anon his thisby must be answered and forth my minnock comes  minnock dr johnson says is the reading of the old quarto and he believes right minnekin adds he now minx is a nice trifling girl the folio according to mr steevens reads mimmick perhaps for mimick a word more familiar than that exhibited by one of the  tos for the other reads minnick after all minnock mimmick and minnick are only perhaps misprints for mommock which comes nearly to the same letters and signifies a huge misshapen thing and is very properly applied by a fairy to a clumsy overgrown clown minnekin is evidently a corruption of mannekin or manikin properly mankin   mannikn s  man and klein german johnsons dictionary  a little man dr johnson is so very imperfectly acquainted with the nature and derivation of the english language and in that respect his dictionary how valuable soever it may be on account of the explanation and use of english words is beneath contempt there being scarcelyten words properly deduced in the whole work that it is no wonder to find him making minnekin and minx the same word but minnekin does not mean a nice trifling girl and though a substantive is oftener used adjectively than otherwise so in midas not john lylies  my minikin miss   mn kin  small diminutive shakespeare ibi  the smallest sized pins are likewise called minnekin or minikin pins so jerry sneak citizen and

labors hard to prove this to be a vicious reading fairies says he are never represented stamping or of a size that should give force to a stamp nor could they have distinguished the stamps of such from those of their own companions he therefore reads and at a stump here over and over one falls  to prove however that fairies could stamp mr steevens produces a passage from olaus wormius he need not have gone so much out of his way honest reginald scot could have informed him that our grandams maids were wont to set a boll of milk before incubus and his cousine robin good fellow for grinding of malt or mustard and sweeping the house at midnight andthat he would chase exceedingly if the maid or goodwife of the house having compassion of his nakedness laid any clothes for him beesides his

says it was probably written by shakspeare  the learned critic has made the same innovation in another place and quoted this very passage as genuine to justify the change and yet where the word candlesticks was a syllable too much and the old editions read cansticks which rendered the measure perfect and was supported by the authority of many ancient authors he has continued candlesticks in the text  puck ho ho ho coward why come thon not  it may be remarked that this exclamation is peculiar to puck in the old song printed by peck in which he relates all his gambols he concludes every

twin which dr johnson calls an ingenious emendation that deserves to be true but dr warburton is in evident confusion about the passage he makes helena compare her lover to something which had the property of appearing one thing when it was another not the property sure he cries of a jewel in reality however helena makes no such comparison and the learned critic wilfully misstates her words to found his ingenious emendation as every foolish and impertinent proposal is by the courtesy of editors entitled she says that she has found demetrius as a person finds a jewel or thing of great value

modern editors have altered it into  no lion fell had they continues he consulted the quarto   00 it would have set them right  then know that i as snug the joyner am a lion fell nor else no lions dam a reading which this ingenious gentleman has accordingly adopted it is nevertheless certainly wrong and that of the folio is certainly right  at the rehearsal of the play lest the ladies should be afeard of the lion being as bottom observes the most fearful wild fowl living it was settled that there should be a prologue to tell that snug who was to perform this terrible part was not a lion his name was likewise to be named and half his face seen through the lions neck through which he was moreover to speak saying thus or to this defect  ladies etc if you think i come hither as a lion it were pity of my life no i am no such thing i am a man as other men are  and there indeed he was to name his name and tell them plainly he was snug the joiner this prologue he is now delivering but the passage must be read and pointed thus the sense and meaning being strangely misconceived and misrepresented by the present editors then know that i one snug the joiner am a lion fell nor else no lions dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place twere pity of my life   that is i am neither lion nor lioness i am snug the joiner the text makes him declare that he is a lion or comes as a lion which is utterly inconsistent with the rest of his speech defeats the very end and design of his prologue and would have been enough god shield us to scare the ladies out of their wits the use of

alive nor dead be ever of a muse adorned   instead of ever a late editor of spenser not so intimate perhaps with the language of his author and his contemporaties as he ought to have been proposes to

and my usances  use and usance mr steevens says are both words anciently employed for usury and to justify the explanation he quotes the two following passages from an old play give me my use give me my principal a toy the main about five hundred pounds and the use fifty   but after all is he not mistaken use and usance mean nothing more than interest and the former word is still used by country people in the same sense his own authorities prove this to be the ancient meaning give me my interest give me my principal the main  i e the principal five hundred pounds and the use fifty i e interest at ten per cent the legal rate in shakspeares time when perhaps the word usury itsself had a much more innocent meaning than has been since annexed to it in the old song of neptunes raging fury or the gallant seamans sufferings it signifies only a scrivener the lawyer and the usurer that sits in gowns of fur etc   p   0 antho  for when did friendship take a breed of barren metal of his

laun i am lancelot your boy that was your son that is and your child that shall be   the distinction between boy and son dr johnson sagaciously remarks is obvious but child adds he seems to have had some meaning which is now lost mr steevens supposes that by your child that shall be he means that his duty to his father should in future show him to be his child there is not the least difficulty in the passage lancelot is talking nonsense or as the vulgar have it putting the cart before the horse but whether designedly or not is left to the contemplation of the critics he means however to say i was your child i am your boy and shall ever be your son  p     shy  thou shall not gormandize as thou have done with me  the word  gormandize is very ancient and took its rise from a danish king the danes toward the latter end of the ninth century were defeated by king alfred at edendon in wiltshire and as an article of peace guthrum their king commonly called gurmond submitted to be baptized king alfred being his godfather who gave him the name of athelstan and took him for his adopted son during the stay of the danes in wiltshire they consumed their time in profuseness and bellycheer in idleness and sloth insomuch that as from their laziness in general we even to this day call them lurdanes so from the licentiousness of gurmond and his army in particular we brand all luxuricus and profuse people by the name of gurmondizers and this luxury and this laziness are the sole monuments the only memorials by which the danes have made themselves notorious to posterity by being encamped in wiltshire vide a vindication of stoneheng restored by john webb esquire p     n jonson in his sejanus act i  that great gourmond fat apicius g after such a pompous display of learning so strangely introduced into the margin of shakspeare how will this mr g who has certainly showed if not judgment at least prudence in concealing his name be surprised to hear that there is not a single jt either of sense or of truth from the beginning to the end of his laborious dissertation gourmand a glutton and gourmandise glutroy whence jonons gourmond and our gormandize are immediately taken are common french words to be found in every dictionary and lurdane properly lurden is derived from lourdin or falurdin a word of the same signification in the same language equally common either gourmond or lurdane therefore has no more possibly much less connection with the ancient danes than it has with this same mr g the structor of the above ingenious but alas too easyly demolished fabric  p

place see a note on measure for measure act i collins  the conversation of even the highest ranks was not perhaps in shakspeares time over and above remarkable for its delicacy but does the  real commentator believe that a lady of portias good sense high station and elegant manners could speak or even think so grossly it is impossible  this observation and others of the like nature from the same hand are however as the reader will perceive strictly within the canon  he  i e the professed critic may find out a bawdy or immoral meaning in his author where there does not appear to be any hint that way canon xii  p     shy and others when the bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affections masters of passion sway it to the mood of what it likes or loath  the reading of all the old editions is and others when the bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affection masters of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes   which is surely defensible though our candid editors have not been pleased to notice it the meaning is that some men when they hear the sound of a bagpipe are so affected therewith that they cannot retain their urine for those things which are masters over passion make it like or loath whatever they will  if sways be objected to it may be easyly altered to sway but there are above fifty instances in shakspeare where a verb of the singular number is made to agree with a noun of the plural  p     sy why he a woollen bagpipe   it is not unusual to see the large skin or bladder of a bagpipe covered with flannel and it is possible that shakspeare only used the word as a descriptive epithet  dr johnson supposes he wrote wooden  sir john hawkins swelling or swollen but any meaning is preferable to such arbitrary violations of the text  p     por shylock there is thrice thy money offered thee   where or by whom is any such offer made bassanio indeed in answer to portias question if anthonio were not able to discharge the money says yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum   but nobody offers thrice the money either portia mistook bassanios proposal or this is one of those inaccuracies of the text which are now irremediable  p     duke for half thy wealth it is anthonios the other half comes to the general state which humbleness may drive unto a fine  anth so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so be will let me have the other half in use  to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter  the terms proposed says dr johnson have been misunderstood anthonio declares that as the duke quits one half of the forfeiture he is likewise content to abate his claim and desires not the property but the use or produce only of the half and that only for the jews life unless we read as perhaps is right upon my death  how others have misunderstood anthonios terms does not by this edition appear and it might be policy in dr johnson to suppress the account for it is very clear that they are not understood by him anthonio tells the duke that if he will abate the fine for the states half he anthonio will be contented to take the other in trust after shylocks death to render it to his daughters husband that is it was during shylocks life to remain at interest in anthonios hands and shylock was to enjoy the produce of it the present reading is perfectly right clear and intelligible and these trifling mistakes might teach even the greatest critic some little diffidence

no alteration was ever more necessary or more obvious the two syllables thus misplaced and which are utterly absurd and insensible as they stand are just wanting to make up the meter of the first line of lorenzos speech the emendation is therefore unpardonably neglected  p     p     the merchant of venice  a ballad is still remaining on the subject of romeo and juliet which by the date appears to be much older than shakspeares time it is remarkable that all the particulars in which that play differs from the story in bandello are found in this ballad  where is this same ballad to be found or

brother on his blessing to breed me well  dr warburton would substitute my father in the place of fashion dr johnson allows that the nominative my father is left out but says it is so left out that the auditor inserts it in spite of himself an auditors understanding the intent of a speech will not however supply the defects of its grammatical construction there is no necessity for omitting the word fashion but either my father or which is perhaps much better the pronoun he should be inserted between fashion and bequeathed the passage ought therefore to be read and pointed thus as i remember adam it was on this fashion he bequeathed me by will but a poor thousand ducats etc the reader will perceive that it is only the sequel of a conversation which has commenced before the play  p     le

therefore prays the gods to make her honest the clown tells her that to cast honesty away upon a foul slut i e an ill favored dirty crecture is to put meat in an unclean dish she replies she is no

the following is it not past two oclock and here is no orlando  p     clo we found our quarrel was upon the seventh cause   so says dr johnson all the copies but it is apparent adds he from the sequel that we must read the quarrel was not upon the seventh cause  the propriety of this remark is very doubtful jaques a few speeches after asks the clown how he and his antagonist found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause the clown says upon a lie seven times removed and thus explains it   his dislike of the courtiers beard   the courtiers retort courteous   the quip modest   the reply churlish   the reproof valiant   the countercheek quarrelsome   the lie circumstantial this may indeed be called the seventh cause but it certainly is not a lie seven times removed touchstone is rather inaccurate in his calculations but dr johnsons proposal seems inadmissible after all it is not easy to conceive how either the lie circumstantial or the lie direct could be a greater affront than the countercheck quarrelsome which was simply thus  you lie  taming of the shrew p  0  sly am not i christopher sly old slys son of burtonheath ask marian hacket the fat alewife of wincot if she know me

recollected william visor of wonct but the matter is fully cleared up by the celebrated mr warton who positively assures us that wilnecotte is a village in warwickshire with which shakspeare was well acquainted near stratford that the house kept by our genial hoiess still remains but is at present a mill a stranger to the chronology of mr wartons life would be apt to conclude from this satisfactory information that shakspeare and he had had many a merry meeting over a cup of our genial hostesses warwickshire ale or how should he suppose him to have come by such a perfect knowledge of the house our authors intimate acquaintance with it and the character of its mistress burton dorset is a village in warwickshire  p     hor sweet bianca  happy man be his dole   a proverbial

forefinger   it behooves me here to remark that this abridged nominative tib is not as the great musical knight opineth a contraction of tabitha but is the diminutive of isabel moreover the forefinger is not as master tollet conceives the thumb but that finger which is usually placed next or nearest thereunto meseemeth likewise that our author has here one of those covert allusions diverse of which

the print of the old folio it is doubtful whether it be joves or loves the characters being not distinguishable johnson  it is no wonder that the learned critic should not have been able to distinguish between an   and an l where he could not perceive the variation of whole words and even lines and speeches no one beside hisself however could possibly have had a doubt about the matter the two characters being as clearly different in the old editions as they are any where else  but this is not the only instance in which the ingenious commentator could not determine whether the word were love or jove he is at the same loss in troilus and cressida x    where the l is equally conspicuous  p     clo o madam yonder is my lord your son with a patch of velvet ons face whether there be

tyrwhtt thinks that the conceit given to sir andrew shows too quick an apprehension for him he would therefore transfer it to sir toby but does the ingenious critic imagine it probable that maria would call sir toby an ass  p     sir to marry hang thee brock   a brock is certainly a badger but malvolio is not so called because he is likely to be hunted and persecuted like that animal which by the way is never hunted neither is to badger a man a phrase for making a fool of him sir toby uses the word as a term of contempt as if he had said hang thee cur  out filth to stink like a brock being proverbial to badger a man is to be perpetually plagueing him the badger from that spirit of humanity so prevalent in the english vulgar being always baited to death  p     sir t  how now my nettle of india   the old copy mr steevens says reads  mettle of india which he thinks is probably the true reading the change he tells us was made by mr row  nettle however as the learned commentator ought to have known is the reading of the second folio and is indisputably right  p     sir to challenge me the counts youth to fight with him   this mr tyrwhitt pronounces to be nonsense he would have us read  challenge me the counts youth go fight with him but if any alteration be necessary it should be thus  challenge me the counts youth to fight with you the text however is neither nonsensical nor difficult  p     sir to why man he is a very devil i have not seen such a virago   the word virago is certainly inapplicable to a man a blustering hectoring fellow as sir toby means to represent viola for he cannot possibly entertain any suspicion of her sex but it is no otherwise so than rounceval is to a woman meaning a terrible fighting blade from ronceval or roncesvalles the famous scene of that fabulous combat with the saracens when charlemagne and all his peerage fell by fontarabia   p     sir to nay if you be an undertaker i am for you   this mr tyrwhitt believes a touch upon the times in allusion to certain persons who in the reign of king james the first undertook to carry all the government measures smoothly through parliament but what has antonio said or done that sir toby should take him for a busy member of the house of commons he only means to tell him that if he be an undertaker of or intermeddler in other peoples quarrels he sir toby is ready to take him up  p     clo what say you sir i am shent for speaking to you   shent i e rated scolded abused the two instances adduced by mr steevens give it a meaning quite foreign to the text  p   0 sir toby ay biddy come

sir to  we willcrown thee for a finder of madmen   dr johnson thinks this phrase an allusion to witchfinders but mr steevens pronounces it a satire on those coroners who so often bring in selfmurder lunacy to which title he says many other offenses have to the full as just pretensions the observation is however scarcely pertinent as it is not the officer but the inquest that makes the return and perhaps while such inhuman such diabolical laws as the brutality of the most barbarous ages has annexed to the commission of the above act continue to disgrace the judicial system of this country even perjury itsself becomes a virtue finders of madmen are those who formerly acted under the writ de lunatico inquirendo  p     sir to  meddle you must that is certain   meddle mr steevens explains mix

have given it right i e a frenzy that drew every object but one out of my memory  ibid clo an your ladyship will have it  i e malvolios letter as it ought to be you must allow vox   i am by no means

says the clown will have this letter read as it should be you must allow me the full and proper use of my voice she had just checked him for bawling too loud which he tells her is the right method of reading a madmans letter  winters tale p  0  leo  lower messes perchance are to this business purblind  mess says dr johnson is a contraction of master as mess john master john an appellation used by the scots to those who have taken their academical degree lower messes therefore adds he are graduates of a lower form mr steevens however believes that lower messes is only used to signify the lowest lower degrees about the court a conjecture in which he seems to be as right as dr johnson is certainly wrong the word mess as mess john neither being any contraction of master nor having the remotest allusion to academical degrees it is merely the scottish pronunciation of mass and is only applied in vulgar language to the priest or minister  p     came i have loved thee    leo make that thy question and go rot   nothing can be more obvious than that the words here put into the mouth of camillo really belong to leontes whom he neither does nor could address with so much familiarity but we are under no necessity to agree with mr tyrwhitt that they would come in more properly after rot if the measure be thought to need emendation it would be less violence to adopt that proposed by mr theobald  p     ant i have three daughters the eldest is eleven the second and the third nine and some five  this says dr johnson is mr theobalds correction the former editions read sans five  if the critic mean to say only that some editions prior to theobalds read sans the assertion may probably be true but if his note imply that theobald first introduced the word some nothing can be less so it is the reading of the first folio and the second does not read sans  the speaker tells us that one of his daughters was eleven the second nine and the third about five  p     leo i never heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first  it is apparent dr johnson says that according to the proper at least according to the present use of words less should be more or wanted should be had  it is a pity that the learned critic should not better understand the language upon which he professes to comment there is not the slightest difficulty or impropriety in the passage i never heard says leontes that any of these greater offenders wanted i e were deficient in less impudence to deny their crime than to commit it you therefore he means to tell the queen who have had sufficient impudence to do what i charge you with can be at no loss for impudence to deny it  p     flo  the gods themselves humbling their deities to love have

reply will then be perfectly becoming her character  p     shep leave your prating since these good men are pleased let them come in  here a dance of twelve satyrs  pol aside o father you will know more of that hereafter   this says dr warburton is replied by the king in answer to the shepherds saying since these good men are pleased  this is very unlikely the dance which has intervened would take up too much time to preserve any connection between the two speeches the line spoken by the king seems to be in reply to some unexpressed question from the old shepherd and should not be uttered aside  macbeth p     match the prince of cumberland    the crown of scotland mr steevens observes was originally not hereditary when a successor was declared in the life time of a king as was often the case the title of prince of cumberland was immediately bestowed on him as the mark of his designation  the propriety of this note is not very apparent  the crown of scotland had been hereditary for ages before duncan  nay from the very foundation of the scottish monarchy the apparent or presumptive heir was always the known and declared successor as in england and every other hereditary government the kings eldest son or grandson  i e the heir apparent for the time being alone was prince of cumberland as the king of englands is prince of wales or the king of frances the dauphin and it should seem from the play that malcolm was the first who had this title  p  0  march  no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine making the green  one red  whoever was the author of this emendation as it is called for mr sheridan has likewise taken the credit of it lectures on elocution  to p    it seems to have been adopted with too much haste and without either necessity or advantage the old reading is much more in the manner of shakspeare and of course more likely to be the true one especially if we read sea  p     mat  there is none but he whose genius i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark antonys was by caesar he chid the sisters when etc  though i would not often assume the critics privilege of being confident where certainty cannot be obtained nor indulge myself too far in departing from the established reading yet i cannot but propose the rejection of this passage which i believe was an insertion of some player that having so much learning as to discover to what shakspeare alluded was not willing that his audience should be less knowing than himself and has therefore weakened the authors sense by the intrusion of a remote and useless image into a speech bursting from a man wholly possessed with his own present condition and therefore not at leisure to explain his allusions to himself if these words are taken away by which not only the thought but the numbers are injured the lines of shakespeare close together without any traces of a break  my genius is rebuked he chid the sisters johnson this note dr johnson tells us was written before he was fully acquainted with shakspeares manner and he does not now think it of so much weight why did he then reprint it because the words which he once thought interpolated by the players he now thinks to have been interpolated by the author but there never was surely such a number of words wasted to such an idle purpose whether macbeth would have made use of the image is not the question the words are as evidently shakspeares as any others in the play and where was the necessity of so much learning to discover the allusion the idea was persectly familiar to him he got it from the old translation of plutarch and has particularly dwelled upon it in antny and cleopatra act ii scene iii  p     match  better be with the dead whom we to gain our place have sent to peace  the old copy according to mr steevens reads whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace  the change he says was made by mr row it is however the reading of the second folio  p     match ere  the shardborne beetle with his drowsy hum has rung nights yawning peal etc  the shardborn beetle is perhaps the beetle born among shards i e not cowsdung for that is only a secondary or metonymical signification of the word and not even so generally but pieces of broken pots tiles and such like things which are frequently thrown together in corners as rubbish and under which these beetles may usually breed or what is all the same may have been supposed to do so  thus in hamlet the priest says of ophelia shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her  would mr tollet say that cowsdung was to be thrown into the grave the spelling of born can have no weight any way it is true however that sharded beetle seems scarcely reconcilable to the above explanation mr steevens may be right but dr warburton and mr tollet are certainly wrong  p     enter three murderers   mur but who bid thee join with us     mur macbeth     mur he needs not our mistrust since he delivers our offices and what we have to do to the direction just    the meaning of this abrupt dialogue dr johnson observes is this the perfect spy mentioned by macbeth in the foregoing scene has before they enter upon the stage given them the directions which were promised at the time of their agreement yet one of the murderers suborned suspects him of intending to betray them the other observes that by his exact knowledge of what they were to do he appears to be employed by macbeth and needs not be mistrusted a comment which there are sew besides the learned author that would not have been ashamed to repeat  in the preceding scene macbeth says to the two first murderers i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy of the time the moment on it i e the very time when you are to look out for him but dr johnson has changed it to a perfect spy of the time and seems too consident or too careless to perceive the absurdity he introduces for if macbeth had made the two first murderers acquainted with this perfect spy of dr johnson and they had received their directions from him how could the first murderer possibly ask him who bid him join them  o but says the learned critic he suspects him of an intention to betray them betray them to whom to banquo to be sure they had wonderful cause to be afraid of one whom the king hisself had appointed them to kill  the fact plainly is that this additional or supernumerary villain is sent from macbeth by way of reinforcement after the others had taken their stand he has told them that he was acquainted with the design but one of them being unwilling it should seem to admit a third to participate in the reward and therefore desirous to shuffle him off very naturally asks who bid him join them  p     macd bleed bleed poor country great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure for goodness dares not check thee wear thou thy wrongs his title is affcard  his  i e macbeths title is affeerd i e established or affirmed since he whose duty and interest it is to endeavor to dethrone him refuses to join in the attempt this kind of exclamation seems natural to macduff for a little after when malcolm striyes to comfort him on the slaughter of his wise and children he breaks forth in the same manner he   i e maleolm and not macheth as mr steevens supposes has no children  all my pretty ones  p     mal it is called the evil  strangely visited people all swollen and ulcerous he curts hanging a golden stamp about their necks put on with holy prayers and it is spoken to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction with this strange virtue he has a heavenly gift of prophery etc  it must be owned says dr warburton that shakspeare is often guilty of some strange absurdities in point of history and chronology yet here he has artfully avoided one he had a mind to hint that the cure of the evil was to descend to the successors in the royal line in compliment to james the first but the consessor was the first who pretended to the gift how then could it be at that time generally spoken of that the gift was hereditary this he has solved by telling us that edward had the gift of prophecy along with it  the ingenious editor of the household book of the fifth earl of northumberland dr percy adds mr steevens very acutely observes on the subject of cramp rings that the miraculous gift of curing the evil was left to be claimed by the stuarts our ancient plantagenets were humbly content to cure the cramp  there may be a vast fund of acuteness but there is not a tittle of truth or knowledge in this ingenious observation it is so well known that not only the tudor family but their predecessors for many ages exercised this real or imaginary power that in the reign of queen elizabeth who touched often as any old history and many other books will inform us one william tooker a learned divine published a laborious latin treatise upon the subject in which he enumerates a number of cures performed by that princess and others of our ancient english monarchs   see much curious information on this subject in the reverend dr douglases criterion or miracles examined london      p         etc henry vii and edward i are proved to have touched for the evil by contemporary writers and the notion of such an inherent power in our kings appears by indisputable authority to have been as thoroughly established in the reign of henry ii as it was in that of charles ii or queen ann  with respect to dr warburton one would be glad to know how he became so certain that edward the confessor was the first who pretended to this gift shakspeare may be sometimes chargeable with great absurdities but he rarely if ever commits such a one as his overlearned commentator would here force upon him if edward the consessor had been the first english monarch possessed of this hereditary faculty it must necessaryly have dyed with him for he not only was a usurper but left no issue so that king james neither did nor possibly could either claim or get it from him and his real titles were too good and he was too well acquainted with them to permit him to accept such a compliment even if shakspeare intended it which he undoubtedly did not  p     rosse  but i have words that would be howled out in the desert air where hearing should not catch them  the folio it seems read latch which appears to be the proper word and certainly signifies catch thus in piers plowman so     as who so lays lines for to latche fowls as mr steevens elsewhere tells us that he made it his busyness to restore ancient readings one might naturally have expected to see latch in the text  p     match  then fly false thanes and mingle with the english epicures  it appears says mr steevens in a note upon this passage from dr johnsons journey to the western islands of scotland that the natives had neither kail nor brogues till they were taught the arts of planting the one and making the other by the soldiers of cromwell and yet adds he king james vi thought it necessary to form an act against superfluous banqueting  it is a pity that the ingenious commentator has omitted the very candid and liberal inference which the great traveler draws from the above circumstance of the kail i e that when they had not that they had nothing  but under the favor of this ingenious critic it does not appear  dr johnson indeed is pleased to say so and they who would have believed him if he had given a relation of his voyage into the moon may if they choose believe this it is very seldom that we find people teaching to others arts of which they are ignorant theirselves and yet this must have been the case with cromwells soldiers who were accustomed neither to eat kail nor to wear brogues the truth is that both articles have in all probability been known to the scottish ever since the country was inhabited so that they may safely admit the truth of the above very candid travelers goodnatured position  mr steevens seems to think it altogether needless to restrain luxury in diet where people could get neither kail nor brogues which to be sure are the very essence of a sumptuous feast  p     match and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart  stuffed mr steevens tell us is the reading of the old copy but for the sake of the ear which must be shocked by the recurrence of so harsh a sound he is willing to read foul foul is accordingly read and such is the method taken to preserve the authors genuine text alas poor shakspeare  volume the fifth king john p   k john be thou as eghtning in the eyes of france for ere thou can report i will be there the thunder of my cannon shall be heard  this simile dr johnson observes does not suit well the lightning indeed adds he appears before the thunder is heard but the lightning is destructive and the thunder innocent the allusion may notwithstanding be very proper so far as shakspeare has applied it i e merely to the swiftness of the lightening and its preceding and foretelling the thunder but there is some reason to believe that thunder was not thought to be innocent in our authors time as we elsewhere learn from hisself thus in king lear you sulphurous and thought executing fires vaunt couriers to oakrending thunderbolts   again in antheny and cleopatra some innocents escape not the thunderbolt  again in julius caesar  i have walked about the streets and thus unbraced casea as you see have barred my bosom

old superstition is still prevalent in many parts of the country  p  0 k john bedlam have done  surely this should be beldam a word frequently used in this play  p    constable thou wear a lions hide doff it for shame and hang a calves skin on thy recreant limbs  it does not appear that constance hereby means to call austria fool as sir john hawkins would have it but she certainly means to call him coward and to tell him that a calves skin would suit his recreant limbs better than a lions they still say of a dastardly person that he is a calfhearted fellow and a runaway schoolboy is usually called a great calf  p    pand for that which thou have sworn to do amiss is it not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it  for this nonsense the reader is indebted to dr johnsons emendation the old copies have it thus is not amiss when it is truly done which dr warburton calls the conclusion de travers he therefore reads is yet amiss sir thomas hanmer  most amiss  but all these objections to and proposed alterations of the old reading arise entirely from its not being understood if the reader will consider the passage a moment he will perceive that it has sense and meaning  is quite in the spirit of the cardinals quibbling logic  and infinitely superior to any of these pretended emendations pandulf having conjured the king to perform his first vow to heaven  to be champion of the church  tells him that what he has since sworn is sworn against hisself and therefore may not be performed by him for that says he which you have sworn to do amiss is not amiss i e becomes right when it is done truly that is as he explains it not done at all and being not done where it would be a sin to do it the truth is most done when you do it not  so in loves labor lost it is religion to be thus forsworn  there is no difficulty in this but what the over busy critic chooses to make  it is strange that when the sense is so clear any commentator should thus laboriously obscure it to introduce a new reading and yet stranger that he should show such confidence in his emendation as to insert it in the text johnson  the learned critic seems to think hisself entitled to an exclusive privilege of corrupting the authors language   it is not with this writer alone that such injudicious freedoms have been taken beaumont and fletcher are equally indebted to the sense and judgment of their friendly editors one instance out of some hundreds may serve as a specimen in the faithful shepherdess perigor describing a delightful bank says here never durst the babbling euckow spit which last word the ingenious critic who unsettled the text in the late edition to spit not being as he believed a property of the cuckoo very readyly changed to sit a variation which slight as it is entirely destroys the harmony of the passage and could only have proceeded from a person equally ignorant of the authors language and inattentive to his ideas the whole description is confined to the purity of the turf and its freedom from every thing foul and venomous and lest the next editor of these poetical brothers should know no more of his duty than his immediate predecessor has done he is here told that in the north of england the white froth frequently observed on bushes plants and grass is believed by the vulgar to have a poisonous or venomous quality and is universally called the cuckows      p  0 faul bell book and candle shall not drive me back the curse by bell book and candle is the solemn anathema pronounced by the priest at the time of mass the book being laid open before him the candles lighted and the sacring bell rung  p  0 pand for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue  true blood says dr johnson is the blood of him that has the just claim but the expression seems to mean no more than innocent blood in general  p     lewis  john has made  his peace with rome what is that peace to me  i by the honor of my marriage bed after young arthur claim this land for mine in a preceding scene pandulph tells lewis that in case of arthurs death he   in the right of lady blanch his wife might then make all the claim that arthur did   this claim the dauphin now asserts and it is possible that shakspeare imagined him to have the right he pretended but the fact is arthur had left an infant sister eleanor of britain who was then right heir to the crown and de jure queen of england and who to the everlasting disgrace of this country languished all her days in obscurity and confinement and even supposing her out of the question john and his son henry had a better title than blanch who was only that kings sisters daughter unless indeed he might be said to have forfeited all right by his unnatural cruelty to his nephew whom he is believed to have murdered with his own hands yet still even on that idea would young henrys title remain unimpeached for neither then nor in our authors time was it understood that the personal misconduct of the ancestor could in any case bar the succession of the innocent issue a humane and righteous principle reserved for the discovery and practice of a more refined and liberal people in a more enlightened and politic age  p   0 sal  new flight and happy newness that intends old right  happy innovation quoth dr johnson that purposed the restoration of the ancient rightful government what rightful government does the good old constitutionalist suppose it to have been in john a murderer and a villain one who had not the least right to the possession of the crown and whom it would have been praiseworthy in any man or set of men to have put to death  richard the second p     boling norsolk  so far as to mine enemy   dr johnson does not he says clearly see the sense of this abrupt line it is not therefore much to be wondered that he has not given a meaning which he could not find the old copies reading  so fare  0 all the old copies read so fare steevens a mistake the second folio reads  so far  mr tollet makes the speaker wish norsolk to fare like his enemy a construction than which nothing can be more irrational and absurd bolingbroke only uses the phrase by way of caution lest mowbray should think he was about to address him as a friend norfolk says he so far as a man may speak to his enemy i etc  p     boling thanks gentle uncle  come lords away to fight with glendower and his accomplices  this last line mr theobald thought an interpolation and therefore threw it out of his edition and in this the editors have been weak enough to enclose it in brackets these proceedings are the more remarkable as supposing it genuine there does not appear any thing like a reason in mr theobalds note for the charge he would make against shakspeare of forgetfulness and inattention to history and a very strange charge it would be for it is evident from the preceding scene that there was a force in wales which bolingbroke might think it necessary to suppress and why dr johnson for you think the emendation just might not shakspeare call it glendowers when we next see bolingbroke he is in wales and mentions his having received intelligence that the welshmen are dispersed  p     queen gardener for telling me these news of woe i would the plants thou graftst may never grow  an execration dr johnson observes too ludicrous and unsuitable to the queens condition and it certainly appears so but perhaps for shakspeares highest or lowest characters are never without a quibble she means to wish him chidlless it is to be remembered that the queen was very young dr johnson will therefore the more readyly pardon any puerilities of expression he may find her guilty of  p     fitzw  my rapiers point  dr johnson here takes an opportunity to censure shakspeare for deserting the manners of the age in which his drama is placed  this weapon he says not being seen in england till two centuries aftewards it would be as well however though not quite so easy for the learned critic to bring some proof in support of this and such like assertions without which the authority of shakspeare is at least equal to that of dr johnson and even if he could prove what he asserts which however it is believed he cannot the poets friends would still have an argument which would render both his assertions and his proofs equally nugatory and ridiculous  p     k rich my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches to mine eyes    the first folio says dr johnson agrees with the third quarto which reads my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jarre there watches to mine eyes    this is not true the first folio which the learned critic was too indolent to consult reads their watches on unto mine eyes   which he has already given as the reading of the quarto of   0   p     r rich now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans    should we not

own childrens blood  dr warburton calls these lines nonsense and would read trempe instead of daub or as it stood then damp dr johnson allows them to be absurd but objects to trempe and would change entrance to entrails adding that the relative her is inaccurately used in both readings he is likewise willing to suppose a verse lost mr steevens not being satisfied with either alteration proposes entrants instead of entrance and explains it by those who set foot on this kingdom through the lust of power or conquest which was the kings own case never sure was there so much drumbleing nor except in this edition were there ever so many wild and absurd conjectures as this simple passage has given rise to for so simple it certainly is as that the little meaning it has may be easyly discovered by the most ignorant however doctors may differ about it the thirsty entrance of the soil is nothing more or less than the face of the earth parched and cracked as it always appears in a dry summer and mr steevens came nearer the mark than he was aware of when he mentioned the persus surface of the ground as to its being personifyed it is certainly no such unusual practice with shakspeare every one talks familarly of mother earth and they who live upon her face may without much impropriety be called her children our author only confines the image to his own country the allusion is to the barons wars  p     p henry as the honey of hybla my old lad of the castle  there is a very old and popular tradition that old lad of the castle alludes to the name of sir john oldcastle falstaffs original surname when this play was first performed this mr steevens will by no means allow but it is no matter there is as much reason argument and authority as can be well expected on one side of the question and his bare opinion on the other fuller beside the words cited in the note has in his worthies p     the following passage  sir john oldcastle was first made a thrasonical puff an emblem of mock valor a make sport in all plays for a coward  speed likewise in his chronicle edit   p     says  the author of the three conversions i e parsons the jesuit has made oldcastle a ruffian a robber and a rebel and his authority taken from the stageplayes is more befitting the pen of his slandcrous report than the credit of the judicious being only grounded from the papist and the poet of like conscience for lies the one ever seigning and the other ever falsifying the truth    both these quotations are immediately taken from an old number of the gentlemans magazine   it is somewhat extraordinary for mr steevens to assert that shakspeare was not the author of the old play of hen v in which oldcastle appears to have been first introduced upon the stage no body ever said or thought he was but the very ingenious critic knows and allows that this same play afforded shakspeare several hints among which were the name and character of sir john oldcastle whom he afterward upon better advice called sir john falstff  p     hot but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown  north he did myself did hear it  it was not says mr steevens edmund earl of march the mortimer of this play whom k richard ii proclaimed heir to the crown but his father roger earl of march who was killed soon after in ireland  the learned commentator would have done well to consult the history before he ventured to be so decisive let us see when northumberland heard this proclamation why  then it was when the unhappy king set forth upon his irish expedition   that roger mortimer could not be then proclaimed heir to the crown is evident from this plain and simple circumstance  he was not then alive he had been treacherously killed by the wild irish and it was chiefly to revenge his death that the king set out on this very expedition this proves it could not be roger and that it was edmund is proved by hall who expressly says that he edmond son to earl roger at king richardes going into ireland was proclaimed heir apparent to the crown and realm  p       car ant be not four by the day i will be hanged charles wain is over the new chimney

for this very ingenious and judicious etymology the writer is indebted to a earned friend  p       car your chamberlie breeds fleas like a loach  loach says dr warburton is a loch scotch a lake mr steevens halfdoubts the propriety of this explanation and supposes the expression may mean fleas resembling a loach i e the fish so called they must have been elephantinelops indeed to do this the loach being two or three inches in length besides this construction necessaryly requires the passage to have been  seas like loaches the allusion is doubtless to the above fish and mr steevens in the course of his extensive researches may one day find that it either has or was formerly supposed to have when dead the quality of producing fleas in abundance dr watburtons explanation if it may be so miscalled is almost too absurd to deserve contradiction the scotch or irish word loch a lake is a hard guttural sound which we have softened into lough e g lough vulgariter lop leeches the physicians or phlebotomists of the lake  p  00 gads give me thy hand thou shall have a share in our purchase   purchase  perquisitio acquisition thus in hen v they will steal any thing and call it purchase  p  0

poins is made to speak on the entrance of gadshill thus o it is our setter i know his voice  bardelph what news  this he pronounces to be absurd and therefore alters the passage as above with very little reason and against all authority the modern editors noticing an omission make bardolph to enter with gadshill the learned critic calls this a countenancing of the impropriety and therefore does not bring bardolph on at all there is no absurdity in the passage except that of which the learned commentator is guilty falstaffs calling out for bardolph is no proof that he was within hearing the latters entrance should be marked and the old reading restored  p  0  fall hang ye gorbellied knaves are ye undone no ye fat chuffs   mr steevens is under a small mistake in supposing this word a corruption of choughs the name of the cornish bird is pronounced by the natives chow chuff is the same word with cuff both signifying a clown and being in all probability derived from a saxon word of the latter sound so cotton virgil tavetie the wealthieft carles thereabouts rich cuffs and very sturdy louts   p     fall you rogue there is lime in this sack   sack the favorite beverage of sir john falstaff was according to the information of a very old gentleman a liquor compounded of sherry syder and sugar sometimes it should sem to have been brewed with eggs i e mulled and that the vintners played tricks with it appears from falstaffs charge in the text etc it does not seem to be at present known the sweet wine so called being apparently of a quite different nature  p     fall he of wales that swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a welsh book   mr steevens seems to be right in supposing a welsh book to be a weapon of the same kind with our old english bill or the lochaber axe with which by the way mr steevens might have observed colonel gardener was killed    this gentlemans conduct at the battle of prestonpans does not seem to have proceeded so much from the generous bravery of a noble and heroic mind as from a spirit of religious enthusiasm and a bigoted reliance on the pesbyterian doctrine of predestination which made it a matter of total indifference to him whether he left the field or remained in it the highlander who slew him was not many years ago said to be living in the town of perth  the representation therefore of the old sword from speed could have been spared it is more like the seaxe or faulchion of our saxon ancestors than any instrument of henry the fourths time the shepherds hook in the song is no warlike implement but merely a crook he used to catch his sheep withal  p     p henry do thou stand for my father   fall shall i content  this chair shall be my state this dagger my scepter and this cushion my crown   p henry thy state is taken for a jointstool thy golden scepter for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown   this says dr farmer is an apostrophe of the prince to his absent father not an answer to falstaff  the learned critics interpretation cannot be right it is certainly nothing more than a ludicrous description of falslaffs mock regalia  p     fall if the fruit may be known by the tree as the tree by the fruit then there is virtue in that falstaff   mr steevens is afraid that here is a profane allusion to the   d verse of the   th chapter of st matthew alas and if the allusion were intentional where is its profansness  p     fall thou art essentially mad without seeming so   p henry and thou a natural coward without instinct   fall i deny your major if you will deny the sheriff so if not let him enter etc   falstaff here intends a quibble which the editors industrious enough it must be confessed in pointing out such like things    dr johnson has unfortunately been too much so what imagination but his own would have discovered such a pun as either of the following  k henry indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders  this conceit rather too low for a king has been already explained as alluding to the venereal disease  and many such like ass of great charge   i e esses heavily loaded a quibble is intended between as the conditional particle and ass the beast of burden  but to be sure the learned critic has as falstaff says a strange alacrity in sking    have suffered to

soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with carping fools  the metaphor carded his state is supposed by mr steevens from a hint of mr tollet and by dr farmer to be taken from mingling coarse wool with fine and carding them together but this explanation is by much too far fetched and the learned critics may be justly said to have sent their wits a woolgathering in search of it by carding his state the usurper means that his predecessor set his consequence to hazard played it away as a man loses his fortune at cards  p     k hen the archbishops grace of york douglas

these things it is true you have articulated p     hot he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace  to sue his livery mr steevens says is a law phrase meaning to sue out the possession of his lands from the court of wards  the court of wards did not exist till the   d year of king henry the eighth before which time wardships were usually granted as courtfavours to those who made suit for and had interest enough to obtain them  p  0  worcester and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle gull the cuckows bird uses the sparrow  that is as dr johnson very learnedly observes the cuckows chicken who says he being hatched and fed by the sparrow r the hedge sparrow in whose nest the cuckows egg was laid grows in time able to devour his nurse  such indeed is the old popular superstition but the curious reader will find the honor and reputation of the cuckoo and her said chicken so elegantly personifyed by the learned commentator ably desended by the

seems very anxious to prove him a rascal mr steevenses quotations would have been more germane to the matter if they had exhibited huntcounter as a substantive for it is not impossible that after all the word may be found to signify a catchpole or bumbailif he was probably the judges tipstaff  p     fall very well my lord very well  in the quarto edition printed in   00 this speech mr theobald informs us stands thus old very well my lord very well  mr steevens still remains unconvined and adds that old might have been the beginning of some actors name an objection which would have served equally well if the name of oldcastle had in that edition stood at length instead of falstaff throughout the whole play the learned critics heterodoxical obduracy increases in proportion to the blaze of gospel evidence on the other side which must enforce conviction upon every mind not predetermined to think otherwise  p     poins  the worst that they can say of me is that i am a second brother and that i am a proper fellow of my hands and these two things i confess i cannot help  a tall or proper fellow of his hands says dr johnson was a stout fighting man  in this place however a proper fellow of his hands means a good looking well made personable man poins might certainly have helped his being a fighting fellow  p     fall on seeing the prince and poins disguised as waiters ha a bastard son of the kings and art not thou poins his brother   his brother whose brother the kings or his bastard sons astonishing that the editors did not perceive the absurdity of printing or at least pointing the passage thus  and art not thou poins his brother  i e poinses brother or brother to poins a vulgar corruption of the genitive case  p   0 k hen we would dear lords unto the holy land   dr johnson is very fond of giving the reader continual information that the play proceeds in one unbroken tenor through the first edition  that there is therefore no evidence that the division of the acts was made by the author and that since every editor has the same right to mark the intervals of action as the players who made the present distribution he would propose to change them so and so  when a division has been made by mr row  any of his successors an editor has certainly a good right to change it if he can for the better but there is little room to doubt that the pauses of action marked in the first folio have been intended or at least approved by the author the player editors divided the different dramas just as they were broken in the representation and most if not all of shakspeares plays having been performed at his own theater and under his own eye it is very improbable that he should not have given directions about the division of the acts if there had been no distinction of acts in the playhouse copies messieurs hemings and condell would never have troubled their heads about the matter no editor has therefore any right to alter that division which is established by the two first folios unless in two or three places where the misplacing of the actus is too glaringly absurd to admit a doubt of its impropriety  p     shall  will squele a cotswold man   i e says mr steevens one versed in the gymnastic exercises and consequently of a daring spirit and an athletic constitution i suppose continues he the following passage contains an allusion of the same kind by my faith ye are wont to be as bold as yt were a lion of cottyswold   again you old stale ruffin you lion of cotsoll  it is rather unlucky that the ingenious commentator did not comprehend the force of this expression a lion of cotswold is a sheep  p     shall the same sir johni saw him break skogans head at the court gate   who scogan was mr steevens says may be understood from a passage in the fortunate isles a masque by ben jonson  scogan what was he oh a fine gentleman and a master of arts of henry the fourths time that made disguises for the kings sons and writ in ballad royal daintily well etc and adds that among the works of chaucer is a poem called  scogan unto the lords and gentilmen of the kings house  but this is not the scogan alluded to by shallow he means the scogan who was a jester mime mimic or courtfool in edward the fourths reign mr steevens knows scogans jess that is the man as to the point of chronology it is not worth consideration  p   0 fall for you moldy stay at home till you are past service   dr farmer seems right in his conjecture that this passage should be read for you moldy you have stayed at home till you are past service  the same ingenious and learned critic whom every lover of hakspeare literature and truth must always regard with the utmost gratitude and respect observes that there is some mistake in the number of recruits shallow says that falstaff should have four there but he appears to get but three wart shadow and feeble  it is very true  falstaff on his entrance asks the justices if they have provided him half a dozen sufficient men shalow answers in the affirmative but only five are produced and when falstaff says is here all shallow tells him there is two more called than your number you must have but four here so that there is certainly a man missing is this now irretrieveable loss to be charged upon shakspeare or the players  p     shall  yea marry william cook bid him come hither   it appears from this instance mr steevens thinks that anciently the lower orders of people had no surnames but in their stead were content to adopt the titles of their several professions an inserence and conclusion which may with equal justice and propriety be made by some critic commenting a couple of centuries hence upon the dramatic pieces of the present period on meeting with the titles of robin coachman and john hosteler  p     chapter just and struck me in the very seat of judgment   sir john hawkins subjoins an account of the insult given to the speaker by prince henry from sir thomas elyot but mr

face that this most learned gentleman may for the future know on what authority speed made the assertion he has an opportunity to peruse the following extract  for imprisonmente of one of his prince henrys wanton mates and unthrifty plaifaiers he struck the chief justice with his fiste on the face for which offense he was not only committed to straight prison but also of his father put out of the preuy counsel and banished the court hall hen iv it is more than probable that hollinshed has the same story and the commentator might have likewise found it  where shakspeare did  in the old anonymous play  p     sil singing do me right and dub me knight saningo  is it not so   he means according to hanmer to say san domingo an observation highly applauded by the reverend mr thomas warton who is to be sure from his extraordinary skill in the tongues perfectly well qualifyed to judge of its propriety but the truth is that the spaniards though they use san pedro san juan etc never either write or say san tomas or san domingo mr steevens has very happyly quoted an old catch ending  do me right and dub me knight domingo which is the identical scrap that silence is singing he therefore certainly means to say domingo but being fap as bardolph has it conclusions pass the careires  volume the sixth king henry the fifth p    cant  the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great  but charlemain and charles the great were one and the same person charlechauve was indeed the son of lewis the emperor but who the lady lingare was has not been discovered shakspeare however gives the information just as he found it in hall and hollinshed  ibid cant  also king lewis the ninth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorain  the worth ninth has been inserted by some of the modern editors the old copies read tenth no notice is however taken of any variation in the margin of the present edition and yet ninth is certainly wrong and tenth certainly right isabel was the wife of philip the second father of lewis the ninth and grandfather of lewis the tenth  p  0 k hen may i with right and conscience make this claim   cant the sin upon my head dread sovereign   notwithstanding the learned prelate is so confident in his opinion and so zealous to engage the king in a war with france and to cause such a deluge of christian blood it will not be improper for the readers of this play to reflect that he had no more right to the throne of that kingdom than charles vi had to the crown of england henry proposes the invasion and conquest of france in prosecucution of the dying advice of the usurping machiavel his father  to busy giddy minds with foreign quartels that action thence borne out might waste the memory of the former days that his subjects might have sufficient employment to mislead their attention from the nakedness of his own title the archibishop and clergy it appears had a similar reason for urging it  p    k hen we never valued this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous license as it is ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin  i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france  it is evident that the word hence implies here sir thomas hanmer was however to blame for making it so no one who reads shakspeare or indeed any other old writer can be ignorant in what strangely lax and arbitrary senses many other words are used the king says that as he had lived from home i e his throne of france in a place he did not esteem he had been careless to observe the dignity and behavior of a great king  dr warburton explains it to be living as if he were absent from england mr steevens withdrawing from court  p    nym good morrow lieutenant bardolph   it would be some satisfaction to learn how bardolph acquired his commission he was no more than falstaffs corporal when we last parted with him and in act ii scene ii nym addresses him by the same title which mr steevens there says is a mistake for lieutenant that gentleman therefore is perhaps able to give the desired information  p    nym  when time shall serve there shall be smiles   dr warburton suspects smiles to have been a stage direction mr steevens explains it thus  he should be merry even though he were to lose pistols friendship or that his face would be ready with a smile as often as occasion should call one out into service though pistol who had excited so many was no longer near him it is not always an easy matter to discover the humor of nyms expressions but from the tenor of his discourse one would think he meant that when opportunity came he would take a pleasant revenge that he would when he caught pistol sleeping cut his throat and smile  p    bard good lieutenant good corporal offer nothing here   mr steevens observes we should read  good ancient for it is pistol to whom he addresses himself it is very true and what is pistol falstaff whom one may suppose to have been at least as well acquainted with his rank as the ingenious commenator can be has already addressed him by the same title fear no colors go with me to dinner come lieutenant pistol come bardolph and in act iii of the present play fluellen calls him  an ancient lieutenant  ibid pist pish for thee iceland dog thou prickeard cur of iceland   the old reading was island and island seems to be right it is the proper name of the country the difficulty arose from the commentators not understanding the right pronunciation and it may be here observed in passing that the common english word should be always written island the s being not only expletive and useless but unnatural and absurd the same observation will apply to the word viscount unless it should be thought better to write and pronounce it vicecount  p    quick  his nose was as sharp as a pen and a babbled of green fields   here is a number of profound annotations on this passage of which the use is not very apparent that note of theobalds which dr johnson affects to say he omits in pity to his readers is not only a better but a more interesting one than any in the page and was peculiarly necessary as it established the adopted reading a mr smith seems to write with a good deal of confidence why do not we meet him oftener or rather why have we met him at all  p    pist let housewifry appear keep close i thee command   mr steevens whose note on this passage it would not be proper to transcribe has elsewhere observed that on some occasions silence is less reprehensible than information and it would perhaps have been as well if he had still continued of the same opinion and omitted to acquaint us with the indecent reading of the old quartos and spared his equally indecent quotations and comments more especially as every reader ignorant of this precious piece of information would take the text to imply as it does no more than a charge to keep within doors and further as it does not appear on looking into philotus that the word adduced by the learned commentator either has or can by the utmost stretch of ingenuity be made to bear in that play any such meaning as he here seems so desirous of forcing upon it  p    exe he will call you to so hot an answer for it that caves and womby vaultages of france shall chide your trespass   shall hide your trespass   mr pope rightly corrected it shall chide  warburton  i doubt whether it be rightly corrected the meaning is that the authors of this insult shall fly to caves for refuge johnson  mr pope restored chide from the quarto i have therefore inserted it in the the textsteevens  all these gentlemen have boasted of their fidelity and care in collating the old editions the two first cannot at present be spoke with but one may surely venture to ask dr johnson and mr steevens what the folios read  p  0 flu  up to the preaches you rascals will you not up to the preaches   pist be merciful great duke to men of mould   great duke what duke fluellen indeed his grace is infinitely obliged to the generosity of our editorial brentford sovereigns for the honor they have been so graciously pleased to confer upon him a welsh captain created a duke good it is not fit however that shakspeares dignities should be thus prostituted at the mere motion and special grace of every usurper perhaps the next phys or ush that obtrudes hisself upon the dramatic throne may take it into his head to create ancient pistol a viscount but the peerage of shakspeare must not be so degraded we shall therefore forthwith institute an enquiry into the disposal of the above dukedom  up to the preaches etc thus says mr steevens the  to the folio adds he reads up to the breach you dogs avaunt you cullions but neither does this variation lessen the absurdity of pistols calling fluelen a duke  the quart reads flucilens speech as in the text and nym answers him thus abate thy rage sweet knight abate thy rage no mention is made of any duke  the fact is that in the folio it is the duke of exeter and not eluellen who enters and to whom pistol addresses hisself shakspeare had made the alteration and the player editors inserted it in the text but inadvertently left fluellen in possession of the margin this was an incongruity which might one would think have been easyly perceived and quickly remedyed but the present editors by taking fluellens speech from the quarto and pistols from the folio have increased the confusion and absurdity of the text a thousand fold and thus it has come to pass that the former is created a duke  if such like kings be fit to govern speak p    flu  fortune is painted plind etc   this picture of fortune dr farmer tells us is taken from the old history of fortunatus but is dr farmer quite certain that this history had made its appearance in an english dress so early as shakspeares time surely fortune is painted plind in many other books much more ancient and equally common  p    pist die and be damned and figo for thy friendship  the fig of spain   an allusion mr steevens observes to the custom of giving poisoned figs to those who were the objects of spanish or italian revenge but the expression both here and afterward is evidently used by pistol as a term of contempt and cannot have any relation either to poisoning or to revenge whether to the fico indeed explained in the merry wives of windsor may be doubtful  p  0  cho  the poor condemned english sit

soldiers hearts possess them not with fear take from them now the sense of reckoning if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them  the old copies read  take from them now the sense of reckoning of the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them   the poet says theobald might intend take from them the sense of reckoning those opposed numbers which might pluck their courage from them but the relative adds he not being expressed the sense is very obscure  this change according to dr johnson is rightly admitted by bishop warburton sir thomas hanmer it seems reads  the opposed numbers which stand before them   this reading dr johnson says he borrowed from the old quarto which gives the passage thus take from them now the sense of reckoning that the opposed multitudes that stand before them may not appall their courage   mr tyrwhitt allows that theobalds alteration makes a very good sense but he thinks that we might read with less deviation from the old edition what is adopted in the present text  after all the old reading appears to be right though none of the commentators has attempted to explain it the king prays that his men may be unable to reckon the enemies force that their hearts  i e their sense and passions may be taken from them that they may be as brave as a total absence of all feeling and reflection can make them    junius  an explanation which seems to be countenanced by the old  to  a learned friend inclines to think that by  their hearts the king means the hearts of the opposed numbers  p     k hen  more will i do though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after all imploring pardon  this reading is certainly right though not properly explained by dr johnson it is simply thus  all that i can do is of no avail since when i have done every thing i can i must still rely on my own penitence for obtaining the pardon of my fathers misdeeds the first part of dr warburtons note is singularly just it is indeed a mockery of heaven in henry to expect pardon for a crime of which he continued to enjoy the benefit and certainly if ever the divine judgment ought to have interfered or did actually interfere in visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children it was in this very case of the house of lancaster  p     pist yield cur   fr sol je pense que vous efles le gentilhomme de bonne qualite   pist quality call you me construe me art thou a gentleman   the old and evidently true reading is quality calmie calmly custure construe me the alteration was it seems proposed by mr edwards and has been too hastyly adopted for if it be not nonsense it is very little better pistol who does not understand french imagines the prisoner to be speaking of his own quality the line should therefore have been given thus quality  calmly construe me art thou a gentleman  p     boy  neantmoins pour les escus que vous lavez promettez etc   it is strange enough that the editors should print this nonsense for french the first folio reads layt a promets but the second gives it correctly  lui promettez  p     flu stand away captain gower i will give treason his payment into plows i warrant you   the revisal very plausibly according to dr johnson reads in two plows mr steevens would rather prefer in due plows but what need of alteration the scottish both in speaking and in writing frequently use into for in however if it should still be thought necessary to amend the text the readyest way would be to omit a syllable and read  in plows  p     k henry give me thy glove soldier look here is the fellow of it   it must be says dr johnson give me my glove for of the soldiers glove the king had not the fellow the passage is notwithstanding like most of those the doctor objects to perfectly right give me thy glove soidier i e that which thou have in thy cap and of that the king had certainly the fellow  p     k henry  such a plain king    i know not says dr johnson why shakspeare now gives the king nearly such a character as he made him formerly ridicule in percy it would be much less difficult for the reader to remove the cause of the learned commentators ignorance than it would be for him to point out the passage in which percy is ridiculed  first part of king henry the sixth p   0 bur myself  am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull  mr steevens believes that trull did not anciently bear so harsh an interpretation as it does at present an opinion for which the learned commentator does not seem to have sufficient authority in shakspeares time and long before it signified a strumpet a harlot as it evidently does in the text neither will the single instance brought by mr steevens prove the contrary in the ancient morality of the iiij elements a fellow says for to satisfy your wanton lust i shall apoynt you a trull of trust nor a fairer in this town   again in the old maygme of robin hode she is a trul of trust to ferve a friar at his lust  it is to be regretted that shakspeare should have so far followed the absurd and lying stories of his time about this celebrated heroine whom the french called the maid of god as to represent her not only a strumpet but a witch if we may believe the most authentic historians she was no less distinguished for virtue than courage she was burnt indeed by the barbarous english whom she had so frequently driven before her and who to excuse their want of courage or policy and to justify their inhumanity pretended that she had dealt with the devil but her memory will no doubt be long held in deserved veneration by her grateful countrymen whom she so largely contributed to rescue from usurpation and slavery and it is not the least praise of our elegant historian mr hume that he has endeavored to do justice to the much injured character of this amiable brave wise and patriotic female  the dauphin too whom we are apt to look upon as a traitor a coward and a scoundrel was perhaps the greatest character of the age he lived in he was one of the best kings france ever had and england never had a better  p     plat he bears him on the places privilege   the temple dr johnson observes being a reli was an asvlum a place of exemption from  revenge and bloodshed  the learned commentator deals more in words than in knowledge the temple was then as it is now the residence of students in the law and it is not unlikely that the orders of the society prohibited quarreling and blows under certain penalties  p   0 a room in the tower enter mortimer brought in a chair and jailors mr edwards in his ms notes says mr steevens observes that shakspeare has varyed from the truth of history to introduce this scene between mortimer and richard plantagenet edmund mortimer served under henry v in      and dyed unconfined in ireland in       the truth of this charge should have been established by some better authority than the dictum of mr edwards adopted by mr steevens in the third year of henry the sixth      and during the time that peter duke of coimbra was entertained in london edmonde mortymer says hall the last earl of march of that name which long time had been restrained from his liberty and finally waxed lame disceased without issue whose inheritance descended to lord richard plantagenet etc  this authority even if the fact were otherwise is sufficient to protect shakspeare against the charge of having varyed from the truth of history to introduce the scene  p     k hen when i was young as yet i am not old i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword  his majesty must have had a fine sprag memory as sir hugh evans says since he frequently in the course of the play mentions his having been crowned at nine months old  p     war my lord of york i promise you the king prettily methought did play the orator  york and so he did but yet i like it not in that he wears the badge of somerset  war tush that was but his fancy blame him not i dare presume sweet prince he thought no

have seen decypherd there more ranccrous spite more furious raging broils than yet can be imagined or supposed  theobald who thought that by what he calls the pointing reformed  i e corrupted he had restored the text to its purity reads  and if i wis he did  nay if i know any thing he did think harm dr johnson thought this plausible enough but would rather have the speech corrupted further broken thus  and if  i wish  he did or perhaps and if he did i wish such nonsense as no one but dr johnson would have been confident enough to produce and which not even dr johnson could understand to mr steevens we are certainly indebted for a very useful additional letter the old copies only reading i wis but it is really astonishing that men of so much learning sense and sagacity for they certainly have in many places displayed a great deal of each should so grossly misconceive the meaning of so plain and simple a passage york says he is not pleased that the king should prefer the red rose the badge of somerset his enemy warwick desires him not to be offended at it as he dares say the king meant no harm to which york yet unsatisfyed hastyly adds in a menacing tone  if i thought he did  but he instantly checks his threat with  let it rest it is an example of a rhetorical figure which every one knows and which our author has elsewhere used thus in coriolanus  an twere to give again  but it is no matter  mr steevens is too familiar with virgil not to recollect his quos ego  sed motos praesat componere fluctus  if the passage would not have explained itsself one should think that exeters soliloquy immediately following yorks speech might have served to do it  it is but justice to say that the truly ingenious author of the revisal understood this passage in the same manner and the neglect he has received at the hands of the late editors who have made little other use of his book than merely to pick out a few conjectures to cavil at does no more credit to them than it has done service to their author  p     york and i am lowted by a traitor villain   a lout is a country fellow a clown he means that somerset treats him like a hind dr johnson had better let such words alone as he does not understand lowted in his dictionary is overpowered  second part of king henry the sixth p     spirit the duke yet lives that henry shall depose but him out live and die a violent death  the meaning of this perplexed and aenigmatical reply seems to be the duke is living who shall depose the king but the king shall outlive him and dye by violence the plain construction is the duke shall depose henry but shall outlive him and dye a violent death  which was not the case  p     simp  being called a hundred times and oftener in my sleep by good saint alban who said  saunder

better to read simpcox for which sim has in all probability been put by contraction in the players ms  p     york  give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to englands crown  i know not well says dr johnson whether he means the opinion or the title is infallible does the learned commentator whose knowledge and want of knowledge seem equally serviceable to shakspeare imagine that any other person could have conceived such a doubt or would have written such a note  p     sal this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king who kept him in captivity till he died  this is very extraordinary in act ii scene v of the last play york to whom this is spoken is present at the death of edmund mortimer in prison and the reader will recollect him to have been married to owen glendowers daughter in the first part of king henry iv is it possible that the authors memory should have so much deceived him that he could not remember in one play what he had already written in another  p     q mar  two pulls at once his lady banished and a limb lopped off this staff of honor raught  there let it stand  the word raught seems to have some other meaning in this place than reached e g reft or violently torn from him the point at the end of the second line should be a comma the limb lopped off certainly alludes to the loss of his office the full stop should be after raught  p     suff my lord these faults are easy quickly answered   easy dr johnson says is slight inconfiderable as in other passages of this author it would have been well to have produced one or two of those other passages but that perhaps might have been difficult the word no doubt means easyly  p     suf  that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit  mates him says bishop percy means  that first puts an end to his moving to mate adds he is a term in chess used when the king is stopped from moving and an end put to the game the learned prelate follows dogberrys advice and lets his writing and reading appear when there is no need of such vanity mates him in the text means  confounds him from amatir or matter french to mate is no term in chefs with which one would have supposed the ingenious annotator more intimate checkmate the term he alludes to is a corruption of the persian schah mat the king is killed there can be no better evidence that shakspeare was entirely unacquainted with the game of chess than his not having at least to the writers remembrance the most distant allusion to it as he does not appear to have read a single book or known a single art or science or indeed any thing else from which he did not some how or other contrive to introduce into his plays all the information images or ideas they had supplied him with chess would have been an inexhaustible fund and kings and warriors would have been checkmated in every play  p     k henry i thank thee well these words content me much   the old copies read i thank thee nell these words content me much  this says mr theobald is king henrys reply to his wife margaret there can be no reason adds he why the king should forget his own wises name and call her nell instead of margaret as the change of a single letter he thought set all right he was willing to suppose it came from his pen thus i thank thee well these words content me much and this the editors have adopted without further enquiry that the queens name was margaret and not eleanor is an allowed fact but that the king should forget it is not at all surprising as in the progress of the scene we find that she forgets it herself calling herself eleanor no less than three times in one speech of this however it should seem that mr theobald has not taken any notice at least none is taken of it in this edition which every where reads margaret the change in the three instances alluded to was certainly requisite and the same necessity and the same reasoning which displaced eleanor and inserted margaret must in the passage under consideration displace nell and insert meg  p     suf obscure and lowly swain king henrys blood   the quarto mr steevens observes reads lowsy swain from which we are doubtless to infer that the present edition agrees with the folio but unfortunately for the inference the folio does not differ from the quarto  p     suff than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate   mr tollet is accurate in his reference to cograve but cograve is mistaken the name of the

the lent shall be as long again as it is etc   lent shall be as long as it is   methinks says dr johnson it might be read more humorously lent shall be as long again as it is  this emendation thus impressed with all the power of his eloquence dr johnson found in the old quarto and two first folios all which he professes to have seen    this is far from being a singular instance of the learned critics producing the reading of the old copies as his own conjectures so in henry v act v scene ii    like a married wife about her husbands neck   every wife is a married wife i suppose we should read newmarried an epithet more expressive of fondness johnson  the solio reads a newmarried wise steevens     p     cade iden farewell and be proud of thy victory tell kent from me she has lost her best man and exhort all the world to be cowards for i that never feared any am vanquished by famine not by valor   iden how much thou wrongst me heaven be my judge   that is says dr johnson in supposing that i am proud of my victory certainly not because cade does not tell him he is proud of his victory but only bids him be so he wrongs him in attributing his own death to famine and not to idens valor  p     fields near saint albans but why saint albans hall who it may be supposed knew as much about the matter as the editors and hollinshed after him expressly says that the duke of york was encamped on bretheath a mile from dertford in kent andx miles from london and that the kings army lay upon blackheath and there is no reason to believe that shakspeare meant in this instance at least to deviate from the history though he has certainly so either by inadvertency or design in making buckingham the messenger he was indeed sent to york on a different occasion  i e immediately before the battle of saint albans but the bishops of winchester and ely were the ambassadors on this  p     york call hither to the stake my two brave bears bid salisbury and warwick come to me  the nevils earls of warwick says sir john hawkins had a bear and a ragged staff for their cognizance but the talbots who were formerly earls of shrewsbury had a lion and the present earl of talbot a descendant of that family has the same  all this sir john hawkins may be very true but will you just give us leave to ask  what it is to the purpose  third part of king henry the sixth p     york lord clifford and lord stafford all abreast charged our main battles front and breaking in were by the swords of common soldiers slain  it is the more extraordinary that york should be made to say this as in the last scene but one of the immediately preceding play he kills clifford upon the stage with his own hand  p     k henry richard in the view of many lords resigned the crown to henry the fourth  york he rose against him being his sovereign and made him to resign the crown perforce  war suppose my lords he did it unconstrained think you twere prejudicial to the crown  exe no for he could not so resign the crown but that the next heir should succeed and reign  dr johnson thought we should rather read prejudicial to his son to his next heir which is strangely absurd mr steevens says prejudicial to the crown means to the prerogative of the crown an exposition in which he is certainly right if by prerogative of the crown he mean its indefeasible hereditary descent the reader will recollect that this was a revolution parliament though diametrically opposite in its principles and practice to one shakspeare never heard of which unhappyly for this country contributed as much to destroy the constittuion as that he here describes did to preserve it  p     gab the queen with all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in your castle  this intelligence is given to york just after he has determined from the arguments of his sons edward and richard to break his oath of peace to the king and obtain immediate possession of the crown by force  i know not says dr johnson whether the author intended any moral instruction but he that reads this has a striking admonition against that precipitancy by which men often use unlawful means to do that which a little delay would put honestly in their power had york staid but a few moments he had saved his cause from the stain of perjury  it will be no more than justice to york if we recollect that this scene so far as respects the oath and his resolution to break it proceeds entirely from the authors imagination neither the earl of march nor richard was then at sandal the latter being likewise a mere child scarcely more than if indeed so much as nine years old his appearance therefore and actions in this and the last acts of the present and at least the two first of the following play are totally unsupported by history and truth  p     enter rutland and his tutor a priest called sir rbert aspall hall hen vi fo    p     rut i never did thee harm why will thou slay me   clif thy father has   rut

seventeen years old  p     york oh tygres heart wrapped in a womans hide   this is a remarkable instance of the editors diffidence the word appears in the same shape in the old editions and the present editors not knowing whether it was intended for tigers or tygresss durst not venture to change it and have therefore left it as they found it we should however certainly read tygress  p     edw  when came george from burgundy to england   war  he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war  this circumstance is not warranted by history clarence and gloucester as they were afterward created were sent into flanders immediately after the battle of wakefield and did not return until their brother edward got possession of the crown besides clarence was not now more than twelve years old  isabel duchess of burgundy whom shakspeare calls the dukes aunt was daughter of john i king of portugal by philippa of lancaster eldest daughter of john of gaunt they were therefore no more than third cousins  p       0 rich whoever got thee there thy mother stands     rich iron of naples hid with english gilt   the first of these speeches is in the folios by an evident blunder given to warwick the latter which is there given to richard seems more properly to belong to warwick  p     a field of battle at ferrybridge in yorkshire we should read near towton shakspeare has here perhaps intentionally thrown three different actions into one the lord fitzwater being stationed by king edward to defend the pass of ferrybridge was assaulted by the lord clifford and immediately slain and with him says hall the hastard of salisbury brother to the earl of warwycke a valeaunt young genelman and of great audicitie when the earl of warwycke adds he was informed of this seat he like a man desperated mounted on his hackeney and came blowing to king edward saying sir i pray god have mercy of their souls which in the beginning of your enterprise has lost their lyfes and because i se no succors of the world i remit the vengeance and punishment to god our creator and redenier and with that lighted down and slew his horse with his swourde saying let them fly that will for surely i will tarry with him that will tarry with me and kissed the cross of his swourde clifford in his retreat was beset with a party of yorkists when either says the historian for heat or pain putting off his gerget suddenly with an arrowe as some say without an hedde he was stricken into the throat and incontinent rendered his spirit

field between towton and saxton joined the main battles which continued engaged that night and the greater part of the following day upwards of  0000 men all english including many of the nobility and the flower of the gentry especially of the northern parts being slain on both sides this battle says carte decided the fate of the house of lancaster overturning in one day an usurpation strengthened

explanation or such as do not explane matters at all but merely fill up so much paper a canon of which dr johnson has availed hisself pretty much in the manner of his predecessor dr warburton who

colleague the cobbler tells flavius that if he be out he can mend him can any thing therefore be more absurd than for marullus to abuse the cobbler for saying what he had not said that he could mend him and yet does the critic pronounce his reply to be made properly enough the hint however in the latter part of the note may incline one to give the first speech to marullus instead of transferring the last to flavius  p   mar that tyber trembled underneath his banks   the old copies read  her banks as tyber is always represented by the figure of a man the feminine gender is improper steevens

  bru  with this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallowed fire  mr steevens after observing that this circumstance is taken from plutarch and that it is also mentioned by valerius maximus says it may not be amiss to remark that the death of portia wants that foundation which has hitherto entitled her to a place in poetry as a pattern of roman fortitude she is reported by pliny i think to have died in rome of a lingering illness while brutus was abroad  this indeed though a rather extraordinary is a tolerably easy method of overturning the credit of historians and the existence of an historical fact but surely with all the submission to the learned and ingenious commentator due authority of plutarch and valerius maximus is somewhat better than a vague idea of its being contradicted by pliny  p  0  octa upon the right hand i keep thou the left   the tenor of the conversation evidently requires us to read  you  p     of this tragedy dr johnson says many particular passages deserve regard but i have never been strongly agitated in perusing it and think it somewhat cold and unaffecting etc  this is a strange charge if nature have denied to this great critic the ordinary feelings of humanity is he therefore to accuse the poet surely dr johnson is the only person living who would not be ashamed to declare hisself insensible to the interesting and pathetic scenes of this admirable drama so far from shakspeares adherence to the real story and to roman manners having impeded the natural vigor of his genius he seems to have risen with the grandeur and importance of his subject and if there be any one play in these volumes which affects the heart more than the rest it may be safely averred to be this of julius caesar and he who is not agitated in perusing it may defy the powers of poetry to move him  the characters or dogmatical criticisms subjoined by the above learned philosopher at the end of each play are generally as in the present instance as unjust in theirselves as injurious to the immortal author and in many cases could only proceed from one who either had not read the drama reviewed or from some natural defect was insensible of its beauty and merit  antony and cleopatra p   0 char prythee how many boys and wenches must i have  soeth if every of your wishes had a womb and foretell every wish a million  that is says dr johnson if you had as many wombs as you will have wshes and i should foretell all those wishes i should foretl a million of children the text as dr warburton justly observes is nonsense and this explanation is as bad she asks the foothsayer how many children she is to have why says he if all your wishes had wombs and i should foretell every wish you would have a million ridiculous is that any answer to her question he does foretell how many she will have dr warburton reads fertile which restores sense and spirit to the whole passage  p     cleo  can fulvia die  notwithstanding the ingenious comment upon this passage by mr steevens one may be still inclined to think that cleopatra means no more than  is it possible that fulvia should dye i will not believe it  p     ale  so he nodded and soberly did mount an armgaunt steed who neighd so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbd by him  mr seyward says dr johnson in his preface to beaumont has very elaborately endeavored to prove that an armgaunt steed is a steed with leanshoulders arm adds he is the teutonic word for want or poverty arm gaunt may be therefore an old word signifying lean for want illfed edwardss observation that a worn out horse is not proper for atlas to mount in battle is impertinent the horse here mentioned seems to be a posthorse rather than a warhorse  it is somewhat remarkable that when this great critic is desirous to introduce his own note on a passage whereon a much better has been already written he generally begins his observation by ridiculing that of his predecessor mr seward not seyward as dr johnson mr steevens and mr malone have every where throughout this edition corrupted his name explains the word armgaunt by thin shoulders which he says is known to be one of the principal beauties of a horse and he adds that the epithet has from the uncommon use of either part of the compound word in this ense an antique dignity and grandeur in sound that poets much delight in the reader will observe the difference between thin shoulders and lean shoulders the former being a beauty the latter a defect and this dr johnson calls an elaborate endeavor to prove not recollecting that his own attempt is more elaborate and much ss ingenious and successful arm may be the teutoni word for want and yet one would like to have some better proof of its existence than the bare dictum of one so little acquainted with ancient languages as dr johnson is and even when that is given we should still be glad to know how shakspeare came by it dr johnsons observation that this steed was a post horse is impertinent as a posthorse would scareely have made any distinction between antony and his groom and yet the author represents it so proud of its burden that its neigh silenced the bystanders  p   0 pomp i have fair meaning sir   ant and fair words to them   the last word makes it evident that we should read meanings  p     eno there is a strong fellow menas

corrected to the third part then is drunk would it were all  p     mec and gives his potent regiment to a trull  trull dr johnson says was not in our authors time a term of mere infamy but a word of slight contempt as wench is now it may be difficult to know what the learned commentator conceives to be a term of mere infamy but thus much is certain that trull in the age of shakspeare signified a strumpet and so he uses it  p     ant yes my lord yes  he at philippi kept his sword even like a dancer  sworddances at christmas are not peculiar to northhumberland they are common to the adjoining counties and are not without the greatest probability supposed to have descended from the romans    pyrrby pyrrhic dancers is a name still given in the north to the streamers or northern lights doubtless from the imaginary resemblance between their figure and motion and those of the sworddancers or ploughstors who always exhibit in their shirts  in these dances the swordpoints are generally over the shoulders of the performers antony means that caesar stood inactive with his sword on his shoulder  p     ant let me lodge lichas on the horns of the moon   shakspeare mr steevens thinks might have taken part of this imagery from heywoods silver age      if the silver age however were not printed before that year it is more likely that shakspeare furnished heywood  p     cleo  not the imperious show of the fullfortund caefar ever shall be broochd with me  brooch says dr percy is properly a bodkin or some such instrument originally a spit and ladies bodkins adds he being headed with gems it sometimes stands for an ornamental trinket or jewel in general in which sense he says it is perhaps used at present or as probably in its original one for pinned up etc  a brooch is always an ornament whether a buckle or pin for the breast hat or hair or whatever other shape it may may assume a broach is a spit the spires of churches are likewise so called in the northern couuties as darntonbroach broochd in the text certainly means adorned as it has been properly explained by mr steevens  timon of athens p     pain how this lord is followed   poet the senators of athens  happy men   mr steevens would read  happy man thinking it the happiness of timon and not that of the senators upon which the poet means to exclaim but the text is right the poet envies or admires the felicity of the senators in being timons friends and familiarly admitted to his table to partake of his good cheer and experience the effects of his bounty  p     poet apemantus even he drops down the knee before him and returns in peace most rich in timons nod  either shakspeare mr steevens says meant to put a falsehood into the mouth of his poet or had not yet thoroughly planned the character of apemantus for in the ensuing scenes his behavior is cynical to timon as to his followers  the behavior of apemantus is justly represented and yet the note might have been spared the authors consistency being liable to no charge the poet seeing that apemantus paid frequent visits to timon naturally concluded that he was equally courteous with his other guests the critic indeed knows the contrary but the speaker did not  p     timon i am not of that feather to shake off my friend when he must need me  the sense would be certainly improved by reading thus i am not of that feather to shake off my friend when he most needs me   p     tim purchance some single vantages you took when my indisposition put you back and that unaptness made your minister thus to excuse yourself  this is perfectly unintelligible so however says dr johnson the original the later editions he tells us have all  made you minister which is right it is the reading of the second folio  p     flav  my dear loved lord though you hear now yet now is too late a time  the old editions read though you hear now  too late yet now is a time  that is according to dr warburton though it be now too late to retrieve your former fortunes yet it is not too late to prevent by the assistance of your friends your future miseries sir t hanmer it seems made the alteration which though undoubtedly wrong dr johnson thought right and admitted into his text the old reading however is not properly explained by dr warburton though i tell you this says flavius at too late a period perhaps for the information to be of service to you yet late as it is it is necessary that you should be acquainted with it it is evident that the steward had very little hope of assistance from his masters friends  p   0 var yes mine is three thousand crowns what is yours   lu five thousand mine   var it is much deep and it should seem by the sum your masters confidence was above mine else surely his bad equaled  dr johnson whose understanding frequently starts at the plainest passage and makes those who have little of their own imagine difficulties where there are none asks if this should not be else surely mine had equaled the answer is easy it should not mr malone has indeed undertaken to justify the text and given a long note upon it which he may possibly understand without taking further notice however of his seesaw conjectures the meaning of the passage is evidently and simply this your master it seems had more confidence in lord timon than mine otherwise his i e my masters debt i e the money due to him from timon would certainly have been as great as your masters i e as the money which timen owes to your master  that is my master being as rich as yours could and would have advanced timon as large a sum as your master has advanced him if he  i e my master had thought it prudent to do so  p     tim  maid to thy masters bed thy mistress is of the brothel  the sense according to mr steevens is go maid with security to thy masters bed for thy mistress is a bawd to thy amors this is not altogether so clear one would father suppose it to mean that the mistress frequented the brothel and so sir t hanmer understood it  p     tim  those milkpaps that through the window bars bore at mens eyes  the folios read barn and not improperly en is a common termination of a saxon plural which we in numberless instances retain to this day the word is to be explained by bars but should not though dr warburton calls it strange nonsense have been removed from the text  p     apemantus retreats backward would not this ingenious remark be much improved by reading  apemantus advances backward like the exercise of the city militia  advance three paces backwards  the editors have here and there indulged us with a few of these little marginal pleasantries which would not make a bad figure together the reader may take a specimen exit com and men vii     exit worcester and vernon v  0  enter mortimer brought in a chair v   0 exit clown autolycus dorcas and mopsa iv     exit the queen and hamlet dragging in polonius x     exit etc x  0    p   0 scene ii  enter poet and painter the poet and the painter were within view when apemantus parted from timon and might then have seen timon since apemantus standing by him could see them but the scenes of the thieves and steward have passed before their arrival and yet passed as the drama is now conducted within their view it might be suspected that some scenes are transposed for all these difficulties would be removed by introducing the poet and painter first and the thieves in this place yet i am afraid the scenes must keep their present order for the painter alludes to the thieves when he says he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity this impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act and the poet and painter in another but it must be remembered that in the original edition this play is not divided into separate acts so that the present distribution is arbitrary and may be changed if any convenience can be gained or impropriety obviated by alteration johnson  had the learned critic perused the small remainder of the painters speech he would have perceived another incongruity of which he does not seem to be aware in the immediately preceding scene the first of the fifth act flavius timons steward has a conference with his master and receives gold from him between this and the present scene a single minute cannot be supposed to pass and yet the painter tells his companion  it is said he gave his steward a mighty sum where was it said why in athens whence it must therefore seem they are but newly come here then should be fixed the commencement of the fifth act in order to allow time for flavius to return to the city and for rumor to publish his adventure with timon but how are we in this case to account for apemantuses announcing the approach of the poet and painter in the last scene of the preceding act and before the thieves appear it is possible that when this play was abridged for representation all between this passage and the entrance of the poet and painter may have been omitted by the players and these words put into the mouth of apemantus to introduce them and that when it was published at large the interpolation was unnoticed or if we allow the poet and the painter to see apemantus it may be conjectured that they did not think his presence necessary at their interview with timon and had therefore returned back into the city  p     sol by all description this should be the place who is here speak ho  no answer  what is this timon is dead who has outfiretchd his span some beast read this there does not live a man dead sure and this his grave what is on this tomb i cannot read the character i will take with wax  dr warburton proposes reared for read and says that the soldier had only seen the rude heap of earth but dr johnson who seems to have thought that the chief part of his busyness consisted in a totis viribus opposition to the most judicious improvements of preceding commentators and that there is as much honor to be got by the demolition as by the erection of an elegant structure observes that the soldier had evidently seen something that told him timon was dead and what could tell that but his tomb the tomb he sees and the inscription upon it which not being able to read and finding none to read it for him he exclaims peevishly some beast read this for it must be read and in this place it cannot be read by man  now with all proper deserence to the misunderstanding and confusion under which the learned critic labors in the above note it is evident that the soldier when he first sees the heap of earth does not know it to be a tomb he concludes that timon must be dead because he receives no answer it is likewise evident that when he utters the words some beast etc he has not seen the inscription and dr warburtons emendation is therefore not only just and happy but absolutely necessary what can this heap of earth be says the soldier  timon is certainly dead some beast must have erected this for here does not ive a man to do it  yes he is dead sure enough and this must be his grave what is this writing upon it  dr johnson is not content with representing the soldier as peevish he makes him a perfect fool for thus according to the sagacious commentators exposition will his soliloquy stand  i cannot read these letters i must get some beast to read them for me for read they must be and read in this place they cannot be by man but first where was the so urgent necessity of the inscription being read at all and secondly why could no man read it where it was  titus andronicus p     mar the greeks upon advice did bury ajax that slew himself etc  this passage convinces mr steevens that this play was the work of one conversant with the greek tragedies in their original language and therefore not of shakspeare we have here says he a plain allusion to the ajax of sophocles of which no translation was extant in the time of shakspeare if the fact were true of which however neither mr steevens nor any man now living can be certain    theobald has supposed a passage in this play to have been gleaned from the hecuba of euripides but says mr steevens upon that occasion mr theobald should first have proved to us that our author understood greek or else that this play of euripides had been translated in the mean time because neither of these particulars are verified we may as well suppose he took it from the old story book of the trojan war or the old translation of ovid why should mr steevens require a proof from theobald of a circumstance which he hisself here assumes as a matter of fact  numbers of printed tracts and even large volumes having perished since that period as accidents and the researches of antiquarians daily prove still shakspeare might have been indebted for the circumstance to some manuscript version or the information of a more learned friend or as is very probable the same allusion may be contained in other old books there are many expressions in the course of the play which do not prove the author to have been very familiar with the ancients among other instances which might be adduced marcus praises lavinia for her excellent performance on the lute and it will not be very easy to decide whether the characters or at least the times are christian or heathen  p     chi not i till i have sheathed etc   the editors have here adopted a transposition made by dr warburton for which there is not the least reason only the matter is not of sufficient consequence to dwell upon  p     dm she is a woman therefore may be wooed she is a woman therefore may be won  suffolk in the first part of king henry vi makes use of almost the same words she is beautiful and therefore to be wooed she is a woman therefore to be won   how much or how little soever this may serve to prove if facts and evidence be to determine our judgment there cannot remain a doubt that this play of titus andronicus is as much shakspeares as any other in this collection it is not only given to him by mers but is printed as his by the editors of the first folio his fellow comedians and intimate friends who neither could have been deceived theirselves nor could or would have deceived the public  volume the ninth troilus and cressida p    cre  women are angels wooing things won are done joys soul lies in the doing  so says dr johnson read both the old editions for which adds he the later editors have orly given  the souls joy lies in doing  whatever may be the poverty of the expression it did not originate with the later editors it is the reading of the second folio  p    patr no more words thersites peace   there i will hold my peace when achilles brach bids me shall i   the folio and quarto editions it seems read brooch which leads dr johnson to think the meaning equivalent to one of achilles hangerson mr malone who it must be confessed generally comes foreward to a very good or useful purpose observes that brooch had some meaning at present unknown for says he in the following passage in lodges rosalynde      it seems to signify something very different from a pin or a bodkin his bonnet was green whereon stood a copper brooch with the picture of st dennis a brooch is an ornament likewise a buckle of uncommon workmanship for the hat or breast such a one as had an image or figure of st dennis upon it would probably conceal the pin or prong which kept it fast to the hat or girdle k lewis the eleventh of france generally wore a leaden figure of st andrew in his hat which perhaps answered the purpose of a brooch or buckle  thus in loves labor lost ii  0   biron st georges half cheek in a brooch   dum ay and in a brooch of lead   biron ay and worn in the cap of a toothdrawer   brach is certainly the true reading  p    trei  the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve  sieve it seems is in the quarto the folio according to dr johnson reads  unrespective same same for which he says the modern editors have silently printed  unrespective place  the learned commentator is so perfectly acquainted with the old copies that it is wonderful to find an ancient reading escape him place however cannot well be the silent interpolation of a modern editor as it is to be found in the second folio  p    patr why am i a fool   there make that demand of the prover   so says dr johnson the quarto the folio adds mr steevens profanely reads  of thy  to the creator this would be intelligible however which the adopted reading is not and as to any profaneness there may be in the words rejected which every person may not so readyly discover the author is answerable for it not the editor  p    pan what exploits in hand where sups he to night   helen nay but my lord    pan

disposer is fick   disposer dr warburton thinks should in both places be dispouser she that would separate helen from paris dr johnson does not understand the word nor know what to substitute in its place he says there is no variation in the copies mr steevens suspects that you must not know when he sups should be added to the speech of pandarus and that the following one of paris should be given to helen he thinks that disposer should be changed into deposer and supposes that she addresses herself to pandarus and by deposer means  she who thinks her beauty or whose beauty you suppose to be superior to mine  mr steevenses conjecture is very ingenious and happy but the propriety of his explanation is very doubtful the dialogue should perhaps be regulated thus  par  where sups he to night   helen nay but my lord    pan what says my sweet queen   par my cousin will fall out with you to helen   pan you must not know where he sups to paris   helen i will lay my life with my deposer cressida   she calls cressida her deposer not for either of the reasons assigned by mr steevens but because she had deposed her in the affections of troilus whom fandarus in a preceding scene is ready to swear she loved more than paris  dr johnson mistakes in asserting the uniformity of the the copies the second folio reads the fifth speech thus pan with my disposer cressida  p    pan oh oh groans out for ha ha ha hey ho   hey ho this exclamation is thus added in the folio to the preceding line o ho groans out for ha ha ha  hey ho but the interjection is certainly no part of the song and consequently should not appear in the same character it is uttered by pandarus after he has done singing this is evident from helens observation in love in faith to the very tip of the nose  p  0  aeue good good my lord the secrets of neighbor pandar   this reading was first introduced by mr pope from the old quarto the folio reads  the secrets of nature which is surely preferable neither the

to tend with them on hectors heels certainly not dio has therefore crept in by mistake the line either is part of parises speech or belongs to deiphobus who is in company as to diomed he neither goes along with them nor has any thing to get ready  he is now walking with troilus and cressida toward the gate on his way to the grecian camp  p     achil it is but early days   should not this be  early

neither rhyme nor reason requires the alteration ulysses asks her if he may beg a kiss she says he may he then desires it she bids him beg which he does the construction is plain enough and if the rhyme be thought worth preserving by a violence to the text we may read why beg toe  the remainder upon which the same learned commentator has given an unintelligible note might be regulated thus  ulyss why then for venus sake give me a kiss   cres when helen is a maid again and his i am your debtor claim it when it is due  ulyss nevers my day and then a kiss of you   p     hect whom must we

for brothel the folio reads brother errneously for broker as it stands at the end of the play where the lines are repeated johnson  let us turn to the end of the play and see what the critic says there   hence broker lacquey   so the quarto the folio has brother johnson  the concordance of the two comments is surprising  after all however brothel lacquey seems the best reading though broker is certainly in this place the reading of the folio  p     nest  like scaled sculls before the belching whale  sculls and shoals have not only one and the same meaning but are actually or at least

carrying sticks or staves in their hands it is not here meant to question the propriety of mr steevenses explanation of the word but the nature of the english language cannot possibly allow the derivation of slickler from stick with which as a word it has not the remotest connection besides the giving sticks or staves to the seconds or sidesmen seems a mere gratisdictum for which the ingenious critic can have no authority but such as he may be able to produce from the practice of parisgarden stickler is simply from the verb stickle to interfere to take part with to busy ones self

spccio di cavalleria espejo de cavallerias are all a lookingglass for chialry and so is the word properly rendered in our english versions of the history of don quixote who is called a lookingglass in which all the valiant knights of the world may behold themselves but one might be glad to know who ever styled don bellianis the morrour of knighthood before dr johnson  p  0  jack  could this carle a very drudge of natures have subdued me   carle is used by our old writers in opposition to a gentleman see the poem of john the reeve percy  it is a very common but at the same time a very unreasonable practice in commentators and others to bid their readers see this or that scarce book of which it is as they well know frequently impossible for them to procure a sight but never was this absurdity carried to such an extent of mockery as it is in the present instance where the learned prelate very coolly orders us to inspect a poem only extant as he is well assured and has elsewhere told us in a certain folio ms in his own possession which perhaps no one ever saw and which if it really exist he will for his own sake take effectual care that no one shall see  carl or churl ceopl sax is a clown or husbandman  king lear p     france is it no more but this a tardiness in nature   these two words  no more seem to be introduced or preserved merely to spoil the measure they are not in either folio  p     glo  all this done upon the gad  to do upon the gad says dr johnson is to act by the sudden stimulation of caprice as cattle run madding when they are stung by the gadfly  this indeed is a mode of explanation which requires very little knowledge of ones author it should not sem that cattle stung by the gadfly are actuated by caprice but whether or not is a circumstance foreign to the purpose a thing done upon the gad is  done suddenly or as before while the iron is hot a gad is an iron ba so in i will never leave the a scottish song by allan ramsay bid iceshogles hammer red gads on the studdy  p     kent you take vanity the puppets part against the royalty of her father   alluding says dr johnson to the mysteries or allegorical shows in which vanity iniquity and other vices were personified  the description is applicable only to the old moralities between which and the mysteries there was an essential difference of which the learned commentator does not seem to have been aware  p     edg  poor turlygood poor tom that is something yet  edgar i nothing am  this dr johnson explains as edgar i am outlawed dead in law i have no longer any political existence and surely nothing can be more completely ridiculous outlawry is the effect of many legal proceedings in the ordinary course of justice and neither the speaker nor the author can have the least allusion to it the critics idea is both too complex and too puerile for one in edgars situation he is pursued it seems and proclaimed i e a reward has been offered for taking or killing him in assuming this character says he i may preserve myself as edgar i am inevitably gone  p     edg come over the bourn bessy to me   we should certainly read burn the fools reply does not seem to have

sleep or wakest thou jolly shepherd thy sheep be in the corn and for one blast of thy minikin mouth thy sheep shall take no harm  mr steevens thinks that minikin has been a term of endearment but it only means small little slender as has been already observed p    thy minikin mouth implies thy little and therefore perhaps pretty mouth  p     edg hound or spaniel brache or lym   a lym seems to

for sustaining the character of poor tom are now exhausted his horn was what he carried his liquor in and there is no necessity either for making him speak the words aside or for giving them an allegorical signification and even supposing the latter probable they need only mean i can no more or i have nothing left to say the company if they attended to him would take the phrase in its most obvious and simple sense i e that he had nothing to drink  dr johnson is surely right in supposing that sessy is a coption of cessez be quiet stop hold let alone it is so used by christofero sly the drunken tinker in the taning of a shrew and by edgar hisself in a preceding scene  dolphin my boy sessy let him trot by but it does not seem equally clear that it has been corrupted into so so mr steevens would have it to mean sissy  cecilia which is certainly wrong  p  0  gone  aside one way i like this well   goneril dr johnson observes is well pleased that cornwall is destroyed who was preparing war against her and her husband but is afraid of losing edmund to the widow  it does not appear that cornwall was making any hostile preparations against albany on the contrary in act iii scene viii goneril is on a visit to cornwall who dispatches her with amicable letters to her husband she is glad to hear of cornwalls death because by her sisters now rendered less difficult to compass she could possess the whole kingdom  p     reg lord edmund spoke not with your lady at home   stew no madam   the folio reads your lord but says dr johnson lady is the first and better reading if the learned critic had not been too indolent to look back a few pages to the second scene of this act he would have found that though lady may be the first and better reading lord is the true and right one for goneril not only converses with lord edmund in the stewards presence but prevents him from speaking to or even seeing her husband  p     gent ay madam in the heaviness of his sleep we put fresh garments on him  phys be by good madam when we do awake him i doubt not of his temperance  the folio mr steevens observes gives these four lines to a gentleman the quartos it seems distribute them very differently but the ingenious critic will recollect that in the folio the gentleman and as he is here called the physician is one and the same person a circumstance he does not appear to have at all attended to  p     the goujeres shall devour them etc the resolute john florio dr farmer says has sadly mistaken these goujeers he writes with a good year to thee and gives it in italian il mal anno che dio ti dia  but does the ingenious commentator really suppose that john meant a blessing instead of a curse in fact the pedant is guilty of no mistake  that he intended these very goujeers is evident from the folio of shakspeare where it is said the good years shall devour them and this was the usual spelling of that age  p   0 gone mean you to enjoy him   alb the let alone lies not in your good will   whether he who shall not or shall what depends not on your choice johnson  this ingenious and occult annotation is grounded on and supported by canon xv which allows the professed critic to explane a difficult passage by words absolutely unintelligible  there is not it may be here observed one of the canons which could not be properly illustrated and supported by numerous examples from the margin of the last edition  albany means to tell his wife that however she might want the power she evidently did not want the inclination to prevent the match  p     edg let us exchange charity   our author says dr johnson by negligence gives his heathens the sentiments and practices of christianity  does the learned critic mean to insinuate that benevolence or a forgiveness of injuries could not subsist without a belief in christianity that heathens could not act like men the contrary it is believed is so much a fact that it would be no paradox to assirm because it might be very easyly proved that all the moral virtues were better understood and more regarded by heathen greece and pagan rome thathey have been by any christian state since the invention or introduction of that system and what would the great philosopher think if it were to be made appear that the first christians borrowed or rather stole for they took without acknowlegement all their morality from the professors of paganism indeed it must be absurd to suppose for a single moment that they who had more sense than their successors had not at least as much virtue  p     kent i have a journey sir shortly to go my master calls and i must not say no  the modern editors mr steevens says have supposed that kent expires after he has repeated these two lines but the speech he thinks rather appears to be meant for a despairing than a dying man and adds that as the old editions give no marginal direction for his death he has forborne to insert any  the construction mr steevens puts upon kents speech is not meant to be disputed but it might have been as well if before he had charged his death upon the modern editors and asserted that the old editions give no direction about it he had consulted those editions for nothing can be more certain than that the second folio at the end of this speech has the word dies in the margin  the folios give the couplet thus i have a journey sir shortly to go my master calls me i shust not say no   volume the tenth romeo and juliet p    ben  what sadness lengthens romeos hours   romans nor having that which having makes them short   ben in love   romans out    ben of love   romans out of her favor where i am in love   i says dr percy take out not to be an imperfect part of a sentence cut off by aposiopesis but rather the interjection still used in the north where they say out much in the same sense as we now say fie  mr steevens very pertinently asks the doctor why romeo should say fie on being asked if he were in love but mr steevens gives no opinion  it is evident that this word out which is neither an interjection nor cut off by aposiopesis would in case romeo had not been interrupted have been as it is the first of his following speech out of her favor etc  p    romans these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows   i e says mr steevens the masks worn by female spectators of the play but this is by no means so certain and there is little reason for thus forcing improprieties upon the author of which he may not be guilty these or those merely resers to the masks worn by ladies shakspeare knew it to be a custom in london and supposed it to be one in verona  p    cap such comfort as do lusty young men feel when wellappareld april on the heel of limping winter treads   dr johnson reads yeomen which though mr steevens does not agree with him seems at least to be the interpretation of young men as these words are perpetually used for yeomen in old writings see particularly the legends of robin hood and adam bell so in a subsequent scene of this very play yew trees are in the old editions called young trees  p    romans i will be a candleholder and look on  the game was never so fair and i am done  an allusion to an old proverbial saying which advises to give over when the game is at the fairest  p  0 merc this is that very mab that cakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs  if all the old copies read bakes which mr steevens says they do what authority had mr pope to make the alteration and why is it followed  p    cap nay sit nay sit good cousin capulet   this cousin capulet dr johnson observes is uncle in the paper of invitation but as capulet is described as old consin is probably he says the right word in both places  each reading is right in its place cousin was a common expression from one kinsman to another out of the degrees of parent and child brother and sister thus in hamlet the king his uncle and stepfather addresses him with but now my cousin hamlet and my son and in this very play act iii lady capulet says tybalt my cousin  o my brothers child so in as you like it res me uncle duke you cousin and olivia in the twelfth night constantly calls her uncle toby cousin  p  0 enter chorus the use of this chorus dr johnson thinks is not easyly discovered as it relates nothing but what is already known or what the next scene will show indeed it seems to have been brought out merely to fill up part of the vacancy of time between the acts instead of a piece of music the groundlings of that age like the rooflings of the present would doubless be ever impatient to know what was to come next  p    ben come he has hid himself among those trees to be consorted with the humorous night  mr steevens brings some instances from other authors to prove that shakspeare means humid and mr malone who is remarkable for the pertinence propriety and real importance of his learned and ingenious remarks adds the following note  again in measure for measure the vaporous night approaches  to prove no doubt that shakspeare as he has here used humorous for humid there uses vaporous for vapid  p    mer and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone  as maids etc after this line says mr steevens in the quarto      i find two other verses containing such ribaldry that i cannot venture to insert them in the text though i exhibit them here as a proof that either the poor or his friends knew sometimes how to blot surely the poet and his friends are under very little obligation to the ingenious commentator for producing an indecent passage which he supposes one or other of them to have already suppressed but after all the learned editor is mistaken for despicable as the lines are they were not blotted either by the poet or by his friends  and if he will take the trouble of turning to either of the folios he will there find them  p    romans he jests at scars that never felt a wound   that is says dr johnson mercutio jests who has just left the scene and whom he overheard but with all due submission it does not appear that romeo either did or could nor is there any occasion that he should hear mercutio he that person jests etc is merely in allusion to his having conceived hisself so armed with the love of rosaline that no other beauty could make any impression on him this is clear from the conversation he has with mercutio just before they go to capulets  p    jul it is but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague what is montague etc  there is certainly some obscurity in this passage which might possibly be removed by reading thou art thyself though yet a montague or thus thou art thyself although a montague  at least juliets meaning seems to be that though he was a montague by name and therefore her enemy yet for his person and mind i e as a man she might still be allowed to love him either of the above proposed readings which yet are only for the margin seem as good as this which dr johnson thinks the true one thou art thyself then not a montague  and certainly much better than this of hanmer thou rt not thyself so though a montague  the subsequent lines which in the present edition stand thus what is montague it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part what is in a name etc and in the folio thus what is montague it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face o be some other name belonging to a man what is in a name etc should perhaps be thus regulated what is montague it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man o be some other name what is in a name etc   the words nor any other part which are in the quarto editions seem to have been omitted in the folio by inadvertency  p    romans my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love  to prorogue mr steevens observes has not in this place its common signification but means to delay and what is its common signification but to delay when the king prorogues the parliament he only defers or puts off its meeting to a future day  p    fri holy st francis etc   old copy jesu maria steevens  and why not this  p    mer a pox of such antic lisping affecting fantasticoes   thus the old copies says mr steevens and rightly the modern editors adds he read fantasies  the folio however which is generally looked upon as an old copy does not read fantasticoes and heminge and condell who are not usually ranked among modern editors read phantacies  p    nurse does not rosemary and romeo begin with a letter   romans ay nurse what of that both with an r   nurse ah mocker that is the dogs name r is for the dog no i know it begins with some other letter  the old reading appears to be  r is for

reading is as good if not better when properly regulated e g ah mocker that is the dogs name r is for the  no i know it begins with some other letter   in any case the long notes preceding mr tyrwhitts might be well spared being now wholely impertinent to the text  p    friar therefore love moderately long love does so too swift arrives as tardy as too slow  alluding to the vulgar proverb the more haste the worse speed  p    jul but my true love is grown to such excess i cannot sum up half my sum of wealth  the old copies according to mr steevens read i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth and i cannot sum up some of half my wealth the following would therefore be nearer the original reading than the present text i cannot sum up the sum of half my wealth  p    juliet back foolish tears back to your native spring your tributary drops belong to woe which you mistaking offer up to joy  mr steevens thinks the words woe and joy should change places otherwise says he her reasoning is inconclusive the learned critic does not seem to have paid his usual attention to the passage the text is certainly right juliet says that she has more reason to rejoice than to be sorry at tibalts death and that therefore her tears are egregiously mistimed  p  00 jul that  banished that one word  banished has stain ten thousand tybalts  has put tybalt out of my mind as if out of being johnson  out of being why where was he before the true meaning is i am more affected by romeos banishment than i should be by the death of ten thousand such relations as tybalt  p  0  jul it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sits on you pomegranate tree  this is not mr steevens says merely a poetical supposition it is observed of the nightingale that if undisturbed she sits and sings upon the same tree for many weeks together  it may be very true but the learned critic will recollect that it can only be so of the he and not of the she nightingale as the latter never sings the discovery is not indeed of the age of shakspeare  but what of that  p     jul hunting thee hence with hunts up to the day   the hunts up mr steevens says was the name of the tune anciently played to wake the hunters and collect them together and in proof of it he quotes a number of passages to which if the please he may add the following from charles cottons virgil travestie which indeed it is somewhat extraordinary he should omit i will play the rakehells such a hunts up  there was likewise a little rude song which it is supposed was formerly in use on this occasion as we learn from puttenham art of english poesy      one gray says he what good estimation did he grow into with king henry the eighth and afterward with the duke of somerset protector for making certain merry ballades whereof one chiefly was the hunte is up the hunte is up whether the following be the identical merry ballade does not clearly appear it is however very old the hunt is up the hunt is up and now it is almost day and he that is a bed with another mans wife it is time to get him away   master gray was probably author of both words and music and the tune may have remained in use after the words were forgot  p     jul  gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself tonight for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state  dr johnson with that candor and politeness for which he is so remarkable observes that juliet plays most of her pranks under the appearance of religion perhaps says he shakspeare meant to punish her hypocrisy if he had we should without doubt have been some how or other informed of it but shakspeare would never have given the little innocent excuses her virtue and conjugal fidelity prompt her to make use of so harsh a name  sweet juliet little did thou dream that in addition to thy misfortunes the unsullyed purity of thy angelic mind should at this distance of time be subject to the rude breath of criticism  but rest in peace sweet saint thy fair untained name shall live  live in thy shakspeares page  when even the critics memory is no more  p     cap o son the night before thy wedding day has death lain with thy bride  mr steevens is willing to suppose that this passage may have been coarsely ridiculed in deckers satiromastix dead she is deaths bride he has her maidenhead  the ingenious commentator who pursues such objects with perhaps too much avidity might have caught a much more likely hint in another place from juliets own mouth the judicious reader however will find many opportunities to remark that numerous expressions which are now degraded by vulgar currency were perfectly innocent and polite in the age of shakspeare  ibi cap death is my soninlaw death is my heir my daughter he has wedded i will die and leave him all life leaving all is deaths   death is my soninlaw etc the remaining part of the speech i have restored from the quarto   0  steevens  it is unfortunate that the industrious editor did not know that the lines restored are in both the folios  p     muss what will you give us   pet no money on my faith but the gleek   the use of this cant term is no where explained and in all probability cannot at this distance of time be recovered to gleek however signified to put a joke or trick upon a person perhaps to jest according to the coarse humor of that age so bottom midsummor nights dream act iii scene i  nay i can gleek upon occasion queen thou art as wise as thou art beautiful   dumps were heavy mournful tunes possibly indeed any sort of movements were once so called as we sometimes meet with  a merry dump hence doleful dumps deep sorrow or grievous affliction as in the next page and in the less ancient ballad of chevy chase it is still said of a person uncommonly sad that he is in the dumps  p     pet it is  music with her silver sound because such fellows as you have no gold for founding   instead of fellows which is the reading of the old quarto in      later editions mr steevens observes have musicians i should suspect adds he that a fiddler made the alteration  but does the ingenious commentator really imagine that such fellows were the editors of subsequent impressions or had even power to alter the language of shakspeare whenever they were displeased at it the change was less doubtfully made by the author out of compliment to or upon a remonstrance from the gentlemen of the orchestra  p     romans  famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thine eyes  the first quarto mr steevens informs us reads and starved samine dwells in thy cheeks  the quartos        0  and the folio as in the text  the modern editors without authority need and oppression stare within their eyes  the passage might perhaps be better regulated thus need and oppression stareth in thy eyes  for they cannot properly be said to starve in his eyes though starved famine may be allowed to dwell in his cheeks thy not thine is the reading of the folio and those who are conversant in our author and especially in the old copies will scarcely notice the grammatical impropriety of the proposed emendation  p     lau unhappy fortune by my brotherhood the letter was not nice but full of charge of dear import  that is it was not a mere letter of compliment or ceremony  p   0 romans thou detestable maw thou womb of

disqualifyed him for an editor of spenser  the modern pronunciation has arisen from vulgarity and ignorance the word being not formed of the verb detest but derived from detestable f detestabilis l

are much indebted both to his sagacity and friendship informs us may be discontinued at the readers pleasure the editors duty however and not the readers pleasure ought to have determined the matter the reader has it not in his power to discontinue any thing but the perusal of the book either of the other words would answer as well  p     romans how often when men are at the point of death have they been merry which their keepers call a lightning before death o how may i call this a lightning  dr johnson thinks we should read  o now may i call this a lighting   but how is certainly right and proper romeo had just before been in high spirits a symptom which he observes was sometimes called a lightning before death but how says he for no situation can exempt shakspeares characters from the vice of punning can i term this sal and gloomy prospect a lightning  p     romans  o here will i set up my everlasting rest  this again is a quibble between the implement formerly used by foot soldiers and the certain quiet of a future state  the writer of these notes will here take occasion to observe as one of the many great excellencies of this immortal bard that no author ancient or modern ever sacrificed less to the reigning superstition of the time than hisself whatever may be the temporary religion popish or protestant paganism or christianity if its professors have the slightest regard for genius or virtue shakspeare the poet of nature addicted to no system of bigotry will always be a favorite there never was but one set of men who professed open enmity to his name and writings and they were at the same time the declared and most virulent enemies of literature and morality in every shape it is scarcely necessary to add the mention of the barbarous enthusiasts of the last century one and perhaps the best founded of whose charges against that great and good monarch whom they so savagely murdered was  his intimacy with the writings of william shakspeare  the circumstance would at this time at least pass unnoticed in such a miscreant as cock to whom a hatred of letters was as natural as it was to his more illustrious predecessor jack cade  but when we see milton  the sublime milton  insisting upon the enormity of this amiable trait in the character of his murdered and libeled sovereign  our contempt for and detestation of the act is equaled by our surprise to find him the assassin  p     lau i will be brief etc dr johnson thinks it much to be lamented that the poet did not conclude the dialogue with the action and avoid a narrative of events which the audience already knew it was necessary however that the surviving characters should be made acquainted with the circumstances which produce the catastrophe and we should have had more reason to condemn the poet for being brief than tedious that our judicious author knew when to tell his story behind the curtain and when upon the stage is evident from the next play and it was perhaps to avoid a sameness between the conclusion of that and present that he has made the friar reveal the transaction to the audience which naturally introduces the reconciliation of the two families and the moral reflections at the end of the scene which whatever the critic may think are too valuable to be sacrificed to his mere rule and compass abridgement of it  p     prince and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen  what kinsmen mercutio doubtless is one and benvolio we may presume is the other the line therefore which communicated the tidings of the latters death to the audience p     and young benvolio is deceased too and which mr steevens rejects as he supposes shakspeare to have done as unnecessary slaughter should be restored to the text his death should seem to have been occasioned by grief for the death of one friend and the banishment of the other and we no where find that the prince was any way related to either the capulets or the montagues  hamlet      dr johnsons assertion that this play is printed in the folio of      more correctly than almost any other of the works of shakespeare could only proceed from his never having looked into it if any one play is in that edition more incorrect than all the rest it is hamlet even the accuracy of mr steevens has suffered some hundreds of its various readings to escape him  p   0 ber if you do meet horatio and marcellus the rivals of my watch bid them make have  by rivals the speaker certainly means partners according to dr warburtons explanation or those whom he expected to watch with him marcellus had watched with him before whether as a sentinel a volunteer or from mere curiosity we do not learn but whichever it was it seems evident that his station was on the same spot with bernardo and that there is no other sentinel by them relieved possibly marcellus was an officer whose duty it was to visit each watch and perhaps continue with it some time horatio as it appears watches out of curiosity but in act ii scene i to hamlets question hold you the watch tonight horatio marcellus and bernardo all answer we do my honored lord the folio indeed reads both which one may with greater propriety refer to marcellus and bernardo if we did not find the latter gentleman in such good company we might have taken him to have been like francisco whom he relieves an honest but common soldier the strange indiscriminate use of italian and roman names in this and other plays makes it obvious that the author was very little conversant in even the rudiments of either language  p     king but now my cousin hamlet and my son   ham a little more than kin and less than kind   i e we are indeed somewhat too nearly related but our relationship savours very little either of nature or affection  why the page of shakspeare should be loaded and disgraced with such a quantity of illfounded and injudicious notes is a question that every reader will find frequent occasion to ask to any one acquainted with the language of shakspeare and of nature the sense of this passage was sufficiently clear bishop warburton and dr johnson out of the abundance of their misunderstanding have done every thing in their power to confound it and those who look upon them to be the most intelligent and sagacious of all possible critics are naturally led to conceive difficulties which do not exist mr steevens has established the true reading and if there be any necessity for a note his with a little alteration should alone remain and all the others be consigned to the oblivion they so well merit  p     king  let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you  the crown of denmark was elective steevens  wherever the learned commentator acquired this piece of knowledge certain it is that his quotation from sir clyomon proves no such thing and me possess for spoused wife who in election am to have the crown of denmark here as heir unto the same for it clearly appears from this that she was to take the crown by hereditary right the words in election implying no more than that she had such right by the election the chosenness the elevation of her rank and family the king tells hamlet that he is the most immediate to the throne i e heir apparent or at least presumptive heir which would be absurd on an idea that the crown was elective see also the conversation of laertes with his sister in scene iii  impart most assuredly means profess myself bear me toward you and not what dr johnson says i e communicate whatever i can bestow whose note as well as mr steevenses should be entirely expunged  p   0 ham or that the everlasting had not fixed his canon against selfslaughter  a quibble between ordnance and ecclesiastical decrees mr steevens is an advocate for the former sense mr theobald for the latter what happyness what immortal glory to be the conciliator of such contending chieftains in criticism  p   0 pol for the apparel often proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are most select and generous chief in that  this pointing which comes recommended by mr steevens makes the most ingenious and absolute nonsense of the whole passage the folios read  are of a most select and generous cheff in that without any punctuation the genuine meaning of the passage requires us to point the line thus are most select and generous chief in that  i e the nobility of france are select and generous above all other nations and chiefly in the point of apparel the richness and elegance of their dress  p  0  ham  that these men  carrying i say the stamp of one defect being natures livery or fortunes star   one of the quarto editions and the editors have not condescended to inform us that the passage is in consequence no doubt of the authors own alteration omitted in the folios reads scar which dr johnson thinks more proper but dr johnson did not perhaps know neither does it appear that mr steevens could acquaint him that the word star in the text signifies a scar of that appearance it is a term of farriery the white star or mark so common on the forehead of a dark colored horse is according to another humane practice peculiar it is believed to this generous country usually produced by making a scar on the place  ibi  the dram of base does all the noble substance of worth out to his own scandal this must be allowed a very difficult and perplexed passage but as mr steevenses proposed reading  does all the noble substance often do out or rather indeed mr holts  does all the noble substance often adopt comes nearest to the traces of the original   the dram of ease does all the noble substance of a doubt it ought to have been inserted in preference to theobalds and the whole speech from the fourth line should have been thrown to the bottom of the page or perhaps totally omitted as apparently rejected by the author upon a revision of his play  p     hor  to what issue will this come   mar something is rotten in the state of denmark   hor heaven will direct it   perhaps says dr farmer it may be more apposite to read heaven will detect it  horatio asks to what issue this strange busyness will come and not receiving any answer from marcellus at least one to his purpose very naturally adds heaven will direct or lead it dr farmer and horatio seem to be thinking of two distinct subjects the latter is reflecting upon the appearance of the ghost the former upon the rottenness of the state  p     ghost i find thee apt and duller should thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethes wharf would thou not stir in this  rots itself is the reading of the two first folios that of the quarto mr steevens informs us but as there are more quartos than one we should have been more obliged to him if he had told us to which he alludes and what the others read is roots and mr pope followed it though mr steevens thinks the superiority of the present reading apparent to be in a quiescent state he says  i e to root itself affords an idea of activity very little activity one would imagine is necessary for the purpose of a weed rooting itsself and that little is made almost none when it roots itsself in ease to rot he thinks better suits with the dullness and inaction to which the ghost refers and yet adds he the accusative case itself may seem to demand the verb roots and with that reading the text would certainly be better for setting aside the impropriety of giving an octive signification to a neuter verb it is far from being either necessary or even proper that the ghost should have any allusion to rottenness and decay fatness and stupidity being generally attended at least in this world with a tolerable share both of good health and of good fortune  p     pol good sir or so or friend or gentleman   this is the reading of all the old copies and there is not a more plain simple certain  0 that it is the true reading is sufficiently proved by what reynoldo a few lines lower says to polonius who asks where did i leave rey at closes in the consequence at friend or so or gentleman but this last line though certainly useful  though printed in the olios  is not taken the least notice of in this editorial specimen of accuracy and perfection  and intelligible line in these ten volumes nor one that has more exercised the attention and ingenuity of the learned and sagacious commentators such readers as are better acquainted with shakspeare than with the modern improvements upon him will not be displeased to see a list of their several emendations  dr warburton good sir or sire i e father  dr johnson good sir forsooth or friend or gentleman  mr steevens good sir or so forth friend or gentleman  mr tyrwhitt good sir or sir etc  each of these proposals is recommended by a long note and there is besides a memoir by the reverend and learned dr percy upon the word forsooth illustrious critics how much is the spirt of shakspeare indebed to your unparalleled generosity and unexampled friendship  p     guil but we both obey and here give up

old norway overcome with joy gives him threescore thousand crowns in annualsie  fee in this place says mr steevens signifies reward recompense the word annual however might have inclined him to find some other meaning for it the king gave his nephew a feud or see in land of that yearly value the folio reads the line thus gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee but mr theobald and the present editors after him thinking that too little for a prince have very liberally upon the credit of some of the old quarto editions enlarged his income to  0000 to be sure the interpolation spoiled the measure but as the critic has for this license the authority of one of the canons nothing is to be objected on that head  p     ham  conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive   this reading is not explained conception understanding says hamlet is a blessing but the conception pregnancy of your daughter would not be one  p     ros  an aerie of little eyases    mr theobald had no such mighty reason to plume hisself on having done what is just equal to nothing at all for yases the old reading had he known how to pronounce it would not have been round to differ in any very extraordinary degree from his most sagacious emendation  p     ham then came each actor on his ass   this says dr johnson seems to be a line of an old ballad he has therefore caused it to be printed in the italic character but there appears no other ground for the supposition than the good doctors opinion which is not sufficient in these matters to authorize an alteration in the type  ibi pol the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral tragicalhistorical tragicalcomical historicalpastoral scene undividable etc  the words within the crotchets says mr steevens  i have recovered from the folio and see no reason why they were hitherto omitted but though the learned commentator could see no reason why the words were omitted before his readers can see one why they should be omitted now viz that the words historicalpastoral may not be absurdly repeated the truth is that the industrious editor has entirely lost the merit of his recovery by the negligence of his printer the folio properly reads  pastoralcomical historicalpastoral tragicalhistorical tragicalcomical historicalpastoral etc  p     ham why as by lot

ham  the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general  the discordant accounts given in this page will fully justify the following quotation from a writer of sense and veracity  caviare is made at astracan of the rows of sturgeon and belluga a large fish about twelve or fifteen feet long without scales not unlike a sturgeon but more luscious and large his flesh is whiter than veal and more delicious than marrow of these two fishes they take great numbers only for their rows sake which they salt and press and put up into casks some they send unpressd and a little cornd with salt being accounted a great dainty present state of russia by dr collins         mo  hamlet seems to mean that the play like the pickled sturgeon was a delicacy for which the multitude had no relish and hereby pays the said multitude a compliment he did not intend since it is hard to say whether his tragedy or his caviare were the more strange and unnatural food  p     ham what is hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her  mr upton and sir john hawkins think this expression a plain allusion to a passage in plutarchs life of pelopidas which the latter has here quoted at length this story shakspeare had undoubtedly read in sir thomas norths translation but that he here alludes to it is not equally apparent hamlets observation merely relates as the players grief did to the bombast stuff about hecuba which the latter had just done spouting  p     king her father and myself  lawful espials   the words  lawful espials are wanting in the folio steevens  this is not altogether so certain at least both the first and second folios appear to read her father and my self lawful espials  p     ham  who would fardels bear to groan and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death  the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns  puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklyd over with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action  groan dr johnson is for or against shakspeares own words just as it suits his purpose or inclination if grunt the reading of all the old copie be to be changed to groan merely because as he says it can scarcely be borne by modern ears shakspeare may be so transmografyed how do your ears bear that dr johnson and frittered away by his friendly editors in the course of a few years that if he were to rise from the dead he could not possibly know his own work  the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns it may still be a question how far dr farmers note removes the force or ground of lord orrcrys objection  a very simple person once observed that it is rather extraordinary for hamlet to say that no traveler had ever returned from this undiscovered country when he has a few moments before had a long conversation with the spirit of his father which had returned from it for the sole purpose of speaking to him  pith the quartos it seems have pitch which is certainly the better reading the allusion is to the pitching or throwing the bar  a manly exercise usual in country villages  p   0 ham you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it   innocculate is the reading of the folios the first quarto according to mr steevens reads euocutat the second euacuat and the third euacuate so that evacuate appears to be the true reading the word adopted renders the passage absolute nonsense  p     oph like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh   would it not be better to

own imagination should at least have pointed out some one of the old moralities in which this saracen deity of his is so clamorous and violent grennyng upon her like termagauntes in a play bales acts of english votaries relics i    which is very probably all the authority the learned dignitary had for his assertion seems to mean no more than the behavior of those fiends or imps so frequently to be met with in the ancient mysteries  p     ham do thou hear since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election has sealed thee for herself  though this be the reading of the two first folios it is certainly much inferior to the following which mr steevens gives us from an old quarto and could of men distinguish her election sh has sealed thee etc   distinguish her election is no more than make her election distinguish of men is exceeding harsh to say the best of it  p     ham o your only jigmaker   mr steevens has clearly proved that jig in the authors time signified a ludicrous dialogue in meter or a common ulgar ballad but he is as clearly wrong in asserting that it did not at that time signify a dance he may be satisfied of the fact by only turning over the next leaf from his own note  tumbling dancing of gigges  p     b ham  let the devil wear black for i will have a suit of sables   that a suit of sables was a very rich dress and

in support of the old reading  razed or racd why is mr popes capricious alteration still suffered to usurp a place in the text  p  0  ham for thou do know o damon dear this realm dismantled was of jove himself and now reigns here a very very  peacock  the first folio has paiocke one of the quartos it seems and the second folio pajecke and another quarto paicocke mr theobald in a very long note contends that we should read paddock which he interprets a toad as this is a most groundless and absurd conjecture mr malone  believes it to be the true reading alas poor shakspeare  peacock however is so certainly right that the very corruption of the old editions serves to confirm it  the surname peacock and most probably the bird itsself is still in many parts of the country called paike a paddock is a frog hamlets using that word afterward is nothing to the purpose here a peacock means a creature of no value but for its gaudy trappings but theobald is evidently right insupposing that it is only substituted for the word ass  p     ham now might i do it pat now he is praying and now i will do it  and so he goes to heaven and so am i revenged  that would be scanned a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven why this is hire and salary not revenge he took my father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven but in our circumstance and course of thought it is heavy with him and am i then revenged to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and seasoned for his passage no up sword and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in the incestuous pleasures of his bed at gaming swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation in it then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell whereto it goes  this speech says dr johnson in which hamlet represented as a virtuous character is not content with taking blood for blood but contrives damnation for the man that he would punish is too horrible to be read or to be uttered  how far it detracts from the virtue of hamlet to be represented as lying in wait for an opportunity to take an adequate and complete revenge upon the murderer of his father is a question not with submission to the great moralist quite so easyly decided the late king has reported hisself to have been destroyed in the most deliberate horrid and diabolical manner cut off even in the blossom of his sin unhouseld disappointed unaneald no reckoning made but sent to his account with all his imperfections on his head o horrible o horrible most horrible under such aggravated circumstances for hamlet to be content with having what dr johnson calls blood for blood would have been taking an inadequate and imperfect revenge and consequently doing an act of injustice and impiety to the manes of his murdered parent but indeed the reasons hamlet here gives for his conduct as they are better than any other person can make for him will fully justify both him and it against all such hypercritical opposition to the end of time  p     ham a bloody deed  almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother  queen as kill a king  this exclamation which mr steevens thinks may be considered as some hint that the queen had no hand in her husbands murder is as likely to proceed from surprised guilt as conscious innocence there is indeed no direct proof before us of her being accessory to the late kings death but his referring her punishment  to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosomlodge to goad and sting her and her own confession of the black and grained spots she sees in her very soul which will not leave their tinct do surely render her share in that shocking transaction very suspicious  p     ham  sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplexd  this is certainly the true reading hamlet means that the queen must have some kind of sense otherwise she could not walk about use her eyes hands etc as she was every day seen to do mr malones note in which he explains motion by libidinous inclination instead of throwing light upon the passage does essential injury to it  p     ham  a vice of kings   the vice says dr johnson is a low mimick the foo of a farce from whom the modern punch is descended but with al proper deference to so good a judge in these maters it is a much more probable conjecture that the facetious master punch and his wife joan are the trure reentarives of those distinguished characters in the old msteries pontius pilate and his dreaming lady the  as we elsewhere read had a dagger of lath  i e a sword of thin wood and is very likely the genuine ancestor of our more modern harlequin the fool of the christmas gambols in the north of yorkshire is yet called the vice  p     ham for this same lord i do repent but heaven has pleased it so to punish him with me and me with him  this dr johnson tells us is hanmers reading the other editions have it to punish me with this and this with me  what thanks are due from every lover of shakspeare to these worthy editors for their constant and successful edeavours to preserve his genuine text  p     ham  a pair of reechy kisses   reechy is here not smoky as mr steevens interprets it but dirty and greasy like the appearance of a cookwenches face or chimneybacon this is likewise its meaning in coriolanus  the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram bout her reechy neck   p     king the bark is ready and the wind at help   i e at hand ready ready to help or assist you dr johnson supposes it should be  the wind at helm  p   0 king and thou must cure me till i know it is done hower my haps my joys were never begun   however my haps my joys will never begin this being the termination of a scene should according to our authors custom be rhymed perhaps he wrote however my hopes my joys are not begun johnson  the folio reads in confirmation of dr johnsons remark  however my haps my joys were never begun steevens  this is true but is it not at the same time a conclusive proof either that dr johnson never looked into the folio or that he has ascribed what he there found to his own sagacity  something of this nature has been before observed dr johnsons captious readyness to question mr theobalds integrity on similar though much more dubious occasions is a sufficient justification of truth and candor to dwell on circumstances which might perhaps otherwise have been left unnoticed  p     oph tomorrow is st valentines day all in the morning betime and i a maid at your window to be your valentine  without doubt says dr farmer good morrow it is saint valentines day  the young lady comes to her sweethearts window the day before the choosing of valentines is always the busyness of the vigil or eve  p     oph by gis and by saint charity   gis is likely enough a corruption of jesus but surely it cannot be imagined that the letters l h s on book backs etc could any way contribute to it  p     king  the other motive is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection work like the spring that turns wood to stone convert his gyves to graces  the folio mr steevens observes instead of work reads would and should not the present edition have done so dr johnson seems not to understand the passage the king says that the common people would turn hamlets faults into virtues as strange a perversion adds he as that produced by the spring which changes wood to stone the learned and sagacious editor has a similar property but his alchemy only serves to convert gold to lead he has a very ready knack at changing the most perfect sense to the most absolute nonsense  p     king  good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returned shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager over your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father  laer i will do it and for the purpose i will anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples tliat have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratched withal i will touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death  it is a matter of surprise that neither dr johnson nor any other of shakspeares numerous and able commentators has remarked with proper warmth and detestation the villainous assassinlike treachery of laertes in this horrid plot there is the more occasion that he should be here pointed out an object of abhorrence as he is a character we are in some preceding parts of the play led to respect and admire  p     ham we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us   to do any thing by the card says dr johnson is to do if with nice observation the card being according to him the paper on which the different points of the compass were described that is the compasspaper itsself but it is not the card is a seachart still so termed by mariners and the word is afterward used by osrick in the same sense hamlets meaning will therefore be we must speak directly foreward in a siraight line plainly to the point  p     osr the king sir has wagerd with him six barbary horses against the which he has impond six french rapiers etc   to impone is certainly right and means to put down to stake from the verb impono to depone which dr johnson perhapses it should be is the same as to depose to swear or give evidence upon oath as he might have concluded from the very passage he has quoted from hudibras  p     osr the king sir has laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he has laid on twelve for nine   this wager dr johnson heartily professes hisself unable to understand in a dozen passes he says one must exceed the other more or less than three hits nor can be comprehend how in a dozen there can be twelve to nine mr malone however with the assistance of a slight correction already made by sir t hanmer thinks he has reconciled all difficulties by a dozen passes between yourself and him he understands a dozen passes for each the meaning then says he is  the king has laid that in a dozen passes apiece between you and laertes he shall not have the advantage of you by three hits he viz the king has laid on the terms of laertes making twelve hits for nine which you shall make  or perhaps he adds the last he means laertes and then it will run   he viz laertes has laid on terms of making twelve hits for nine which you shall make this continues the ingenious critic just exceeds hamlets number by three if therefore says he laertes in his    passes should make    hits and hamlet in his    but   the king would lose  if on the other hand laertes should make but    hits and hamlet   or laertes    and hamlet  0 his majesty would win  mr maone has evidently bestowed great pains in the above nice and accurate calculation and great is his praise as an ingenious commentator and a dexterous arithmetician it must therefore be with no small diffidence after so laborious and mathematical a discussion of this intricate subject which he has doubtless most satisfactoryly expounded and in the style of his good old schoolmaster the venerable mr cocker made plain to the meanest capacity that any anonymous scribbler should venture to question the radix of his figurative system and if that should unfortunately cause a demolition of the whole fabric alas the day  that a dozen passes apiece were not intended does evidentry appear from the ensuing scene in which the king previously to the encounter declares that if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange he will then drink his health it is clear from this that laertes might get these three hits but in case either party no matter which were to be the sole assailant for the first twelve passes and the other stand altogether on the defensive as the ingenious commentators own idea allows one to suppose the kings proposal would be ridiculous and absurd for if hamlet played his bouts first laertes could not have a single chance out of    passes or at least   and on the contrary if laertes took the lead there would be no possibility of hamlets getting a single hit the ingenious citic takes it for granted that passes might be made without a bit on either side a conjecture for which there is not the slightest ground in the play each pass or number of passes seems to have been made for the purpose of getting the hit and did not end till the hit was given but let us see how the parties behave in the trial scene  here they play each endeavoring we find to hit the other hamlet gets the first and second hits and calls on his antagonist for the third bout praying him to pass with his best violence they play again lartes wounds hamlet they become incensed change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes there does not seem the least foundation for the ingenious hypothesis and calculation in the note the whole structure must therefore inevitably al to the ground had they played with coolness and supposing their skill equal the odds were and so we are to understand osrick    to   in favor of hamlet for laertes to win must have got   hits at the least whereas hamlet would have won if he had only got   so that he had clearly the advantage of laertes in point of number three whole passes or hits and the odds were   to   which is in the same arithmetical proportion as    to   in hamlets favor before they begun to play this is shakspeares meaning and renders the text clear and consistent throughout and it only remains to be considered whether dr johnson or mr malone has understood the passage best  p  0  laert i am satisfied in nature whose motion in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honor i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honor i have a view and precedent of peace to keep my name ungord but till that time i do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it  this mr steevens says was a piece of satire on fantastical honor though nature adds he is satisfied yet he will ask advice of older men of the sword whether artificial honor ought to be contented with hamlets submission but in fact the passage is as little intended for a satire as the honor laertes alludes to is artificial or fantastical the ingenious commentator does not surely mean to contend that nature and honor are one and the same thing the sentiments of laertes and almost his very words would one may venture to say be adopted by men of real honor in similar circumstances in any country or in any age he is notwithstanding a treacherous and diabolical villain  p  0  ham your grace has laid the adds of the weaker side   mr malone for unluckyly as he did not understand the passage he found it would not in its present shape suit his ingenious hypothesis and curious calculations in a preceding page would have us read your grace has laid upon the weaker side but the text is perfectly right and neither requires nor admits of alteration the king had wagered on hamlets part six barbary horses against a few rapiers poniards etc i e about twenty to one odds enough in all conscience and yet is this same mr malone in another place so hardy as to assert that no unequal stakes were laid  p  0  ham i am afraid you make a wanton of me   i e you trifle with me as if you were playing with a child dr johnson only observes that a wanton was a man feeble and effeminate he might as well have said it was a horse or an elephant   i would have thee gone and yet no further than a wantons bird that lets it hop a little from his hand and with a silk thread pulls it back again romeo and juliet p     hor now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest  mr steevenses note on this passage is so interesting and extraordinary that it becomes necessary to insert it here at large lest it might be thought to be partially or unfairly represented in the remarks which it has occasioned  let us review for a moment the behavior of hamlet on the strength of which horatio founds this eulogy and recommends him to the patronage of angels  hamlet at the command of his fathers ghost undertakes with seeming alacrity to revenge the murder and declares he will banish all other thoughts from his mind he makes however but one effort to keep his word and that is when he mistakes polonius for the king on another occasion he defers his purpose till he can find an opportunity of taking his uncle when he is least prepared for death that he may insure damnation to his soul though he assassinated polonius by accident yet he deliberately procures the execution of his schoolfellows rosencrantz and guildenstern who appear to have been unacquainted with the treacherous purposes of the mandate they were employed to carry their death as he declares in a subsequent conversation with horatio gives him no concern for they obtruded themselves into the service and he thought he had a right to destroy them he is not less accountable for the distraction and death of ophelia he comes to interrupt the funeral designed in honor of this lady at which both the king and queen were present and by such an outrage to decency renders it still more necessary for the usurpr to lay a second stratagem for his life though the first had proved abortive he comes to insult the brother of the dead and to boast of an affection for his sister which before he had denied to her face and yet at this very time must be considered as desirous of supporting the character of a madman so that the openness of his confession is not to be imputed to him as a virtue he apologizes to horatio afterward for the absurdity of this behavior to which he says he was provoked by that nobleness of fraternal grief which indeed he ought rather to have applauded than condemned dr johnson has observed that to bring about a reconciliation with laertes he has availed himself of a dishonest fallacy and to conclude it is obvious to the most careless spectator or reader that he kills the king at last to revenge himself and not his father  hamlet cannot be said to have pursued his ends by very warrantable means and if the poet when he sacrificed him at last meant to have enforced such a moral it is not the worst that can be deduced from the play for as maximus in beaumont and fletchers valentinian says although his justice were as white as truth his way was crooked to it that condemns him   the late dr akinside once observed to me that the conduct of hamlet was every way unnatural and indefensible unless he were to be regarded as a young man whose intellects were in some degree impaired by his own misfortunes by the death of his father the loss of expected sovereignty and a sense of shame resulting from the hasty and incestuons marriage of his mother  i have dwelt the longer on this subject because hamlet seems to have been hitherto regared as a hero not undeserving the pity of the audience and because no writer on shakespeare has taken the pains to point out the immoral tendency of his character  there are very few it is believed at all acquainted with this inimitable author who would not be surprised nay astonished at such a severe and unexpected attack upon his principal and most favorite character a character every one has been hitherto led to admire and esteem not more by universal and long established opinion than by the sentiments and feelings of his own mind to find the amiable the injured the distracted and unfortunate hamlet represented as a worthless and immoral being totally undeserving of the least pity from those almost numberless audiences whom the united force of nature shakspeare and garrick has compelled to weep for his misfortunes and whose compassion would not be less in the closet than in the theater seems the most extraordinary and irreconcilable proceeding in a writer of genius and learning that can be well imagined however as the heavy charges which are here brought against him will upon the slightest examination appear to be groundless unwarrantable and unjust there is little reason to fear that the confidence and ingenuity with which they are advanced and supported will answer the purpose of the learned objector  hamlet the only child of the late king upon whose death he became lawfully entitled to the crown had it seems ever since that event been in a state of melancholy owing to excessive grief for the suddenness with which it had taken place and an indignant horror at his mothers speedy and incestuous marriage the spirit of the king his father appears and makes him acquainted with the circumstances of his untimely fate which he excites him to revenge this hamlet engages to do an engagement it does not appear he ever forgot it behoved him however to conduct hisself with the greatest prudence the usurper was powerful and had hamlet carried his design into immediate execution it could not but have been attended with the worst consequences to his own life and fame no one knew what the ghost had imparted to him till he afterward made horatio acquainted with it and though his interview with the spirit gave him certain proof and satisfactory reason to know and detest the usurper it would scarcely in the eye of the people have justified his killing their king to conceal and at a convenient time to effect his purpose he counterfeits madness and for his greater assurance puts the spirits evidence and the usurpers guilt to the test of a play by which the truth of each is manifested he soon after espies the usurper at prayers but resolves and with great justice resolves not to kill him in the very moment when he might be making his peace with heaven inasmuch as a death so timed would have been rather a happyness than a punishment and by no means a proper revenge for his fathers murder we next find him in the queens apartment endeavoring to make her sensible of the state of vice and horror into which her unnatural connection with the usurper had plunged her at the beginning of this conference he mistakes polonius who was behind the arras and about to alarm the household for the usurper and under that apprehension stabs him the spirit appears not very necessaryly perhaps to when his almost blunted purpose he is immediately sent off to england and in his passage discovers the treacherous and fatal purpose of the commission with which his companion and pretended friends were charged these men he knew had eagerly solicited and even thrust theirselves upon this employment and he had of course sufficient reason to conclude that they were well acquainted with the nature and purport of their fatal packet that shakspeare meant to charge them with this knowledge and to represent them as participes criminis is evident from the old black letter history which furnished him with the subject where they are not only made privy to but actually devise the scheme to take hamlets life his own safety depended on their removal and at such a time and under such circumstances he would have been fully justified in using any means to procure it  that he is accountable for the distraction and death of ophelia is a most strange charge indeed he had to be sure accidentally killed her father whom he took for his betters this causes her distraction and her distraction causes her death a most lamentable train of circumstances and with which the moral character of hamlet is as little concerned at that of the ingenious though uncandid commentator  that he comes to interrupt the funeral designed in honor of this lady is an assertion which has nothing but the credit of the asserter to support it walking with his friend horatio through a churchyard he enters into conversation with a gravedigger but presently observing the approach of a funeral procession he says to horatio to whom he was then speaking soft soft aside here comes the king the queen the courtiers who is this they follow and with such maimed rites this does betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life twas of some estate couch we a while and mark does it appear from hence that he knew or had the least reason to suspect this to be the funeral of ophelia or even that he was apprised of her distraction or unfortunate death the contrary is most certain he left the ingdom before her insanity broke out and does not return till after she is dead he has seen no one except horatio who was certainly unacquainted with the latter circumstance so that it is next to an impossibility that he could have known what had happened to her but to proceed laertes asking what ceremony else hamlet observes to horatio that is laertes a very noble youth laertes concluding his expostulation about the further honors with the following beautyful lines  lay her in the earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring  i tell thee churlish priest a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou lie howling hamlet exclaims what the fair ophelia his surprise and astonishment on hearing laertes name his sister are manifestly apparent and may serve to convince the learned critic and every one who has been misled by his illfounded accusations that hamlet does not come to interrupt the funeral and is guilty of no outrage whatever he as little comes to insult the brother of the dead or to boast of an affection for his sister which before he had in a wild and careless manner when he was under the necessity of counterfeiting madness denied to her face laertes bids  treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of an execration hamlet cannot but perceive to be pointed at hisself having uttered this curse laertes hastyly and in direct violation of all decorum jumps into the grave where he rants and mouths it like a player this outrageous proceeding seems to infect hamlet who forgetting hisself as he afterward with sorrow owns to horatio and by the bravery of the others grief being worked up into a towering passion leaps in after him and he who thinks hamlets madness or sincerity counterfeit here does not appear to know so much of shakspeare or of human nature as every one who reads this play ought to do  the affection hamlet now boasts for ophelia was genuine and violent we find him with the very same sentiments in the beginning of the play and he has never once disowned it except on a single occasion when the sacrifice was required by his assumed character a circumstance which cannot at least ought not to be imputed to him as a crime  the behavior and language of laertes is more ranting and unnatural than noble and pathetic and with his execration upon hamlet previously to his leaping into the grave and the violent shock which hamlet might feel on learning the corse to be ophelias might easyly work up to and apologize for a higher pitch of extravagance a stronger and more composed mind than that of which hamlet appears to have been then master  hamlets conversation with laertes immediately before the fencing scene was at the queens earnest entreaty and though dr johnson be pleased to give it the harsh name of a dishonest fallacy there are better because more natural judges who consider it as a most gentle and pathetic address and cannot perceive it to be either dishonest or fallacious for certainly hamlet did not intend the death of polonius of consequence unwittingly and by mere accident injured laertes who after declaring that he was satisfied in nature and that he only delayed his perfect reconcilement till his honor were satisfied by elder masters whom at the same time for he has the instrument of death in his hand he never meant to consult says  till that time i do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it   on which the truly virtuous innocent and unsuspecting hamlet replies  i embrace it freely and will this brothers wager frankly play   let the conduct and sentiments of laertes in this interview and in his conversation with the usurper together with his villainous design against the life of hamlet be examined and tried by any rules of gentility honor or humanity natural or artificial he must be considered as a treacherous cowardly diabolical wretch is such a character to rise on the fall of the generous hamlet  things are sometimes obvious to very careless spectators or readers which are not discerned by those who play closer attention to the scene hamlet in a trial of skill with laertes receives an unexpected a treacherous and mortal wound immediately before the company enter he appears to be much troubled in mind his spirits foreboding what was to happen if it be now says he it is not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readyness is all he does not appear to have suspected laertes of any unfair practice he did not know so much of him as we do but he had every reason to expect treachery and murder from the usurper he might too have heared something of his secret juggling with laertes and doubtless intended to revenge the death of his father being thus wounded and on the threshold of futurity if he had not killed the usurper immediately the villain would have escaped unpunished but he does not stab him for his treachery toward hisself  he upbraids him with his crimes of incest and murder  and consigns him to the infernal regions with all his rank offences thick upon him  so that he sufficiently revenges his father his mother who by the way dies if not deservedly at least unpityed and hisself as to his own fall every reader or spectator must sympathise with horatio for the untimely loss of a youthful prince possessed of such great and amiable qualities rendered miserable by such unparalleled misfortunes  for he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royally and who falls a sacrifice to the most base and infernal machinations his death however is not to be looked upon as a punishment the most innocent as shakspeare well knew are frequently confounded with the most guilty and the virtues of hamlet were to be rewarded among those angels which his friend horatio invokes to escort him to everlasting rest  dr akenside was a very ingenious sensible and worthy man but enough has been said to satisfy those who doubt that the conduct of hamlet is neither unnatural nor indefensible that his intellects were really impaired by the circumstances enumerated by the above learned physician is very probable and indeed hamlet hisself more than once plainly insinuates it see in particular the latter part of his soliloquy at the end of the second act  the opposing and refuting of general charges by proof and circumstance commonly requires much more time and space than the making of them the writer is sensible that the arguments here adduced are neither arranged so judiciously nor expressed so well as the objections of the learned commentator but from what has been said and as it is said it will appear that it has not been without strong and sufficient reasons that hamlet has been hitherto regarded as a hero not undeserving the pity of the audience and the ingenious critic will not perhaps have much cause to congratulate hisself on being the only person who has taken pains to point out the immoral tendency of as noble as virtuous and as interesting a character as ever imagination copd withal  p     hor  so shall you hear of cruel bloody and unnatural acts  thus says mr collins the more modern editors the first quarto and the folio adds he read  of carnal etc referring he supposes to the usurpers criminal intercourse with the mother of hamlet  carnal is without doubt the true reading but nothing can be more indecent ridiculous and absurd than the construction here put upon it was the relationship between the usurper and the deceased king a secret confined to horatio all the world must have been apprised of it the word is used by shakspeare as an adjective to carnage  othello p     iago  three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant often cappd to him  offcappd in the folio is certainly the true reading that of the text is nonsense  p     iago one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damned in a fair wife  this passage is too stubborn for any but a master critic to attack and those who have hitherto attempted it have little reason to boast of their success sir thomas hanmer reads fair phyz which dr warburton calls a whitefriers phrase and thinks iago is repeating othellos own words alluding to him mr steevens seems gently to incline to theobalds notion that the fair wife was iagos dr johnson according to his usual custom when there is real difficulty in a passage has nothing to propose mr tollet thinks one might read salse wife mr tyrwhitt believes the true reading is fair life mr steevens in a subsequent note observes that almost damned in a wife can only be said of a man who is near being married thinking it seems that a man actually married is not almost but altogether damned it is however settled that cassio is the florentine and evident that wise can never be the true word since he neither is married nor till some time after has any connection with a woman at least to our knowledge mr tyrwhitt seems to have come the nearest to what we may conceive to be iagos meaning and as his emendation does so little violence to the text the editors would certainly have been justifiable in adopting it  p     bra what tell thou me of robbing this is vonice my house is not a grange  that is says mr warton you are in a populous city not in a lone house where a robbery might easily be committed  one is always glad to read the notes of this very ingenious and fancyful writer since if one does not meet with information one may be sure of entertainment  you he makes brabantio say to iago and rodorigo are in a populous city not in a lone house  they are standing in the street see as to grange before p     p   0 bra with the moor say thou  who would be a father how did thou know twas she  o thou deceivst me past thought  what said she to you   thus says mr steevens the quarto      the folio      and the quartos    0 and      he adds read  o she deceives me past thought i continues he have chosen the apostrophe to his absent daughter as the most spirited of the two readings  it may be the most spirited but it is surely the least natural it is not at all in brabantios manner and is with as much probability an error of the press as an apostrophe to his daughter be that however as it may the majority and weight of evidence is in favor of the other reading which is more likely to be shakspeares own and should therefore be restored  p     iago he is married   cas to who   iago marry to  come captain will you go   mr steevens thinks it singular that cassio should ask the question as it appears he knew of othellos courtship from first to last but it is very easy to imagine that cassio might wish to know if iago were acquainted with the lady to prevent the latters suspecting that he was  p     bra that thou have practiced on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion  mr theobald reads  that weaken notion hanmer  that waken motion a notion to which mr steevens inclines mr malone knows not which to prefer he is for both and neither  to weaken motion is  to impair the faculties it was till very lately and may with some be still an opinion that philtres or lovepotions have the power of perverting and of course weakening or impairing both the sight and judgment and of procuring fondness or dotage toward any unworthy object who administers them and by motion shakspeare means the senses which are depraved and weakened by these fascinating mixtures  p     bra she is abused stolen from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks  dr warburton cites a venetian statute against those who sold love potions of which mr steevens believes shakspeare knew no more than he does he however supposes him to have been well acquainted with the edicts of that sapient prince king james the first against  practisers of arts inhibited and out of warrant   but there is no doubt that shakspeare had the substance of brabantios speech from cinthios novel however he might come by it and cinthio it may be supposed knew something of the venetin statute as to the edict against these practices by james i it may be fairly presumed that his sapiency had just about as much concern in its fabrication as if wisdom and learning be as criminal as it is rare in a great king a somewhat less sapient successor of his had in its repeal  p   0 oath that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively  thus says mr steevens the eldest quarto the folio he adds reads instinctively perhaps continues he it should be distinctively a word which if he had looked into the second third or fourth folio or into any subsequent edition prior to dr johnsons he would there have found  p     iago  if fanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits etc   here is a collection of quibbles by an erring barbarian he means not only a roving moor but a shallow blundering brute and this character he sets in opposition to that of a supersubtle venetian woman the vow he concluded must needs be frail that was made between two such unnatural extremes as brutal folly and the most refined female cunning  p     des o fie upon thee slanderer   this short speech mr steevens says is in the quarto unappropriated and may as well belong to aemilia as to desdemona it is given to desdemona in both the folios and to her it most certainly belongs  p     iago what an eye she has methinks it founds a parley of provocation   cas an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest   iago and when she speaks is it not an alarm to love   the voice says dr johnson may sound an alarm more properly than the eye can sound a parley  the eye is often said to speak thus we frequently hear of the language of the eye surely that which can talk may without any violent stretch of the figure be allowed to sound a parley  the folio reads  parley to provocation  pheere or fere is as entirely different from peer as one word can be from another the former implying a partner companion mate sweetheart husband or wife peers and compeers may signify equals and in that sense fellows but this is not the language of a balladmaker the term worthy fellow would be poorly explained by honest equal but why should we thus endeavor to make difficulties where we find none every person one may venture to say who has hitherto read the line will understand it to mean by a very common inversion of language king stephen was a worthy lord the term is not confined to this passage we have it in the tempest o king stephano o peer o worthy stephano spenser uses peer continually for lord and one might quote a multitude of similar instances from old books but to what purpose  ibi with that he called the tailor  lown sorry fellow paltry wretch johnson rather knave rascol  p  0  iage i do not know  friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom  in quarter that is according to dr johnson in their quarters at their lodging but it should rather mean at peace quiet or as the learned critic elsewhere explains it in friendship amity concord they had been on that very spot the court or platform it is presumed before the castle ever since othello left them which can scarcely be called being in their quarters or at their lodging and indeed they could not have left it without being guilty of another offense as they were directed by othello to keep the watch  p     clown then put up your pipes in your bag for i will away go vanish into air away   this must be wrong  possibly shakspeare wrote  fly away  p   0 des  what michael cassio that came a wooing with you  and yet in the first act says mr steevens cassio appears perfectly ignorant of the amor and is indebted to iago for the information of othellos marriage and of the person to whom he is married  the ingenious critic will perhaps find his observation a little too hasty cassios appearing or pretending to be ignorant of the above circumstances is in the first place no conclusive proof that he actually was so and secondly if the learned writer will take the trouble of referring to the passage he alludes to he will perceive that cassio is not indebted to iago for the information of the person to whom othello is married  p     oath they are close delations working from the heart   dr warburton reading and defending cold dilations i know not says dr johnson why the modern editors are satisfied with this reading they might easily have found that it is introduced without authority the old copies uniformly give close dilations except that the earlier quarto has close denotements which was the authors first expression afterward changed by him not to cold dilations for cold is read in no ancient copy but to close delations etc  now would any one suppose that after this confidence cold dilations should be the reading of the second third and fourth folios but it is actually the case how naturally does indolence produce error  p     iago i do beseech you though i  perchance am vicious in my guess  that your wisdom yet from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice etc  this passage is printed and explained as if what should have followed after the words though i were broken off by the speaker designedly but it is not his words and meaning are altogether plain and simple i beeseech you says he to otello though i may be too shrewd and vicious in my guess i e as mr steevens well explains it apt to put the worst construction on this matter that you would not from my imperfect surmises take further notice of it  p     iago o beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyd monster which does mock the meat it feeds on  the term greeneyd monster seems to refer only to jealousy and meek doubtless in this instance signifies to loath suspicion is the food which may be said to support jealousy and this very food the jealous person loathes and detests though he is not able to withstand the anxiety with which his mind pursues and devours it dr smollet had perhaps this very passage in his eye when he made one of the characters in his regicide say  let me rot a loathsome banquet to the fowls of heaven   p     oath  it is not to make me jealous to say  my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous  i know not says mr steevens why the modern editors in opposition to the first quarto and folio read most instead of more  they had two reasons  the sense requires most and  it is the reading of the second folio   p     iago foh one may smell in such a will most rank   will says dr johnson is for wilfulness a rank will adds he is selfwill overgrown and exuberant to smell wilfulness and an overgrown selfwill is a faculty peculiar to the learned critic but with all imaginable deference to him the expression means  inclinations or desires most foul gross and strongscented  p     oath a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is  hands not hearts  without it can be proved that this play existed in its present shape prior to the institution of the order of baronets one may pretty safely admit that this passage contains an allusion to the arms allotted them but that shakspeare intended to sneer at the establishment or had such a refined and complex meaning as dr warburton would contend is not quite so obvious as to the inconsistency of othellos acquaintance with an english honor of the writers own time every play abounds with similar instances  supplement volume the first p    widow dido perhaps says the industrious editor there is here an allusion to some old ballad in the pepysian collection adds he is one to the tune of queen dido if the learned commentator had consulted that collection he might have found the ballad of queen dido itsself but it is rather extraordinary that he should not know that it was printed in percys relics  this ballad appears to have been at one time a great favorite with the common people oh you aleknights exclaims an ancient writer you that devour the marrow of the malt and drink whole aletubs into consumptions that sing queen dido over a cupp and tell strange news over an ale pot etc jacke of dover his quest of inquiry or his privy search for the veriest fool in england lon   0   to  fig    p    nor scrape trencher nor wash dish it should be remembered says one of mr malones mushroom assistants in this notable piece of editorial cookry that trenchers which in the time of our author were generally used were cleansed by scraping only and were never washed they were scraped daily continues he till they were entirely worn away an assertion as ridiculous as untrue the scraping of a trencher is merely preparatory and conducive to its being thoroughly washed and scoured if scraping had been the sole and daily process these lasting and serviceable utensils would not only have been soon entirely scraped away but have scarcely been fit to eat off a second time and if mr white the trencherscraper in the note have been used only to scrape and never to wash his trenchers one cannot well envy his guests the luxury of fouling a plate with him  p    val not mine my gloves are on   speed why then this may be yours for this is but one   from this quibble mr malone conjectures that the word one was anciently pronounced as if it were written on that this was the ancient and original pronunciation is very probable as appears from the word only only and the vulgar usage in many counties at this day but that it was not the general practice in our authors time is evident from the following passages  much ado about lothing act v scene i nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine macbeth

the pronunciation of that period  as touching a lodging for you we have gotten won by my lord cardinals means etc  0 mr malone on another occasion v    observed to mr steevens that ere and o are

which it would be difficult for any other person to find a single instance   p    thou common friend that is without faith or love that is says mr malone is here used for id est that is to say

observes it appears that hamlet was then thirty years old and yet says he in the beginning of the play he is spoken of as a very young man one that designed to go back to school i e to the university

paper crown he says was not placed on the duke of yorks head till after it had been cut off  the ingenious commentator is most certainly mistaken shakspeare so far from having deviated from history has followed it with the utmost precision whethamstede expressly tells us that the lancastrians in direct breach of a mutual agreement and before the day appointed for the battle fell suddenly upon the dukes army and took him and the earl of salisbury prisoners treating both but especially the duke in the most shameful manner nam says he statuentes eum super unum parvum formicarium colliculum and quoddam sertum vile ex palustri gramine confectum imponentes per modum coronae super capud suum non aliter quam juaei coram domino incurvaverunt genua sua coram ipso dicentes illuserie ave rex sine regimine ave rex absque hereditate ave dux and pinceps absque omni populo penitus and possessione et hiis una cum aliis variis in eum probrose opprobriseque dictis coegerunt ipsum demum per capitis abscisionem clameum relinquere suae justiciae vendicacionis p     not a single circumstance is omitted or varyed in the scene it is not however imagined that shakspeare had ever consulted whethamstede he found the same story no doubt in some old black letter chronicle which it has not been the writers fortune to meet with or he might possibly have it from popular tradition  the end the genuine text of shakspeare preparing for the press an edition of the plays of william shakspeare with notes this edition will be comprised in eight duodecimo volumes and will be carefully and accurately printed from the only copies of real authority the two first folios but although these editions will be the standard of the intended work such passages in the old quartos as may appear to have been omitted by accident or with a view to shorten the representation and every various reading will be maturely considered and if worthy of insertion be adopted either in the text or margin as their importance or merit may seem to require no variation however will be made from the standard editions without apprising the reader of it unless the difference should consist merely in a slight typographical error nor is any difference between the various editions in other respects intended to be otherwise than occasionally regarded the orthography will be reduced with the utmost care to a modern and uniform system except where a change would be injurious to the authors sense and meaning various or doubtful readings will be settled from an attentive examination of the sentiments of every commentator the notes which will be very sparingly introduced and never but where they seem absolutely necessary or peculiarly proper will be chiefly extracted under the names of their respective authors from the editions of theobald warburton johnson and steevens but not to the exclusion of better though perhaps anonymous intelligence if it can be given it is however no part of the editors design to fill his margin with a view of the corruptions or a refutation of the errors of preceding commentators  the authors life with the usual documents particularly a more exact copy of his will than has been yet published and the prefaces of his various editors will be prefixed to to the work which will likewise be attended with a new copious and accurate glossary and in an additional volume it is proposed to give a complete verbal index adapted to the intended edition  this edition will with regard to the correctness of the text be infinitely superior to any that has yet appeared it will possess all the advantages of every former edition and be as little liable it is hoped as possible to the defects of any    th april
