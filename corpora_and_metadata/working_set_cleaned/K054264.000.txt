any one should entertain a more humble opinion of the following little production than she who presents it to you it is a trifle which she confesses has but a very slender claim to your protection but she considers that your name will be an ornament to her book as your friendship has been an honor to its author  where merit is incontestible and characters are decided by the concurring suffrage of mankind praise becomes almost impertinent it is absurd to be industrious in proving truths so selfevident that no one ever thought of controverting them  i may be accused of advancing a startling proposition when i declare that you are an enemy to the muses but if it be allowed that description and invention are the very soul of poetry i shall be justified by the world in general who constantly behold you displaying talents which cannot be described and exhibiting excellencies which leave nothing to be imagined  whatever reason i may find to regret my having ventured these little poems into the world i shall at least have no common pleasure in recollecting one circumstance attending them since they furnish me with an occasion of assuring you with what esteem and admiration i

vita che si bella in vista come perde agevolmente in un momento quel chen molt anni a grand pena sacquista petrarca there was a young and valiant knight sir eldred was his name and never did a worthier wight the rank of knighthood claim where gliding tay her stream sends forth to crown the neighboring wood the ancient glory of the north sir eldreds castle stood the youth was rich as youth might be in patrimonial dower and many a noble feat had he achieved in hall and bower he did not think as some have thought whom honor never crowned the fame a father dearly bought could make the son renowned he better thought a noble sire who gallant deeds had done to deeds of hardihood should fire a brave and gallant son the fairest ancestry on earth without desert is poor and every deed of lofty worth is but a tax for more sir eldreds heart was good and kind alive to pitys call a crowd of virtues graced his mind he loved and felt for all when merit raised the sufrerers name he doubly served him then and those who could not prove that claim he thought they still were men but sacred truth the muse compels his errors to impart and yet the muse reluctant tells the fault of eldreds heart though kind and gentle as the dove as free from guile and art and mild and soft as infant love the feelings of his heart yet if distrust his thoughts engage or jealousy inspires his bosom wild and boundless rage inflames with all its fires not thules waves so wildly break to drown the northern shore not etnas entrails fiercer shake or scythias tempests roar as when in summers sweetest day to fan the fragrant morn the sighing breezes softly stray over fields of ripened corn sudden the lightnings blast descends deforms the ravaged fields at once the various ruin blends and all resistless yields but when to clear his stormy breast the sun of reason shone and ebbing passions sunk to rest and showed what rage had done o then what anguish he betrayed his shame how deep how true he viewed the waste his rage had made and shudderd at the view the meekeyd dawn in saffron robe proclaimed the opening day up rose the sun to gild the globe and hail the newborn may the birds their amorous notes repeat and glad the vernal grove their feathered partners fondly greet with many a song of love when pious eldred walked abroad his morning vows to pay and hail the universal lord who gave the goodly day that done  he left his woodland glade and journeyd far away he loved to court the stranger shade and through the lone vale stray within the bosom of a wood by circling hills embraced a little modest mansion stood built by the hand of taste while many a prouder castle fell this safely did endure the house where guardian virtues dwell is sacred and secure of eglantine an humble fence around the mansion stood which charmed at once the ravished sense and screend an infant wood the wood received an added grace as pleased it bent to look and viewed its ever verdant face reflected in a brook the smallness of the stream did well the masters fortunes show but little streams may serve to tell from what a source they flow this mansion owned an aged knight and such a man was he as heaven just shows to human sight to tell what man should be his youth in many a wellfought field was trained betimes to war his bosom like a wellworn shield was graced with many a scar the vigor of a green old age his reverend form did bear and yet alas the warriorsage had drained the dregs of care and sorrow more than age can break and wound its hapless prey twas sorrow surrowd his firm cheek and turned his bright locks gray one darling daughter soothed his cares a young and beauteous dame sole comfort of his failing years and birtha was her name her heart a little sacred shrine where all the virtues meet and holy hope and faith divine had claimed it for their seat she reared a fair and fragrant bower of wild and rustic taste and there she screend each favorite flower from every ruder blast and not a shrub or plant was there but did some moral yield for wisdom with a fathers care was found in every field the trees whose foliage fell away and with the summer died he thought an image of decay might lecture human pride while fair perennial greens that stood and braved the wintry blast as types of the fair mind he viewed which shall for ever last he taught her that the gaudiest flowers were seldom fragrant found but wasted soon their little powers lay useless on the ground while the sweet pink and scented rose in precious odours last and when no more the color glows the sweetness is not past and here the virgin loved to lead her inoffensive day and here she often retired to read and often retired to pray embowerd she graced the woodland shades from courts and cities far the pride of caledonian maids the peerless northern star as shines that bright and blazing star the glory of the night when sailing through the liquid air it pours its lambent light such birtha shone  but when she spoke the muse herself was heard as on the ravished air she broke and thus her prayer preferred o bless thy birtha power supreme in whom i live and move and bless me most by blessing him whom more than life i love  she starts to hear a stranger voice and with a modest grace she lifts her meek eye in surprise and sees a stranger face the stranger lost in transport stood bereft of voice and power while she with equal wonder viewed sir eldred of the bower the mountain breeze which paints her cheek with natures purest dye and all the dazzling fires which break illustrious from her eye  he viewed them all and as he viewed drank deeply of delight and still his ravished eye pursued and feasted on the sight with silent wonder long they gazed and neither silence broke at length the smothered passion blazed enamored eldred spoke o sacred virtue heavenly power thy wondrous force i feel i gaze i tremble i adore yet die my love to tell beauty with coldness i have beheld and scapd the shaft divine but what my guardless heart can shield from piety like thine she cast her mild eyes on the ground and raised their beams as fast and close her father dear she found who happily that way past good ardolphs eye his birtha meets with glances of delight and thus with courteous speech he greets the young and graceful knight o gallant youth whoever thou art thou art welcome to this place there is something rises at my heart which says i have seen that face thou generous knight the youth rejoined though little known to same i trust i bear a grateful mind  sir eldred is my name sir eldred  ardolph loud exclaimed renowned for worth and power for valor and for virtue famed sir eldred of the bower now make me grateful righteous heaven as thou art good to me since to my aged eyes it is given sir eldreds son to see then ardolph caught him by the hand and gazed upon his face and to his aged bosom strained with many a kind embrace again he viewed him over and over and doubted still the truth and asked what he had asked before then thus addressed the youth come now beneath my roof i pray some needful rest to take and with us many a cheerful day thy friendly sojourn make he entered at the gate straightway some needful rest to take and with them many a cheerful day did friendly sojourn make end of the first part part ii once  twas upon a summers walk the gaudy day was fled they cheated time with cheerful talk when thus sir ardolph said thy father was the firmest friend that ever my being blessed and every virtue heaven could send fast bound him to my breast together did we learn to bear the targe and ample shield together learned in many a war the deathful spear to wield to make our union still more dear we both were doomed to prove what is most sweet and most severe in heartdissolving love the daughter of a neighboring knight did my fond heart engage and never did heaven the virtues write upon a fairer page  his bosom felt an equal wound nor sighed we long in vain one summers sun beheld us bound in hymens holy chain thou wast sir eldreds only child thy fathers darling joy on me a lovely daughter smiled on me a blooming boy but man has woes has clouds of care that dim his star of life  my arms received the little pair the earths cold breast my wife forgive thou gentle knight forgive fond foolish tears will flow one day like mine thy heart may heave and mourn its lot of woe but grant kind heaven thou never may know the pangs i now impart nor ever feel the deadly blow that rives a husbands heart beside the blooming banks of tay my angels ashes sleep and wherefore should her ardolph stay except to watch and weep i bore my beauteous babes away with many a gushing tear i left the blooming banks of tay and brought my darlings here i watched my little household cares and formed their growing youth and fondly trained their infant years to love and cherish truth thy blooming birtha here i see sir eldred straight rejoined but why thy son is not with thee resolve my doubting mind when birtha did the question hear she sighed but could not speak and many a soft and silent tear strayed down her damask check then passed over good sir ardolphs face a cast of deadly pale but soon composed with manly grace he thus renewed his tale for him my heart too much has bled for him my darling son has sorrow pressed my hoary head but  heavens high will be done scarce eighteen winters had revolved to crown the circling year before my valiant boy resolved the warriors lance to bear too high i prized my native land too dear his fame i held to oppose a parents stern command and keep him from the field he left me  left his sister too yet tears bedewed his face  what could a feeble old man do  he burst from my embrace o thirst of glory fatal flame o laurels dearly bought yet sweet is death when earned with fame  so virtuous edwy thought full manfully the brave boy strove though pressing ranks oppose but weak the strongest arm must prove against an host of foes a deadly wound my son receives a spear assails his side grief does not kill  for ardolph lives to tell that edwy died his long  loved mother died again in edwys parting groan i wept for her yet wept in vain  i wept for both in one i would have died  i sought to die but heaven restrained the thought and to my passionclouded eye my helpless birtha brought when lo arrayed in robes of light a nymph celestial came she cleared the mists that dimmed my sight  religion was her name she proved the chastisement divine and bade me kiss the rod she taught this rebel heart of mine submission to its god religion taught me to sustain what nature bade me feel and piety relieved the pain which time can never heal he ceased  with sorrow and delight the tale sir eldred hears then weeping cries  thou noble knight for thanks accept my tears o ardolph might i dare aspire to claim so bright a boon  good old sir eldred was my sire  and thou have lost a son and though i want a worthier plea to urge so dear a cause yet let me to thy bosom be what once thy edwy was my trembling tongue its aid denies for thou may disapprove then read it in my ardent eyes oh read the tale of love thy beauteous birtha   gracious power how could i ever repine cries ardolph since i see this hour yes  birtha shall be thine a little transient gleam of red shot faintly over her face and every trembling feature spread with sweet disordered grace the tender father kindly smiled with fullness of content and fondly eyed his darling child who bashful blushed consent o then to paint the vast delight that filled sir eldreds heart to tell the transports of the knight would mock the muses art but every kind and gracious soul where gentle passions dwell will better far conceive the whole than any muse can tell the more the knight his birtha knew the more he prized the maid some worth each day produced to view some grace each hour betrayed the virgin too was fond to charm the dear accomplished youth his single breast she strove to warm and crowned with love his truth unlike the dames of modern days who general homage claim who court the universal gaze and pant for public fame then beauty but on merit smiled nor were her chaste smiles sold no venal father gave his child for grandeur or for gold the ardour of young eldreds flame but ill could brook delay and often he pressed the maid to name a speedy nuptial day the fond impatience of his breast twas all in vain to hide but she his eager suit represt with modest maiden pride when often sir eldred pressed the day which was to crown his truth the thoughtful sire would sigh and say o happy state of youth it little recks the woes which wait to scare its dreams of joy nor thinks tomorrows altered fate may all those dreams destroy and though the flatterer hope deceives and painted prospects shows yet man still cheated still believes till death the bright scene close so looked my bride so sweetly mild on me her beautys slave but whilst she looked and whilst she smiled she sunk into the grave yet o forgive an old mans care forgive a fathers zeal who fondly loves must greatly fear who fears must greatly feel once more in soft and sacred bands shall love and hymen meet tomorrow shall unite your hands and  be your bliss complete the rising sun inflamed the sky the golden orient blushed but birthas cheeks a sweeter die a brighter crimson flushed the priest in milkwhite vestments clad performed the mystic rite love lit the hallowed torch that led to hymens chaste delight how feeble language were to speak the immeasurable joy that fired sir eldreds ardent cheek and triumphed in his eye sir ardolphs pleasure stood confessed a pleasure all his own the guarded rapture of a breast which many a grief had known twas such a sober sense of joy as angels well might keep a joy chastisd by piety a joy prepared to weep to recollect her scattered thought and shun the noontide hour the lovely bride in secret sought the coolness of her bower long she remained  the enamored knight impatient at her stay and all unfit to taste delight when birtha was away betakes him to the secret bower his footsteps softly move impelled by every tender power he steals upon his love o horror horror blasting sight he sees his birthas charms reclined with melting fond delight within a strangers arms wild phrenzy fires his frantic hand distracted at the sight he flies to where the lovers stand and stabs the stranger knight die traitor die thy guilty flames demand the avenging steel  it is my brother she exclaims it is edwy  oh farewell an aged peasant edwys guide the good old ardolph sought he told him that his bosoms pride his edwy he had brought o how the fathers feelings melt how faint and how revive just so the hebrew patriarch felt to find his son alive let me behold my darlings face and bless him ere i die then with a swift and vigorous pace he to the bower did hie o sad reverse  sunk on the ground his slaughtered son he viewed and dying birtha close he found in brothers blood imbued cold speechless senseless eldred near gazed on the deed he had done like the blank statue of despair or madness engraved in stone the father saw  so jephthah stood so turned his woefraught eye when the dear destined child he viewed his zeal had doomed to die he looked the woe he could not speak and on the pale corse pressed his wan discolored dying cheek and silent sunk to rest then birtha faintly raised her eye which long had ceased to stream on eldred fixed with many a sigh its dim departing beam the cold cold dews of hastening death upon her pale face stand and quick and short her failing breath and tremulous her hand the cold cold dews of hastening death the dim departing eye the quivering hand the short quick breath he viewed  and did not die he saw her spirit mount in air its kindred skies to seek his heart its anguish could not bear and yet it would not break the mournful muse forbears to tell how wretched eldred died she draws the grecian in the celebrated picture of the sacrifice of iphigenia timanthes having exhausted every image of grief in the bystanders threw a veil over the face of the father whose sorrow he was utterly unable to express plin book xxxv painters veil the vast distress to hide yet heavens decrees are just and wise and man is born to bear joy is the portion of the skies beneath them all is care the end the bleeding rock a legendary tale  the annual wound allured the syrian damsels to lament his fate in amorous ditties all a summers day while smooth adonis from his native rock ran purple to the sea supposed with blood of thammuz yearly wounded milton the bleeding rock a legendary tale where beauteous belmont rears its modest brow to view sabrinas silver waves below lived lindamira fair as beautys queen the same sweet form the same enchanting mien with all the softer elegance of mind by genius helghtend and by taste refined yet early was she doomed the child of care for love illfated love subdued the fair ah what avails each captivating grace the form enchanting or the finished face or what each beauty of the heaven born mind the soul superior or the taste refined beauty but serves destruction to insure and sense to feel the pang it cannot cure each neighboring youth aspired to gain her hand and many a suitor came from many a land but all in vain each neighboring youth inspired and distant suitors all in vain admired averse to hear yet fearful to offend the lover she refused she made a friend her meek rejection wore so mild a face more like acceptance seemed it than disgrace young polydore the pride of rural swains was wont to visit belmonts blooming plains who has not heard how polydore could throw the unerring dart to wound the flying do how leave the swiftest at the race behind how mount the courser and outstrip the wind with melting sweetness or with magic fire breathe the soft flute or strike the louder lyre from that famed lyre no vulgar music sprung the graces tuned it and apollo strung apollo too was once a shepherd swain and fed the flock and graced the rustic plain he taught what charms to rural life belong the social sweetness and the sylvan song he taught fair wisdom in her grove to woo her joys how precious and her wants how few the savage herds in mute attention stood and ravished echo filled the vocal wood the sacred sisters stooping from their sphere forgot their golden harps intent to hear till heaven the scene surveyed with jealous eyes and jove in envy called him to the skies young polydore was rich in large domains in smiling pastures and in flowery plains with these he boasted each exterior charm to win the prudent and the cold to warm to act the tenderness he never felt in sorrow soften and in anguish melt the sigh elaborate the fraudful tear the joy dissembled and the well feigned fear all these were his and his the treacherous art that steals the guileless and unpracticed heart too soon he heard of lindamiras fame twas each enamored shepherds favorite theme returned the rising and the setting sun the shepherds favorite theme was never done they praised her wit her worth her shape her air and even inferior beauties thought her fair such sweet perfection all his wonder moved he saw admired nay fancied that he loved but polydore no real passion knew lost to all truth in feigning to be true no sense of tenderness could warm a heart too proud to feel too selfish to impart cold as the snows of rhodope descend and with the chilling waves of hebrus blend so cold the breast where vanity presides and mean selflove the bosomfeelings guides too well he knew to make his conquest sure win her soft heart yet keep his own secure so often he told the well imagined tale so often he swore  how should he not prevail too unsuspecting not to be deceived the well imagined tale the nymph believed she loved the youth she thought herself beloved nor blushed to praise whom every maid approved alas that youth from lindamira far for newer conquests wages cruel war with other nymphs on other plains he roams where injured lindamira never comes laughs at her easy faith insults her woe nor pities tears himself had taught to flow and now her eyes soft radiance seemed to fail and now the crimson of her cheek grew pale the lily there in faded beauty shows its sickly empire over the vanquished rose devouring sorrow marks her for his prey and slow and certain mines his silent way yet as apace her ebbing life declined increasing strength sustained her womans mind o had my heart been hard as hisshe cried an hapless victim thus i had not died if there be gods and gods there surely are lnsulted virtue doubtless is their care then hasten righteous heaven my tedious fate shorten my woes and end my mortal date quick let your power transform this failing frame let me be any thing but what i am and since the cruel woes i am doomed to feel proceed alas from having loved too well grant me some form where love can have no part nor human weakness reach my guarded heart if pity has not left your blessed abodes change me to flinty adamant ye gods to hardest rock or monumental stone rather than let me know the pangs i have known so shall i thus no farther torments prove nor taunting rivals say  she died for love for sure if aught can aggravate our fate it is scorn or pity from the breast we hate she said  the gods accord the sad request for when were pious prayers in vain addressed now strange to tell if rural folks say true to hardened rock the stiffening damsel grew no more her shapeless features can be known stone is her body and her limbs are stone the growing rock invades her beauteous face and quickly petrifies each living grace the stone her stature nor her shape retains the nymph is vanished but the rock remains yet would her heart its vital spirits keep and scomd to mingle with the marble heap when babbling fame the fatal tidings bore grief seized the soul of perjured polydore despair and horror robbed his soul of rest and deep compunction wrung his tortured breast then to the fatal spot in haste he hied and plunged a deadly poniard in his side he bent his dying eyes upon the stone and take sweet maidhe cried my parting groan fainting the steel he grasped and as he fell the weapon pierced the rock he loved so well the guiltless steel assailed the mortal part and stabbed the vital vulnerable heart the lifeblood issuing from the wounded stone blends with the crimson current of his own and though revolving ages since have past the meeting torrents undiminishd last still gushes out the sanguine stream amain the standing wonder of the stranger swain now once a year so rustic records tell when over the heath resounds the midnight bell on eve of midsummer that foe to sleep what time young maids their annual vigils keep the midsummermen consulted as oracular by village maids telltale shrub fresh gathered to declare the swains who false from those who constant are when ghosts in clanking chains the churchyard walk and to the wondering ear of fancy talk when the scared maid steals trembling through the grove to kiss the tomb of him who died for love when with long watchings care at length oppressed steals broken pauses of uncertain rest nay grief short snatches of repose can take and nothing but despair is quite awake then at that hour so still so full of fear when all things horrible to thought appear is perjured polydore observed to rove a ghastly spectre through the gloomy grove then to the rock the bleeding rock repair where sadly sighing it dissolves to air still when the hours of solemn rites return the village train in sad procession mourn pluck every weed which might the spot disgrace and plant the fairest fieldflowrs in their place around no noxious plant or floweret grows but the first daffodil and earliest rose the snow drop spreads its whitest bosom here and golden cowslips grace the vernal year here the pale primrose takes a fairer hue and every violet boasts a brighter blue here builds the wood lark here the faithful dove laments her lost or wooes her living love secure from harm is every hallowed nest the spot is sacred where true lovers rest to guard the rock from each malignant sprite a troop of guardian spirits watch by night aloft in air each takes his little stand the neighboring hill is hence called fairy land by contraction failand a hill well known in somersetshire not far from this is the bleeding rock from which constantly issues a crimson current  the end
