jonathan wild   the life of jonathan wild from his birth to his death  containing his rise and progress in roguery his first acquaintance with thieves by what arts he made himself their head or governor his discipline over them his policy and great cunning in governing them and the several classes of thieves under his command  in which all his intrigues plots and artifices are accounted for and laid open  to which is added a true copy of a paper designed to be delivered by him at the place of execution to the reverend mr edwards  intermixed with variety of diverting stories  the second edition  by h d late clerk to justice   london printed for t warner at black boy in paternosterrow      price one shilling  the preface the account which the reader will here find of the most extraordinary rogue that ever yet suffered in england was picked up for the most part at several times from his own relations and stories of himself which are the best authorities that can be produced for things which according to the iniquity and nature of them were transacted with such extreme caution  and it is certain that the greatest part of his dark proceedings would still have continued a secret to the world had it not been that in his gay hours when his heart was open he took pleasure in recounting his past rogueries and with a great deal of humor bragged of his biting the world often hinting not without vanity at the poor understanding of the greatest part of mankind and his own superior cunning  and indeed when we consider that it is not a mans grandeur or high station in the world but the strange adventures of his life and his art and conduct in the management of things which gives us a curiosity of looking into his history  i say when this is granted we need make no apology for collecting these materials and offering them to the public  for here they will meet with a system of politics unknown to machiavel they will see deeper stratagems and plots formed by a fellow without learning or education than are to be met with in the conduct of the greatest statesman who have been at the heads of governments  and indeed when things are rightly compared it will be found that he had a more difficult game to play for he was to blind the eyes of the world to find out tricks to evade the penalties of the law and on the other side to govern a body of people who were enemies to all government and to bring those under obedience to him who at the hazard of their lives acted in disobedience to the laws of the land  this was steering betwixt scylla and charybdis and if he had not been a very skilful pilot he must long since have split upon a rock either on one side or the other  to conclude we have not taken so much pains to multiply a number of stories which would have swelled the bulk of these sheets and increased the price and perhaps tired the reader we have only endeavored to trace him through his several steps and gradations to account for the policy and cunning of his management and relating only such facts as have not yet been made public concerning him  ps as to the paper he left behind him and which we have annexed to this edition it was given me by a person who being of his acquaintance was admitted frequently to his company after his conviction and which he assures me he had from his own hands the reverend gentleman there mentioned whom i know nothing of can best tell whether he had such a design of communicating himself to the public in that manner and there i leave it    the life of jonathan wild from his birth to his death jonathan wild was born of very honest parents in the town of wolverhampton in the county of stafford his father was not rich however he provided handsomely for his family while he lived by his trade which was that of a carpenter but he dying and leaving four or five small children for the widow to bring up and subsist it is no wonder if their education was no better taken care of as for jonathan he showed early signs of a forward genius and whilst a boy would commit a thousand little rogueries among those of the same or a superior class in which he discovered a ready wit and a cunning much above his years though these actions did not extend to robbing or any such crime but i mean little collusive tricks which served to impose upon his own companions who had a less faculty of discerning than jonathan had  at the usual age when young jonathan had been instructed to a moderate degree of learning such as writing and accounts he was put prentice to a bucklemaker whom he served seven years honestly enough when that time was expired he carried on a little peddling business himself in the same way but jonathan wanted application which is generally observed to be the fault of men of brisk parts work and he were too much at variance for him to thrive by his trade he seemed to follow it only at a distance often playing the loose wandering from one alehouse to another with the very worst though the merriest company in the place and was particularly fond of the strolling actors that now and then frequented that country  after this manner jonathan lived three or four years leading a life of pleasure disturbed with nothing unless it was now and then at the noise of a drum which he had as great antipathy to as some folks to cheese or a cat this was in the height of the late war between france and the confederates when the officers went down into the several counties for recruits for flanders for which kind of service mr wild had perhaps more aversion than for any other thing in life this was not for want of courage as we shall prove in the course of his history but he thought a man of stratagem might push his fortune some better way than by standing to be shot at and therefore twas necessary that he should employ the utmost cunning to avoid it which however jonathan could never have done but by a trick which he was more beholden to nature for than art this was a knack of dislocating his hipbone which he could do without pain and thereby render himself a cripple and repose it in its place again without trouble whenever he pleased this was particularly useful to him and which he constantly performed whenever his unlucky stars brought him within sight of a red coat which he used to pass by in so decrepid and deformed a posture as never failed to move pity in the beholders toward so miserable an object and he was no sooner out of sight of em but he walked as upright and as firm as any man  in the course of jonathans trading he visited some market towns to put off his wares as other dealers did at which time he used to hire a horse of his neighbors for jonathans stock would not amount to one of his own and at a certain time when trade grew bad on his hands he sells his whole cargoe for what he could get and rides up the horse to london instead of returning home to wolverhampton and the owner heard nothing of his beast till twas sold and all the money spent  while jonathan was spending in gaiety and pleasure the little fortune he had acquired by the sale of his own stock and his neighbors horse he got acquainted with several persons of both sexes who were people of merit in their way by whose interest and the vivacity of his own parts he was recommended to an employment of trust in which he acquitted himself very handsomely considering the corruption of the times but after a while jonathan finding it rather a post of honor than profit resigned and went down into his own country again the employment i mean is that of a bailiffs follower the qualifications of which are vigilance sagacity patience quicksightedness cum multis aliis which our jonathan had frequent opportunities of exercising  one of the first visiters jonathan had upon his return to wolverhampton was mr  who lent him his horse to whom he opened his case letting him know that he was not one farthing the richer by living at london that he had spent every groat and if he threw him into prison he would lose his money but that if he would favor him so as to give him time he would pay for his horse at a shilling in the pound per month till the whole was paid and he should apply himself with assiduity to his own business to enable him to make good these conditions which the creditor considering came into and so the agreement was made  mr wild pursuant to the above terms made two payments at the time they became due but neglecting the third for a fortnight or three weeks mr  gave jonathan a gentle dun telling him at what time the month was up and so forth but was very much surpised to find that mr wild was so far from making any excuse for his omission that he told him plainly he should pay him no more money and wondered at his assurance of making demands on him why says the creditor did not you run away with my horse sell him at london and put the money in your own pocket i did so answered jonathan but that affair was settled by an agreement between us that i should pay you so much money by monthly payments in consideration thereof therefore that cause is at an end very well replied the creditor why dont you pay me according to that contract then no quoth jonathan that contract is obsolete and of none effect how so says the creditor why you will allow says jonathan that articles of agreement or contracts not fulfilled are broken and articles once broken cannot subsist afterward now our articles are broken continued he for i have made but two payments when there are three due long ago therefore i owe you nothing  i mention this story to show that jonathan had a genius for the study of the law and had not his practice taken another turn at first i dont know whether better or worse as it is practiced of late he might have been as eminent and made as great a figure as some of his countrymen  it was not long after this that jonathan found the making of buckles too mechanic an employment for him his soul was too great to be confined to such servile work and what was worse he easily perceived he had occasion for more money than his hands could procure him in that narrow way of business therefore he spurned at the trade and resolved some how or other to transfer the labor from his hands to his head as being the most likely means of getting a livelihood fit for a gentleman  big with hopes he set out for london once more but as if he threw himself entirely upon fortune and resolved to court her favors he begun his journey on foot and with no more than nine pence in his pocket and the first day he was so lucky as to meet with the goddess in the same shape the poets describe her viz that of a woman traveling on the road the lady was on horseback but however she was so goodnatured as to let jonathan keep pace with her for three or four miles till by a little conversation they grew intimate and acquainted with each others circumstances she told jonathan she was an itinerant doctress and cured people of all distempers that she had been riding about the country for the good of the public and was then going to gloucester whereupon jonathan being in a merry humor asked her opinion concerning his leg and thigh which he presently put out in the manner before mentioned the gentlewoman alighted from her horse and handling jonathans parts she found his hipbone was out of its socket a great exuberance on the back part thereof and his knee and foot turned almost behind him  she was amazed to see this sudden alteration without being sensible of the cause and was very much troubled to know what she should do with the poor fellow in that condition but jonathan presently put her out of pain desired her to mount her horse and he would accompany her into town he thereupon replaces the joint and walks along before her with great briskness and agility when she was thoroughly informed of the trick she intimated how useful this deceit might be made to them both if he would leave it to her management and all the trouble he should be at was to lie a bed for a fortnight and eat and drink whatever he had a mind to upon which she let him into a secret that she knew no more of physic or surgery than her horse and only pretended to it for a livlihood  it may be imagined that jonathan was not difficult to be wrought on to such good purposes for he was never an enemy to eating and drinking in his whole life accordingly the plan was laid and jonathan hoppd into town in the evening in the circumstances of a poor decriped beggarman  the doctress set up at the best inn in gloucester asked for a room and called the landlord telling him she found a poor miserable object upon the road that asked alms of her which she presently relieved seeing him in a condition that rendered him useless to the world and burdensome to himself adding that since he might be able if his lameness could be cured to get an honest livlyhood by his labor twas a thousand pities he should not be taken care of the landlord could say nothing to that twas the parishs business where he was born he said who should take care of him says she if you have any eminent surgeon in town a man of honor and probity that will undertake his cure i will be at the expense of it my self and give him a suitable reward the landlord commended her ladiships charity and jonathan prayed aloud for his benefactress  on mr b  a surgeon was sent for to whom madam declared her self in like manner and the surgeon took a survey before all the house of the part affected he saw the nature of his lameness and therefore only asked jonathan how long ago this misfortune happened to him he answered in a whining tone about eight years and thereupon relates a plausible story of his falling off a tree in a country village where no help was to be met with and his mother being a poor woman had not wherewithal to pay a doctor and the like but pretended to be very much cast down when the surgeon addressing himself to the gentlewoman said madam it would be no less than a robbery to take your money for there is no possibility of serving him the bone having been so long misplaced has contracted a new situation and the head of the bone has formed a new socket so formidable that twould be unnatural now to remove it thence so that we must let it rest as it is this did not seem to satisfy the gentlewoman she was sure she said the limb might be reduced to its proper place with care taken if he would apply fomentations and other topical medicines to the part for the relaxation of the ligaments etc in preparation for the reduction this was disputed some time with warmth between the male and the female surgeon till it ended as often arguments do in a wager of fifty guineas and the lady her self was to take the matter into her own hands  whereupon the patient was blooded and then put ito a warm bed stupes were made of a thousand herbs and the fomentation applied or pretended so to be several times a day mr b  visited him once in twenty four hours and the gentlewoman continued with him all the while for ten days together in which time honest jonathan acted his part so well that he roared himself hoarse for the pain he underwent as it was thought in this extraordinary operation at length one morning as mr b  the surgeon our quack doctress and three or four of the town for the affair had made some noise were coming up stairs they heard the patient instead of groaning and making other dismal cries as he used to do singing whistling and what not so they all burst into his chamber and presently asked the occasion of his mirth jonathan told them he never knew so much pleasure in all his lifetime for now he said he was as free from pain as ever a one in the room  the sly doctress desired to be informed how and at what time the pain left him he answered that about three a clock that morning not having slept for four nights before he fell into a dose and dreamed that two angels lifted him out of bed and carried him through several regions of which he could give no account and set him down upon a fine bank of flowers on the side of a rivulet on the other side of which were beautiful walks pleasant groves and curious waterworks and in the center of all a pavillion of ivory of extraordinary workmanship particularly the sculpture the roof was adorned with birds of all kinds inlaid and on the inside a throne of pure gold where sat his kind and good benefactress at the sight of her continued jonathan i rose up in haste thinking to swim the rivulet when a noise like thunder awakened me and i found my self in this bed in perfect health and ease the cunning gentlewoman cried out at that instant went the bone into its place with that they turned down the bedcloaths and found jonathan a whole man to the great surprise of all the company  this extraordinary cure was looked upon as a kind of miracle mr b  believed it as such paid the money  viz fifty guineas and cleared the case up to every body from any imputation of deceit jonathan in two or three days came abroad but limpd a little and madam doctress gave public notice that she would stay a week in that town for the sake of the diseased poor of the country for whom she would make up some papers of powders that should cure them of all disorders and make it the healthiest part in the whole kingdom for which she would take nothing of them but what the medecines cost her out of her pocket according to the cant of all quacks  the news run like that of a great victory gained over the french and spaniards and people of all conditions age and sexes came into gloucester so that jonathan could not pound brickdust fast enough for sale the price of a small paper of which with a mixture of brimstone and  came but to six pence  by this stratagem the womans fame was so raised that when jonathan and she computed their gains they found after all charges were deducted that they were much about  00 l in pocket with which they set out early in the morning and arrived at london safely in three days following here jonathan lived a merry life as long as the money lasted and being seduced by the pleasures of the town had no thought of getting more till urged thereto by necessity but now an unlucky accident happened which seemed to give an ill turn to his affairs for his lady doctress took it into her head to fall out with him whether it be that she was jealous of his having some new amor for jonathan was always a great man amongst the ladies or whether she could not bear his extravagance is a piece of history we cannot clear up but let it be which it will there arose so furious a quarrel betwixt them that jonathan was laid aside and obliged to shift for himself he was after this footman to one mr daniel a barrister of law in whose service he spent some time in which nothing remarkable happening we pass over in silence a little time after he was arrested in an action of debt and he being destitute both of credit and friends could meet with no body who would venture to bail him so that he was thrown into the compter where he lay a considerable time  here jonathan laid the foundation of all his future greatness for it must be observed that the compter is the place where common thieves and pickpockets taken in the city are first carried as soon as they are apprehended jonathan took care to cultivate an acquaintance and intimacy with them all and as they are an enterprizing body of men there seemed to a kind of sympathy betwixt their natures and that of jonathan so that they soon crept into one anothers secrets he became acquainted with all their tricks and stratagems and when the iron hand of justice had laid hold of them and they were entangled in difficulties he often put such quirks and evasions in their heads and gave them such advice as sometimes proved of great advantage to them so that he became a kind of oracle amongst the thieves  after he had laid a considerable time in the compter he was assisted by a friendly gentleman in littlebritain who getting a small contribution among his neighbors procured jonathans liberty with it  he had now a numerous acquaintance with whom he constantly associated these were the thieves as has been before observed there was no enterprise they went upon whether in town or country but they acquainted jonathan with the particulars of their success what booty they got and what hazzards they run so communicative are these gentlemen to those who keep them company yet at the beginning he had so much the fear of the gallows before his eyes that they could never prevail with him to go with them upon any adventure and share in the executive part  at first jonathan drove but a poor pedling trade only helping people to writings which the thieves could make no profit of and which could be of no use but to the owners and in this he at first acted with such extreme caution for fear of coming within the penalty of the laws that after he had bargained with the people and they were come by his appointment to pay the money and receive the writings he led them into a room contrived for that purpose where pushing back a small panel of the wainscot a hand used to appear with the writings in it and the parties were to take them out of that hand and to put the money into it without their seeing the body which belonged to it so that they could not say he had ever taken any of their money or received the stolen goods yet the success and encouragement he afterward met with made him more careless to his great sorrow  the first thing that gave him any fame was a dispute he had with cornelius a tilburgh a noted quack doctor who being robbed of some goods and hearing of jonathan wild applied to him for the recovery of them but after they had treated some time they could not agree about the price upon the whole tilburgh was vexed he could not have his goods again and thinking jonathan had them he arrests him in an action of trover jonathan gave bail to the action and so a suit of law was commenced which was so well defended on jonathans side that the doctor was nonsuited and costs were given to jonathan  this gave him a great reputation among his good friends the thieves who thought jonathan the best factor or agent they could employ so that his business so increased that it is thought he got two or three hundred pounds a year by commission  but it is no wonder he should thus by degrees increase in business and in fame for no man grows great at once having now engrossed the whole traffic of stolen goods to himself he became as useful to the thieves as they were to him for now by his credit they had a safe way of making money of every thing that fell into their hands whereas before they run as great hazzards of being discovered and brought to justice when they went about to dispose of their goods as they did in stealing them  but as the thieves first set him up only as their factor he by degrees made himself their master and their tyrant he divided the city and suburbs into wards or divisions and appointed the persons who were to attend each ward and kept them strictly to their duty he also called them to a very exact accuont and made them produce what they had got and though it were money he would have his dividend and it was no less than death to sink upon him as he termed it for there was scarce any thing stole which was worth having again but he heard of it and knew who the person must be that took it as well as those who lost it this is plain by what follows  some time since the duchess of tyrconnel being at mass at the chapel of his excellency count staremberg in the pall mall her grace in the height of her devotion had her gold watch stolen from her side which was entered next day in mr wilds office who assured her grace that the business was performed by a regular hand and therefore he doubted not the recovery of it fox alias vaux a dextrous fellow having his station about westminster hall the court of requests and at the cathedral and parochial churches wild was assured must be the man though he intending to bite jonathan of his share denied it obstinately at first but mr wild using menaces and threatening if he persisted to send him to his triangular home he confessed the bill and paid back as the thieves term it the watch to the duchess for twenty five guineas  however fond jonathan appeared to be of getting money he showed a generosity to his friends not common with people who practice the law of which i could give numberless instances particularly an acquaintance of his who lived in the mint having lost a gold watch for there were gold watches there sometimes he paid back the watch without one farthing expense he returned me a pocket book with some notes of value which i advertised in one of the papers gratis but gave me this caution to keep better company and one mr h  ll then a justice of the peace told me that once going to a country fair he met jonathan upon the road who gave him a watchword by using which he said if he met any of the prigs that were out in these hundreds he would pass safe mr giles tailor a tall attorney losing his snuff box he could not prevail with jonathan to trouble himself about such trivial things as he called it but mr tailor telling him he valued the box and withal reminded him that he used to come with briefs to his master counselor daniel whom he had the honor to serve in the quality of a footman o sir says wild i cry your mercy you have given me many a sixpence call in a day or two and you shall have your box again which was accordingly left for him at a tavern in the oldbailey without a fee  the wife of mr chiselden a famous surgeon having been robbed of a diamond buckle at the bath mr chiselden together with a creditable shopkeeper near the oldbayley waited on mr wild for his advice wild being very drunk received him with a great deal of rudeness not usual with him but he signified the cause of his disgust to him for he told the surgeon that he had dissected several honest fellows that were his friends and acquaintance and that he should be d  d before he should have his buckle again which he assured him was dissected and divided amongst the jolly fellows who had fairly ventured their lives for it and so dismissed mr chiselden  i mention these instances to show that jonathans practice was fairer than some other peoples and that he was capable of more honorable and friendly actions than those that made so great a noise of their charity their generosity etc it is certain as the elegant author of the weekly journal observes jonathan hated these pretenders to his art and called them the quacks of the profession which every science was pestered with  one time an accident happened to a gentlewoman at hackney who used to let lodgings a lady who came attended by a footman and a maid took a lodging in her house the first day they had possession of it they broke open a scrutore belonging to the gentlewoman of the house which was full of chince and muslin and very dexterously carried off the whole cargoe it was a great loss to the poor woman who lamenting with her neighbors they advised her to go to jonathan wild and offer a sum of money to recover it she went accordingly and when she gave him an account where she lived and what she had lost he called to his bookkeeper to search the books to know if any of their people had been lately out to take the air at hackney the fellow having examined answered immediately that wapping moll had been there and that tawny bess was her maid and harry smart her footman jonathan appeared in a passion and cursed them sufficiently but appointed the gentlewoman to come again in a little time when he procured the things upon her paying the money agreed for  thus he made them all pay contribution whether they made use of him in disposing of the things or no and when the late act was made which gives a pardon to one felon for convicting another he became absolute over them all for if any of them disobliged him or as he called it rebeld he took them up and thereby got the reward appointed by act of parliament for taking highwaymen on the contrary when any of his own people were taken which he had a mind to save then he endeavored to take some other then his own man by claiming the benefit of the act became an evidence when ever any interloping traders started up in the business that is people who set up for themselves without paying him any contribution or homage or holding any correspondence with him he did all he could to take them and if such were otherwise taken up upon suspicion or upon any information and evidence was wanting to convict them nothing was more common than for him to take up one of his own fellows whose life was always in his power and make him swear himself into some of the robberies of which the others were suspected whereby their evidence might obtain some credit with a jury and jonathan was entitled to the reward if he was the person who took them  and thus by taking some of his own gang now and then because they had disobliged him and apprehending others because they were not of his gang and hanging them in the manner before described he was reckoned a very useful man and was often called upon by the court to look at the prisoners and give them characters which seemed to have great weight at that time and sometimes by ingenious quirks or by managing the juries or evidences he has brought off some of his favorites who had been taken in the very facts for which they were committed as he did once by two fellows who having committed a robbery on the highway and several persons well mounted and armed happening to come by immediately they were pursued and taken with the gentlemens watches and rings about them and being forthwith carried before a justice of peace were committed to newgate within a day or two of the sessions jonathan whose wit seldom failed him at a pinch enquiring the names of the prosecutors went to them and asking them if they had not been robbed by such and such fellows now in newgate the gentlemen answered they had jonathan pretending a great spleen to those fellows who he said were the greatest rogues in the whole world and that he would have hanged them long ago if he could have found them and therefore begged of the gentlemen that he might assist them in managing the prosecution and he would engage the rascals should not escape the gentlemen very willing to have part of the trouble taken off their hands accepted his offer knowing mr wild to be a person very well skilled in those affairs accordingly they appointed to meet at a tavern in the old bailey on the morning which was appointed for the trial of these highwaymen when they met jonathan told them there was a great crowd in the court and that they had better stay there till the trial should begin which he said would not be till about three a clock in the afternoon in the mean time a dinner was bespoke to be ready at one and jonathan sent a man to wait in the court with orders to call them when the trial came on jonathan made such good use of his time that whether by putting something into the liquor or by fair drinking is not known but it is certain he made the gentlemen very drunk who passed away the time till evening without thinking of the matter at which time one of them wondering that their messenger had not called them they sent another to the court to know what was doing there when they found the court was broke up and the two highwaymen were discharged there having no evidence appeared against them  in an affair like this jonathan did not come off quite so well though the business was managed with equal success the story is this one arnold powell a notorious housebreaker was committed to newgate and a prosecution carrying on against him by one mr eastwick a glassgrinder near bridewell jonathan pays his respects to the prosecutor and acquaints him how ready he should be to bring such a villain to justice and if he would leave the matter to his handling he should certainly send him to sleep with the fathers for that was his expression accordingly mr eastwick commits the management of the suit to him and chose to be directed by him who he was satisfied had a better understanding in those affairs than himself  before the sessions jonathan though retained on the other side of the cause visits mr powell tells him of the dangerous circumstances he was in and at the same time enquires into the value of his personal estate the thief apprehended his meaning and made him sensible that forty pounds should not part them for it seems this fellow never came into jonathans books whereupon the bargain was struck the money paid down and mr wild left him with this blessing live and prosper  when the sessions came on a bill was found for felony and burglary against mr powell for breaking open and robbing the house of the said mr eastwick so far mr eastwick saw matters were carried fair when this was done mr wild desired the prosecutor and his witnesses to go to his house in the oldbayley that they might nor wait about in the sessions houseyard till the trial came on which they readily agreed to from thence jonathan carried them to an alehouse at the upperend of the street quite out of the hearing of the court and there plies them with liquors by one of his agents in the mean time he gets powell set to the bar and the witnesses called over and over time after time but no body appearing nor any account to be given why they did not the prisoner was acquitted  when mr eastwick found how the game had been played he complains to the recorder of the abuse who was very ready to do mr wild all the justice in the world and therefore commits him to newgate in order to be tried at the ensuing sessions for the offense and powell though acquitted then for want of evidence was detained in custody and convicted the next sessions perhaps for another fact and executed but honest jonathan alighted upon his legs like an expert tumbler and came off unhurt  however this was by discerning men looked upon to be a kind of a slur upon jonathans character he found himself that after this he had not that credit with the court upon the trial of any criminal as he used to have and he took as odd a way to retrieve it as ever was thought of for in order to insinuate himself into the good graces of the r  r he sets one of his gang to steal the velvet seats out of his coach and then waited upon him with a tender of his service to recover them without any expense to his honor but sir w  m despised his offer and generously chose rather to sit down with the loss than to recover them by giving countenance to such scandalous practices  by all the beforementioned tricks and artifices jonathan passed for a man of so much understanding and interest that the thieves began to think he could hang or save whom he pleased so that all malefactors whether of his own gang or not after they were taken used to flatter themselves that if they could raise any money for jonathan he would bring them off and even after they were condemned they were of opinion that his extraordinary interest might procure them a reprieve or have the sentence changed to transportation  it is certain that it was one of his arts to make them believe so and he used particularly to affect an extraordinary intimacy with certain justices of peace and as it is said he sometimes drank with those gentlemen at taverns he used to leave word at home that if any body should enquire for him he was gone to such a tavern to meet justice suchaone the use he made of insinuating this notion into their heads was that if any information should be given to these justices against any of his friends he should have timely notice of it from them or their clerks so that the party might get out of the way which was a material thing toward keeping his people always depending upon him  the reader will imagine by what has been here related that jonathan must be a person of no uncommon parts  to govern a commonwealth already fixed and established is no more than what may be done by any common capacity but to form and establish a body of such lawless people into what we may call a form of government to erect a commonwealth like that of the bees in which there should be no drone in which every member was obliged to go forth and labor and to bring an offering to him their king of part of the product of their cunning and industry to be able so many years to evade the punishments appointed by the laws of all nations for such persons as make no difference betwixt meum and tuum and to live not only in a toleration but even in a kind of credit amongst the people he was robbing every day and to escape the plots and conspiracies of his own treacherous subjects  i say to be able to manage all this must proceed from an admirable wit and cunning and thorough observation of the humors and weak sides of men  but to return to our subject we have taken notice in what manner jonathans revenues were raised and increased but as his subjects were so frequently taken off by untimely ends his royalty would by degrees have declined and sunk at last to little or nothing if he had not by admirable foresight and care provided future thieves both for himself and the gallows  the mint in southwark was the country where jonathan usually went to raise recruits when his army began to grow thin and weak there i say he constantly beat up for volunteers and most of his best men came from thence  he knew it was the place where tradesmen who had met with misfortunes first retired to that it was the constant retreat of all those whom idleness or extravagance had rendered obnoxious to the law  he knew also that people under those circumstances commonly brought a little money with them at their first going over which being soon spent by reason of their being out of business to get more they must of consequence be reduced to extreme necessity till which time he did not judge them rightly qualified for his service  as i was let into this secret of his proceedings by a story from his own mouth i shall relate the method and way he went to work with the gentlemen minters  first he made himself acquainted with all the people who kept public houses whether taverns alehouses or the venders of the royal liquor commonly called gin from these he learned from time to time what people were newly come over and if he liked the description of their persons and the account of their circumstances he took some opportunity of getting into company with them and jonathan being facetious as well as frank and open in conversation made himself very agreeable to those sort of people who are called merry fellows besides jonathan always pretended to compassionate their misfortunes and to show his generosity would treat them and make them drunk and sometimes perhaps lend them small matters in their extreme necessities  so that he has sometimes confessed that by half a crown well disposed that is lent with a certain manner of which he was master he has sometimes got fifty and sometimes a hundred pounds which it must be confessed was laying money out to a very good advantage  we shall prove this by an example  jonathan came acquainted with a b a broken cheesemonger who had taken refuge in the mint this poor fellow being charmed with the conversation of the ingenious jonathan spent the little money he had saved from the ruin of his trade in keeping him company when all was gone jonathan now and then lent him some small matter and observing him to be young active and a fellow of spirit worked upon him and brought him into his measures by representing to him the miserable prospect he had before him telling him he deserved to be damned if such a clever fellow as he should want good clothes on his back or money in his pocket and that all the world would despise him therefore says he take my advice and get money  the advice was good and seasonable for there was nothing in the world the poor fellow wanted more but how to do it was the difficulty  therefore he begged his friend jonathan to give him some advice in that important affair z  ds says jonathan i know a great many clever fellows who keep the best company in town and make very smart figures and if they have not sixpence in their pockets now they will have money enough before they go to bed that is if there be any money to be had betwixt this and bath or this and tunbridge  now the cheesemonger began to apprehend his friend jonathan and in his necessity and despair said he would do any thing but he had neither horse nor arms nor any means of purchasing them but jonathan who did nothing by halves directed him where good horses were to be hired for the use of the gentlemen of the snaffle and gave him as much money as would pay for the hire for he was too cunning to appear in the matter himself he also directed him to go upon the epsom road telling him there were no gentlemen out upon the same lay that way  and thus our cheesemonger was turned into a gentleman and equipped like a knight errant in search of adventures  after he had loiterd about the road for some time he saw one man a horseback coming toward him without any servant or attendance which proved to be a peaceable citizen him he ventured to stop and commanding him to deliver the citizen surrendered all the money he had without any words which proved to be nine guineas as soon as our new highwayman found himself in possession of the money he made the best of his way home to his kennel the mint without seeking any more adventures that day  he was no sooner alighted but he found jonathan who waited to receive him to whom he very frankly gave an account of what he had done and what he had got with all the circumstances thinking he had behaved himself very handsomely for a new beginner nay jonathan himself praised him and for his encouragement took from him but seven guineas of the nine leaving him two as a mark of his favor  perhaps some may be of opinion that this dividend was a little unequal and that he who ventured all should have had the greatest share of the booty but it must be considered on the other side that now he was initiated he was become the subject nay the slave of jonathan who had power of life and death over him and that so far from murmuring at what he took from him it was jonathans opinion he should think himself obliged to him that he did not hang him  the fellow continued every now and then to make excursions sometimes on one road sometimes on another constantly doing business by himself and if we may believe jonathan he always left the fellow some small matter of what he got whether it happened to be little or much but this we must take upon his credit but however that be the cheesemonger was so discontented that he resolved to desert and see what he could do for himself  accordingly some time after he disappeared nor could jonathan find him out by all the inquiry and search he could make jonathan railed loudly at him saying thus am i served by a parcel of rascals when i have put bread into their mouths but i will hang him if there was not another rogue left in england  while jonathan was thus enraged against the deserter some people who had been robbed upon the oxford road came to make proposals for the recovery of some watches and pocket books which had been taken from them jonathan consulted his books for it must be observed he was very exact in minuting down all his orders and found that no gentlemen under his command had been out upon the road for a fortnight before wherefore he was very inquisitive to know what sort of man the person was who had committed those robberies and according to their description and by other circumstances he was pretty sure it must be the deserting cheesemonger  jonathan therefore set out toward oxford well mounted and well armed intending to renew his acquaintance with his old friend who according to several reports had met with good luck upon that road he jogd on easily visiting all the villages which lay in the byroads both on the right and left going into every inn looking into the stables to see the horses and drinking with all the ostlers and chamberlains and enquiring of them what company was in each house and what company they lately had which was his constant method when he went in search of a deserter  he spent a good deal of time in this manner to no purpose when moving on toward oxford he met a coach which had been just robbed the coachman giving him warning to take care and telling him the place where they had been attacked was not above a quarter of a mile off upon this jonathan enquires the number of the people who had robbed them the coachman told him it was done by a single man and in describing him confirmed jonathan it must be his cheesemonger upon this assurance jonathan sets spurs to his horse and coming to the spot which had just before been the scene of action he hastes and takes a view of the ground like an experienced general and considering with himself what a man of any discipline would do after such an incident in order to puzzle and beguile his pursuers in case any hue and cry should be raised to pursue him he spied a lane upon the right hand and wisely concluded with himself that if the cheesemonger was a man of conduct he must have struck down that lane after he had finished his adventure therefore he doubled his pace and after a short gallop came in sight of a man in a great coat well mounted he judged now that he was come to the end of his enquiry and therefore slackened his pace that he might prepare himself for battle for jonathans courage was equal to his conduct the man before hearing the tread of a horse looked back but seeing no more than one man he thought it had not the appearance of a pursuit and therefore he never moved a step the faster and it was at such a distance that he did not know the sweet fiz of jonathan jonathan who was stuck round with pistols as thick as an orange with cloves or like the man in an old almanac with darts was not idle all this while but took care to be well cocked and primd which part he managed under his great coat for he took care to conceal his warlike appointment lest it might put the enemy into a posture of defense  as he approached nearer the man cast another look back and immediately knew it was jonathan upon which he faced about manfully and drawing his pistol bid jonathan stand off for he had done with him jonathan put on the foxs skin and employing all his oratory for he had an excellent talent at wheedling begged that they might be good friends and go and drink together swearing that he loved men of courage and that he desired nothing but that they might be good friends as before  but the valiant cheesemonger told him his mind in few words jonathan says he you have led me here into a damned trade which i am weary of and now i have got money in my pocket i am resolved to go over to holland and try to put my self into some honest business by which i may get my living without fear or danger jonathan having a pistol in his hand under his great coat which the other could not see still continued his wheedling and approaching nearer and nearer that he might have a sure mark he of a sudden drew forth his desperate hand and let fly a brace of bullets in the face of the valiant cheesemonger and drawing forth a sharp hanger at the same instant flew upon him like a tiger and with one blow felled him to his horses feet all weltring in his gore  so have i seen and with as little mercy a gallant ox felled to the ground by some fierce butcher and so like jonathan have i seen him bestride the mighty beast and strip him of his skin  jonathan thus having obtained a complete victory and being master of the field immediately fell to plundering  he found fifty odd guineas in the fellows pockets with some movables of value of which having taken livery and seisin according to the law of arms he went to the next town leading the horse of the slain in a kind of triumph as a mark of his victory and enquiring for the next justice of peace he surrendered himself telling him that he had killed a highwayman and giving a direction where he had left the body the justice sent and had it taken up when he was known by some stage coachmen and others to be the same that had infested that road for some time past jonathan at the same time signifying to the justice that he was the famous wild the thiefcatcher the justice took bail for him and jonathan returned home to his wife loaded with victory and plunder  i presume this story may suffice to let the reader know by what kind of policy this machiavel of thieves supplied his commonwealth with subjects as fast as they were cut off  those whom he observed to be active brisk and courageous he put into his cavalry there was another corpse which we may call his dragoons because they served sometimes on horseback sometimes on foot as was most consistent with the service these sometimes went forth doubly armed and on the wide extended common attacked the stage coach in open day other whiles they laid ambuscades and lying perdue in some ditch surpised the heedless traveller on foot and were counted his best men being as the saying is in utrumque parati or having two strings to their bow  but as jonathan was a deep studier of nature he knew that mens talents were different and that he who had not courage enough to bid a man stand upon the road might nevertheless make an excellent pickpocket and he took care that no mans parts should be misapplied nay it is said that nothing pleased him more than to see a child or youth of a promising genius and that such never wanted his encouragement insomuch that a little boy in a crowd having at a certain time stole a pair of silver buckles out of a mans shoes without being felt his mother not a little proud of her childs ingenuity presented him to jonathan who gave him half a crown with this prophetic saying my life on it he will prove a great man  but i must observe that jonathans prophecy never was fulfilled the youth dying before he came to the age of manhood for he was hanged before he arrived at sixteen  he had another sort of gentlemen under his command whom in the cant or language of the profession he distinguished by the name of spruce prigs these were persons not qualified for the bold and manly employment of knockingdown housebreaking etc but being persons of address and behavior were dispatched to court on birthnights to balls operas plays and assemblies for which purpose they were furnished with laced coats brocade wastcoats fine perriwigs and sometimes equipped with handsome equipages such as chariots with footmen in liveries and also valet de chambres the servants being all thieves like the master  this body of gentlemen were generally chosen out of such as had been footmen who by waiting at tables and frequenting public places with their masters and mistresses knew something of the address and discourse used among gentlemen and the better to qualify them to acquit themselves handsomely at balls jonathan sometimes paid a dancingmaster to teach them to dance that is after he lost his own dancingmaster the celebrated mr lun who died in his own profession viz dancing being hanged at kingston for a robbery on the highway who he sometimes said was a great loss to the corporation  there were another class of the same sort of gentlemen but who did not strike such bold strokes as the other or as we may say did not fly at such high game these appeared commonly like young mercers or drapers being always dressed very clean in plain cloth good wigs and good linen with a ring or rings on their fingers the places which they haunted most were sadlerswells and all the hops about the town they were also great practicers of the art of dancing and some of them were famous for hornpipes  their business was to promote countrydancing and while the young fellows and their girls were very earnest at their diversion they were to assist a confederate for nothing could be done without a partner to carry off the silver swords and canes if there were any whilst the dancer himself was to stand his ground always pretending to have lost a cane or hat amongst the rest and making the greatest clamor of all  the genteelest of these sort of gentlemen sometimes took handsome lodgings of two or three guineas a week and being attended by their sham servants these servants were to give out that their master was just returned from his travels that he was a peer or at least a baronet of a great estate and the better to carry on the bite they took care to assume the name of some person of great estate who was actually abroad  that his father or some relation being lately dead was the occasion of his coming over in haste to take possession of a great estate and that his lordship or honor would not appear nor have it known he was arrived till he had put himself and all his servants in mourning wherefore a draper was sent for and a vast quantity of fine cloth was agreed for not only for his own family but he was to give mourning to all his relations  the draper was generally recommended by the landlord who thought himself very happy in having such a customer as his lordship  as soon as the cloth came in it was immediately sent off being carried away by some accomplices who waited in the way and represented porters before the draper could come for his money  but if as it sometimes happened the draper came himself at the same time with the cloth why then his lordship was so busy in his closet that he could not speak to him but he sent him out a bankers note desiring him to give the rest but if the draper had not money enough about him then he was to go and receive the whole and bring his lordship the rest but as soon as his back was turned the whole posse moved off leaving generally an empty trunk or two to pay for the lodging  this trick has often been played in the streets betwixt the temple and somerset house the situation of those places being very commodious for making a retreat by water  jonathan one night at southwarkfair was observed to sit in one of the booths in a corner of the pit as much out of sight as he could and being asked by an acquaintance what he was doing there  see that beau says he in the sidebox pointing to a handsome young fellow who was very fine that is one of my people but the son of a whore has hid himself from me these two months but i will frighten him out of his wits and if you have a mind for a little sport go to the next tavern and i will divert you  we had not been there two minutes for i was one of the company when jonathan enters with sir fopling jonathan immediately with many oaths and menaces began to question him where he had been and what the d  l was the reason he had not come near him in all that time the beau in a very great fright swore and cursed and prayed all in a breath begging jonathan to forgive him telling him he could not help it having been in jail in lincolnshire where he went upon a very good lay that was his term for he went down there expecting to marry a lady of great fortune but that miscarrying that he might not lose his labor he spoke with a silver tankard and some spoons for which he was committed however he managed it so well by the assistance of nimble dick who personated his servant that nothing was found upon him and so the pimps discharged him not out of good will d  n them says he but for want of proofs but that he was upon a lay at that time if he would let him go that he was sure of getting a gold watch that night and swore upon his honor he would bring jonathan some money the next day  upon these protestations and promises and his paying for a bottle of wine jonathan let him go  when he was gone jonathan told us he was an ingenious pretty fellow and would live like a gentleman in any part of the world for that the last birthnight he went to court as fine as any thing there and no body knowing him he was taken for some young man of fortune just come to his estate his design being to pick the kings pocket but that he was hindered and interrupted by a certain lady a citizens wife who would not let him get near enough for the fondness she had of showing herself to his m  y however it cost her dear for she lost her repeating watch by the bargain  he told us that he had saved the young fellows life once by good management at his trial for he thought it was pity such a clever fellow should be cut off so soon and that he had done a great many handsome things since that time we desired to know of jonathan what the young fellow was originally he told us he was the son of a chairman who living with a lady of quality she put this young fellow when a boy into a livery that this lady loving her pleasures and being a woman of intrigue the boy got the reputation of being a very good pimp so that if his lady had not died he would have been made a page and then perhaps groom of the chamber and then recommended to my lord for some considerable post so that by this time he might have been a topping grandee if the death of the lady had not put an end to his hopes of rising that way for after her decease being out of place he had no thought or ambition of going into any way of getting his bread but by being a servant so that being nimble and light of body he practiced running thinking to get a running footmans place with some person of quality when i says jonathan happened to meet with him and thinking it a pity that such parts should be buried and lost to the world i took him into my protection and i warrant you will see him preferred one time or other  but though it is some years since this thing happened i was not long since informed by jonathan that the beau is still alive that he made a considerable figure at the last installment at windsor being the person who took the lady m  ns diamond buckle that when her ladyship applied to jonathan for the recovery of it he asked her how much she would give she answered twenty guineas z  nds madam says he you offer nothing it cost the gentleman who took it forty for his coach equipage and other expenses to windsor  jonathan gave us to understand that these gentleman often visited the bath tunbridge and epsom not staying long in a place but going from one to the other and always thrusting themselves into the best company their business there was to get watches and snuff boxes and whenever there happened a crowd on the walks or in the long rooms then it is these gentlemen work and if the things should happen to be missed while they are in the room the figure they make carries them off without being suspected but as has been before observed for fear of accidents there must be a footman not only for state but for use who to prevent the consequences of a search receives the booty from the master as soon as the work is done and conveys it to some place of safety  the footman in his way is a person of as great service to the commonwealth of thieves as the master he is to insinuate himself into the acquaintance of all the servants wherever he goes from them he is to learn all the circumstances and affairs of their respective masters and mistresses  as what plate they bring with them to those places of pleasure when they remove to town or to any other place and how they go attended which are very material advices for intelligence is sent of all these things to jonathan who takes care to have them spoke with upon the road if it be feasible and safe the footman is also to endeavor to corrupt some of the servants he converses with and if they are fellows who love mirth and good company they are often delighted with these fellows who study to please and they are by all means to come acquainted with the servant maids who live in good families and to make love to some one of them by these means they not only become acquainted with the situation of the house and know where all the plate and other rich movables are kept but if one of the damsels should happen to be captivated with the person of mr john or mr thomas or whatever name he takes she may be wrought upon to let him in at night and so a good prize may be got with little hazard and danger  jonathan told us the world was grown so peery that was his term for sharp that ingenious men meaning thieves must have recourse to stratagems or else they could not get bread for says he there are not so many opportunities of working as heretofore there are such a damned number of poor people more than formerly that are not worth robbing and those that have made them poor and got their money take so much care to keep it and are so well guarded that it is very difficult to come at them downright robbing or your chance jobs are not worth a farthing and i may say without vanity that if it had not been for the confederacy i have formed the business would have come to nothing but let them be as cautious and as cunning as they will well be more cunning than they  i will tell you a stratagem of some of the gentlemen i have the honor to command  there were a parcel of rich citizens who took a singular pleasure in ringing bells one day in the week they met and dined together and passed the rest of the day in ringing in summer time they traveled from place to place wherever they heard of a good ring of bells in order to divert themselves with ringing and to try where were the sweetest bells  one of our gentry found means of getting into their company and one night when they were pretty warm with wine and boasting of their great excellence in ringing our spark offered that he and five more he would bring should ring with them for two hundred guineas provided he was to name the bells they took him up immediately and entered into articles under the forfeiture of an hundred pounds to those that should fail who named lincoln cathedral where they agreed to meet by a certain day  our citizens set out some in their own coaches and some on horseback with two hundred guineas for their wager and each of them money besides for expenses and our spark with his confederates met them very punctually  the citizens immediately stripped themselves in order to put on their ringing dresses consisting of drawers wastcoats and caps and while they were beginning to try the bells one of our people conveyed away their clothes when the rest saw him safe out they stole off and mounted their horses which were ready and left the citizens to enjoy all their music themselves  this expedition was worth near three hundred pounds in money for all they carried was in their breeches pockets i say three hundred pounds besides watches snuff boxes tobacco boxes clothes and perriwigs  we owned to jonathan that this affair was well projected and as well executed oh says he this is nothing to what has been done for one of our people once stole a house of six rooms on a floor and an hundred and fifty pounds a year rent  as this appeared to be a kind of rhodomontade we desired mr wild to let us know how that could be done and he being very communicative in his temper told us the story a gentleman had fitted up a house in queenssquare in a very handsome manner expecting to let it to some foreign minister or english person of quality which as soon as twas ready i equipt a fellow who had proved himself a man fit for business in a plain neat suit goldheaded cane snuff box etc a good chariot with two other rogues for footmen this supposed gentleman calls upon the landlord and offers to treat with him for the hire of his house which he said if he liked his terms he would take a lease of for twenty one years whereupon the bargain was struck and in few days the leases were drawn the rent to be paid at half yearly payments and the furniture was promised by the squire to be brought in the wednesday following  the week after the landlord calls at the house to see his new tenant in order to promote a more intimate acquaintance but finds no body there but a shabby old man and not one piece of furniture but on the contrary two or three of the marble chimney pieces and slabs taken down he enquires of the old man the meaning of it who told him his master ordered it for he did not like the fashion of em and was pleased to have them altered the landlord swore and stormed like a madman bid him get out of the house and vowed neither he nor his master should have any thing to do there but at length was pacified upon his assuring him his master designed nothing but what was honorable and would make him all the satisfaction he could desire and that the next day at noon he would come himself and direct what he would have done whereupon he went away but not very well pleased you may be sure and returning the next day as the fellow had appointed he meets some men at the door carrying out two chimneyglasses and several pictures that had been fixed to the pannels over the chimneypieces which he stopped but the squire happening himself to be in the house but without his chariot or footmen required to know by what authority he stopped the goods from going where he sent them why sir says the landlord are they not my own what would you pull my house down before my face and send it g  knows where why is not your own furniture brought home as you appointed sir says the tenant i have had two children sick of the smallpox which hindered me from moving so soon as i expected but tomorrow some of my goods will be here but what are you doing replies the landlord with these that you send away why says he i am for fitting up things according to my own fancy and i dont matter the expense of it for as i alter the chimneypieces to another form the glasses must be made to answer them and the frames of the pictures i shall have made wider to square with the glasses when i fitted up this house says the landlord i thought it might have served any man of quality in the kingdom that might be said the squire again i will have things done agreeable to my own humor for all that when your rents due i will pay it and when my lease is expired i shall leave the house in as good condition as i have found it  the landlord finding it in vain to oppose him and withal that he had promised that some of his goods would certainly be brought to the house the next day which he hoped would be some security for what he might possibly suffer by the alterations the tenant was making he waited till then and came again to the house but was still more provoked to see that all the furniture that was brought consisted of two old chairs and a table not worth half a crown and they had in the mean time been so expert in making the alterations as they called it that they had took down a very fine new staircase and the wainscot of the best room whereupon the landlord finding himself really tricked arrests the tenant in an action of  00 l but i got my gentleman bailed and ordered my attorney to summon the plaintiff before a judge to show cause of action which he failing to do was obliged to take common bail but this not answering his purpose for in reality the defendant owed him nothing the landlord files a bill in the exchequer upon which the tenant prefers a cross bill obliging him to answer to several points particularly the letting the house to him which as he could not deny the landlords bill was dismissed with costs of suit and the suit at common law went against him also by default and the tenant going to work again upon the premises the landlord thought fit to make overtures of agreement viz that upon a surrender of his lease and giving up the possession of the house in the condition it was then in he would pay all his charges and release him from all damages whatsoever which since there was no more to be got by my consent the terms were accepted of and so the landlord besides a year and a halfs rent sat down at  00 l loss which i suppose will make him take a little more care how he lets his houses  at one time the stealing shopkeepers accountbooks was grown a considerable branch of trade of which jonathan gave us one instance which is worth relating  a merchant a considerable dealer in hops in thames street had his books stole and applying to me offered ten guineas to have them restored the prigs says he were in my ken that nimd em out of his swag to explain this language it means that the thieves were then in his house that stole them out of the shop but to go on with the story in plain terms jonathan went into the room where they were and made the report but they sitting in council with two or three others of the same squadron though not in that detachment declared that they thought the books were really worth twenty that is to return to the owners which jonathan notifyd to the merchant but in short the agreement was fifteen but then arose a dispute about the delivery jonathan proposed that he should leave the money behind him and the books be brought to his house which he scrupling jonathan said to him sir do you question my honor i scorn to do an ill thing by any man no sir answered he by no means and then readily laid down the money and went his way and before he got home himself the books were at his house which serves to show how far jonathans honor was to be depended on  within three weeks the same gentleman came to jonathans house upon the very same business for his shopbooks were gone again and he would fain have had five guineas bated this time because of his having been a customer before but jonathan said twas nothing to him if the gentleman says he will take five shillings i shall agree to it so in short he paid down his money like a fair dealer and was going home as before but jonathan called him back and asked him how and in what part of his shop his counting house was built he told him twas next the street and the door opened withinside behind the counter why says jonathan you are quite wrong you will never keep your books if that is the case but i will come to morrow my self and see it and then i will advise you what is proper to be done  the next day jonathan comes to thames street the books having been sent before and meets with the merchant at home he takes a survey of the whole affair and advises the old counting house to be pulled down and a new one to be erected at the farther end of the shop and to break out a skylight over head this he said would be the only contrivance to make all safe which was done according to jonathans model and yet hardly a month happened before it was again attacked with the like success and cost him the same sum over again to get it out of jonathans purgatory the manner of the adventure is as follows a gentleman well dressed watched his opportunity and came into the shop and asked if mr  was at home whereupon he was told that he himself was the person sir says he i have two or three words to speak with you in private and so walks him toward his counting house the hopmerchant goes in first expecting the gentleman would have followed in order to declare his business to him there but instead of that he only reaches out his hand to the desk upon which the abovementioned books lay and takes them away and at the same instant shuts to the door locks it upon the hopdealer and walks off very leisurely  jonathan about this time had one of his best hands deserted him and yet the fellow still did business as mr wild found by his books and the accounts that came in jonathans clerk minuted down a gold watch a pair of diamond earrings with several other things of less value which were made that is stole in their language by this fellow and yet he had missed several musters and jonathan nor any of his people had heard one syllable of him for above three months any otherwise than that such and such things were spoke with which he knew must be by the devil or this rascal he said therefore twas time to take him off whereupon jonathan was continually upon the hunt for him but as he kept company with no other of the profession it was a difficult matter for his master to get intelligence of him without his grand masters assistance but whether the devil did really put it into his servant jonathans head or what other way he found it out i cannot say but true it is that at length he got certain information where he then lodged  mr wild had my lord chief justices warrant in his pocket so taking two or three constables with him about four in the morning he beset the house which was in bishopsgatestreet the corner of  street a publickhouse jonathan headed the posse with a pistol in each hand and up stairs he goes to his room though not so silently but that he heard them upon the stairs and therefore he gets up and puts on his breeches shoes and stockings by that time jonathan had wrenchd open the door for it was locked within side upon sight of whom he gave a spring out of the window which was one story high and came down into a little yard from thence leaped over a wall into the street and ran cross the way into a linendrapers house whose door happened to stand open at that time the servants of the house were washing below stairs to whom the fellow begs for protection for that he was pursued by bailiffs and if he should be taken he must be inevitably ruined and undone the poor credulous women pitied the mans case and told him he should stay with them till the bloodsucking villains were gone to return to jonathan and the constables as soon as they saw their man fly out of the window you may be sure they were not long behind him but as much haste as they made down stairs they saw not the least shadow of him neither in the yard or in the street which prodigiously surpised them all but jonathan peerd about being satisfied his motion from the window was downwards therefore he must have taken house somewhere and at last spied this linendrapers door open he goes over acquaints the gentleman with what had happened and assures him the rogue could be no where but in his house he said he had seen no such person and that he had not been from the shop above a minute sir says jonathan that was the very time he slipped in give me leave to search for him which being granted he went into the washhouse where for a good while they denied they saw any such person till being informed he was no debtor but a highwayman and housebreaker they owned the matter and told mr wild the man he looked for was in the coalhole under the stairs whereupon he takes a candle calls all his myrmidons about him and into the coalhole he goes but no highwayman was there then he searches round the cellar kitchen and in short every place where he thought a man could be concealed but no body was to be seen jonathan owned he never was so foiled in all the course of his practice before he came up and told the master of the house there was no body there the washerwomen were frightened out of their wits believing they had seen a spirit and all looked very foolish upon one another till the linendraper gave them to know that if any man went down stairs he must be there still for he was sure no body had come up from thence he having staid in sight ever since and then persuaded jonathan to go down again and look into all the washingtubs and search every place over again for there is says he no other way to get out but up these stairs and so into the street  mr wild was prevailed upon at last and he and the constables with his guard de corpse redescended and finding one of the tubs standing bottom upwards they turned that up as the gentleman had put it into their heads and there they found poor culprit jonathan had no patience but flew upon him like a tiger you treacherous dog said he where are the diamond earrings and goldwatch you stole at such a place g  d  n me you villain you cheating son of a whore i will hang you if there is never another rogue in england you vile rascal  we must remark here that though jonathan in the main used to talk up the gentlemen of his game to be generally bright clever fellows yet when he was angry with some of them he would own there were scoundrels of the profession  notwithstanding this bounce of jonathans the prisoner understood how to soften this machiavels temper and thereupon whispered him to go up to his lodging and look behind the head of the bed which jonathan did telling the people of the house he must go up stairs for the fellows clothes which he brought down along with him and in a hole where the thief directed him to he found a gold watch two silver ones rings and other things of value which he put into his own pocket for any body else would not have known what to have done with them and the prisoner being carried before the justice was committed on suspicion of felony and the next sessions no body appearing against him he was discharged  the success that jonathan went on with in his business rendered him famous all over london and he made use of several little arts to make himself appear considerable to distant parts of the kingdom particularly by some printers of newspapers and dyingspeeches whom he prevailed on to give him a character therein in which he was generally styled thiefcatchergeneral of great britain his house was handsomely furnished and set out with plate pictures etc and when his wife appeared abroad it was generally with a footman in a fine laced livery he kept a country house dressed well and in company affected an air of grandeur a little before his catastrophe he promised me a haunch or a side of venison whenever i pleased to send to him saying he had two parks at his command well stocked with deer  the wealth that he was supposed to have amassed by this business made several persons look upon him with envy and some well enough acquainted in the roguish arts attempted to set up against him a few years ago the principal were one felt  n a superannuated thief riddlesd  n an attorney and thief whose chief merit for the support of his pretensions to this practice was his having sacrilegiously and feloniously broke open the royalchapel at white hall and stole thence the communionplate and mr h  n city mar  l this last and jonathan wrote pamphlets against each other as it was the custom then between great men but jonathan laying himself too open h  n dropped the pen and took up the cudgels of the law with which he banged jonathan so that he thought fit to buy his peace at the price of a sum of money  however none of them all was able to give jonathan any notable disturbance in his office on the contrary he found means soon after to get riddle  n transported for not complying with the conditions of his pardon to make felt  n run mad and h  n entirely to quit his pretensions  wherefore he turned himself again to his business  and as we were enumerating how many species of thieves he had under his command we shall resume that part of our story  there were another sort of gentry under his command whose business it was to loiter about the streets in the daytime and as servants who go of short errands to a chandlers shop or bakers are apt to leave the door a jar as they call it they were to whip in and seize upon the next thing that was portable and bring it off they generally peeped in to see that no body was in the foreparlours and if by chance any body should surprise them they were ready to enquire if some person with a strange name did not live there though it seldom falls out so because they generally do their business in a minute  these sort of people sometimes go in liveries and sometimes dressed like ticket porters with silver badges either upon their coats or about their necks one of them some time since whipped into a house in king street near longacre which is divided into tenements the people furnishing their own lodgings and going directly up two pair of stairs from whence he saw a woman who inhabited it come down he easily put back the lock and finding nothing in the room of any value except the bedding he tied it all up and was carrying it off when the owner happened to meet him at the lower end of the stairs and asking him where he was carrying that bedding he answered without hesitation that he brought it from mr  the upholsterer and was carrying it to such a one but i find they dont live here oh says the woman they live at next door thank you mistress says the fellow and before she got up stairs to find it was her own bedding he had got into a hackney coach and carried it safe off  these people sometimes went disguised like chairmen in great coats and harness and a couple of them meeting together stole the young duchess of marlboroughs chair as her grace was visiting at mrs h  ns in piccadilly her chairmen and footmen being gone to a neighboring alehouse one of her servants thought immediately of applying to mr wild who told him that if he would leave ten guineas he might have the chair the next day the man made some difficulty of leaving the money beforehand but mr wild told him he was a man of honor and scorned to wrong him and indeed his character was by this time established as a man that dealt honorably in his way so that the man ventured at last to leave the money wherefore mr wild bid him direct the dutchesss chairmen to attend the morning prayers at lincolns innchapel and there they should find the chair which the fellows did accordingly and they found the chair with the crimson velvet cushions and damask curtains all safe and unhurt  and it must be observed that whenever jonathan obliged the parties to leave the money beforehand he very punctually complied with the terms of agreement as to the delivery of the goods for one of his common sayings was that honesty was the best policy  he frequently drew out detachments of some of his cleverest fellows whom he sent out upon command to country fairs upon which occasion he generally marched out himself for indeed the service could not be well carried on without him for the common people seeing jonathan there were the more careless because he always gave out that he came to take some rogues whom he suspected to be there and the people had a notion that his presence frightened away the thieves and to countenance this belief he went doubly and trebly armed and often wore armor under his clothes which he took care to show in all companies being attended by three or four and sometimes half a dozen terrible looking fellows by way of guard du corpse as if all thieves in england had vowed to sacrifice him  this grimace took very well for it gave him an opportunity of protecting and carrying off the booty which was made in these fairs and if any of his party was in danger of being taken these myrmidons of his who passed for his body guard were to run into the crowd and under pretense of assisting the people who were about to seize such rogues were to try to shuffle off and favor their escape  in fine his business in all things was to put a false gloss upon things and to make fools of mankind which was his own expression yet when he had a mind to be merry to drink his bottle and to laugh at the world he talked with too much freedom of himself and his own management and not without some vanity of which there are a thousand instances we shall give one because it is short  a certain tradesman a very honest man though of jonathans acquaintance going into a tavern where he expected to meet some company by mistake went in where jonathan was drinking with some merry fellows the tradesman was about to draw back but jonathan pressed him to sit down and take a glass with them the tradesman was a little angry with jonathan for the following reason about a week before passing through a country fair he saw jonathan a horseback and asking him how he did jonathan damned him and bid him not trouble him with impertinent questions therefore the tradesman desired to know the reason why jonathan snappd him up in that rude angry manner when he had spoke to him so civilly z  ds says jonathan you disturbed me in my business for i had at that time twenty pair of hands at work  and indeed he employed hands in all sorts of works so that according to the author of the fable of the bees he was a great benefactor to trade for as some of our news papers have observed he kept in pay many artists for the altering of watches and rings so he also kept a kind of magazine or armory of all kind of instruments used in thievery as picklocks files saws and engines for forcing doors windows etc which he made no secret of showing pretending he found them upon such and such housebreakers whom he had taken and convicted though it is certain he did not suffer them to grow rusty for want of use for he never went into a house but like an engineer he would view on which side it might be attacked with the most advantage and he knew better things than to send his men upon actions without arms  sometimes jonathan spoke in the style of a prince as when the son of mrs knap who was murdered by a footpad near graysinnwall went to him to desire his assistance in taking the murderer and putting ten guineas in his hand for his encourgement with a promise of forty more when the work should be done jonathan answered him gravely he might depend he would produce the villian for says he i never pardon murder  and indeed he was as good as his word for he seized the fellow at the jeruasalem tavern in clerkenwell and he was hanged the sessions following  whilst he went on with this tide of success and seemed to carry the world before him an ill wind arose which blew from a certain corner of the law and which seemed to threaten the overthrow of his commonwealth  for sir w  m t  son observing what mischiefs arose from the practice of receiving stolen goods and returning them again to the proprietors for such sums of money as the receiver and proprietor agreed upon which money no doubt must be divided betwixt the receiver and thief thought of putting an end to it by bringing a bill into the house of commons for the more effectual transporting of felons and for preventing burglaries and felons in which among other things was the following clause  and whereas there are several persons who have secret acquaintance with felons and who make it their business to help persons to their stolen goods and by that means gain money from them which is divided between them and the felons whereby they greatly encourage such offenders be it enacted by the authority aforesaid that wherever any person takes money or reward directly or indirectly under pretense or upon account of helping any person or persons to any stolen goods or chattles every such person so taking money or reward as aforesaid unless such person do apprehend or cause to be apprehended such felon who stole the same and cause such felon to be brought to his trial for the same and give evidence against him shall be guilty of felony and suffer the pains and penalties of felony according to the nature of the felony committed in stealing such goods and in such and the same manner as if such offender had himself stole such goods and chattels in the manner and with such circumstances as the same were stolen  we are well informed that after this act had passed the r  r was pleased to send for wild to admonish him and let him know the danger and hazard of pursuing the same course of life any longer and recommended to him to detect rogues and bring them to justice promising upon that condition to give him all encouragement reminding him of what considerable sums he had got that way already by which he might judge that he might get sufficient to keep him by doing good service to the public and living honestly  whether these good admonitions or the fear of this new law wrought upon his conscience is uncertain but there was a sudden damp put upon all his business his books were shut up for some weeks and he grew so abstemious that he refused several sums offered him for the recovery of things stolen  yet he did not break off all acquaintance and correspondence with his old friends and allies the thieves on the contrary having the command of some money he gave them some small matters just what he pleased for what old nick had sent them in their way and deposited the goods up in a wareheouse  in the mean time all wilds acquaintance were inquisitive to know what he intended to turn himself to for they took it for granted that this new act had quite cut him out of his former business having a notion that he was too cunning ever to venture himself within the clutches of the law  wherefore he talked of a new project which was for setting up a policy and opening an office for taking in subscriptions for insuring against robbery pretending to settle a sufficient fund and give good security for the performance of articles sometimes showing a manuscript paper of proposals and consulting people whom he supposed to have any understanding in those affairs extolling the great use and advantage this project would be to the public not doubting he said but that all trading people as well as gentlemen and noblemen who kept great quantities of plate in their houses would for their own sakes encourage so useful an undertaking bragging that it was no southseabubble and that he could fairly make a great fortune by it  whether he gave out this report only to amuse people and to hinder them from enquiring any farther into his affairs or whether he was in earnest and thought to bring it to bear i cannot tell but the thing was generally received as a banter or as a piece of mr wilds wit and no farther steps were taken in it  it was about this time that he projected the carrying on a trade to holland and flanders and thereupon purchased a sloop and put in one roger j  son to command her who had long been one of jonathans clever fellows he carried over gold watches rings plate and now and then a bank or goldsmiths note that had been spoke with by the way of the mail his chief trading port was ostend where he is particularly well known from thence he usually traveled up to bruges ghent brussels and other great towns where he brought his toys and jewels to market and then returned to his sloops took in a lading of hollands and other goods and came back to the river of thames  it is not to be expected that jonathan and roger would let any one share in the profits of such an honorable profession it would have been inconsistent with their practice who never paid for any thing to pay custom that would have been reflected upon as idle and foolish no the cargoe came generally safe to land the first night and at a certain house within forty miles of newingtonbuts most part of the dark business was acted where councils were secretly held and the projects formed but i hope from what has happened some persons who are well known will have prudence to take warning since i can assure them that their actions are sifting into by persons of no small penetration and whom they are not entire strangers to  but to return from this digression roger drove on the business abovementioned but two years which was owing to an accident that he himself was the occasion of it happened that by some negligence or other two pieces of holland were lost in the shipping them for england which when he arrived he stopped out of his mates wages making him pay for the whole loss this so provoked the mate that he went immediately and gave information of jon  ns running such quantities of goods whereupon the vessel was exchequerd in the river and he was obliged to stand a trial with the king in which he was cast in  00 l damages and so his trade was put an end to in that particular way  this stop brought jonathan again to consideration he soon missed his returns from ostend and having three wives living and always a seraglio of mistresses no less than half a dozen at a time to maintain according to his rank and being frequently importuned and teased by people who had been robbed to help them to their goods he ventured to dabble a little again but with great caution and for none but such as he took to be men of honor every now and then bringing in an offering to the gallows of some idle rascal who did not mind his business and who according to his notions was fit for nothing but hanging  finding no bad consequence to proceed from his new practice it made him bolder and bolder so that he began to think he might go on as before and that he should be connived at in a small time carrying on his trade with very little caution he went publicly down to the late instalment at windsor accompanied by his lady madam wild attended by a couple of footmen in laced liveries and the detachment he commanded down upon that occasion made as good a figure both for dress and equipage as any people there  as there was a very great booty brought off safe from that expedition mr wild had more than ordinary court made to him by people of fashion of both sexes who solicited hard to have their jewels watches etc returned upon a reasonable composition and his open way of treating upon this occasion was the most impudent thing he ever did in contempt of the late act  he proceeded fo far as to break off with several people because they would not come up to his terms and he considerably advanced the price of stolen goods for whereas at first he took no more for any thing of plate than its value in weight now he would make people pay something for the fashion also otherwise they should never have them intending to send them over to holland where they might come to a better market   yet no prosecution followed all these daring proceedings which made him think no doubt that he could do any thing yet he had not long ago a narrow escape as we shall show by the following relation  jonathan sitting one day at an inn in smithfield observed a large trunk in the yard and imagining there might be some things of value therein he immediately went home and ordered one rann a notorious acquaintance to habit himself like a porter and to endeavor to speak with it rann obeys his masters commands and accordingly succeeds the trunk belonged to mr jarvis a whipmaker in that neighborhood who was sending it down to a dealer in the country there was in it a great quantity of rich linen and other things for a wedding upon mr jarviss applying to wild after many delays he had most of the goods again for ten guineas but soon after wild and rann falling out he got him hanged and the day before his execution he sent for mr jarvis and related to him the above particulars but mr jarvis dying soon after jonathan had the good luck to hear no more of the matter  but now it being decreed by providence that jonathan should reign no longer he was infatuated to do a thing which brought on his destruction  certain persons having information where a considerable quanty of rich goods lay supposed to be stolen obtained a warrant for the seizure of them which was accordingly done though jonathan did not go and claim the goods as his own he had the assurance to take out an action in the name of roger johnston to whom he pretended the goods belonged and arrested the person or persons who seized them thus he pretended to recover those goods by law for possessing which if they were found upon him the law would hang him   a proceeding so barefaced and impudent put certain persons upon finding out means of bringing so sturdy a rogue to justice jonathan was threatened loud which occasioned a report all over the town that he was fled from justice upon which occasion he published a bullying advertisement in some of the news papers offering a reward of ten guineas to any person who should discover the author of such a scandalous report at the same time he run into all public places to show himself and let the world see that he was not run away as was reported  yet in the midst of all this blustering he was seized and committed to newgate  there are some other circumstances in this story but as we had it only from his own mouth that he was malicious against the persons concerned and endeavored to asperse them we shall say no more of it  how far roger john  n was concerned with wild at the time of his apprehension i leave the world to judge when immediately upon his being committed to newgate an express was sent over and john  n with another of the trade came down to ostend and appeared like persons of quality told the news to all about him and swore he would hang both jonathan and the b  who calls her self his wife so he takes a packet and hires her for dover where he arrived but as he has hot appeared publicly in london we may very well suppose that the hanging of them was the least part of his business  we cannot forbear observing something remarkable in the fate of this fellow first that he had opportunities of escaping after he knew that a prosecution was designed against him and secondly that the fact for which he died was committed whilst he was a prisoner in newgate for he was so blind as to imagine that the taking but ten guineas for the recovery of the lace when the woman offered fifteen or twenty and refusing to accept of any thing for his own trouble and also that palliating speech he made her that he did these things only to serve poor people who had been wronged would have been circumstances in his favor when he should come to be tried not considering that he directly by this action incurred the penalty of the act of parliament before quoted which is a proof that all his former cunning and sagacity forsook him when he wanted it most and makes good that saying  quem jupiter vult perdere dementat prius  jupiter first takes away the understanding of him whom he has a mind to destroy  i believe no malefactor ever stood his ground so long committing every day acts of felony in sight of the world so that i have heard him compute that in fifteen years he had received near ten thousand pounds for his dividend of stolen goods returned living all this while in riot and voluptuousness  but vengeance at length overtook him and from the minute of his being seized his sense and resolution failed nor was he spirited up by the hopes of a reprieve which some people endeavored to flatter him with and industriously spread such a rumor about whilst they were trembling lest it should be so because he and they are supposed to be no strangers to each others practices  we shall not trouble the readers with any thing which has already been made public concerning this extraordinary fellow who has made so much noise in the world therefore we shall conclude with observing that whoever had seen him in the gaiety of his life when all his rogueries were successful and had also been witness of his deplorable state of mind after his condemnation might have drawn a lesson of morality from it which perhaps might have been of use to an atheist  i say to have seen one remarkable for the gaiety of his temper for a vast depth of cunning as well as hardness and personal courage so changed at the apprehensions of his approaching death and the great account which is to follow to have seen him under the greatest distractions and horrors of mind that human nature is capable of suffering would be convinced that virtue only can give true tranquillity and nothing can support a man against the terrors of death but a good conscience  a true copy of a paper written by jonathan wild on saturday the   th day of may      and designed to have been delivered by him at the place of execution to the reverend mr edwards but was prevented by the draught of opium he took the night before his death in the condemned hold of newgate it having pleased almighty god in his justice to put an end to a most vicious and wicked course of life by a shameful and ignominious death the world will expect some account of my real sentiments and behavior under so great a vicissitude  such as expect any extraordinary discoveries and confessions from me will be disappointed for my affairs are too much confused and my mind too sadly perplexed to give me room to satisfy the curious in a particular manner neither do i believe it would be of any public advantage except to some few printers and publishers  let it suffice that i have gone on in a long series of dreadful guilt and no crime treason murder and sodomy excepted escaped me for which gods vengeance has now overtaken me my rash zeal to serve mr johnson by directing an action to be brought for the recovery of his effects has facilitated my fate and utterly undone me by putting me into the hands and power of my enemies that i had previous notice of their designs and of warrants being issued against me is too notorious to be contested and i might have escaped far enough out of their reach many times if i had thought my self in any danger but i am equally surprised with the rest of the world who never thought matters could have been carried to this height against me  the methods i took for to procure a respite and protract the time of my execution were no other than what is natural enough to poor wretches under the dreadful sentence of death and what has been often practiced by malefactors of much greater rank and quality than my self i mean my pretending to discover the persons that robbed the exchequer but the government was wiser and knew better things than to be imposed on by so mean and despicable a criminal  as mr recorder was pleased at my trial to say that the clause in the act of parliament by which i now fall was directly levelled against me and that himself had frequently admonished me against acting in contempt of the same i do not pretend to deny it but presuming on the services i did the public by apprehending and bringing to justice great numbers of robbers at the apparent hazard of my life i hoped that law might have been dispensed with and those services balance the inconveniences arising from my recovering stolen goods and indeed it was upon this foundation that i all along acted  i return thanks to my neighbors and others who did so readily attend at the sessions house to have testified for my demeanor amongst them if there had been occasion for it and to all other persons whatsoever who have assisted me in my misery and wished well to me  and particularly my dying thanks to the reverend dr knight the reverend mr nicholson and the reverend mr purney for the great comforts their christian labors have brought to my soul and to all others who have charitably assisted me to undergo this great conflict with a christian fortitude  the reason i have to expect ill treatment from the poplulace gives me much uneasiness and strikes me with great terror the barbarous insults i met with from them after my receiving sentence of death at the sessions house i believe were such as never was shown before to a person in my circumstances in no country upon earth i freely forgive them and all the rest of my enemies whatsoever hoping to meet with forgiveness for all my enormous crimes and offenses from the great god of mercy and truth whom i have broughout the whole course of my life grievously offended lord have mercy upon me lord receive me  jonathan wild  finis
