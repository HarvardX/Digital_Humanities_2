diary with passages from an autobiography these are loose fragments of journal in the handwriting of john adams upon scraps of paper scarcely legible from    november      to  0 november      they were effusions of mind committed from time to time to paper probably without the design of preserving them selfexaminations at once severe and stimulative reflections upon others sometimes not less severe upon his friends thoughts such as occur to all some of which no other than an unsullied soul would commit to writing mingled with conceptions at once comprehensive and profound j q a          november    we had a very severe shock of an earthquake it continued near four minutes i then was at my fathers in braintree and awoke out of my sleep in the midst of it the house seemed to rock and reel and crack as if it would fall in ruins about us chimneys were shattered by it within one mile of my fathers house         january    reading hutchesons introduction to moral philosophy dined with major chandler    sunday heard mr maccarty  february    i am constantly forming but never executing good resolutions i take great pleasure in viewing and examining the magnificent prospects of nature that lie before us in this town if i cast my eyes one way i am entertained with the savage unsightly appearance of naked woods and leafless forests in another place a chain of broken and irregular mountains throws my mind into a pleasing kind of astonishment but if i turn myself round i perceive a wide extensive tract before me made up of woods and meadows wandering streams and barren plains covered in various places by herds of grazing cattle and terminated by the distant view of the town     thursday heard mr welman preach the lecture and drank tea with him at home where he made this observation namely that dr mayhew was a smart man but he embraced some doctrines not generally approved     friday supped at major gardiners and engaged to keep school at bristol provided worcester people at their ensuing march meeting should change this into a moving school  not otherwise major greene this evening fell into some conversation with me about the divinity and satisfaction of jesus christ all the argument he advanced was that a mere creature   or finite being could not make satisfaction to infinite justice for any crimes and that these things are very mysterious thus mystery is made a convenient cover for absurdity    sunday staid at home reading the independent whig  very often shepherds that are hired to take care of their masters sheep go about their own concerns and leave the flock to the care of their dog so bishops who are appointed to oversee the flock of christ take the fees themselves but leave the drudgery to their dogs that is curates and understrappers    monday we have the most moderate winter that ever was known in this country for a long time together we have had serene and temperate weather and all the roads perfectly settled and smooth like summer the church of rome has made it an article of faith that no man can be saved out of their church and all other religious sects approach to this dreadful opinion in proportion to their ignorance and the influence of ignorant or wicked priests still reading the independent whig oh that i could wear out of my mind every mean and base affectation conquer my natural pride and selfconceit expect no more deference from my fellows than i deserve acquire that meekness and humility which are the sure mark and characters of a great and generous soul subdue every unworthy passion and treat all men as i wish to be treated by all how happy should i then be in the favor and good will of all honest men and the sure prospect of a happy immortality    wednesday spent an hour in the beginning of the evening at major gardiners where it was thought that the design of christianity was not to make men good riddlesolvers or good mysterymongers but good men good magistrates and good subjects good husbands and good wives good parents and good children good masters and good servants the following questions may be answered some time or other namely—where do we find a precept in the gospel requiring ecclesiastical synods convocations councils decrees creeds confessions   oaths subscriptions and whole cartloads of other trumpery that we find religion encumbered with in these days    thursday no man is entirely free from weakness and imperfection in this life men of the most exalted genius and active minds are generally most perfect slaves to the love of fame they sometimes descend to as mean tricks and artifices in pursuit of honor or reputation as the miser descends to in pursuit of gold the greatest men have been the most envious malicious and revengeful the miser toils by night and day fasts and watches till he emaciates his body to fatten his purse and increase his coffers the ambitious man rolls and tumbles in his bed a stranger to refreshing sleep and repose through anxiety about a preferment he has in view the philosopher sweats and labors at his book and ruminates in his closet till his bearded and grim countenance exhibits the effigies of pale want and care and death in quest of hard words solemn nonsense and ridiculous grimace the gay gentleman rambles over half the globe buys one thing and steals another murders one man and disables another and gets his own limbs and head broke for a few transitory flashes of happiness is this perfection or downright madness and distraction  0 friday symptoms of snow writing tillotson     saturday snow about ankle deep i find by repeated experiment and observation in my school that human nature is more easily wrought upon and governed by promises and encouragement and praise than by punishment and threatening and blame but we must be cautious and sparing of our praise lest it become too familiar and cheap and so contemptible corporal as well as disgraceful punishments depress the spirits but commendation enlivens and stimulates them to a noble ardor and emulation    sunday suppose a nation in some distant region should take the bible for their only lawbook and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited every member would be obliged in conscience to temperance and frugality and industry to justice and kindness and charity   towards his fellow men and to piety love and reverence towards almighty god in this commonwealth no man would impair his health by gluttony drunkenness or lust no man would sacrifice his most precious time to cards or any other trifling and mean amusement no man would steal or lie or in any way defraud his neighbor but would live in peace and good will with all men no man would blaspheme his maker or profane his worship but a rational and manly a sincere and unaffected piety and devotion would reign in all hearts what a utopia what a paradise would this region be heard thayer all day he preached well spent the evening at colonel chandlers with putnam gardiner thayer the doctor  and his lady in conversation upon the present situation of public affairs with a few observations concerning heroes and great commanders—alexander charles xii cromwell    tuesday we are told that demosthenes transcribed the history of thucydides eight times in order to imbibe and familiarize himself with the elegance and strength of his style will it not be worth while for a candidate for the ministry to transcribe dr tillotsons works    friday all day in high health and spirits writing tillotson that comet which appeared in      is expected again this year and we have intelligence that it has been seen about ten days since near midnight in the east i find myself very much inclined to an unreasonable absence of mind and to a morose and unsociable disposition let it therefore be my constant endeavor to reform these great faults    saturday attended mrs browns funeral let this and every other instance of human frailty and mortality prompt me to endeavor after a temper of mind fit to undergo this great change      march   monday wrote out bolingbrokes reflections on exile   tuesday began this afternoon my third quarter the great and almighty author of nature who at first established   those rules which regulate the world can as easily suspend those laws whenever his providence sees sufficient reason for such suspension this can be no objection then to the miracles of jesus christ although some very thoughtful and contemplative men among the heathen attained a strong persuasion of the great principles of religion yet the far greater number having little time for speculation gradually sunk into the grossest opinions and the grossest practices these therefore could not be made to embrace the true religion till their attention was roused by some astonishing and miraculous appearances the reasoning of philosophers having nothing surprising in them could not overcome the force of prejudice custom passion and bigotry but when wise and virtuous men commissioned from heaven by miracles awakened mens attention to their reasonings the force of truth made its way with ease to their minds   wednesday natural philosophy is the art of deducing the general laws and properties of material substances from a series of analogous observations the manner of reasoning in this art is not strictly demonstrative and by consequence the knowledge hence acquired is not absolutely scientific because the facts that we reason upon are perceived by sense and not by the internal action of the mind contemplating its ideas but these facts being presumed true in the form of axioms subsequent reasonings about them may be in the strictest sense scientific this art informs us in what manner bodies will influence us and each other in given circumstances and so teaches us to avoid the noxious and embrace the beneficial qualities of matter by this art too many curious engines have been constructed to facilitate business to avert impending calamities and to procure desired advantages   saturday rose at half after four wrote bolingbrokes letter on retirement and study   sunday heard mr maccarty all day spent the evening and supped at mr greenes with thayer honesty sincerity and openness i esteem essential marks of a good mind i am therefore of opinion that men ought after they have examined with unbiased judgments every system of religion and chosen one system on their own authority for themselves to avow their opinions and defend them with boldness      friday laid a pair of gloves with mrs willard that she would not see me chew tobacco this month    sunday heard mr maccarty all day upon abrahams faith in offering up isaac spent the evening very sociably at mr putnams several observations concerning mr franklin  of philadelphia a prodigious genius cultivated with prodigious industry    monday i sometimes in my sprightly moments consider myself in my great chair at school as some dictator at the head of a commonwealth in this little state i can discover all the great geniuses all the surprising actions and revolutions of the great world in miniature i have several renowned generals but three feet high and several deep projecting politicians in petticoats i have others catching and dissecting flies accumulating remarkable pebbles cockle shells c with as ardent curiosity as any virtuoso in the royal society some rattle and thunder out a b c with as much fire and impetuosity as alexander fought and very often sit down and cry as heartily upon being outspelt as cæsar did when at alexanders sepulchre he recollected that the macedonian hero had conquered the world before his age at one table sits mr insipid foppling  and fluttering spinning his whirligig or playing with his fingers as gaily and wittily as any frenchified coxcomb brandishes his cane or rattles his snuffbox at another sits the polemical divine plodding and wrangling in his mind about adams fall in which we sinned all as his primer has it in short my little school like the great world is made up of kings politicians divines l ds fops buffoons fiddlers sycophants fools coxcombs chimney sweepers and every other character drawn in history or seen in the world is it not then the highest pleasure my friend to preside in this little world to bestow the proper applause upon virtuous and generous actions to blame and punish every vicious and contracted trick to wear out of the tender mind every thing that is mean and little and fire the  0 newborn soul with a noble ardor and emulation the world affords no greater pleasure let others waste their bloom of life at the card or billiard table among rakes and fools and when their minds are sufficiently fretted with losses and inflamed by wine ramble through the streets assaulting innocent people breaking windows or debauching young girls i envy not their exalted happiness i had rather sit in school and consider which of my pupils will turn out in his future life a hero and which a rake which a philosopher and which a parasite than change breasts with them though possessed of twenty laced waistcoats and a thousand pounds a year methinks i hear you say this is odd talk for john adams ill tell you then the occasion of it about four months since a poor girl in this neighborhood walking by the meetinghouse upon some occasion in the evening met a fine gentleman with laced hat and waistcoat and a sword who solicited her to turn aside with him into the horse stable the girl relucted a little upon which he gave her three guineas and wished he might be damned if he did not have her in three months into the horse stable they went the three guineas proved three farthings and the girl proved with child without a friend upon earth that will own her or knowing the father of her threefarthing bastard    wednesday a fine morning proceeded on my journey towards braintree stopped to see mr haven  of dedham who told me very civilly he supposed i took my faith on trust from dr mayhew and added that he believed the doctrine of the satisfaction of jesus christ to be essential to christianity and that he would not believe this satisfaction unless he believed the divinity of christ mr balch was there too and observed that he would not be a christian if he did not believe the mysteries of the gospel that he could bear with an arminian but when with dr mayhew they denied the divinity and satisfaction of jesus christ he had no more to do with them that he knew not what to make of dr mayhews two discourses upon the expected dissolution of all things they gave him an idea of a cart whose wheels wanted greasing it rumbled on in a hoarse rough manner there was a good deal of ingenious talk in them but it    was thrown together in a jumbled confused order he believed the doctor wrote them in a great panic he added further that arminians however stiffly they maintain their opinions in health always he takes notice retract when they come to die and choose to die calvinists set out for braintree and arrived about sunset    sunday vernal equinox spent the evening at mr wibirds  with messrs quincy  cranch  savil in conversation upon the present situation of public affairs mr quincy exerted his talents in a most eloquent harangue mr cranch quoted the bishop of quebecs letter  concerning the french missionaries among the indians some he says are very good men    wednesday set out for worcester dined at dedham and rode from thence in the rain to mendon supped and lodged at josiah adamss    thursday rode to uxbridge tarried at my uncle webbs and lodged with mr nathan     friday rode to grafton dined at josiah rawsons he    exerted his rawsonian talents concerning the felicity of heaven i sat and heard for it is in vain to resist so impetuous a torrent proceeded to worcester drank tea at mr maccartys and spent the evening at major gardiners    saturday the stream of life sometimes glides smoothly on through the flowery meadows and enamelled plains at other times it drags a winding reluctant course through offensive bogs and dismal gloomy swamps the same road now leads us through a spacious country fraught with every delightful object then plunges us at once into miry sloughs or stops our passage with craggy and inaccessible mountains the free roving songster of the forest now rambles unconfined and hops from spray to spray but the next hour perhaps he alights to pick the scattered grain and is entangled in the snare the ship which wafted by a favorable gale sails prosperously upon the peaceful surface by a sudden change of weather may be tossed by the tempest and driven by furious opposite winds upon rocks or quicksands  in short nothing in this world enjoys a constant series of joy and prosperity    monday we find ourselves capable of comprehending many things of acquiring considerable degrees of knowledge by our slender and contracted faculties now may we not suppose our minds strengthened and capacities dilated so as fully to comprehend this globe of earth with its numerous appendages may we not suppose them further enlarged to take in the solar system in all its relations nay why may we not go further and suppose them increased to comprehend the whole created universe with all its inhabitants their various relations dependencies duties and necessities if this is supposable then a being of such great capacity endowed with sufficient power would be an accomplished judge of all rational beings—would be fit to dispense rewards to virtue and punishments to vice    april  0 saturday the man to whom nature has given a great and surprising genius will perform great and surprising achievements but a soul originally narrow and confined will never be enlarged to a distinguishing capacity such a one must be content to grovel amidst pebbles and butterflies through the whole of his life by diligence and attention indeed he may possibly get the character of a man of sense but never that of a great man    thursday drank tea and spent the evening at mr putnams in conversation concerning christianity he is of opinion that the apostles were a company of enthusiasts he says that we have only their word to prove that they spoke with different tongues raised the dead and healed the sick c    friday i can as easily still the fierce tempest or stop the rapid thunderbolt as command the motions and operations of my own mind i am dull and inactive and all my resolutions all the spirits i can muster are insufficient to rouse me from this senseless torpitude my brains seem constantly in as great confusion and wild disorder as miltons chaos they are numb dead i have never any bright refulgent ideas every thing appears in my mind dim and obscure like objects seen through a dirty glass or roiled water    saturday all my time seems to roll away unnoticed i long to study sometimes but have no opportunity i long to be a master of greek and latin i long to prosecute the mathematical and philosophical sciences i long to know a little of ethics and moral philosophy but i have no books no time no friends i must therefore be contented to live and die an ignorant obscure fellow    sunday astronomers tell us with good reason that not only all the planets and satellites in our solar system but all the unnumbered worlds that revolve round the fixed stars are inhabited    as well as this globe of earth if this is the case all mankind are no more in comparison of the whole rational creation of god than a point to the orbit of saturn perhaps all these different ranks of rational beings have in a greater or less degree committed moral wickedness if so i ask a calvinist whether he will subscribe to this alternative either god almighty must assume the respective shapes of all these different species and suffer the penalties of their crimes in their stead or else all these beings must be consigned to everlasting perdition    monday the reflection that i penned yesterday appears upon the revision to be weak enough for first we know not that the inhabitants of other globes have sinned nothing can be argued in this manner till it is proved at least probable that all these species of rational beings have revolted from their rightful sovereign when i examine the little prospect that lies before me and find an infinite variety of bodies in one horizon of perhaps two miles diameter how many millions of such prospects there are upon the surface of this earth how many millions of globes there are within our view each of which has as many of these prospects upon its own surface as our planet great and marvellous are thy works c    wednesday drank tea at mr putnams walked with him to his farm talked about all nature    thursday fast day heard mr maccarty spent the evening at mr putnams our proper business in this life is not to accumulate large fortunes not to gain high honors and important offices in the state not to waste our health and spirits in pursuit of the sciences but constantly to improve ourselves in habits of piety and virtue consequently the meanest mechanic who endeavors in proportion to his ability to promote the happiness of his fellow men deserves better of society and should be held in higher esteem than the greatest magistrate who uses his power for his own pleasures or avarice or ambition  0 friday reading milton that mans soul it seems to me was distended as wide as creation his power over the human mind was absolute and unlimited his genius was great beyond conception and his learning without bounds i can only gaze at him with astonishment without comprehending the vast compass of his capacity    may   saturday if we consider a little of this our globe we find an endless variety of substances mutually connected with and dependent on each other in the wilderness we see an amazing profusion of vegetables which afford sustenance and covering to the wild beasts the cultivated plains and meadows produce grass for the cattle and herbs for the service of man the milk and the flesh of other animals afford a delicious provision for mankind a great part of the human species are obliged to provide food and nourishment for other helpless and improvident animals vegetables sustain some animals these animals are devoured by others and these others are continually cultivating and improving the vegetable species thus nature upon our earth is in a continual rotation if we rise higher we find the sun and moon to a very great degree influencing us tides are produced in the ocean clouds in the atmosphere all nature is made to flourish and look gay by these enlivening and invigorating luminaries yea life and cheerfulness is diffused to all the other planets as well as ours upon the sprightly sunbeams no doubt there is as great a multitude and variety of bodies upon each planet in proportion to its magnitude as there is upon ours these bodies are connected with and influenced by each other thus we see the amazing harmony of our solar system the minutest particle in one of saturns satellites may have some influence upon the most distant regions of the system the stupendous plan of operation was projected by him who rules the universe and a part assigned to every particle of matter to act in this great and complicated drama the creator looked into the remotest futurity and saw his great designs accomplished by this inextricable this mysterious complication of causes but to rise still higher this solar system is but one very small wheel in the great the astonishing machine of the world those stars that twinkle in the heavens have each of them a choir of planets comets and satellites dancing round them playing mutually on each other and all together playing on the other systems that lie around them our system considered as one body hanging on its centre of gravity may affect and be affected by all the other systems within the compass of creation thus it is highly probable every particle of matter influences and is influenced by every other particle in the whole collected universe      sunday i think it necessary to call myself to a strict account how i spend my time once a week at least since the   th of april i have been studying the first part of butlers analogy   monday spent the evening and supped at mr maccartys the love of fame naturally betrays a man into several weaknesses and fopperies that tend very much to diminish his reputation and so defeat itself vanity i am sensible is my cardinal vice and cardinal folly and i am in continual danger when in company of being led an ignis fatuus chase by it without the strictest caution and watchfulness over myself   tuesday let any man suppose of the most improved understanding look upon a watch when the parts are separated let him examine every wheel and spring separately by itself yet if the use and application of these springs and wheels is not explained to him he will not be able to judge of the use and advantage of particular parts much less will he be able if he has only one wheel in like manner we who see but a few cogs in one wheel of the great machine of the universe can make no right judgment of particular phenomena in nature   friday spent the evening and supped at mr maccartys a mans observing the flux of the tide today renders it credible that the same phenomenon may be observed tomorrow in the same manner our experience that the author of nature has annexed pain to vice and pleasure to virtue in general i mean renders it credible that the same or a like disposition of things may take place hereafter our observing that the state of minority was designed to be an education for mature life and that our good or ill success in a mature life depends upon our good or ill improvement of our advantages in minority renders it credible that this life was designed to be an education for a future one and that our happiness or misery in a future life will be allotted us according as our characters shall be virtuous or vicious for god governs his great kingdom the world by very general laws we cannot indeed observe many instances of these laws but wherever we see any particular disposition of things we may strongly presume that there are other dispositions of things in other systems of nature analogous and of a piece with this   saturday went a shooting with mr putnam drank tea with him and his lady      sunday since last sunday i have wrote a few pages of the spectator read the last part of butlers analogy wrote out the tract upon personal identity and that upon the nature of virtue a poor weeks work    tuesday the first day of court nature and truth or rather truth and right are invariably the same in all times and in all places and reason pure unbiased reason perceives them alike in all times and in all places but passion prejudice interest custom and fancy are infinitely precarious if therefore we suffer our understandings to be blinded or perverted by any of these the chance is that of millions to one that we shall embrace errors and hence arises that endless variety of opinions entertained by mankind the weather and the season are beyond expression delightful the fields are covered with a bright and lively verdure the trees are all in bloom and the atmosphere is filled with a ravishing fragrance the air is soft and yielding and the setting sun sprinkled his departing rays over the face of nature and enlivened all the landscapes around me the trees put forth their leaves and the birds fill the spray    wednesday rambled about all day gaping and gazing    friday drank tea at the colonels not one new idea this week    saturday a lovely day soft vernal showers exercise invigorates and enlivens all the faculties of body and of mind it arouses our animal spirits it disperses melancholy it spreads a gladness and satisfaction over our minds and qualifies us for every sort of business and every sort of pleasure    sunday the week past was court week i was interrupted by company and the noisy bustle of the public occasion so that i have neither read nor wrote any thing worth mentioning heard mr thayer and spent the evening at mr putnams very sociably    monday the elephant and the lion when their strength is directed and applied by man can exert a prodigious force but their strength great and surprising as it is can produce no great effects when applied by no higher ingenuity than their own but man although the powers of his body are but small and contemptible by the exercise of his reason can invent engines and instruments to take advantage of the powers in nature and accomplish the most astonishing designs he can    rear the valley into a lofty mountain and reduce the mountain to a humble vale he can rend the rocks and level the proudest trees at his pleasure the forest is cleared and palaces rise when he pleases the soaring eagle is precipitated to earth and the lightfooted roe is stopped in his career he can cultivate and assist nature in her own productions by pruning the trees and manuring the land he makes the former produce larger and fairer fruit and the latter to bring forth better and greater plenty of grain he can form a communication between remotest regions for the benefit of trade and commerce over the yielding and fluctuating element of water the telescope has settled the regions of heaven and the microscope has brought up to view innumerable millions of animals that escape the observation of our naked sight    sunday heard mr maccarty he is particularly fond of the following expressions carnal ungodly persons sensuality and voluptuousness walking with god unregeneracy rebellion against god believers all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked shut out of the presence of god solid substantial and permanent joys joys springing up in the soul the shines of gods countenance when we consider the vast and incomprehensible extent of the material universe those myriads of fixed stars that emerge out of the remote regions of space to our view by glasses—and the finer our glasses the more of these systems we discover—when we consider that space is absolutely infinite and boundless that the power of the deity is strictly omnipotent and his goodness without limitation who can come to a stop in his thoughts and say hither does the universe extend and no further nothing can proceed from nothing but something can proceed from something and thus the deity produced this vast and beautiful frame of the universe out of nothing that is he had no preëxistent matter to work upon or to change from a chaos into a world but he produced a world into being by his almighty fiat perhaps in a manner analogous to the production of resolutions in our minds this week i have read one volume of duncan forbess works and one half of bentleys sermons at the boilean lectures    monday had the projectile force in the planets been greater than it is they would not describe circles but very    eccentrical ellipses round the sun and then the inhabitants would be tormented yea destroyed and the planets left barren and uninhabitable wastes by extreme vicissitudes of heat and cold it was many million times as likely that some other degree of velocity would have been lighted on as that the present would if chance had the disposal of it and any other degree would have absolutely destroyed all animal and sensitive if not vegetable inhabitants ergo an intelligent and benevolent mind had the disposal and determination of these things    friday if we examine critically the little prospect that lies around us at one view we behold an almost infinite variety of substances over our heads the sun blazes in divine effulgence the clouds tinged with various colors by the refracted sunbeams exhibit most beautiful appearances in the atmosphere the cultivated plains and meadows are attired in a delightful verdure and variegated with the gay enamel of flowers and roses on one hand we see an extensive forest a whole kingdom of vegetables of the noblest kind upon the hills we discern flocks of grazing cattle and on the other hand a city rises up to view with its spires among the clouds all these and many more objects encounter our eyes in the prospect of our horizon perhaps two or three miles in diameter now every animal that we see in this prospect men and beasts is endued with a most curiously organized body they consist of bones and blood and muscles and nerves and ligaments and tendons and chyle and a million other things all exactly fitted for the purposes of life and motion and action every plant has almost as complex and curious a structure as animals and the minutest twig is supported and supplied with juices and life by organs and filaments proper to draw this nutrition of the earth it would be endless to consider minutely every substance or species of substances that falls under our eyes in this one prospect now let us for a minute consider how many million such prospects there are upon this single planet all of which contain as great and some a much greater variety of animals and vegetables when we have been sufficiently astonished at this incomprehensible multitude of substances let us rise in our thoughts and consider how many planets and satellites and comets there are in this one solar system each of which has as many such prospects upon its surface as our earth such a view as this may  0 suffice to show us our ignorance but if we rise still higher in our thoughts and consider that stupendous army of fixed stars that is hung up in the immense space as so many suns each placed in the centre of his respective system and diffusing his enlivening and invigorating influences to his whole choir of planets comets and satellites and that each of this unnumbered multitude has as much superficies and as many prospects as our earth we find ourselves lost and swallowed up in this incomprehensible i had almost said infinite magnificence of nature our imaginations after a few faint efforts sink down into a profound admiration of what they cannot comprehend god whose almighty fiat first produced this amazing universe had the whole plan in view from all eternity intimately and perfectly knew the nature and all the properties of all these his creatures he looked forward through all duration and perfectly knew all the effects all the events and revolutions that could possibly and would actually take place throughout eternity    saturday drank tea at mr putnams what is the proper business of mankind in this life we come into the world naked and destitute of all the conveniences and necessaries of life and if we were not provided for and nourished by our parents or others should inevitably perish as soon as born we increase in strength of body and mind by slow and insensible degrees one third of our time is consumed in sleep and three sevenths of the remainder is spent in procuring a mere animal sustenance and if we live to the age of threescore and ten and then sit down to make an estimate in our minds of the happiness we have enjoyed and the misery we have suffered we shall find i am apt to think that the overbalance of happiness is quite inconsiderable we shall find that we have been through the greatest part of our lives pursuing shadows and empty but glittering phantoms rather than substances we shall find that we have applied our whole vigor all our faculties in the pursuit of honor or wealth or learning or some other such delusive trifle instead of the real and everlasting excellencies of piety and virtue habits of contemplating the deity and his transcendent excellencies and correspondent habits of complacency in and dependence upon him habits of reverence and gratitude to god and habits of love and compassion to our fellow men and habits of temperance recollection    and selfgovernment will afford us a real and substantial pleasure we may then exult in a consciousness of the favor of god and the prospect of everlasting felicity  0 sunday heard mr maccarty you who are sinners are in continual danger of being swallowed up quick and borne away by the mighty torrent of gods wrath and justice it is now as it were restrained and banked up by his goodness but he will by and by unless repentance prevent let it out in full fury upon you this week i have wrote the eighth sermon of bentleys boilean lectures read part of the first volume of voltaires age of louis xiv i make poor weeks works    monday when we see or feel any body we discern nothing but bulk and extension we can change this extension into a great variety of shapes and figures and by applying our senses to it can get ideas of those different figures but can do nothing more than change the figure if we pulverize glass or salt the original constituent matter remains the same only we have altered the contexture of its parts large loads and heaps of matter as mountains and rocks lie obstinate inactive and motionless and eternally will remain so unless moved by some force extrinsic to themselves dissolve the cohesion and reduce these mountains to their primogenial atoms these atoms are as dull and senseless as they were when combined into the shape of a mountain in short matter has no consciousness of its own existence has no power of its own no active power i mean but is wholly passive nor can thought be ever produced by any modification of it to say that god can superadd to matter a capacity of thought is palpable nonsense and contradiction such a capacity is inconsistent with the most essential properties of matter june   tuesday the reasoning of mathematicians is founded on certain and infallible principles every word they use conveys a determinate idea and by accurate definitions they excite the same ideas in the mind of the reader that were in the mind of the writer when they have defined the terms they intend to make use of they premise a few axioms or selfevident principles that every man must assent to as soon as proposed they then take for granted certain postulates that no one can deny them such as that a right line may be drawn from one given point to another and from these plain simple principles    they have raised most astonishing speculations and proved the extent of the human mind to be more spacious and capable than any other science   wednesday when we come into the world our minds are destitute of all sorts of ideas our senses inform us of various qualities in the substances around us as we grow up our acquaintance with things enlarges and spreads colors are painted in our minds through our eyes all the various modulations of sounds enter by our ears fragrance and fœtor are perceived by the smell extension and bulk by the touch these ideas that enter simple and uncompounded through our senses are called simple ideas because they are absolutely one and indivisible thus the whiteness of snow cannot be divided or separated into two or more whitenesses the same may be said of all other colors it is indeed in our power to mix or compound colors into new and more beautiful appearances than any that are to be found in nature so we can combine various sounds into one melodious tune in short we can modify and dispose the simple ideas of sensation into whatever shape we please but these ideas can enter our minds no other way but through the senses a man born blind will never gain one idea of light or color one born deaf will never get an idea of sound   saturday dreamed away the afternoon    monday he is not a wise man and is unfit to fill any important station in society that has left one passion in his soul unsubdued the love of glory will make a general sacrifice the interest of his nation to his own fame avarice exposes some to corruption and all to a thousand meannesses and villanies destructive to society love has deposed lawful kings and aggrandized unlawful ill deserving courtiers envy is more studious of eclipsing the lustre of other men by indirect stratagems than of brightening its own lustre by great and meritorious actions these passions should be bound fast and brought under the yoke untamed they are lawless bulls they roar and bluster defy all control and sometimes murder their proper owner but properly inured to obedience they take their places under the yoke without noise and labor vigorously in their masters service from a sense of the government of god and a regard to the laws established by his providence should all    our actions for ourselves or for other men primarily originate and this master passion in a good mans soul like the larger fishes of prey will swallow up and destroy all the rest    tuesday consider for one minute the changes produced in this country within the space of two hundred years then the whole continent was one continued dismal wilderness the haunt of wolves and bears and more savage men now the forests are removed the land covered with fields of corn orchards bending with fruit and the magnificent habitations of rational and civilized people then our rivers flowed through gloomy deserts and offensive swamps now the same rivers glide smoothly on through rich countries fraught with every delightful object and through meadows painted with the most beautiful scenery of nature and of art the narrow huts of the indians have been removed and in their room have arisen fair and lofty edifices large and well compacted cities july    wednesday kept school i am now entering on another year and i am resolved not to neglect my time as i did last year i am resolved to rise with the sun and to study the scriptures on thursday friday saturday and sunday mornings and to study some latin author the other three mornings noons and nights i intend to read english authors this is my fixed determination and i will set down every neglect and every compliance with this resolution may i blush whenever i suffer one hour to pass unimproved i will rouse up my mind and fix my attention i will stand collected within myself and think upon what i read and what i see i will strive with all my soul to be something more than persons who have had less advantages than myself    thursday fast day rose not till seven oclock this is the usual fate of my resolutions wrote the first three chapters of st james wrote in bolingbroke pretty industriously spent the evening at mr paines the years of my youth are marked by divine providence with various and with great events the last year is rendered conspicuous in the memorials of past ages by a series of very remarkable events of various kinds the year opened with the projection of three expeditions  to prevent the further and remove the present depredations and    encroachments of our turbulent french neighbors i shall not minute the gradual steps advanced by each army but only the issue of each braddock the commander of the forces destined against du quesne and six or seven hundred of his men were butchered in a manner unexampled in history all routed and destroyed without doing the least injury that we know of to the enemy johnson with his army was attacked by the baron dieskau but happily maintained his ground and routed the enemy taking dieskau prisoner monckton and winslow at nova scotia gained their point took the fortresses and sent off the inhabitants into these provinces boscawen bravely defended our coast with his fleet and made great havoc among the french merchantships all these actions were performed in a time of peace sed paulo majora canamus god almighty has exerted the strength of his tremendous arm and shook one of the finest richest and most populous cities in europe into ruin and desolation by an earthquake  the greatest part of europe and the greatest part of america have been in violent convulsions and admonished the inhabitants of both that neither riches nor honors nor the solid globe itself is a proper basis on which to build our hopes of security the british nation has been making very expensive and very formidable preparations to secure its territories against an invasion by the french and to humble the insolent tempers and aspiring prospects of that ambitious and faithless nation  the gathering of the clouds seems to forebode very tempestuous weather and none can tell but the storm will break heavy upon himself in particular is it not then the highest frenzy and distraction to neglect these expostulations of providence and continue a rebellion against the potentate who alone has wisdom enough to perceive and power enough to procure for us the only certain means of happiness and goodness enough to prompt him to both    friday rose at seven wrote the two last chapters of st james    saturday rose at seven wrote a little in greek afternoon wrote bolingbroke       sunday rose at half after six good sense some say is enough to regulate our conduct and to dictate thoughts and actions which are proper upon certain occasions this they say will soften and refine the motions of our limbs into an easy and agreeable air although the dancing master was never applied to and this will suggest good answers good observations and good expressions to us better than refined breeding good sense will make us remember that others have as good a right to think for themselves and to speak their own opinions as we have that another mans making a silly speech does not warrant my ill nature and pride in grasping the opportunity to ridicule him and show my wit a puffy vain conceited conversation never fails to bring a man into contempt although his natural endowments be ever so great and his application and industry ever so intense no accomplishments no virtues are a sufficient atonement for vanity and a haughty overbearing temper in conversation and such is the humor of the world the greater a mans parts and the nobler his virtues in other respects the more derision and ridicule does this one vice and folly throw him into good sense is generally attended with a very lively sense and delight in applause the love of fame in such men is generally much stronger than in other people and this passion it must be confessed is apt to betray men into impertinent exertions of their talents sometimes into censorious remarks upon others often into little meannesses to sound the opinions of others and oftenest of all into a childish affectation of wit and gayety i must own myself to have been to a very heinous degree guilty in this respect when in company with persons much superior to myself in years and place i have talked to show my learning i have been too bold with great men which boldness will no doubt be called selfconceit i have made ill natured remarks upon the intellectuals manners practice c of other people i have foolishly aimed at wit and spirit at making a shining figure in gay company but instead of shining brighter i only clouded the few rays that before rendered me visible such has been my unhappy fate i now resolve for the future never to say an illnatured thing concerning ministers or the ministerial profession never to say an envious thing concerning governors judges ministers clerks sheriffs lawyers or any other honorable or lucrative offices or officers never to affect wit upon laced waistcoats or large    estates or their possessors never to show my own importance or superiority by remarking the foibles vices or inferiority of others but i now resolve as far as lies in me to take notice chiefly of the amiable qualities of other people to put the most favorable construction upon the weaknesses bigotry and errors of others c and to labor more for an inoffensive and amiable than for a shining and invidious character    monday rose at seven read carefully thirty lines in virgil    tuesday read carefully thirty lines in virgil wrote a little in bolingbroke at noon and a little at night spent the evening at mr putnams    wednesday read about forty lines in virgil and wrote a little at noon nothing more    thursday rose at half after six read a little greek  0 friday dreamed away the time    saturday the nature and essence of the material world is not less concealed from our knowledge than the nature and essence of god we see ourselves surrounded on all sides with a vast expanse of heavens and we feel ourselves astonished at the grandeur the blazing pomp of those stars with which it is adorned the birds fly over our heads and our fellow animals labor and sport around us the trees wave and murmur in the winds the clouds float and shine on high the surging billows rise in the sea and ships break through the tempest here rises a spacious city and yonder is spread out an extensive plain these objects are so common and familiar that we think ourselves fully acquainted with them but these are only effects and properties the substance from whence they flow is hid from us in impenetrable obscurity god is said to be selfexistent and that therefore he must have existed from eternity and throughout immensity god exists by an absolute necessity in his own nature that is it implies a contradiction to suppose him not to exist to ask what this necessity is is as if you should ask what the necessity of the equality between twice two and four is twice two are necessarily in their own nature equal to four not only here but in every point of space not only now but in every point of duration in the same manner god necessarily exists not only here but throughout unlimited space not only now but throughout    all duration past and future we observe in the animate and in the inanimate creation a surprising diversity and a surprising uniformity of inanimate substances there is a great variety from the pebble in the streets quite up to the vegetables in the forest of animals there is no less a variety of species from the animalcula that escape our naked sight quite through the intermediate kinds up to elephants horses men yet notwithstanding this variety there is from the highest species of animals upon this globe which is generally thought to be man a regular and uniform subordination of one tribe to another down to the apparently insignificant animalcules in pepper water and the same subordination continues quite through the vegetable kingdom and it is worth observing that each species regularly and uniformly preserve all their essential and peculiar properties without partaking of the peculiar properties of others we do not see chickens hatched with fins to swim nor fishes spawned with wings to fly we do not see a colt foaled with claws like a bird nor man with the clothing or armor which his reason renders him capable of procuring for himself every species has its distinguishing properties and every individual that is born has all those properties without any of the distinguishing properties of another species what now can preserve this prodigious variety of species and this inflexible uniformity among the individuals but the continual and vigilant providence of god august   sunday heard mr maccarty all day spent the evening at the colonels the event shows that my resolutions are of a very thin and vapory consistency almost a fortnight has passed since i came to worcester the last time some part of the time i have spent as frugally and industriously as i possibly could but the greatest part i have dreamed away as usual i am now entering upon a new month and a new week and i should think that one month would carry me forward considerably if i could keep up a continual presence of mind and a close application at all proper times this i will labor after   monday agreeably to the design laid last night i arose this morning before the sun   saturday all this past week my designs have been interrupted by the troubles and confusion of the house i shall be able to resume the thread of my studies i hope now wrote    pretty industriously in bolingbroke i have never looked attentively into my own breast i have never considered as i ought the surprising faculties and operations of the mind our minds are capable of receiving an infinite variety of ideas from those numerous material objects with which we are surrounded and the vigorous impressions which we receive from these our minds are capable of retaining compounding and arranging into all the varieties of picture and of figure our minds are able to retain distinct comprehensions of an infinite multitude of things without the least labor or fatigue by curiously inquiring into the situation fruits produce manufactures c of our own and by travelling into or reading about other countries we can gain distinct ideas of almost every thing upon this earth at present and by looking into history we can settle in our minds a clear and a comprehensive view of this earth at its creation of its various changes and revolutions of its various catastrophes of its progressive cultivation sudden depopulation and gradual repeopling of the growth of several kingdoms and empires of their wealth and commerce wars and politics of the characters of their principal leading men of their grandeur and power of their virtues and vices and of their insensible decays at first and of their swift destruction at last in fine we can attend the earth from its nativity through all the various turns of fortune through all its successive changes through all the events that happen on its surface and through all the successive generations of mankind to the final conflagration when the whole earth with all its appendages shall be consumed and dissolved by the furious element of fire and after our minds are furnished with this ample store of ideas far from feeling burdened or overloaded our thoughts are more free and active and clear than before and we are capable of diffusing our acquaintance with things much further we are not satiated with knowledge our curiosity is only improved and increased our thoughts rove beyond the visible diurnal sphere they range through the heavens and lose themselves amidst a labyrinth of worlds and not contented with what is they run forward into futurity and search for new employment there here they can never stop the wide the boundless prospect lies before them here alone they find objects adequate to their desires i know not by what fatality it happens but i seem to have a    necessity upon me of trifling away my time have not read fifty lines in virgil this week have wrote very little    thursday friday i know not what became of these days    saturday i seem to have lost sight of the object that i resolved to pursue dreams and slumbers sloth and negligence will be the ruin of my schemes however i seem to be awake now why cant i keep awake i have wrote scripture pretty industriously this morning why am i so unreasonable as to expect happiness and a solid undisturbed contentment amidst all the disorders and the continual rotations of worldly affairs stability is nowhere to be found in that part of the universe that lies within our observation the natural and the moral world are continually changing the planets with all their appendages strike out their amazing circles round the sun upon the earth one day is serene and clear no cloud intercepts the kind influences of the sun and all nature seems to flourish and look gay but these delightful scenes soon vanish and are succeeded by the gloom and darkness of the night and before the morning appears the clouds gather the winds rise lightnings glare and thunders bellow through the vast of heaven man is sometimes flushed with joy and transported with the full fury of sensual pleasure and the next hour lies groaning under the bitter pangs of disappointment and adverse fortune thus god has told us by the general constitution of the world by the nature of all terrestrial enjoyments and by the constitution of our own bodies that this world was not designed for a lasting and a happy state but rather for a state of moral discipline that we might have a fair opportunity and continual incitement to labor after a cheerful resignation to all the events of providence after habits of virtue selfgovernment and piety and this temper of mind is in our power to acquire and this alone can secure us against all the adversities of fortune against all the malice of men against all the operations of nature a world in flames and a whole system tumbling in ruins to the centre have nothing terrifying in them to a man whose security is builded on the adamantine basis of good conscience and confirmed piety if i could but conform my life and conversation to my speculations i should be happy have i hardiness enough to contend with omnipotence or have i cunning enough to elude infinite wisdom  0 or ingratitude enough to spurn at infinite goodness the situation that i am in and the advantages that i enjoy are thought to be the best for me by him who alone is competent to judge of fitness and propriety shall i then complain oh madness pride impiety    sunday if one man or being out of pure generosity and without any expectation of returns is about to confer any favor or emolument upon another he has a right and is at liberty to choose in what manner and by what means to confer it he may convey the favor by his own hand or by the hand of his servant and the obligation to gratitude is equally strong upon the benefited being the mode of bestowing does not diminish the kindness provided the commodity or good is brought to us equally perfect and without our expense but on the other hand if one being is the original cause of pain sorrow or suffering to another voluntarily and without provocation it is injurious to that other whatever means he might employ and whatever circumstances the conveyance of the injury might be attended with thus we are equally obliged to the supreme being for the information he has given us of our duty whether by the constitution of our minds and bodies or by a supernatural revelation for an instance of the latter let us take original sin some say that adams sin was enough to damn the whole human race without any actual crimes committed by any of them now this guilt is brought upon them not by their own rashness and indiscretion not by their own wickedness and vice but by the supreme being this guilt brought upon us is a real injury and misfortune because it renders us worse than not to be and therefore making us guilty upon account of adams delegation or representing all of us is not in the least diminishing the injury and injustice but only changing the mode of conveyance    sunday yesterday i completed a contract with mr putnam to study law under his inspection for two years i    ought to begin with a resolution to oblige and please him and his lady in a particular manner i ought to endeavor to oblige and please everybody but them in particular necessity drove me to this determination but my inclination i think was to preach however that would not do but i set out with firm resolutions i think never to commit any meanness or injustice in the practice of law the study and practice of law i am sure does not dissolve the obligations of morality or of religion and although the reason of my quitting divinity was my opinion concerning some disputed points i hope i shall not give reason of offence to any in that profession by imprudent warmth heard crawford upon the love of god the obligation that is upon us to love god he says arises from the instances of his love and goodness to us he has given us an existence and a nature which render us capable of enjoying happiness and of suffering misery he has given us several senses and has furnished the world around us with a variety of objects proper to delight and entertain them he has hung up in the heavens over our heads and has spread in the fields of nature around about us those glorious shows and appearances by which our eyes and our imaginations are so extremely delighted we are pleased with the beautiful appearance of the flowers we are agreeably entertained with the prospect of forests and meadows of verdant fields and mountains covered with flocks we are thrown into a kind of transport and amazement when we behold the amazing concave of heaven sprinkled and glittering with stars he has also bestowed upon the vegetable species a fragrance that can almost as agreeably entertain our sense of smell he has so wonderfully constituted the air that by giving it a particular kind of vibration it produces in us as intense sensations of pleasure as the organs of our bodies can bear in all the varieties of harmony and concord but all the provision that he has made for the gratification of our senses though very engaging and unmerited instances of goodness is much inferior to the provision the wonderful provision that he has made for the gratification of our nobler powers of intelligence and reason he has given us reason to find out the truth and the real design and true end of our existence and has made all endeavors to promote them agreeable to our minds and attended with a conscious pleasure and complacency on the contrary he has made a different    course of life—a course of impiety and injustice of malevolence and intemperance—appear shocking and deformed to our first reflections and since it was necessary to make us liable to some infirmities and distempers of body he has plentifully stored the bowels and the surface of the earth with minerals and vegetables that are proper to defend us from some diseases and to restore us to health from others besides the powers of our reason and invention have enabled us to devise engines and instruments to take advantage of the powers that we find in nature to avert many calamities that would otherwise befall us and to procure many enjoyments and pleasures that we could not otherwise attain he has connected the greatest pleasure with the discovery of truth and made it our interest to pursue with eagerness these intense pleasures have we not the greatest reason then yea is it not our indispensable duty to return our sincere love and gratitude to this greatest kindest and most profuse benefactor would it not show the deepest baseness and most infamous ingratitude to despise or to disregard a being to whose inexhausted beneficence we are so deeply indebted    monday came to mr putnams and began law and studied not very closely this week    the choice of a profession having been finally determined an interval of more than two years occurs in the diary embracing the remainder of his term of residence at worcester the following extracts from the autobiography find their place here      while i was at worcester three great personages from england passed through that town lord loudon was one he travelled in the winter from new york to boston and lodged at worcester in his way the relations we had of his manners and conduct on the road gave us no great esteem of his lordships qualifications  to conduct the war and excited gloomy apprehensions the young lord howe who passed from boston to new york was the very reverse and spread everywhere the most sanguine hopes which however were too soon disappointed by his melancholy but heroic death  the third was sir geoffrey amherst afterward lord amherst and commander in chief of the english army amherst who had arrived at boston from the conquest of louisburg marched with his army of four thousand men across the country and halted a few days at worcester having encamped his army on the hill behind the present court house here we had an opportunity of seeing him his officers and army the officers were very social spent their evenings and took their suppers with such of the inhabitants as were able to invite them and entertained us with their music and their dances many of them were scotchmen in their plaids and their music was delightful even the bagpipe was not disagreeable the general lodged with colonel chandler the elder and was very inquisitive concerning his farm insisting on rambling over the whole of it the excellent order and discipline observed by these troops revived the hopes of the country which were ultimately fully satisfied by the entire conquest    of canada with the help of the militia of the country which were sent on to their assistance  with great confidence at the time when fort william henry was besieged there came down almost every day despatches from the general to the new england colonies urging for troops and assistance colonel chandler the younger had sent so many expresses that he found it difficult to get persons to undertake the journeys complaining of this embarrassment one evening in company i told him i had so long led a sedentary life that my health began to fail me and that i had an inclination to take a journey on horseback the next morning by daybreak he was at my chamber door with despatches for the governor of rhode island he said a horse was ready without hesitation i arose and was soon mounted too much despatch was necessary for my comfort and i believe for my health for a journey so fatiguing to a man who was not on horseback more than once a year on a short visit to his parents i cannot think calculated to relieve a valetudinarian arrived at providence i was informed that mr greene was at newport with the general assembly i had then to ride through the narraganset country and to cross over conanicut to rhode island in the woods of narraganset i met two gentlemen on horseback of whom i took the liberty to inquire whether the governor was still at newport one of them answered he was not but the gentleman with him was the governor my despatches were delivered to him and he broke the seals and read them on the spot he said he believed the french were determined to have the country  asked many questions gave me many polite invitations to return with him to his home which as he said he had no answer to return by me and as i was determined to see newport i civilly declined pursuing my journey i found a great difficulty to get over the water as the boats and men were gone upon their usual employment one was found after a time very tedious to me and i landed on the island and had a good opportunity to see the whole of it as my road to bristol lay through the whole length    of it to me the whole island appeared a most beautiful garden an ornamented farm but hostile armies have since degarnished it of a principal embellishment the noble rows and plantations of trees crossing over the ferry to bristol i spent a night with colonel green whose lady was a church and sister to mrs john chandler here i was happy and felt myself at home next morning i pursued my journey to worcester the whole was accomplished in four days one of which was sunday as i was obliged to ride all that day i had an opportunity of observing the manners of rhode island—much more gay and social than our sundays in massachusetts in      my period with mr putnam expired two gentlemen by name doolittle and baldwin  visited me in the office and invited me to settle in worcester they said as there were two sides to a question and two lawyers were always wanted where there was one i might depend upon business in my profession they were pleased to add that my character was fair and well esteemed by all sorts of people in the town and through the county that they wished to get me chosen at the next election which was very near register of deeds which would procure me something handsome for the present and insure me employment at the bar that as the chandler family had engrossed almost all the public offices and employment in the town and county they wished to select some person qualified to share with them in those honors and emoluments my answer was that as the chandlers were worthy people and discharged the duties of their offices very well i envied not their felicity and had no desire to set myself in opposition to them and especially to mr putnam who had married a beautiful daughter of that family and had treated me with civility and kindness but there was one motive with me which was decisive i was in very ill health and the air of worcester appeared to be unfriendly to me to such a degree that i panted for want of the breezes from the sea and the pure zephyrs from the rocky mountains of my native town that my father and mother invited me to live with them and as there never had been a lawyer in any country part of the then county of suffolk    i was determined at least to look into it and see if there was any chance for me they replied that the town of boston was full of lawyers and many of them of established characters for long experience great abilities and extensive fame who might be jealous of such a novelty as a lawyer in the country part of their county and might be induced to obstruct me i returned that i was not wholly unknown to some of the most celebrated of those gentlemen that i believed they had too much candor and generosity to injure a young man and at all events i could try the experiment and if i should find no hope of success i should then think of some other place or some other course      october   braintree yesterday i arrived here from worcester i am this day about beginning justinians institutions with arnold vinniuss notes i took it out of the library at college it is intituled d justiniani sacratissimi principis institutionum sive elementorum libri quatuor notis perpetuis multo quam hucusque diligentius illustrati cura et studio arnoldi vinnii j c editio novissima priori emendatior et progressu juris civilis romani fragmentis xii tabularum et rerum nominumque indice auctior ut ex præfatione nostra patet now i shall have an opportunity of judging of a dutch commentator whom the dedicator calls celeberrimus suâ ætate in hâc academiâ doctor let me read with attention deliberation distinction let me admire with knowledge it is low to admire a dutch commentator merely because he uses latin and greek phraseology let me be able to draw the true character both of the text of justinian and of the notes of his commentator when i have finished the book few of my contemporary beginners in the study of the law have the resolution to aim at much knowledge in the civil law let me therefore distinguish myself from them by the study of the civil law in its native languages those of greece and rome i shall gain the consideration and perhaps favor of mr gridley and mr pratt by this means as a stimulus let me insert in this place justinians adhortationem ad studium juris—summâ itaque ope et alacri studio has leges nostras accipite et vosmetipsos sic eruditos ostendite at spes    vos pulcherrima foveat toto legitimo opere perfecto posse etiam nostram rempublicam in partibus ejus vobis credendis gubernari data constantinopoli xi kalendas decembris domino justiniano perpetuo augusto tertiùm consule—cicero   de orat pergite ut facitis adolescentes atque in id studium in quo estis incumbite ut et vobis honori et amicis utilitati et reipublicæ emolumento esse possitis arnoldus vinnius in academiâ leydensi juris professor fuit celeberrimus a  the birth places of john and of john quincy adams i have read about ten pages in justinian and translated about four pages into english this is the whole of my days work i have smoked chatted trifled loitered away this whole day almost—by much the greatest part of this day has been spent in unloading a cart in cutting oven wood in making and recruiting my own fire in eating victuals and apples in drinking tea cutting and smoking tobacco and in chatting with dr savils wife at their house and at this  chores  chat tobacco tea steal away time but i am resolved to translate justinian and his commentators notes by daylight and read gilberts tenures by night till i am master of both and i will meddle with no other book in this chamber on a week day on a sunday i will read the enquiry into the nature of the human soul and for amusement i will sometimes read ovids art of love to mrs savil this shall be my method i have read gilberts first section of feuds this evening but am not master of it   friday rose about sunrise unpitched a load of hay translated two leaves more of justinian and in the afternoon walked to deacon webbs then around by the mill pond home smoked a pipe with webb  at the doctors and am now about reading over again gilberts section of feudal tenures   sunday read a few leaves in baxters enquiry into the nature of the human soul he has explained with great exactness the resistance which matter makes to any change of its state or condition whether of motion or of rest the vis inertiæ    the positive inactivity of matter not barely its inactivity but its antiactivity for it not only is destitute of a power of changing its state from rest to motion or from motion to rest but it has a positive power—each single particle has a positive power of resisting any force that attempts to change its state but a leaden ball held between my fingers as soon as i withdraw my fingers will of itself for aught i see change its state from rest to motion and fall suddenly to the floor this phenomenon is not vis inertiæ it is by no reluctance or aversion to motion that it moves but it seems to be a tendency to motion an active principle if it is passive the agent that presses it downwards is invisible but because matter in all the experiments i have tried resists a change from rest to motion upwards will it follow that all matter essentially resists a change from rest to motion downwards is it a posteriori from experiments that he deduces this proposition that all matter essentially resists any change of state or is it a priori from some property that is essentially included in our ideas of matter that he demonstratively argues this vis inertiæ is inactivity and antiactivity included in our ideas of matter are activity perceptivity c properties that we by only comparing ideas can see to be incompatible to any properties of matter if nothing is matter which has not this antiactive principle then human minds are not matter for they have no such principle we are conscious that we can begin and end motion of ourselves if he argues a posteriori from experiments he can pretend only to probability for unless he was certain that he had made the experiment and found the property in every particle of matter that ever was created he could not be certain that there was no particle in the world without this property though he had tried all but one and found that they had it we have tried but a few parcels of matter the utmost we can say is that all we have tried are inactive but for arguments sake i will deny that all the parcels that we have tried have this property on the contrary i will say that all have a motive power downwards powder has an active power springing every way c thus experiment is turned against the doctrine i cannot yet see how he will prove all matter antiinactive a priori from properties of matter before known essential with which he must show this to be necessarily connected      monday read in gilberts tenures i must and will make that book familiar to me  0 tuesday read in gilbert i read him slowly but i gain ideas and knowledge as i go along which i do not always when i read    wednesday rode to boston conversed with ned quincy  and samuel peter chardon c by the way peter chardon is a promising youth he aspires and will reach to a considerable height he has a sense of the dignity and importance of his profession that of the law he has a just contempt of the idle incurious pleasurehunting young fellows of the town who pretend to study law he scorns the character and he aims at a nobler he talks of exulting in an unlimited field of natural civil and common law talks of nerving sharpening the mind by the study of law and mathematics quotes lockes conduct of the understanding and transcribes points of law into a commonplace book on lockes model this fellows thoughts are not employed on songs and girls nor his time on flutes fiddles concerts and card tables he will make something    thursday examined the laws of this province concerning roads cattle fences c c read in gilbert this small volume will take me a fortnight but i will be master of it    friday read gilbert went in the evening to colonel quincys heard a trial before him as a justice between jos field and luke lambert the case was this lamberts horse broke into fields inclosure and lay there some time damage feasant  when lambert found that his horse was  0 there he entered the inclosure and although field calls to him and forbids it waved his hat and screamed at the horse and drove him away without tendering field his damages this was a rescous of the horse out of fields hands for although lambert had a right to enter and take out his horse tendering the damages yet as the words of the law are that whoever shall rescous any creature c out of the hands of any person about to drive them to pound whereby the party injured shall be liable to lose his damages and the law be eluded shall forfeit c and as field was actually about to drive them to pound and lambert offered him no damages this was completely a rescous field after the rescous went to colonel quincy made complaint against lambert and requested and obtained a warrant the warrant was directed to the constable who brought the offender before the justice attended with the complainant and the witnesses ordered to be summoned quincy  for defendant took exception on the warrant to the jurisdiction of the justice because the sum originally sued for consisting of the forfeiture of forty shillings to the poor and the parties damages estimated at nine pence which was forty shillings nine pence was a greater sum than the justice can take cognizance of and because the words of this act of the province are that this forty shillings to the poor and these damages to the party injured shall be recovered by action c in any of his majestys courts of record—now as the court of a single justice is not one of his majestys courts of record the forfeiture and damages prayed for in this complaint cannot be recovered in this court the justice adjourned his court till eight oclock monday morning in order to inform himself—  whether the court of a single justice of the peace was one of his majestys courts of record   whether a single justice can take cognizance of any matter in which the sum originally prosecuted for is more than forty shillings if upon examination the colonel shall find that a single justice has no authority to hear and determine such a rescous at the adjournment the proceedings will be quashed and the complainant must begin de novo but if he finds that a single    justice has authority to determine the matter he will proceed to judgment the questions that arise in my mind on this case are these   what is the true idea and definition of a court of record what courts in england and what in this province are courts of record and what are not wood jacobs c   whether a justice has authority by warrant to hear and determine of any offence the penalty of which or the forfeiture of which to the king the poor the informer c is more than forty shillings   whether a court is denominated a court of record from its keeping records of its proceedings whether every court is a court of record whose president is a judge of record for it seems plain in dalton that a justice of the peace is a judge of record   on supposition the warrant should be quashed who should pay the costs of the original warrant of the defendants attendance and of witnesses oaths and attendance the complainant who was mistaken through ignorance in going to the justice for a remedy or the justice who was mistaken in the same manner in acting upon the complaint beyond his authority   what are the steps of prosecuting by information is not a motion made in court that the information may be amended or filed are informations ever filed but by attorneygeneral when the penalty sued for by the information is half to the king or half to the poor and the other half to the informer is the defendant committed till he discharges the penalty or is an execution ever issued   it is said courts of record alone have power to impose a fine or imprison quære which   a rescous is a breach of law and a breach of the peace and remedy for it may be by action of trespass which is always contra pacem   are not justices warrants confined to criminal matters may a warrant be issued for a trespass quare clausum fregit it may for a trespass of assault and battery justices may punish by fine imprisonment stripes c the colonel inquired what punishment he could inflict on a constable for disobedience to his warrant for not making return of his doings he found a case ruled in kings bench that a constable    is a subordinate officer to a justice of the peace and is indictable at common law for neglect of duty the malfeasance or nonfeasance of officers are crimes and offences that may be inquired of indicted or presented by the grand jury at common law field took lamberts horses damage feasant in his close once before and impounded them and gave him verbal notice that his horses were in pound but neglected to give either lambert or the poundkeeper an account of the damages the horses had done him lambert went to the poundkeeper and demanded his horses tendering the poundkeepers fees and the poundkeeper delivered them up now quære whether field is enjoined by any law of the province to get his damages appraised and to lodge an account of them with the poundkeeper   whether as he neglected this the poundkeeper cannot justify his resigning of them to the owner   if field had lodged an estimation of his damages with the poundkeeper and the poundkeeper had nevertheless resigned the creatures up without taking the damages would not an action lay against him as an action lies against a prisonkeeper for a voluntary escape and quære what action would be proper i want a form of an action of escape now   it cannot be called an indirect way of delivering his creatures out of pound to pay or tender the poundkeeper his fees and demand and receive his cattle of him when he has unlocked or opened the pound gate and turned the creatures out so that it will not admit a query whether lambert is liable to an action for receiving his horses of the poundkeeper it is plain i think he is not    monday read a few pages in gilbert i proceed very slowly    tuesday read in gilbert went to monatiquot  to see the raising of the new meeting house no observations worth noting i have not spirits and presence of mind to seek out scenes of observation and to watch critically the air countenances actions and speeches of old men and young men of    old women and young girls of physicians and priests of old maids and bachelors i should chatter with a girl and watch her behavior her answers to questions the workings of vanity and other passions in her breast but objects before me do not suggest proper questions to ask and proper observations to make so dull and confused at present is my mind saw lawyer thachers father  at mr niless he said old colonel thacher of barnstable was an excellent man he was a very holy man i used to love to hear him pray he was a counsellor and a deacon i have heard him say that of all his titles that of a deacon he thought the most honorable quære—is he a new light old age has commonly a sense of the importance and dignity of religion i dare say he is not well pleased with his sons professing the law he had rather have him a deacon    wednesday went to boston bob paine  i have ruined myself by a too eager pursuit of wisdom i have now neither health enough for an active life nor knowledge enough for a sedentary one quincy we shall never make your great fellows thus paine and quincy both are verging to despair paine if i attempt a composition my thoughts are slow and dull paine is discouraged and quincy has not courage enough  to harbor a thought of acquiring a great character in short none of them have a foundation that will support them peter chardon seems to me in the directest road to superiority paines face has lost its bloom and his eye its vivacity and fire his eye is weak his countenance pale and his attention unsteady and what is worse he suffers this decline of health to retard and    almost to stop his studies and quincys soul is afraid to aim at great acquisition paine to me you dont intend to be a sage i suppose oh paine has not penetration to reach the bottom of my mind he dont know me next time i will answer him and say no knowledge enough to keep out of fire and water is all that i aim at    thursday i borrowed yesterday of quincy the first volume of batista angelonis letters  and a general treatise of naval trade and commerce as founded on the laws and statutes of this realm in which those laws and statutes i suppose relating to his majestys customs merchants masters of ships mariners letters of marque privateers prizes convoys cruisers c are particularly considered and treated with due care under all the necessary heads from the earliest time down to the present second edition in two volumes read angeloni through i believe and studied carefully about a dozen pages in mercantile law angelonis letters are all of a piece he has an odd system of faith namely that utility is truth  and therefore that transubstantiation is true and auricular confession is true because they are useful and promote the happiness of mankind therefore rain is true because it is useful in promoting the growth of herbs and fruit and flowers and consequently of animals for mans use this is very different from mathematical truth and this explanation of his meaning gives room to suspect that he disbelieves a revelation himself though he thinks it useful for the world to believe it he reasons who can conceive that a being of infinite wisdom justice and goodness would suffer the world to be governed two thousand years by a religion that was false but may not this question be asked of the mahomedans the chinese in short of every religion under heaven and will not the argument equally prove these all to be true what passion is most active and prevalent in—s mind the desire of money he retails sugar by the pound  by the bunch pins penknives to save these articles in his family and net a few shillings profit he makes poor people who are    in his debt pay him in labor he bargains with his debtors in the two other parishes for wood which he sends to the landing place and to dr marshs thus by practice of physic trading and bargaining and scheming he picks up a subsistence for his family and gathers very gradually additions to his stock but this is low the same application and scheming in his profession would raise up and spread him a character preserve him profitable business and make him his fortune but by this contemptible dissipation of mind among pins needles tea snuffboxes vendues loads of wood day labor c he is negligent of the theory of his profession and will live and die unknown these drivelling souls oh he aims not at fame only at a living and a fortune    saturday rose with the sun i am now set down to the laws relating to naval trade and commerce let me inquire of the next master of a ship that i see what is a bill of lading what the logbook what invoices they keep what accounts they keep of goods received on board and of goods delivered out what in other ports c    sunday conversed with captain thacher about commercial affairs     tuesday rode to boston arrived about half after ten went into the court house and sat down by mr paine at the lawyers table i felt shy under awe and concern for mr gridley mr pratt mr otis mr kent and mr thacher were all present and looked sour i had no acquaintance with anybody but paine and quincy and they took but little notice however i attended court steadily all day and at night went to consort with samuel quincy and dr gardiner there i saw the most spacious and elegant room the gayest company of gentlemen and the finest row of ladies that ever i saw but the weather was so dull and i so disordered that i could not make one half the observations that i wanted to make    wednesday went in the morning to mr gridleys and asked the favor of his advice what steps to take for an introduction to the practice of law in this county he answered    get sworn ego but in order to that sir as i have no patron in this county—g i will recommend you to the court mark the day the court adjourns to in order to make up judgments come to town that day and in the mean time i will speak to the bar for the bar must be consulted because the court always inquires if it be with consent of the bar then mr gridley inquired what method of study i had pursued what latin books i read what greek what french what i had read upon rhetoric then he took his commonplace book and gave me lord hales advice to a student of the common law and when i had read that he gave me lord c j reeves advice to his nephew in the study of the common law then he gave me a letter from dr dickins regius professor of law at the university of cambridge to him pointing out a method of studying the civil law then he turned to a letter he wrote to judge lightfoot judge of the admiralty in rhode island directing to a method of studying the admiralty law then mr gridley run a comparison between the business and studies of a lawyer a gentleman of the bar in england and those of one here a lawyer in this country must study common law and civil law and natural law and admiralty law and must do the duty of a counsellor a lawyer an attorney a solicitor and even of a scrivener so that the difficulties of the profession are much greater here than in england the difficulties that attend the study may discourage some but they never discouraged me here is conscious superiority i have a few pieces of advice to give you mr adams one is to pursue the study of the law rather than the gain of it pursue the gain of it enough to keep out of the briers but give your main attention to the study of it the next is not to marry early for an early marriage will obstruct your improvement and in the next place it will involve you in expense another thing is not to keep much company for the application of a man who aims to be a lawyer must be incessant his attention to his books must be constant which is inconsistent with keeping much company in the study of law the common law be sure deserves your first and last attention and he has conquered all the difficulties of this law who is    master of the institutes you must conquer the institutes the road of science is much easier now than it was when i set out i began with cokelittleton and broke through i asked his advice about studying greek he answered it is a matter of mere curiosity after this long and familiar conversation we went to court attended all day and in the evening i went to ask mr thachers  concurrence with the bar drank tea and spent the whole evening—upon original sin origin of evil the plan of the universe and at last upon law he says he is sorry that he neglected to keep a commonplace book when he began to study law and he is of half a mind to begin now thacher thinks this county is full    thursday went in the morning to wait on mr pratt  he inquired if i had been sworn at worcester no have you a letter from mr putnam to the court no it would have been most proper to have done one of these things first when a young gentleman goes from me into another county i always write in his favor to the court in that county or if you had been sworn there you would have been entitled to be sworn here but now nobody in this county knows any thing about you so nobody can say any thing in your favor but by hearsay i believe you have made a proper proficiency in science and that you will do very well from what i have heard but that is only hearsay how different is this from gridleys treatment besides it is weak for neither the court nor the bar will question the veracity of mr gridley and mr pratt so that the only uncertainty that can remain is whether mr putnam was in earnest in the account he gave of my morals and studies to those gentlemen which cannot be removed by a line from him or by my being sworn at worcester or any other way than by getting mr putnam sworn after this he asked me a few short questions about the course    of my studies which i answered and then came off as full of wrath as i was full of gratitude when i left gridley the morning before pratt is infinitely harder of access than gridley he is illnatured and gridley is goodnatured attended court all day and at night waited on otis  at his office where i conversed with him and he with great ease and familiarity promised me to join the bar in recommending me to the court mr gridley lent me van muydens compendiosa institutionum justiniani tractatio in usum collegiorum editio tertia prioribus auctior et emendatior pax artium altrix after i have mastered this i must read hoppiuss commentary on justinian the design of this book is to explain the technical terms and to settle the divisions and distributions of the civil law by the way this is the first thing a student ought to aim at namely distinct ideas under the terms and a clear apprehension of the divisions and distributions of the science this is one of the principal excellencies of hawkinss pleas of the crown and it is the very end of this book of van muyden let me remark here one important neglect of the last week i omitted minuting the names of the cases at trial in my ivory book and i omitted to keep pen ink and paper at my lodgings in order to commit to writing at night the cases and points of law that were argued and adjudged in the day let me remember to mark in my memorandum book the names of the cases and the terms and points of law that occur in each case to look these terms and points in the books at otiss pratts or any other office and to digest and write down the whole in the evening at my lodgings this will be reaping some real advantage by my attendance on the courts and without this the observations which i may make will lie in total confusion in my mind    0 friday saturday sunday monday all spent in absolute idleness or which is worse gallanting the girls    tuesday sat down and recollected myself and read a little in van muyden a little in naval trade and commerce november   thursday rode as far as smelt brook breakfasted    made my fire and am now set down to van muyden in earnest—his latin is easy his definitions are pretty clear and his divisions of the subject are judicious   sunday drank tea at colonel quincys he read to me a letter colonel gooch  wrote him in answer to his questions whether a justices court was a court of record and then concluded so that sammy was right for he was all along of that opinion i have forgot what your opinion was this must be false or else partiality and parental affection have blotted out the remembrance that i first started to his son sam and him too the doubt whether he had jurisdiction as a justice sam made him really imagine what he wished had been true namely that he samuel had started it if he did remember he knew it was insult to me but i bore it was forgetfulness was partiality or was a cunning design to try if i was not vain of being the starter of the doubt the true cause of his saying he forgot what my opinion was   monday went to town went to mr gridleys office but he had not returned to town from brookline went again not returned attended court till after twelve and began to grow uneasy expecting that quincy would be sworn and i have no patron when mr gridley made his appearance and on sight of me whispered to mr pratt dana kent thacher c about me mr pratt said nobody knew me yes says gridley i have tried him he is a very sensible fellow at last he rose up and bowed to his right hand and said mr quincy—when quincy rose up then he bowed to me mr adams—when i walked out may it please your honors i have two young gentlemen mr quincy and mr adams to present for the oath of an attorney of mr quincy it is sufficient for me to say he has lived three years with mr pratt of mr adams as he is unknown to your honors it is necessary to say that he has lived between two and three years with mr putnam of worcester has a good character from him and all others who know him and that he was with me the other day several hours and i take it he is qualified to study the law by his scholarship and that he has made a very considerable a very great proficiency  0 in the principles of the law and therefore that the clients interest may be safely intrusted in his hands i therefore recommend him with the consent of the bar to your honors for the oath then mr pratt said two or three words and the clerk was ordered to swear us after the oath mr gridley took me by the hand wished me much joy and recommended me to the bar i shook hands with the bar and received their congratulations and invited them over to stones to drink some punch where the most of us resorted and had a very cheerful chat december   or   tuesday bob paine is conceited and pretends to more knowledge and genius than he has i have heard him say that he took more pleasure in solving a problem in algebra than in a frolic he told me the other day that he was as curious after a minute and particular knowledge of mathematics and philosophy as i could be about the laws of antiquity by his boldness in company he makes himself a great many enemies his aim in company is to be admired not to be beloved he asked me what dutch commentator i meant i said vinnius vinnius says he with a flush of real envy but pretended contempt you cannot understand one page of vinnius he must know that human nature is disgusted with such incomplaisant behavior besides he has no right to say that i do not understand every word in vinnius or even in  for he knows nothing of me for the future let me act the part of a critical spy upon him not that of an open unsuspicious friend last superior court at worcester he dined in company with mr gridley mr trowbridge and several others at mr putnams and although a modest attentive behavior would have best become him in such a company yet he tried to    engross the whole conversation to himself he did the same in the evening when all the judges of the superior court with mr winthrop sewall c were present and he did the same last thanksgiving day at colonel quincys when mr wibird mr cranch c were present this impudence may set the million agape at him but will make all persons of sense despise him or hate him that evening at putnams he called me a numskull and a blunderbuss before all the superior judges i was not present indeed but such expressions were indecent and tended to give the judges a low opinion of me as if i was despised by my acquaintances he is an impudent ill bred conceited fellow yet he has wit sense and learning and a great deal of humor and has virtue and piety except his fretful peevish childish complaints against the disposition of things this character is drawn with resentment of his ungenerous treatment of me and allowances must therefore be made but these are unexaggerated facts lambert sets up for a wit and a humorist he is like a little knurly illnatured horse that kicks at every horse of his own size and sheers off from every one that is larger i should mind what i say before him for he is always watching for wry words to make into a droll story to laugh at such fellows are hated by all mankind yet they rise and make a figure and people dread them but though men of bitter wit are hated and feared yet they are respected by the world quære—was there ever a wit who had much humanity and compassion much tenderness of nature mr congreve was tender extremely tender of giving offence to any man dr arbuthnot was a great wit and humorist yet he was tender and prudent mr cranch has wit and is tender and gentle the other night i happened to be at the doctors with ben veasey he began to prate upon the presumption of philosophy in erecting iron rods to draw the lightning from the clouds his brains were in a ferment and he railed and foamed against those points and the presumption that erected them in language taken partly from scripture and partly from the disputes of tavern philosophy in as wild mad a manner as king lear raves against his daughters disobedience and ingratitude and against the meanness of the storm in joining with his daughters against him in shakspeares lear he talked of presuming    upon god as peter attempted to walk upon the water attempting to control the artillery of heaven—an execution that mortal man cant stay—the elements of heaven fire heat rain wind c let me search for the clue which led great shakspeare into the labyrinth of mental nature let me examine how men think shakspeare had never seen in real life persons under the influence of all those scenes of pleasure and distress which he has described in his works but he imagined how a person of such a character would behave in such circumstances by analogy from the behavior of others that were most like that character in nearly similar circumstances which he had seen    monday i this evening delivered to mr field a declaration in trespass for a rescue i was obliged to finish it without sufficient examination if it should escape an abatement it is quite undigested and unclerklike i am ashamed of it and concerned for it if my first writ should be abated if i should throw a large bill of costs on my first client my character and business will suffer greatly it will be said i do not understand my business no one will trust his interest in my hands i never saw a writ on that law of the province i was perplexed and am very anxious about it now i feel the disadvantages of putnams insociability and neglect of me had he given me now and then a few hints concerning practice i should be able to judge better at this hour than i can now i have reason to complain of him but it is my destiny to dig treasures with my own fingers nobody will lend me or sell me a pickaxe how this first undertaking will terminate i know not i hope the dispute will be settled between them or submitted and so my writ never come to an examination but if it should i must take the consequences i must assume a resolution to bear without fretting  0 wednesday i am this forenoon resuming the study of van muyden i begin at the ninetyninth page    thursday yesterday and today i have read aloud tullys four orations against catiline the sweetness and grandeur of his sounds and the harmony of his numbers give pleasure enough to reward the reading if one understood none of his meaning besides i find it a noble exercise it exercises    my lungs raises my spirits opens my pores quickens the circulations and so contributes much to health    tuesday being the evening after christmas the doctor and i spent the evening with mr cleverly and major miller mr cleverly was cheerful alert sociable and complaisant so much good sense and knowledge so much good humor and contentment and so much poverty are not to be found in any other house i believe in this province i am amazed that a man of his ingenuity and sprightliness can be so shiftless but what avails a noisy fame a plentiful fortune and great figure and consideration in this world neither pratt nor gridley mayhew nor eliot stockbridge nor hersey appears more easy and happy with all their wealth and reputation than he with neither    friday let me see if bob paine dont pick up this story to laugh at  lambert will laugh no doubt and will tell the story to every man he sees and will squib me about it whenever he sees me he is impudent and unfair enough to turn this on every occasion to my disadvantage impudence drollery villany in lambert indiscretion inconsideration irresolution and ill luck in me and stinginess as well as ill luck on the side of field—all unite in this case to injure me fields wrath waxed hot this morning when he found himself defeated a second time he wished the affair in hell called lambert a devil and said that is always the way in this town when any strange devil comes into town he has all the privileges of the town let me note the fatal consequences of precipitation my first determination what to do in this affair was right i determined not to meddle but by the cruel reproaches of my mother by the importunities of field and by the fear of having it thought i was incapable of drawing the writ i was seduced from that determination and what is the consequence the writ is defective it will be said i undertook the case but was unable to manage it this nonsuit will be in the mouth of everybody lambert will proclaim it let me never undertake to draw a    writ without sufficient time to examine and digest in my mind all the doubts queries objections that may arise but nobody will know of any abatement except this omission of the county an opinion will spread among the people that i have not cunning enough to cope with lambert i should endeavor at my first setting out to possess the people with an opinion of my subtlety and cunning but this affair certainly looks like a strong proof of the contrary    sunday andrew oliver  is a very sagacious trifler he can decipher with surprising penetration and patience any thing wrote in signs whether english latin or french but to what purpose it is like great skill and dexterity in gaming used only for amusement with all his expertness he never wins any thing but this is his way to fame

point of law or philosophy and your wife should interrupt you accidentally and break the thread of your thoughts so that you never could recover it ego no man but a crooked richard would blame his wife for such an accidental interruption and no woman but a xanthippe would insist upon her husbands company after he had given her his reasons for desiring to be alone o should you like to spend your evenings at home in    reading and conversing with your wife rather than spend them abroad in taverns or with other company ego should prefer the company of an agreeable wife to any other company for the most part not always i should not like to be imprisoned at home o suppose you had been abroad and came home fatigued and perplexed with business or came out of your study wearied and perplexed with study and your wife should meet you with an unpleasant or an inattentive face how should you feel —i would flee my country or she should o how shall a pair avoid falling into a passion or out of humor upon some occasions and treating each other unkindly ego by resolving against it every person knows that all are liable to mistakes and errors and if a husband finds his wife in one he should use reasoning and convince her of it instead of being angry and so on the contrary but if it happens that both get out of humor and an angry dispute ensues yet both will be sorry when their anger

next to virtue and wisdom ought to be aimed at for it is the dictate of wisdom and is necessary to the practice of virtue in most yesterday went down to defend an action for an old horse versus samuel spear this was undertaking the relief of distressed poverty the defence of innocence and justice against oppression and injustice captain thayer and major crosby too had told the plaintiff that he could not maintain his action and advised him to drop it or agree it and thayer spoke out i would have these parties agree i did not clearly understand the case had no time to prepare to fix in my mind beforehand the steps that i should take and captain hollis major miller and captain thayer were all three very active and busy and interested themselves in the suit it was a scene of absolute confusion — major crosby persuading an agreement the parties raging and scolding i arguing and the three volunteers proposing each one his project and all the spectators smiling whispering c my attention was dissipated and i committed oversights omissions inexpert management i should have adhered to the relation my client gave me and believed nothing that came from the other side without proof i should have insisted upon the entry and opposed any motion for an adjournment till next week or continuance till next hour to send for witnesses for madam q could not swear any thing that can support this action i    should have offered to admit all she could say if i had strictly pursued the story that my client told me i should have demanded an entry of the action or else a dismission of the defendant with costs it was equally idle and tame to continue the action to send for a witness and to submit it to referees for the witness if sent for could not support the action and to submit the original debt to referees was to submit nothing for by the original agreement nothing was due the agreement was to take the horse and keep him and if he lived till april to pay two dollars for him but if he died before to pay nothing now he actually died in february and therefore nothing by contract was to be paid the keeping of so old an horse was more than the service he could do was worth the hay he ate would have had more riding and drawing than the horse did through that winter if spear had applied to such as knew he would not have brought the writ but deputy sheriffs petit justices and pettifogging meddlers attempt to draw writs and draw them wrong oftener than they do right they are meddlers hinters and projectors i should have made a motion to the justice that either the defendant or i might be consulted in the settlement of this affair and that — — and — who had no concern with it might not determine it as they pleased the other night the choice of hercules came into my mind    and left impressions there which i hope will never be effaced nor long unheeded i thought of writing a fable on the same plan but accommodated by omitting some circumstances and inserting others to my own case let virtue address me which dear youth will you prefer a life of effeminacy indolence and obscurity or a life of industry temperance and honor take my advice rise and mount your

laziness languor inattention are my bane i am too lazy to rise early and make a fire and when my fire is made at ten oclock my passion for knowledge fame fortune for any good is too languid to make me

his latin as much as his english and understand it as well     preached the best sermon that i ever heard it was plain common sense but other sermons have no sense at all they take the parts of them out of their concordances and connect them together head and tail how greatly elevated above common people and above divines is this lawyer is not this vanity littleness of mind february   i intend a journey to worcester tomorrow how many observations shall i make on the people at weston and worcester and how many new ideas hints rules of law and eloquence shall i acquire before i return let my journal answer this question after my return   at weston in dr webbs chamber at hammonds his landlady is an odd woman she seems goodnatured and obliging too but she has so many shrugs grimaces affectations of wit cunning and humor as make her ridiculous she is awkward shamefaced bashful yet would fain seem sprightly witty c she is a squaddy masculine creature with a swarthy pale face a great staring rolling eye a rare collection of disagreeable qualities i have read several letters this afternoon and evening in the turkish spy     worcester i have been in this town a week this night how much have i improved my health by exercise or my mind by study or conversation in this space i have exercised little eat and drank and slept intemperately have inquired a little of mr putnam and of abel willard concerning some points of practice in law but dining once at colonel chandlers once at mr paines once at the doctors drinking tea once at mr paines once at the doctors and spending one evening at the doctors one at gardners and several at putnams in company has wasted insensibly the greatest and best part of my time since i have been in town oh how i have fulfilled the vain boast i made to dr webb of reading twelve hours a day what a fine scene of study    is this office  a fine collection of law oratory history and philosophy but i must not stay i must return to braintree i must attend a long superior court at boston how shall i pursue my plan of study braintree mr marsh father flynt  has been very gay and sprightly this sickness colonel quincy went to see him a fast day and was or appeared to be as he was about taking leave of the old gentleman very much affected the tears flowed very fast i hope sir says he in a voice of grief you will excuse my passions ay prithee says the old man i dont care much for you nor your passions neither morris said to him you are going sir to abrahams bosom but i dont know but i shall reach there first ay if you are going there i dont want to go   i spent one evening this week at billy belchers i sat book in hand on one side of the fire while doctor wendell billy belcher and stephen cleverly and another young gentleman sat in silence round the card table all the evening two evenings i spent at samuel quincys in the same manner doctor gardiner henry quincy ned quincy and samuel quincy all playing cards the whole evening this is the wise and salutary amusement that young gentlemen take every evening in this town playing cards drinking punch and wine smoking tobacco and swearing c c while a hundred of the best books lie on the shelves desks and chairs in the same room this is not misspense of time this is a wise a profitable improvement of time—cards and backgammon are fashionable diversions i know not how any young fellow can study in this town what pleasure can a young gentleman who is capable of thinking take in playing cards it gratifies none of the senses neither sight hearing taste smelling nor feeling it can    entertain the mind only by hushing its clamors cards backgammon c are the great antidotes to reflection to thinking that cruel tyrant within us what learning or sense are we to expect from young gentlemen in whom a fondness for cards c outgrows and chokes the desire of knowledge march    reputation ought to be the perpetual subject of my thoughts and aim of my behavior how shall i gain a reputation how shall i spread an opinion of myself as a lawyer of distinguished genius learning and virtue shall i make frequent visits in the neighborhood and converse familiarly with men women and children in their own style on the common tittletattle of the town and the ordinary concerns of a family and so take every fair opportunity of showing my knowledge in the law but this will require much thought and time and a very particular knowledge of the province law and common matters of which i know much less than i do of the roman law shall i endeavor to renew my acquaintance with those young gentlemen in boston who were at college with me and to extend my acquaintance among merchants shopkeepers tradesmen c and mingle with the crowd upon change and traipse the townhouse floor with one and another in order to get a character in town but this too will be a lingering method and will require more art and address and patience too than i am master of shall i by making remarks and proposing questions to the lawyers at the bar endeavor to get a great character for understanding and learning with them but this is slow and tedious and will be ineffectual for envy jealousy and selfinterest will not suffer them to give a young fellow a free generous character especially me neither of these projects will bear examination will avail shall i look out for a cause to speak to and exert all the soul and all the body i own to cut a flash strike amazement to catch the vulgar in short shall i walk a lingering heavy pace or shall i take one bold determined leap into the midst of fame cash and business that is the question—a bold push a resolute attempt a determined enterprise or a slow silent imperceptible creeping shall i creep or fly i feel vexed fretted chafed the thought of no business mortifies stings me but let me banish these fears let me assume a fortitude a greatness of mind    in such a slow gradual ascent to fame and fortune and business the pleasure that they give will be imperceptible but by a bold sudden rise i shall feel all the joys of each at once have i genius and resolution and health enough for such an achievement means not but blunders round about a meaning m—has a very confused blundering way of asking questions she never knows distinctly what she is after but asks at random any thing and has a difficulty of recollecting the names of things the names of things do not flow naturally into my mind when i have occasion to use them i had the idea of the general court in my mind when i said to otis the judges had some important business to do in c but the words general court did not arise with the idea and therefore otis thought i made a silly speech my aunt c—has the same difficulty of recollecting words and ideas too especially of things that are some time past a slothful memory—a slow heavy memory in opposition to a quick prompt memory common people are not incapable of discerning the motives and springs of words and actions    monday this whole day is dedicated to walking riding talk c no reading today it was avarice not compassion that induced—to pass the last court he was afraid that p—would be provoked to appeal both to the superior court if he put both in suit and so keep him out of his money six or eight months six months without interest it is fear of losing the interest upon interest that induces him to pass this court oh love of money oh avarice disguised under the show of compassion   oh but a wit can study in the streets   and raise his mind above the mob he meets     who can study in boston streets i am unable to observe the various objects that i meet with sufficient precision my eyes are so diverted with chimneysweepers sawyers of wood merchants ladies priests carts horses oxen coaches marketmen and women soldiers sailors and my ears with the rattlegabble of them all that i cannot think long enough in the street upon any one thing to start and pursue a thought i cannot raise my mind above this mob crowd of men women beasts and carriages to think steadily my attention is solicited every moment by some new object of sight or some new sound a coach cart a lady or a priest may at any time by breaking a couplet disconcert a whole page of excellent thoughts what is meant by a nodding beam and pig of lead  he means that his attention is necessary to preserve his life and limbs as he walks the street for sheets of lead may fall from the roofs of houses i know of no nodding beam except at the hay market shebbeares dedication is in a strain of ironical humorous satire he reasons as warmly and positively as if in earnest in his favor but his reasoning is so manifestly weak and in some places ambiguous that every reader knows his true intention this system of religion is indeed new religious institutions are mere means of increasing and preserving piety and virtue in the world and any thing that will produce public and private advantages on the happiness and morals of a nation however repugnant to common sense as transubstantiation e g is true april   sunday spent the evening at captain brackets a case was proposed and my opinion asked which gave me opportunity to display some knowledge of law but betrayed me into mistaken dogmatism i am frequently exposing my ignorance of the province law but things are started that put me upon examination it is in vain to expect felicity without an habitual contempt of fortune fame beauty praise and all such things unaffected    benevolence to men and conscious integrity are sufficient supports i have no money but i have an easy heart a quiet mind god made us to be happy i distress myself this animi magnitudo and rerum humanarum contemptio are alone secure of happiness oh stoics you are wise what passions or affections in human nature are affected by satire by humor and drollery there is some affection in human nature which is delighted with humor and satire for a good deal of it is to be seen and heard in all nations and among all ranks of people it prevails in every country parish may be found in every tavern at every town meeting through the province f oh blessed storm the storm blowed me away oh blessed storm this was spoken in person of one of the new selectmen as bracket thayer c and upon this secret principle that an advantage had been meanly taken of the thinness of the meeting to get a change of town officers so that it hinted at their meanness and want of influence in town their influence was not sufficient to have carried a vote had the town been together but they were mean enough to seize the opportunity when three fourths of the town were detained at home by the storm to assemble their crew of debtors and laborers and accomplish their projects as they pleased thus the wit of this lay in hinting at their meanness of soul and insignificancy in the town it hinted that the point was carried not by merit nor by real popularity but by mean and clandestine artifice and plotting how great is the dread of satire and ridicule in human nature mrs s is afraid of colonel quincy and his wife he will laugh at her shape dress behavior i used to dread j o and b k because i suspected they laughed at me i used to dread putnam because of his satirical and contemptuous smiles another reason we were pleased to see the old gentleman diverting himself and laughing at the success of their artifices to depose him instead of being angry and scolding what passions are pleased in the reader or hearer and what are vexed in the person ridiculed    ruggless  grandeur consists in the quickness of his apprehension steadiness of his attention the boldness and strength of his thoughts and expressions his strict honor conscious superiority contempt of meanness c people approach him with dread and terror gridleys grandeur consists in his great learning his great parts and his majestic manner but it is diminished by stiffness and affectation ruggles is as proud as lordly as gridley but he is more popular he conceals it more he times it better and it is easy and natural in him but is stiff and affected in gridley it is an advantage to ruggless character but a disadvantage to gridleys gridley has a bold spirited manner of speaking but is too stiff has too little command of the muscles of his face his words seem to pierce and search to have something quick and animating he is a great reasoner and has a very vivid imagination pratt has a strong elastic spring or what we call smartness and strength in his mind his ideas seem to lie deep and to be brought up with a strong effort of the mind his ideas are vivid and he sees their differences otis is extremely quick and elastic his apprehension is as quick as his temper he springs and twitches his muscles about in thinking thacher has not the same strength and elasticity he is sensible but slow of conception and communication he is queer and affected—he is not easy colonel quincy i learned to write letters of pope and swift c i should not have wrote a letter with so much correctness as i can if i had not read and imitated them the faculty has come to me strangely without any formed design of acquiring it there is a concealed encomium on himself his    own letters in this remark but there is an observation too which is worth considering men wear themselves by slow and imperceptible degrees into confirmed habits of thinking speaking and acting he began early in life i suppose perhaps at college to read those smooth soft writers and although he never formed any design of imitating their ease and politeness yet he gradually wore it into his mind he learned to write as children learn to speak without thinking what they do perhaps had he formed a design in his youth of acquiring that faculty and read authors with that design he would have acquired it much sooner and more perfectly the principle in nature is imitation association of ideas and contracting habits how naturally we imitate without design or with modes of thinking speaking acting that please us thus we conform gradually to the manners and customs of our own family neighborhood town province nation c at worcester i learned several turns of mind of putnam and at boston i find myself imitating otis c but quære—who will learn the art soonest and most perfectly he who reads without a design of extracting beauties or he who reads with the last undoubtedly design attends and observes nicely and critically i learned with design to imitate putnams sneer his sly look and his look of contempt this look may serve good ends in life may procure respect to form a style therefore read constantly the best authors get a habit of clear thinking and strength and propriety and harmony of expression this one principle of imitation would lead me through the whole human system a faculty acquired accidentally without any endeavors or foresight of the effect he read for amusement not to learn to write let me recollect and con over all the phenomena of imitation that i may take advantage of this principle in my own case that i may learn easier and sooner the road is walled on each side with a grove of trees the stillness silence and the uniformity of the prospect put the mind into a stirring thoughtful mood but the reflections that are made in a grove are forgotten in the town and the man who resembles a saint in his thoughts in the first shall resemble a devil in his actions in the last    in such silent scenes as riding or walking through the woods or sitting alone in my chamber or lying awake in my bed my thoughts commonly run upon knowledge virtue books c though i am apt to forget these in the distracting bustle of the town and ceremonious converse with mankind this morning rode to moses frenchs to get him to serve a writ for me he told me he was not yet sworn but was obliged to me for coming to him and would be glad to serve me at any time and would now rather than it should be any damage to me thus he was pleased i hope secured men are only secured by falling in with their inclination by favoring their hopes clearing their prospects then i went to waless he was not at home i followed him to germantown he served the writ we returned together he seemed quite pleasant told me the practice of the two— they drive a great stroke there is—— are all pettifogging dabblers in iniquity and law i might except— and perhaps— from the iniquitous part i hope that wales and french are secured to me how they love—i cannot say i hope they will recommend me to persons that they hear speaking of business as william veasey did veasey knew me and mentioned me to s— the difference between a whole day and a divided scattered day quære—can any man take a book into his hand in the morning and confine his thoughts to that till night is not such a uniformity tiresome is not variety more agreeable and profitable too read one book one hour then think an hour then exercise an hour then read another book an hour then dine smoke walk cut wood read aloud another hour then think c and thus spend the whole day in perpetual variation from reading to thinking exercise company c but what is to be argued by this wavering life but a habit of levity and impatience of thought i never spent a whole day upon one book in my life what is the reason that i cannot remove all papers and books from my table take one volume into my hands and read it and then reflect upon it till night without wishing for my pen and ink to write a letter or take down any  0 other book or think of the girls because i cant command my attention my thoughts are roving from girls to friends from friends to court to worcester newbury and then to greece and rome then to law from poetry to oratory and law oh a rambling imagination could i fix my attention and keep off every fluttering thought that attempts to intrude upon the present subject i could read a book all day   wisdom curse on it will come soon or late             ill learn to smooth and harmonize my mind   teach every thought within its bounds to roll   and keep the equal measure of the soul accidents as we call them govern a great part of the world especially marriages s—and e—broke in upon h—and me and interrupted a conversation that would have terminated in a courtship which would have terminated in a marriage which marriage might have depressed me to absolute poverty and obscurity to the end of my life but that accident separated us and gave room for—s addresses which have delivered me from very dangerous shackles and left me at liberty if i will but mind my studies of making a character and a fortune now let me collect my thoughts which have been long scattered among girls father mother grandmother brothers matrimony hustling chat provisions clothing fuel servants for a family and apply them with steady resolution and an aspiring spirit to the prosecution of my studies now let me form the great habits of thinking writing speaking let my whole courtship be applied to win the applause and admiration of gridley pratt otis thacher c let love and vanity be extinguished and the great passions of ambition patriotism break out and burn let little objects be neglected and forgot and great ones engross arouse and exalt my soul the mind must be aroused or it will slumber i found a passion growing in my heart and a consequent habit of thinking forming and strengthening in my mind that would have ate out every seed of ambition in the first and every wise design or plan in the last yesterday afternoon a plea puis darein continuance was argued    by mr pratt for the plea and gridley and otis against it the plea was that after the last continuance and before the first day of the sitting of this court this term namely on such a day one allen one of the plaintiffs died mr pratt argued that the writ must abate for it was clear law that the writ in this case was ipso facto abated and might be dismissed at the motion of any person as amicus curiæ and of this opinion was the whole court gridley took an exception to the plea as imperfect in not giving the plaintiff a better writ the whole afternoon was spent in arguing this point and twenty volumes of institutes and reporters i suppose were produced as authorities otis aside it makes me laugh to see pratt lug a cartload of books into court to prove a point as clear as the sun the action is as dead as a hub otis i will grant mr pratt very readily that there has been a time since william the conqueror when this plea would have abated this writ in england but i take it that abatements at this day are rather odious than favored and i dont believe that this plea could abate this writ at any time within this century in westminster hall is it not absurd to study all arts but that of living in the world and all sciences but that of mankind popularity is the way to gain and figure the arts of gain are necessary you may get more by studying town meeting and training days than you can by studying justinian and all his voluminous and heavy commentators mix with the crowd in a tavern in the meetinghouse or the training field and grow popular by your agreeable assistance in the tittletattle of the hour never think of the deep hidden principles of natural civil or common law for thoughts like these will give you a gloomy countenance and a stiff behavior i should talk with t— l— c— c c about changing horses offer to change or sell trade in any thing it is certain that retirement will lose its charms if it is not interrupted by business and activity i must converse and deal with mankind and move and stir from one scene of action and debate and business and pleasure and conversation to another and grow weary of all before i shall feel the strong    desire of retiring to contemplation on men and business and pleasure and books after hard labor at husbandry reading and reflection in retirement will be a relief and a high refined pleasure after attending a town meeting watching the intrigues arts passions speeches that pass there a retreat to reflect compare distinguish will be highly delightful so after a training day after noting the murmurs complaints jealousies impudence envy that pass in the field i shall be pleased with my solitude transitions from study to business from business to conversation and pleasure will make the revolution of study still more agreeable and perhaps not less profitable for we are very apt in total retirement to forget the sciences and to smoke and trifle and drone it too much i have been very negligent and faulty in not treating deacon s— nat b— deacon b— c with more attention and sprightliness i should bow and look pleasant to deacon s— and talk with him about news war ministers sermons c should watch critically every word that nat b—says and let him see by the motions of the muscles of my face that i have discernment between wise and foolish witty and silly candid and illnatured grave and humorous speeches and let him know on proper occasions i can vent a smart repartee should always speak and shake hands with the deacon inquire after his wife sons c and humor his talkative disposition it is of no small importance to set the tongues of old and young men and women a prating in ones favor as to doctor savil and his wife i have dismissed all my guards before them and acted and spoken at random i might easily gain their warmest words and assiduous assistance by visiting seldomer by using tender and soothing instead of rough and reproachful language and by complying with their requests of riding out with her and reading plays once in a while to them in the evening but i have been rash boastful profane uncivil blustering threatening before them let me remark parson wibirds popularity he plays with babies and young children that begin to prattle and talks with their mothers asks them familiar pleasant questions about their affection to their children he has a familiar careless way of conversing with people men and women he has wit and humor ripping that is using the words faith devil i swear damnable    cursed c displeases the doctor but especially his wife threatening to quarrel with thayer penniman hollis c disgusts them especially her asserting dogmatically on points of province law which he knows more of than i by several years experience and conversation with people concerning their estates lawsuits c and being fretted disgust them very much i have more faults mistakes imprudences follies rashness to answer for in the doctors house than in all the town besides i am to attend a vendue this afternoon at lamberts my father bracket and thayer are a committee to lease out the town lands to the highest bidder let me remark the management of the sale and the behavior of persons especially of thayer and bracket watch his treatment of people and their treatment of him let me ask myself this question when i return what have i seen heard learned what hint observed to lift myself into business what reputation or disgrace have i got by attending this vendue my character will be spread and mended or injured by it i was consulted by two men this afternoon who would not have applied to me if i had not been at vendue—e niles and elijah belcher and the questions they asked have led me into useful thoughts and inquiries i find hints and inquiries arise sooner in the world than in my study it would be an agreeable and useful speculation to inquire into that faculty which we call imagination define it inquire the good ends it answers in the human system and the evils it sometimes produces what is the use of imagination it is the repository of knowledge by this faculty are retained all the ideas of visible objects all the observations we have made in the course of life on men and things ourselves c i am conscious that i have the faculty of imagination that i can at pleasure revive in my thoughts the ideas and assemblages of ideas that have been before in my mind can revive the scenes diversions sports of childhood youth can recall my youthful rambles to the farms frolics dalliances my lonely walks through the groves and swamps and fields and meadows at worcester    can imagine myself with the wildest tribe of indians in america in their hunting their wars their tedious marches through wild swamps and mountains can fly by this faculty to the moon planets fixed stars unnumbered worlds can cross the atlantic and fancy myself in westminster hall hearing causes in the courts of justice or the debates in the house of commons or lords as all our knowledge is acquired by experience that is by sensation or reflection this faculty is necessary to retain the ideas we receive and the observations we make and to recall them for our use as occasion requires i am conscious too that this faculty is very active and stirring it is constantly in action unless interrupted by the presence of external objects by reading or restrained by attention it hates restraint it runs backward to past scenes c or forward to the future it flies into the air dives in the sea rambles to foreign countries or makes excursions to foreign planetary starry worlds these are but hints irregular observations not digested into order but what are the defects of this faculty what are the errors vices habits it may betray us into if not searched what is the danger i must know all the ends of this faculty and all its phenomena before i can know all its defects its phenomena are infinitely various in different men and its ends are different therefore its defects must be almost infinitely various but all its defects may be reduced to general laws the sphere of imagination includes both actuality and possibility not only what is but what may be thacher pownals style is better than shirleys shirley never promoted any man for merit alone if satan himself were incarnate and in competition with parson wells for the election i would vote for old harry i cant think that any man of true good sense can be so vain and fond of talking of himself as parson wells tully was not a vain man the vainest thing that ever he said was in his oration for muræna that if they provoked him he would profess himself a lawyer in three days i wish myself a soldier i look upon these private soldiers with their guns upon their shoulders as superior to me these are all wild extravagant loose opinions and expressions he expresses himself as wildly as colonel chandler—wild flights    he has not considered that these crude thoughts and wild expressions are catched and treasured as proofs of his character he is extremely tender and sensible of pleasure and of pain kent  is for fun drollery humor flouts jeers contempt he has an irregular immethodical head but his thoughts are often good and his expressions happy thachers passions are easily touched his shame his compassion his fear his anger c fortune has burned colonel quincys house and some of his furniture  fortune is a capricious goddess she diverts herself with men she bestows her favors sometimes with very great profusion on a man and within a few years she strips him even of necessaries it is a fluctuating state we are tossed on the waves sometimes to heaven and then sunk down to the bottom that house and furniture clung and twined round his heart and could not be torn away without tearing to the quick is it possible to preserve a serene undisturbed mind through such a fire and the consequences of it there is in human nature an attainable magnanimity which can see a valuable house full of furniture consuming in flames a friend a child a wife struggling in the agonies of death without a sigh a tear or a painful sensation or reflection the felicis animi immota tranquillitas the immovable tranquillity of a happy mind unmoved by perils of water or of fire unmoved by any losses accidents by loss of wealth of fame of friends c—happy mind indeed cannot a mind be called happy unless its tranquillity its ease its rest is immovable invincible    it is not at all surprising that the colonel is more dejected than his brother was for though his brothers reduction was more complete yet the colonels was less expected ned was reduced to be worse than nothing josiah has a competency left but josiahs loss was entirely unforeseen unexpected and unprepared for neds was i presume familiarly known and considered by him at least beforehand edmund lost a son as suddenly as the colonel lost his house and he showed as much anxiety too he could not sleep all night after he heard of it the colonels grief is more eloquent than neds disappointments are misery if a man takes pride and pleasure in a house or in rich furniture or clothing or in any thing how is it possible for him to be satisfied when they are lost destroyed consumed   not to admire is all the art i know   to make men happy and to keep them so colonel admired his house it is burned he is unhappy c they are burned he is unhappy i made some observations on barberry bushes sumach caterpillars c inquire the properties of isinglass and of carpenters glue how the first attracts all the pumice and sediment in cider to the bottom and the latter to the top inquire how the juice lies in the apple what is the cause of its natural fermentation and inquire the operation of artificial fermentation you regret your loss  but why was you fond of seeing or of thinking that others saw and admired so stately a pile or was you pleased with viewing the convenient and elegant contrivance of the inside and with showing to others how neatly it was finished is it the pleasure of seeing with your own eyes the elegance and grandeur of your house or is it the pleasure of imagining that others admired it and admired or envied you    for it that you regret the loss of did you suppose that you was esteemed and regarded for the beauty and conveniency of your house or are you mortified to think that your enemies will be gratified at your misfortune if these are the sources of your grief it is irrational unmanly for the friendship that is founded on your figure and estate is not worth preserving and the man who can rejoice at your loss is not worth attention but if you consider it as a punishment of your vices and follies as a frown that is designed to arouse your attention to things of a more permanent nature you should not grieve but rejoice that the great parent of the world has thus corrected you for your good figure and show may indeed attract the eyes and admiration of the vulgar but are little very little regarded by wise men is it not rational noble to dote on the pleasure of viewing a fine horse and being seen by others to ride such a one a fine horse riches learning make people stare at me and talk about me and a mighty boon this to be stared at and talked of by people that i despise and all that i regard will love and honor me for acquisitions that i have power to make and which cannot be torn from me wisdom and virtue are not dependent on the elements of fire or water air or earth how should i bear bob paines detraction should i be angry and take vengeance by scandalizing him or should i be easy undisturbed and praise him as far as he is praiseworthy—return good for evil i should have been as well pleased if he had said i was a very ingenious promising young fellow but as it is i am pretty easy    sometime in      or     mr samuel quincy with whom i sometimes corresponded showed to mr jonathan sewall a lawyer somewhat advanced before us at the bar some juvenile letters of mine of no consequence which however sewall thought discovered a mind awake to the love of literature and law and insisted on being acquainted with me and writing to me his acquaintance and correspondence were readily embraced by me and continued for many years till political disputes grew so warm as to separate us a little before the war was commenced his courtship of miss esther quincy a daughter of edmund quincy brought him to braintree commonly on saturdays where he remained till monday and gave us frequent opportunities of meeting besides those at court in boston charlestown and cambridge he possessed a lively wit a pleasing humor a brilliant imagination great subtlety of reasoning and an insinuating eloquence his sentiments of public affairs were for several years conformable to mine and he once proposed to me to write in concert in the public prints to stir up the people to militia duty and military ardor and was fully of my opinion that the british ministry and parliament would force us to an appeal to arms but he was poor and mr trowbridge and governor hutchinson contrived to excite him to a quarrel with mr otis because in the general court colonel otis and his son had not very warmly supported a petition for a grant to discharge the debt of his uncle the late chief justice who died insolvent to this artifice they added another which wholly converted him by giving him the office of solicitorgeneral i know not that i have ever delighted more in the friendship of any man or more deeply regretted an irreconcilable difference in judgment in public opinions he had virtues to be esteemed qualities to be loved and talents to be admired but political principles were to me in that state of the country sacred i could not follow him and he could not follow me    john adams october      jonathan sewall extract of a letter to jonathan sewall this extract is copied upon the first page of one of the small paper books used for this diary it was placed here for a guide to the writers studies as appears from several subsequent references october      the true end which we ought to have in view is that præclarum ac singulare quiddam which follows here tis impossible to employ with full advantage the forces of our own minds in study in council or in argument without examining with great attention and exactness all our mental faculties in all their operations as explained by writers on the human understanding and as exerted by geometricians tis impossible to judge with much precision of the true motives and qualities of human actions or of the propriety of rules contrived to govern them without considering with like attention all the passions appetites affections in nature from which they flow an intimate knowledge therefore of the intellectual and moral world is the sole foundation on which a stable structure of knowledge can be erected and the structure of british laws is composed of such a vast and various collection of materials taken partly from saxony normandy and denmark partly from greece and rome and partly from the canon and feudal law that tis impossible for any builder to comprehend the whole vast design and see what is well and what is ill contrived or jointed without acquainting himself with saxon danish norman as well as greek and roman history with civil feudal and canon law besides all this tis impossible to avail ourselves of the genuine powers of eloquence without examining in their elements and first principles the force and harmony of numbers as employed by the poets and orators in ancient and modern times and without considering the natural powers of imagination and the disposition of mankind to metaphor and figure which will require the knowledge of the true principles of grammar and rhetoric and of the best classical authors now to what higher object to what greater character can any mortal aspire than to be possessed of all this knowledge well digested and ready at command to assist the feeble and friendless to discountenance the haughty and lawless to procure  0 redress of wrongs the advancement of right to assert and maintain liberty and virtue to discourage and abolish tyranny and vice  october    began in pursuance of the foregoing plan to transcribe from brightlands english grammar answers to mr gridleys questions for that grammar i have begun too to compare dr cowells institutes of the laws of england with justinians institutes of the laws of rome title by title that    each may reflect light upon the other and that i may advance my knowledge of civil and common law at the same time    0 may    monday spent the evening at mr edmund quincys with mr wibird and my cousin zab mr quincy told a remarkable instance of mr benjamin franklins activity and resolution to improve the productions of his own country for from that source it must have sprung or else from an unheard of stretch of benevolence to a stranger mr franklin happening upon a visit to his germantown friends to be at mr wibirds meeting was asked after meeting in the afternoon to drink tea at mr quincys the conversation turned upon the qualities of american soil and the different commodities raised in these provinces among the rest mr franklin mentioned that the rhenish grape vines had been introduced into pennsylvania and that some had been lately planted in philadelphia and succeeded very well mr quincy said upon it i wish i could get some into my garden i doubt not they would do very well in this province mr franklin replied sir if i can supply you with some of the cuttings i shall be glad to quincy thanked him and said i dont know but some time or other i shall presume to trouble you and so the conversation passed off within a few weeks mr quincy was surprised with a letter from some of franklins friends in boston that a bundle of these rhenish slips were ready for him these came by water well soon afterwards he had another message that another parcel of slips were left for him by the post the next time mr franklin was in boston mr quincy waited on him to thank him for his slips but i am sorry sir to give you so much trouble o sir says franklin the trouble is nothing to me if the vines do but succeed in your province however i was obliged to take more pains than i expected when i saw you i had been told that the vines were in the city but i found none and was obliged to send up to a village seventy miles from the city for them thus he took the trouble to hunt over the city and not finding vines there he sends seventy miles into the country and then sends one bundle by water and lest they should miscarry another by land to a gentleman whom he owed nothing and was but little acquainted with purely for the sake of doing good in the world by propagating the rhenish vines through these provinces and mr quincy has some of them now growing    in his garden this is an instance too of his amazing capacity for business his memory and resolution amidst so much business as counsellor postmaster printer so many private studies and so many public avocations too to remember such a transient hint and exert himself so in answer to it is surprising     this rhenish wine is made of a grape that grows in germany upon the river rhine from which it receives its name and is very famous all over europe let me remember to look in chambers under rhenish and in salmons geography under the produce of the countries upon the rhine for more particulars of this vine and grape and wine the soil it delights in the method of cultivation what digging what manure what pruning c let me ask mr quincy whether the soil of his garden suits them and what sorts and how many sorts of grapes he has dont they require more heat than we have for them where he got his other slips where he got his lime trees c    wednesday loitered the forenoon away upon this question in arithmetic  in the afternoon zab  and i wandered down to germantown on foot running a parallel between the pleasures profits freedom ease and uses of the several professions especially physic and divinity    thursday rose and breakfasted have done nothing yet today and god only knows what i shall do the question of the pipe  i must run over fractions again vulgar and decimal as well as algebraical and now and then a few questions in fenning and hammond and ward or else i shall totally forget my numbers i find that the art of numbering depends upon practice and in a short disuse they will slip from the memory a journal scrawled with algebraical signs and interspersed with questions of law husbandry natural history c will be a useful thing the principal uses however will be to correct my style and assist my memory give me a true compunction for the waste of time and urge me of course to a better improvement of it besides writing is one of the greatest pleasures and it sooner rouses my ambition warms my imagination and fixes me in a train of thinking than any other thing that i can do than sitting still with my eyes shut or than holding a book to    read mem last sunday after meeting mr cranch explained to us at doctor tuftss the machines that are used in the mines of coal in newcastle and of tin in cornwall to convey up water from the bottom of the mine they go upon the principles of elastic air and rarefied vapor they have hollow globes of plaited iron or of copper which will hold some barrels which they heat with great fires and have tubes and cocks and can cast up great quantities of water many hogsheads in a minute but i have forgot the construction of the machines as well as the method of working them here is my failing or one of my failings my attention has not been keen enough to understand and fix in my memory the explications of many of these machines etter explained to me his stocking looms but i could not when i left him have run from the first motion to the complete formation of a stocking i did not see through it cranch once explained to me the machine that draws water from the thames into the canals under the city of london and that sends water up into their garrets chambers rooms and cellars so that by opening a cock you may draw a pail of water from the thames in any house in the city almost but i do not remember the construction of it let me remember to inquire of him about the construction of these two that for water from the thames and that for water from the mines and to go once more to see the stocking looms few things i believe have deviated so far from the first design of their institution are so fruitful of destructive evils or so needful of a speedy regulation as licensed houses the accommodation of strangers and perhaps of town inhabitants on public occasions are the only warrantable intentions of a tavern and the supply of the neighborhood with necessary liquors in small quantities  and at the cheapest rates are the only excusable designs of a retailer and that these purposes may be effected it is necessary that both should be selected from the most virtuous and wealthy people who will accept the trust and so few of each should be erected that the profits may enable them to make the best provision at a moderate price but at    the present day such houses are become the eternal haunt of loose disorderly people of the same town which renders them offensive and unfit for the entertainment of a traveller of the least delicacy and it seems that poverty and distressed circumstances are become the strongest arguments to procure an approbation and for these assigned reasons such multitudes have been lately licensed that none can afford to make provision for any but the tippling nasty vicious crew that most frequent them the consequences of these abuses are obvious young people are tempted to waste their time and money and to acquire habits of intemperance and idleness that we often see reduce many to beggary and vice and lead some of them at last to prisons and the gallows the reputation of our county is ruined among strangers who are apt to infer the character of a place from that of the taverns and the people they see there but the worst effect of all and which ought to make every man who has the least sense of his privileges tremble these houses are become in many places the nurseries of our legislators an artful man who has neither sense nor sentiment may by gaining a little sway among the rabble of a town multiply taverns and dram shops and thereby secure the votes of taverner and retailer and of all and the multiplication of taverns will make many who may be induced by flip and rum to vote for any man whatever i dare not presume to point out any method to suppress or restrain these increasing evils but i think for these reasons it would be well worth the attention of our legislature to confine the number of and retrieve the character of licensed houses lest that impiety and profaneness that abandoned intemperance and prodigality that impudence and brawling temper which these abominable nurseries daily propagate should arise at length to a degree of strength that even the legislature will not be able to control pownals remark every other house a tavern twelve in this town call upon the selectmen not to grant approbation upon the grand jurors to present all bad houses c  0 friday rose early several country towns within my observation have at least a dozen taverns and retailers here the time the money the health and the modesty of most that are young and of many old are wasted here diseases vicious habits bastards and legislators are frequently begotten n—    would vote for any man for a little flip or a dram b c voted for t for other reasons    saturday read in naval trade and commerce concerning factors consuls ambassadors c and the south sea company c talked with william veasey about church c he will not allow that dr mayhew has any uncommon parts he had haughty spirits and vanity c how the judgment is darkened and perverted by party passions drank tea with zab ran over the past passages of my life—little boats watermills windmills whirligigs birds eggs bows and arrows guns singing pricking tunes girls c ignorance of parents masters cleverly marsh tutors mayhew c by a constant dissipation among amusements in my childhood and by the ignorance of my instructors in the more advanced years of my youth my mind has laid uncultivated so that at twentyfive i am obliged to study horace and homer—proh dolor june   sunday read two odes in horace spent the evening at the colonels   monday wasted the day with a magazine in my hand as it was artillery election it seemed absurd to study and i had no conveniences or companions for pleasure either in walking riding drinking hustling or any thing else   tuesday this day has been lost in much the same spiritless manner   wednesday read nothing but magazines as indeed an indisposition rendered me unfit for any application discharged my venom to billy veasey against the multitude poverty ill government and ill effects of licensed houses and the timorous temper as well as criminal design of the selectmen who grant them approbations  then spent the evening with zab at mr wibirds   thursday arose late feel disordered eight oclock three and a half hours after sunrise is a sluggards rising time it is a stupid waste of so much time it is getting a habit hard to conquer and it is very hurtful to ones health three and a half oneseventh of the twentyfour is thus spiritlessly dozed away god grant me an attention to remark and a resolution    to pursue every opportunity for the improvement of my mind and to save with the parsimony of a miser every moment of my time   friday arose very late a cold rainy northeasterly storm of several days continuance read timon of athens the manhater in the evening at the doctors   saturday arose late again when shall i shake off the shackles of morning slumbers and arise with the sun between sunrise and breakfast i might write or read or contemplate a good deal i might before breakfast entirely shake off the drowsiness of the morning and get my thoughts into a steady train my imagination raised my ambition inflamed in short every thing within me and without into a preparation for improvement i have some points of law to examine today   sunday spent the evening and night at the colonels in illnatured invidious remarks upon eb thayer and morals and general courts c   monday attended major crosbys court where captains t and h made their appearance t had taken two accounts of nathan spear in his own handwriting and got the writs drawn by niles but upon my making a defence for hunt spear was afraid to enter and so agreed to pay costs and drop but poor t had to say several times i told him so but he would have his own way this little dirty pettifogging trade t carries on yet  0 tuesday although my spirits were wasted yesterday by sitting so late the night before till one oclock i believe and rising so early yesterday morning by sunrise and walking in the dewy grass and damp air home to my fathers and then down to major crosbys yet the thoughts of being employed and of opposing captain t and punishing nathan spear and spreading a reputation roused my faculties and rolled out thoughts and expressions with a strength and rapidity that i never expected i remember something of the same sort when i first waited on mr gridley the awe of his presence a desire of his esteem and of an introduction to practice quickened my attention and memory and sharpened my penetration in short i never shall shine till some animating occasion calls forth all my powers  i find that the mind must be agitated with some    passion either love fear hope c before she will do her best i rambled this afternoon with the doctor over the commons and amused myself by clearing the spring and climbing the ledges of rocks through the apertures of which large trees had grown but i spend too much time in these walks these amusing rambles i should be more confined to my chamber should read and muse more running to dr— to the barn down to meals and for pipes and coals and tobacco c take up much of my time i have grown habitually indolent and thoughtless i have scarcely felt a glow a pang a transport of ambition since i left worcester since i left my school indeed for there the mischievous tricks the perpetual invincible prate and the stupid dulness of my scholars roused my passions and with them my views and impatience of ambition let me remember to keep my chamber not run abroad my books—naval trade coke andrews locke homer—not fields and groves and springs and rocks should be the objects of my attention law and not poetry is to be the business of my life    saturday this week has been spent in business that is filling writs and journeys to boston scadding  weymouth abington the other night cranch explained to zab and me the fireengine with which they throw up water from the bottoms of their tin mines in cornwall and coal mines in new castle  in my journey to abington my mind seemed to be confused with the dust and heat and fatigue i had not spirit and attention to make any observations upon the land corn grass grain fences orchards houses c i dined at nortons where the two military companies of the town were assembled to raise volunteers recruits but i had not spirits to make observations on the landlord or lady or officers or soldiers or house or any thing    sunday rose early five oclock a pleasant morning the more i write the better writing is a most useful improving exercise yesterday morning before breakfast i wrought my mind into a course of thinking by my pen which i should not have fallen into the whole day without it and indeed not resuming my pen after breakfast i insensibly lost my attention let me aim at perspicuity and correctness more than ornament in these papers       monday arose before the sun now i am ignorant of my future fortune—what business what reputation i may get which is now far from my expectations how many actions shall i secure this day and what new client shall i have i found at evening i had secured six actions but not one new client that i know of    tuesday arose before the sun again this is the last day  what and who today ebenezer hayden was altogether new and unexpected h himself was altogether new and unexpected and john hayward was altogether new and unexpected—three entirely new clients all from captain thayers own parish one of whom is himself a pretender to the practice are a considerable acquisition i believe the writ and advice i gave hayden and the writ and advice and the lecture concerning idleness and pettifogging given h before hayward will spread me h is very near to beggary and imprisonment his oxen are attached and his cows and pew and a number of writs and executions are out against him not yet extended he owes more than his estate can pay i believe and i told him that by neglecting his own proper business and meddling with law which he did not understand he had ruined himself—and it is true for if he had diligently followed his trade of making shoes and lived prudently he might at this day have been clear of debt and worth an handsome estate but shoemaking i suppose was too mean and diminutive an occupation for mr t h as wigmaking was to mr n g or housebuilding to mr daniel w and he like them in order to rise in the world procured deputations from the sheriff and after serving long enough in that office to get a few copies of common writs and a most litigious disposition left the sheriff  and commenced the writdrawer but poor h is like to be stripped of all he has if he should escape the jail which d w was obliged to enter and if he should not be forced to fly like n g these sudden transitions from shoemaking wigmaking and housebuilding to the deputy sheriffwick and from thence to the practice of law commonly hurry men rapidly to destruction to  0 beggary and jails yet colonel white has risen the same way that is by a deputation from the sheriff but white had the advantage of a liberal education and had no rival no competitor to oppose him so that he got quickly sworn e taylor too was naturally smart and had been long a sheriff and had the patronage and encouragement of mr trowbridge who was his brotherinlaw applin and ruggles are in a higher class men of genius and great resolution to combat the world both by violence and stratagem t by his own abject slavery to colonel p got his affections and he did every thing to encourage him dana has given him great numbers of writs to be served on people in this town he takes seven shillings for the writ and four shillings always and some five for the service of this he gives dana one shilling for his blank and reserves ten or eleven to himself great numbers of writs he has filled himself and those which he durst not fill he got niles to fill for three shillings so that he takes three and four are seven and oftentimes eight shillings to himself thus from colonel p from mr dana and elisha niles he has got his estate as his legislative authority as basely got as bestias from the throne a little longer experience will enable me to trace out the whole system of his policy and iniquity the office of a sheriff has dangers and temptations around it most of them decline in morals or estates or both p is one    wednesday read but little thought but little for the northeast storm unstrung me    thursday  i have been the longer in the argument of this cause not for the importance of the cause itself for in itself it is infinitely little and contemptible but for the importance of its consequences these dirty and ridiculous litigations have been multiplied in this town till the very earth groans and the stones cry out the town is become infamous for them throughout the county i have absolutely heard it used as a proverb in several parts of the province—as litigious as braintree this multiplicity is owing to the multiplicity of pettifoggers among whom captain h is one who has given out that he is    a sworn attorney till nine tenths of this town really believe it but i take this opportunity publicly to confront him and undeceive the town he knows in his conscience that he never took the oath of an attorney and that he dare not assume the impudence to ask to be admitted he knows that the notion of his being a sworn attorney is an imposture is an imposition upon this town and i take this opportunity publicly to declare that i will take all legal advantages against every action brought by him or by captain t or by any other pettifogger in this town for i am determined if i live in this town to break up this scene of strife vexation and immorality such suits as this and most others that ever i have seen before a justice in this town have a tendency to vex and embitter the minds of the people to propagate an idle brawling wrangling temper in short such suits are an inlet to all manner of evils and one of these suit managers when i first came to this town hearing that i had been through a regular course of study with a regular practitioner and that i was recommended to the court in boston by one of the greatest lawyers in america concluded that i should be enabled by these advantages and prompted by my own interest if by no higher motive to put an end to the illegal course of dirty quacking practice in this town which he had been in and thereby enslaved the minds and bodies and estates of his neighbors and to prevent this he set himself to work to destroy my reputation and prevent my getting business by such stratagems as no honest mind can think of without horror such stratagems as i always will resent and never will forgive till he has made atonement by his future repentance and reformation i thank god his malice has been defeated he has not been able to enslave me nor to drive me out of town but peoples eyes begin to open and i hope they will open wider and wider till they can see like other towns happy shall i be if i can rescue the souls and bodies and estates of this town from that thraldom and slavery to which these pettifoggers have contributed to depress them and if i can revive in them a generous love of liberty and sense of honor after this long digression your honor will let me return to this cause and i rely upon it it is a vexatious one i rely upon it that many of these articles were borrowed and not bought and that therefore this action cannot be maintained for them i rely upon it that    the affair of the hat is a litigious thing that it was a mere piece of tavern amusement and if there was any thing like bargain and sale in it the bargain was completed the hat delivered and the money paid and with regard to the other articles we have filed an account that more than balances them and therefore i pray your honors judgment for costs  0 friday i must not say so much about myself nor so much about h and t by name i may declaim against strife and a litigious spirit and about the dirty dabblers in the law i have a very good regard for lieutenant w but he must allow me to have a much greater veneration for the law to see the forms and processes of law and justice thus prostituted i must say prostituted to revenge an imaginary indignity offered in a tavern over a cheerful bowl or enlivening mug to have a mere piece of jocular amusement thus hitched into an action at law a mere frolic converted into a lawsuit is a degree of meanness that deserves no mercy and shall have none from me i dont think lieutenant w considered the nature and the consequences of this action before he brought it if he had he never would have brought it he has too much honor to have brought it but i suppose the case was this lieutenant w was a little chagrined that my client had for once outwitted him and in a miff or a bravado i say a miff or a bravado sees h and asks his opinion and h glad of an opportunity to draw a writ instantly encourages the suit and the suit was brought and when once brought it was too late to repent but i dare say he has been severely sorry that he ever brought it and will have still further occasion to be sorry before it ends    monday a long obstinate trial before major crosby of the most litigious vexatious suit i think that ever i heard such disputes begin with ill humor and scurrilous language and end in a boxing bout or a lawsuit    tuesday arose early a very beautiful morning zab seems to make insufficient distinctions between the vowels he seems to swallow his own voice he neither sounds the vowels nor articulates distinctly the story of yesterdays trial spreads salisbury told my uncle and my uncle told colonel quincy they say i was saucy that i whipped the old major c that i ripped about the lawsuits of this town and of that house and that i reminded the major of his oath to be of counsel to neither    party and to do justice equally between the parties according to law    thursday i have began to read the spirit of laws and have resolved to read that work through in order and with attention i have hit upon a project that will secure my attention to it which is to write in the margin a sort of index to every paragraph     friday read one hundred pages in the spirit of laws rambled away to a fine spring in my cousin adamss land which gushes through a crack in a large flat rock and gurgles down in a pretty rill the water is clear sweet and cool and is supposed to have a very wholesome quality because it issues from a mountain and runs towards the north what physical quality its northern direction may give it i know not by its sweetness it flows through clean earth and not minerals its coolness may be owing to its rise from the bowels of the hill zabs mind is taken up with arithmetical and geometrical problems questions paradoxes and riddles he studies these things that he may be able to gratify his vanity by puzzling all the vain pretenders to expertness in numbers and that he may be too expert to be puzzled by any such questions from others there is a set of people whose glory pride c it is to puzzle every man they meet with some question in the ruleofthree or fractions or some other branch of arithmetic july   saturday cowen and young thayer the marketman are full of w and b cowen heard i tore ws account all to pieces and thayer thought that w had a dirty case—few justices causes have been more famous than that isaac tirrell had the story too but he thought b was to blame was abusive   sunday heard mr mayhew of marthas vineyard   wednesday gould has got the story of w and b august   saturday drank tea at colonel quincys with colonel gooch and dr gardiner i see goochs  fiery spirit his    unguarded temper he swears freely boldly he is a widower and delights to dwell in his conversation upon courtship and    marriage has a violent aversion to long courtship hes a fool that spends more than a week c c a malignant wit a fiery fierce outrageous enemy he quarrels with all men he quarrelled with colonel quincy and intrigued to dispossess him of his regiment by means of dr miller and mr apthorp he now quarrels with colonel miller and dr miller and eb thayer he curses all governors pownal was a servant doorkeeper pimp to lord halifax and he contracted with lord halifax to give him fifteen shillings out of every pound of his salary so that pownal had twentyfive per cent commissions for his agency under lord halifax thersites in homer was   awed by no shame by no respect controlled   in scandal busy in reproaches bold   with witty malice studious to defame   scorn all his joy and laughter all his aim   but chief he gloried with licentious style   to lash the great and monarchs to revile thus we see that gooches lived as long ago as the siege of troy   spleen to mankind his envious heart possessed   and much he hated all but most the best   long had he lived the scorn of every greek   vext when he spoke yet still they heard him speak his daughters have the same fiery temper the same witty malice they have all to speak decently very smart tempers quick sharp and keen an insinuation of mr pownals giving three fourths of his salary for his commission this is   with licentious style   governors to revile colonel miller can serve the devil with as much cunning as any man i know of but for no other purpose is he fit this is in scandal busy in reproaches bold gardiner has a thin grasshopper voice and an affected squeak a meagre visage and an awkward unnatural complaisance he is fribble    q is this a generous practice to perpetuate the shrugs of wit and the grimaces of affectation    tuesday remonstrated at the sessions against licensing lambard because the selectmen had refused to approbate him because he never was approbated by the selectmen to keep a tavern in the house he now lives in because there are already three and his would make four taverns besides retailers within three quarters of a mile and because he obtained a license from that court at april sessions by artfully concealing his removal from the place where he formerly kept and so by an imposition on the court these reasons prevailed major miller colonel miller and ruddock were the only justices on lambards side while i had eight or nine wendells colonel phillips mr dana mr storer c c c mr dana inquired whether those landing places at braintree and weymouth or the road where these four taverns stand was not a great stage for travellers i answered no and rightly for the greatest stage that i knew of from boston to plymouth is in the north precinct of braintree where mr bracket but especially where mr bass now keeps where mr bass now keeps there has been a tavern always since my remembrance and long before it is exactly ten miles from town and therefore a very proper stage for gentlemen who are going from boston down to plymouth and to the cape and for people who come from the cape towards this town and there are very few travellers either bound to or from boston but what stop here but this stage is two or three miles from the place in question these things i should have said but they did not then occur dana asked next what number of carters boatmen shipbuilders c were ever employed at a time at that landing place i answered half a dozen carters perhaps but my answer should have been this at some times there are three or four or half a dozen ship carpenters and it is possible there may have been two or three boats at that wharf at a time which will require half a dozen boatmen and there have been perhaps forty carts in a day with stones and wood and lumber but these carts are coming and going all day long so that it is a rare thing to see half a dozen carts there at a time in short there is so much business done there as to render one tavern necessary but there is not so much business there is no such concourse of travellers no such multitude    of busy people at that landing as to need all this cluster of taverns one tavern and one retailer was thought by the selectmen quite sufficient for that place they have licensed one of each and pray that your honors would recognize no more    tuesday i began popes homer last saturday night was a week and last night which was monday night i finished it thus i found that in seven days i could have easily read the six volumes notes preface essays—that on homer and that on homers battles and that on the funeral games of homer and virgil c therefore i will be bound that in six months i would conquer him in greek and make myself able to translate every line in him elegantly pratt it is a very happy thing to have people superstitious they should believe exactly as their minister believes they should have no creeds and confessions they should not so much as know what they believe the people ought to be ignorant and our free schools are the very bane of society they make the lowest of the people infinitely conceited these words i heard pratt utter they would come naturally enough from the mouth of a tyrant or of a king or ministry about introducing an arbitrary power or from the mouth of an ambitious ecclesiastic but they are base detestable principles of slavery he would have ninetynine hundredths of the world as ignorant as the wild beasts of the forest and as servile as the slaves in a galley or as oxen yoked in a team he a friend to liberty he an enemy to slavery he has the very principles of a frenchman—worse principles than a frenchman for they know their belief and can give reasons for it pratt it grieves me to see any sect of religion extinguished i should be very sorry to have the tract society dissolved so i should be sorry to have condys anabaptist society dissolved i love to see a variety a variety of religions has the same beauty in the moral world that a variety of flowers has in a garden or a variety of trees in a forest this fine speech was pratts yet he is sometimes of opinion that all these sectaries ought to turn churchmen and that a uniform establishment ought to take place through the whole nation i have heard him say that we had better all of us come    into the church than pretend to overturn it c thus it is that fine speechmakers are sometimes for uniformity sometimes for variety and toleration they dont speak for the truth or weight but for the smartness novelty and singularity of the speech however i heard him make two observations that pleased me much more—one was that people in years never suppose that young people have any judgment another was when a deposition was produced taken by parson wells with a very incorrect caption a caption without mention of the cause in which it was to be used or certifying that the adverse party was present or notified he observed that the parson could not take a caption to save his life and that he knew too much to learn any thing october   tuesday waited on mr gridley for his opinion of my declaration lambard versus tirrell and for his advice whether to enter the action or not he says the declaration is bad and the writ if advantage is taken will abate for it is a declaration on a parol lease not on a deed and therefore the lessees occupancy ought to be set forth very exactly for it is his occupancy not any contract that supports the action    thursday in support of complaint in case neals action is not entered  i do not know nor is it possible for your honors to determine what reason induced the plaintiff to renounce this suit whether it was because the estate is insolvent or because he had no cause of action or because his action was mislaid or because his writ was bad—which by the way is very probable considering who drew it—that determined the plaintiff not to enter this action i cannot say and your honors cannot determine it appears to your honors that the defendant has been vexed and distressed by this summons that she has been obliged to take a journey to this town and to attend upon this court when it appears there is nothing for her to answer to—all this appears what motive induced the plaintiff to drop his action does not appear and therefore we have a right to costs as things are circumstanced i will own that had this action been commenced by any gentleman at this bar i would have dispensed with this complaint but it was drawn by a pettifogging deputy sheriff against whom i know it is my duty and i think it is my interest to    take all legal advantages and he himself cannot think it hard as he has taken both illegal and iniquitous advantages against me therefore i pray your honors judgment for costs q if this action should be entered what must be done with it—continued or dismissed a motion must be made for a continuance or a dismission    saturday neals action is entered so that i have two actions to defend by pleas in bar and three of the actions i entered are to be defended clark is to plead in abatement and tirrell and thayer are i suppose to plead to issue november   wednesday messrs i presume  upon the common sense of the world that no offence will be taken at the freedom of the following sentiments while the utmost deference for authority and decency of language is preserved as persons of obscure birth and station and narrow fortunes have no other way but through the press to communicate their thoughts abroad either to the high or the low the vacancy in the highest seat of justice in the province occasioned by the death of judge sewall naturally stirs the minds of all who know the importance of a wise steady and legal administration of justice to inquire for a fit person to fill that place such persons know that the rules of the common law are extremely numerous the acts of parliament are numerous—some taken from or at least in spirit from the civil law others from the canon and feudal law such persons know that the histories of cases and resolutions of judges have been preserved from a very great antiquity and they know also that every possible case being thus preserved in writing and settled in a precedent leaves nothing or but little to the arbitrary will or uninformed reason of prince or judge and it will be easy for any man to conclude what opportunities industry and genius employed from early youth will be necessary to gain a knowledge from all these sources sufficient to decide the lives liberties and fortunes of mankind with safety to the peoples liberties as well as the kings prerogative that  00 happy union in which the excellence of british government consists and which has often been preserved by the deep discernment and noble spirit of english judges it will be easy for any man to conclude that a man whose youth and spirits and strength have been spent in husbandry merchandise politics nay in science or literature will never master so immense and involved a science for it may be taken for a neverfailing maxim that youth is the only time for laying the foundation of a great improvement in any science or profession and that an application in advanced years after the mind is crowded the attention divided or dissipated and the memory in part lost will make but a tolerable artist at best    friday another year is now gone and upon recollection i find i have executed none of my plans of study i cannot satisfy myself that i am much more knowing either from books or men from this chamber or the world than i was at least a year ago when i wrote the foregoing letter to sewall  most of my time has been spent in rambling and dissipation riding and walking smoking pipes and spending evenings consume a vast proportion of my time and the cares and anxieties of business damp my ardor and scatter my attention but i must stay more at home and commit more to writing a pen is certainly an excellent instrument to fix a mans attention and to inflame his ambition i am therefore beginning a new literary year in the twentysixth of my life i am just entered on the fifth year of my studies in law and i think it is high time for a reformation both in the man and the lawyer twentyfive years of the animal life is a great proportion to be spent to so little purpose and four years the space that we spend at college is a great deal of time to spend for no more knowledge in the science and no more employment in the practice of law let me keep an exact journal therefore of the authors i read in this paper this day i am beginning my lord hales history of the common law a book borrowed of mr otis and read once already analysis and all with great satisfaction i wish i had mr blackstones analysis that i might compare and see what improvements he has made upon hales but what principally pleased me in the first reading  0  of hales history was his dissertation upon descents and upon trials by a jury hales analysis as mr gridley tells me is an improvement of one first planned and sketched by noy an attorneygeneral in the reign of charles i and mr blackstones is an improvement upon hales the title is the history of the common law of england the frontispiece i cannot comprehend  it is this ἰσχυρὸν ὁ νóμος ἐστὶν ἄρχοντὰ his great distribution of the laws of england is into leges scriptæ and leges non scriptæ the first are acts of parliament which are originally reduced to writing before they are enacted or receive any binding power every such law being in the first instance formally drawn up in writing and made as it were a tripartite indenture between the king the lords and commons the leges non scriptæ although there may be some monument or memorial of them in writing as there is of all of them yet all of them have not their original in writing but have obtained their force by immemorial usage or custom    saturday spent last evening at colonel quincys with colonel lincoln several instances were mentioned when the independency and superiority of the law in general over particular departments of officers civil and military have been asserted and maintained by the judges at home—lord cokes resolution in the case of— in opposition to the opinion and even to the orders and passionate threatenings of the king lord holts refusal to give the house of lords his reasons for his judgment in the case of—in an extrajudicial manner that is without being legally and constitutionally called before them by a writ of error certiorari or false judgment and c j willess resolute spirited assertion of the rights of common law in opposition to the court martial against the intercession of powerful friends and even of the ministry if not the king himself   0     friday this day has been spent to little purpose i must confine my body or i never shall confine my thoughts  0  running to doctors cutting wood blowing fire cutting tobacco—waste my time scatter my thoughts and divert my ambition a train of thought is hard to procure trifles light as air break the chain interrupt the series finished the history of the common law the second time the dissertation on hereditary descents and that on trials by juries are really very excellent performances and well worth repeated attentive reading    wednesday ten days are now elapsed since i began hale the second time and all the law i have read for ten days is that book once through i read woods institute through the first time with mr putnam in twice that time that is in three weeks and kept a school every day my present inattention to law is intolerable and ruinous night before thanksgiving i have read a multitude of lawbooks mastered but few wood coke two volumes lillys abridgment two volumes salkelds reports swinburne hawkinss pleas of the crown fortescue fitzgibbon ten volumes in folio i read at worcester quite through besides octavos and lesser volumes and many others of all sizes that i consulted occasionally without reading in course as dictionaries reporters entries and abridgments c i cannot give so good an account of the improvement of my two last years spent in braintree however i have read no small number of volumes upon the law the last two years—justinians institutes i have read through in latin with vinniuss perpetual notes van muydens tractatio institutionum justiniani i read through and translated mostly into english from the same language woods institute of the civil law i read through these on the civil law on the law of england i read cowells institute of the laws of england in imitation of justinian doctor and student finchs discourse of law hales history and some reporters cases in chancery andrews c besides occasional searches for business also a general treatise of naval trade and commerce as founded on the laws and statutes all this series of reading has left but faint impressions and a very imperfect system of law in my head i must form a serious resolution of beginning and pursuing quite through the plans of my lords hale and reeve woods institutes of common law i never read but once and my  0  lord cokes commentary on littleton i never read but once these two authors i must get and read over and over again and i will get them too and break through as mr gridley expressed it all obstructions besides i am but a novice in natural law and civil law there are multitudes of excellent authors on natural law that i have never read indeed i never read any part of the best authors puffendorf and grotius in the civil law there are hoppius and vinnius commentators on justinian domat c beside institutes of canon and feudal law that i have to read much may be done in two years i have found already and let it be my care that at the end of the next two years i be better able to show that no time has been lost than i ever have been yet let me practise the rule of pythagoras—   μηδ ὕπνον μαλακοι̑σιν ἐπ ὄμμασι προσδέξασθαι   πρὶν τω̑ν ἡμερινω̑ν ἔργων τρὶς ἔκαστον ἐπελθει̑ν·   πη̑ παρέβην τί δ ἔρεξα τί μοι δέον ὀυκ ἐτελέσθη thus let me every night before i go to bed write down in this book what book of law i have read    friday i have not read one word of law this day but several points and queries have been suggested to me by the consultors in whom is the fee and freehold of our burying yard what right has any man to erect a monument or sink a tomb there without the consent of the proprietors     saturday there is an anecdote in the spectator of de witt the famous dutch politician somebody asked him how he could rid his hands of that endless multiplicity and variety of business that passed through them without confusion he answered by doing one thing at once when he began any thing he applied his whole attention to it till he had finished it this rule should be observed in law if any point is to be examined every book should be consulted and every light should be considered before you proceed to any other business or study if any book is to be read no other book should be taken up to divert or interrupt your attention till that book is finished order method regularity in business or study have excellent  0  effects both in saving of time and in bettering and improving performance business done in order is done sooner and better  0 sunday read no law read bolingbroke december   monday i am beginning a week and a month and i arose by the dawning of the day and by sunrise had made my fire and read a number of pages in bolingbroke tuesday and wednesday passed without reading any law   saturday talked with zab about newton bacon locke martin and chambers rowning desaguliers sgravesande c i told him i had a low opinion of the compilers abridgers and abstract makers we had better draw science from its fountain in original authors these writers the hirelings of the booksellers only vend us the discoveries of other philosophers in another form and under another title in order to get bread to eat and raiment to put on zab says that martin has made several discoveries has invented new machines improved and perfected old ones nay has even detected errors in newton e g newton always thought the moon was surrounded by an atmosphere but martin proves it is not because the stars that appear all round it above below and on each side of it are not diminished in their lustre as they would appear if the rays passed from them through an atmosphere then we transided to dr simpson euclid c and he asked me to demonstrate that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right i undertook it  then we attempted to demonstrate the fortyseventh of the first book i am astonished at my own ignorance in the french tongue i find i can neither express my own thoughts in it nor understand others who express theirs readily in it i can neither give nor receive thoughts by that instrument    sunday hunt v white—complaint to colonel quincy of a scandalous lie made and published to hunts damage     tuesday attended the trial all day between hunt and white before colonel quincy at james brackets what will be the consequence of this trial—to me to hunt and to white white has been punished for his licentious tittletattle but hunt has gained neither recompense nor credit benjamin thayer is enraged and pratt and pitty were enraged at me for abusing  0  them by asking them their thoughts ben thayer continues so for aught i know or care i fear this unsuccessful prosecution connected with that of lovell and reed will occasion squibs and injure my reputation in weymouth however in both i am well assured i had good cause of action the circumstances of suspicion against hunt have taken such hold of mens minds that no conviction of white would have retrieved hunts character at all it would have been much better never to have stirred in this affair a prosecution commenced with so much temper pursued with so much resolution then supported by so little evidence and terminated by agreement though in his favor yet with so small advantage will give occasion for weymouth tongues to wanton in obloquy and for their sides to riot in laughter virtues ambition generosity indulged to excess degenerate into extravagance which plunges headlong into villany and folly    thursday yesterday spent in weymouth in settling the disputes between old w and young f w has the remainder of his habitual trickish lying cheating disposition strongly working to this day—an infinity of jesuitical distinctions and mental reservations he told me he never lost a cause at court in his life—which w and w say is a downright lie he owned to me that his character had been that of a knave and a villain and says every man of wit and sense will be called a villain—my principle has been to deal upon honor with all men so long as they deal upon honor with me but as soon as they begin to trick me i think i ought to trick them thus every knave thinks others as knavish or more knavish than himself what an intrenchment against the attack of his conscience is this—the knavery of my neighbor is superior to mine an old withered decrepit person eightyseven years of age with a head full of all the wiles and guile and artifice of the infernal serpent is really a melancholy sight ambition of appearing sprightly cunning smart capable of outwitting younger men in short i never saw that guile and subtlety in any man of that age father niles has a little of that same serpentine guile i never felt the meaning of the words stratagem guile subtlety cunning wiles c that milton applies to the devil as his plan to effect the ruin of our first parents so forcibly as since i knew that old man and his grandson who seems to have  0  the same subtlety and a worse temper under a total secrecy and dissembled intention he has a smiling face and a flattering tongue with a total concealment of his designs though a devilish malignant fiery temper appears in his eyes he is a cassius like b t sees through the characters of men much further and clearer than ordinary never laughs now and then smiles or half smiles father w with all his subtlety and guile may be easily overreached by men like himself he is too open too ostentatious of his cunning and therefore is generally outwitted and worsted five strange characters i have had concerns with very lately two fools and two knaves besides daniel n a lunatic fs joy like that of the devil when he had completed the temptation and fall of man was extravagant but he broke out into too violent a passion he broke his own seal of secrecy and betrayed his villanous designs to me on my resenting his declared intention he grew sensible of his error and attempted by soothing to retrieve it he was sorry he had broke out so the treatment he had suffered made him in a passion i raised your temper too prodigiously justice dyer says there is more occasion for justices than for lawyers lawyers live upon the sins of the people if all men were just and honest and pious and religious c there would be no need of lawyers but justices are necessary to keep men just and honest and pious and religious—oh sagacity but it may be said with equal truth that all magistrates and all civil officers and all civil government are founded and maintained by the sins of the people all armies would be needless if men were universally virtuous most manufacturers and tradesmen would be needless nay some of the natural passions and sentiments of human minds would be needless upon that supposition for example resentment which has for its objects wrong and injury no man upon that supposition would ever give another a just provocation and no just resentment would take place without a just provocation thus our natural resentments are founded on the sins of the people as much as the profession of the law or that of arms or that of divinity in short vice and folly are so interwoven in all human affairs that they could not possibly be wholly separated from them without tearing and rending the whole system of human nature and state nothing would remain as it is  0     monday this day and tomorrow are the last i have but one blank left that i can use    saturday governor bernards speech to the two houses at the opening of the present sessions has several inaccuracies in it the glorious conclusion of the north american war the north american war is not yet concluded it continues obstinate and bloody with the cherokees and will be renewed probably against the french in louisiana however with regard to this province whose legislature the governor was congratulating it may not very improperly be called a conclusion the fair prospect of the security of your country being settled upon the most sure and lasting foundations is not this sentence filled with tautology the security being secured upon secure foundations emendation and the fair prospect that now presents itself of tranquillity established on lasting foundations but it is not tranquillity nor safety nor preservation nor peace nor happiness but it is security then it is not established fixed placed but it is settled and then it is not stable permanent but sure here are certainly words used merely for sound this great contest c q what does he mean the war or the conclusion of the war if the latter conquest should have been his word if the former what follows is not true namely that we may date the firm establishment of the british empire in north america from our late successes and acquisitions we may date that establishment but not from our misfortunes and losses which make no unmemorable part of this great contest we form these pleasing assurances not only from the more striking instances of the superiority of its power but also from the less obvious observation of the improvement of its policy its power that is the british empires power instances that is particulars in which it has appeared obvious observation has a good meaning but an inelegant and inartificial sound a defect of elegance variety harmony at least the improving a country is a more pleasing task than the defending it improving and defending participles used as substantives with the article the before them will never be used  0  by a grammarian much less by a rhetorician i never could bear such expressions in others and never could use them myself unless in case of absolute necessity where there is no substantive to express the same idea as i have consulted your convenience in deferring calling you together until this the most leisure time of your whole year c in deferring calling would never have been used together by a discerning ear he might have said in deferring this session until c your whole year why yours any more than mine or others ans it is not the most leisure time of every mans whole year it is the most busy time of some mens year deacon palmers observation upon this speech that he talks like a weak honest man is childish tis superficial tis prejudice tis a silly thoughtless repetition of what he has heard others say for though there are no marks of knavery in it there are marks of good sense i think grammatical and rhetorical inaccuracies are by no means proofs of weakness or ignorance they may be found in bacon locke newton c      january   friday the representatives in their address to the governor have told him that great britain is the leading and most respectable power in the whole world let us examine this is she the leading power either in war or negotiation in war she has no army not more than fifty or sixty thousand men whereas france has a standing army of two hundred and fifty thousand men in camp and in garrison and their officers are as gallant and skilful their gunners and engineers the most accomplished of any in europe their navy indeed is now inconsiderable and our navy alone has given us the advantage but our navy alone will not make us the leading power how we can be called the leading power i cannot see holland spain portugal denmark and all italy have refused to follow us and austria russia sweden and indeed almost all the states of germany the prince of hesse excepted have followed france the only power independent power that has consented to follow us is prussia and indeed upon recollection it seems to me we followed prussia too rather than the contrary thus we are the leading power without followers and if we are not the leading power in war we never have   0 been the leading power in negotiation it is a commonplace observation that the french have regained by treaty all the advantages which we had gained by arms now whether this arose from the superior dexterity of the french plenipotentiaries or from the universal complaisance of the other plenipotentiaries of europe to france and frenchmen it equally proves that england is not the leading power in councils how then are we the most respectable the most respected i am sure we are not else how came all europe to remain neuters or else take arms against us how came foreigners from all countries to resort to france to learn their policy military discipline fortification manufactures language letters science politeness c so much more than to england how comes the french language to be studied and spoken as a polite accomplishment all over europe and how come all negotiations to be held in french and if we consider every thing the religion government freedom navy merchandise army manufactures policy arts sciences numbers of inhabitants and their virtues it seems to me that england falls short in more and more important particulars than it exceeds the kingdom of france to determine the character of leading and respectable as doctor savil does from a few victories and successes—by which rules he makes charles xii to have been in his day the leading and most respectable power and oliver cromwell in his and the king of prussia in this—is most ignorant and silly in short leading and respectable is not to be determined either by the prince the policy the army navy arts sciences commerce nor by any other national advantage taken singly and abstracted from the rest but that power is to be denominated so whose aggregate of component parts is most   thursday last monday had a passionate wrangle with eben thayer before major crosby he called me a petty lawyer this i resented     messrs—  i am an old man seventy odd and as i had my education so i have spent my whole life a few weeks in a year excepted when i commonly took a journey in the country i was naturally inquisitive and a little too talkative in my youth which qualities have perhaps increased with my age but as i remember i used to sneer at the vanity and impertinence of old nestor whose speeches i have often read formerly in popes homer a book of which i was then and am still very fond i expect that younger men will laugh at the like vanity and impertinence in me which it shall be my care therefore in this paper at least to avoid because i would have the subject of it candidly weighed indeed scarcely any thing that i have observed in the course of a long life has a greater influence on the religion morals health property liberties and tranquillity of the world—i mean public houses the temper and passions the profaneness and brutal behavior inspired by the low sort of company that frequent such houses and by the liquors they drink there are not very compatible with the pure and undefiled religion of jesus—that religion whose first principle is to renounce all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness that inattention to the public ordinances of religion as well as to private devotion which i have reasons to think so prevalent in these times is no unnatural consequence of the very general resort to those licentious houses the plentiful use of spirituous liquors begins with producing a strange confusion of mind appetites and passions too violent for the government of reason proceeds to involve men in debts and of consequence in lying cheating stealing and sometimes in greater crimes and ends in total and incurable dissolution of manners the effects of such intemperance upon health are of two kinds it either throws them into some acute and inflammatory fever which carries them from the midst of their vices and their follies the mischiefs they do and the distresses they suffer at     once into their graves or else it leads them by insensible degrees through all the gloom and languor of a chronical distemper despised by many hated by more and pitied by a few to a long expected and desired death thousands and thousands are every year expiring in europe and proportionable numbers in america the miserable victims of their own imprudence and the ill policy of rulers in permitting the causes of their ruin to exist allured by the smell of these infernal liquors like the ghosts in romances allured by the scent of human blood they resort to these houses waste their time their strength and their money which ought to be employed in the management of their own affairs and families till by degrees much expended little earned they contract habits of carelessness idleness and intemperance their creditors demand they promise to pay but fail writs issue charges are multiplied for the maintenance of others as idle as themselves and executions strip them of all they have and cast their miserable bodies into loathsome prisons the number of these houses have been lately so much augmented and the fortunes of their owners so much increased that an artful man has little else to do but secure the favor of taverners in order to secure the suffrages of the rabble that attend these houses which in many towns within my observation makes a very large perhaps the largest number of voters the consequence is that these offices and elections which all the wisest legislators of the world in humble imitation of god and nature have allotted to probity and understanding may in time i dare not say have already become the gratuity of tipplers for drams and slops good god where are the rights of englishmen where is the spirit that once exalted the souls of britons and emboldened their faces to look even princes and monarchs in the face but perhaps i am too anxious and in truth i must own i so revere the true constitution of our government founded in those great principles that accomplished in a great antiquity the destruction of troy that extended in a later period the bounds of the roman empire and that produced in the english history so many events for the universe to admire that i cannot think of its evaporating and passing from human breasts with flip and rum of which event there is great danger without rage     last of all innumerable violations of the peace and order of society are every day occurring that spring originally from the same sources quarrels boxing duels oaths curses affrays and riots are daily hatching from eggs and spawns deposited in the same nests in short these houses like so many boxes of pandora are sending forth every day innumerable plagues of every kind natural moral and political that increase and multiply fast enough to lay waste in a little while the whole world how different is this from the state of things in my youth instead of an unmanly retreat to the chimneycorner of a tavern the young fellows of my age were out in the air improving their strength and activity by wrestling running leaping lifting and the like vigorous diversions and when satisfied with these resorted every one to his mistress or his wife love that divine passion which nature has implanted for the renovation of the species and the greatest solace of our lives—virtuous love i mean—from whence the greatest part of human happiness originates and which these modern seminaries have almost extinguished or at least changed into filthiness and brutal debauch was then considered as god intended it both a duty of our nature and the greatest source of our bliss but it is melancholy to think that the present prevalent debauchery which tends so much to shorten the lives of the present generation tends also to prevent the propagation of a succeeding one i really am afraid that in another century unless some wise precaution should intervene a man of my age will be the rarest phenomenon i should be called talkative indeed if i should attempt to develop the causes of that strange multiplication of such houses that is lately grown up but i fear that some selectmen are induced by a foolish complaisance and others by designs of ambition to give their approbation to too many persons who are improper and perhaps too many that are proper for that trust i am afraid that some justices may be induced by lucrative motives by mercantile principles to augment the manufactory or the importation of rum or molasses without attending to the other consequences which are plainly pernicious but let this paper be considered as a warning from one who has seen better days to magistrates to suppress rather than increase within their department to selectmen to discountenance rather than encourage pretenders in their sphere to     parents and masters to restrain their children and servants from frequenting and in short let every man endeavor to keep one from suffering any injury from them in any respect i was too incautious and unartful in my proceeding but practice makes perfect  i should have first taken all the summonses into my own hands or powers of attorney from the defendants then i should have moved that the sheriff should be directed to return his writs that against white and that against hayden then i should have drawn a complaint on each of them and filed them all then i should have desired the justice to make a record of his judgment this would have been regular masterly management but i had no time to think and prepare this is the third time i have been before major crosby with t the first time he was for john spear that action was demolished the next time he appeared for nathan spear against eph hunt and john vinton those actions were demolished the last time he appeared for bayley against niles white hayden c these actions were all demolished thus i have come off pretty triumphantly every time and he pretty foolishly yet i have managed none of these cases in the most masterly manner i see several inadvertent mistakes and omissions but i grow more expert less diffident c i feel my own strength i see the complacent countenances of the crowd and i see the respectful face of the justice and the fearful faces of pettifoggers more than i did to chardon  lest a maiden nicety should prevent the correspondence proposed last week i have taken my pen to open it upon the lofty subject of law we shall be called silly and tasteless c for aught i know or care for let the smart sayings of the gay and the grave satires even of the wise and learned be what they     will i have for my own part and i thank god for it no bad opinion of the law either as a science or a profession why the minute arteries and tendons of the human body the organization of the human voice and mouth and numberless other subjects of the like sort should be thought worthy of the attention of a liberal mind and the no less wonderful and much more important combination of passions appetites affections in the human breast that operate on society too futile or too disagreeable for a wise mans examination i cannot imagine nay if we proceed to the positive institutions of the law i cannot think them so extremely dull uncouth and unentertaining as you and i have heard them represented by some whom we love and honor multitudes of needless matters and some that are nonsensical it must be confessed have in the course of ages crept into the law but i beg to know what art or science can be found in the whole circle that has not been taught by silly senseless pedants and is not stuffed with their crudities and jargon the man who intends to become skilful in any science must be content to study such authors as have written upon it no man will be an adept in grammar or rhetoric or poetry or music or architecture without laboring through a vast deal of nonsense and impertinence in short nonsense seems an unalienable property of human affairs and it is as idle to expect that any author should write well upon any subject without intermingling some proportion of it as it is to expect that a rapid torrent should descend from the mountains without washing some dirt and earth along with it but if the grandeur and importance of a subject have any share in the pleasure it communicates i am sure the law has by far the advantage of most other sciences nothing less than the preservation of the health and properties lives and tranquillity morals and liberties of millions of the human species is the object and design of the law and a comparison of several constitutions of government invented for those purposes an examination of the great causes of their danger as well as those of their safety must be as agreeable an employment as can exercise the mind but it is a science that comprises a multitude and great industry as well as many helps are needful to subdue it     and in truth i do not know a more agreeable help than the correspondence of a friend exchange of observation proposing difficulties stating cases repeating arguments examining sophisms will both arouse and support our ambition and wear by easy degrees a system of law into the mind the plan that i would propose then is this—for you to write me a report of any case you hear argued before the courts of admiralty court of probate governor and council court of sessions justice of the peace c that you think curious propose questions for examination and write me answers to letters from me on all the foregoing subjects and if we will secrete each others letters we shall at least avoid the ridicule of others but if we should be detected we can say that tully and atticus held some such correspondence before that never raised a laugh in the world    tuesday last friday i borrowed of mr gridley the second volume of the corpus juris canonici notis illustratum gregorii xiii jussu editum complectens decretum gratiani decretales gregorii papæ ix sextum decretalium bonifacii papæ viii clementinas extravagantes joannis papæ xxii extravagantes communes accesserunt constitutiones novæ summorum pontificum nunquam antea editæ quæ   decretalium loco esse possint annotationes ant naldi cum addit novis et quæ in plerisque editionibus desiderabantur petri lancelotti institutiones juris canonici regulæ cancellariæ apostolicæ cum indicibus c mr gridley about fifteen months since advised me to read an institute of the canon law and that advice lay broiling in my head till last week when i borrowed the book i am very glad that he gave and i took the advice for it will explain many things in ecclesiastical history and open that system of fraud bigotry nonsense impudence and superstition on which the papal usurpations are founded besides increasing my skill in the latin tongue and my acquaintance with civil law for in many respects the canon is grafted on the civil february   friday i have now almost finished the first book of peter lancelotts institutes which first book is taken     up de jure personarum and is well analyzed in the twentyninth title de clericis non residentibus   monday this morning as i lay abed i recollected my last weeks work i find i was extremely diligent—constantly in my chamber spent no evenings abroad not more than one at the doctors have taken no walks never on horseback the whole week excepting once which was on tuesday when i went to boston yet how has this retirement and solitude been spent in too much rambling and straggling from one book to another from the corpus juris canonici to bolingbroke from him to pope from him to addison from him to yoricks sermons c in fine the whole week and all my diligence have been lost for want of observing de witts maxim one thing at once this reflection raised a determination to reassume the corpus juris or rather lancelotts institutes read nothing else and think of nothing else—till sometime with the week then i begin the second book institutionum juris canonici de rerum divisione atque illarum administratione titulus primus res ecclesiasticæ sunt aut spirituales aut temporales res spirituales sunt aut incorporales aut corporales et corporales dividuntur in sacramenta in res sacras sanctas et religiosas this institute is a curious monument of priestly ambition avarice and subtlety tis a system of sacerdotal guile his majesty has declared himself by his speech to his parliament to be a man of piety and candor in religion a friend of liberty and property in government and a patron of merit the blessing of heaven i devoutly implore as the surest foundation of the whole that is the loyalty and affection of his people his resolution to strengthen the constitution the civil c rights of his subjects and the prerogatives of his crown c and the best means to draw down the divine favor on my reign it is my fixed purpose to countenance and encourage the practice of true religion and virtue these are proofs of his piety he promises to patronize religion virtue the british name and constitution in church and state the subjects rights liberty     commerce military merit these are sentiments worthy of a king—a patriot king  march   tuesday mem to inquire of tufts gould whitmarsh hunts whites c about their method of mending highways by a rate and to inquire at worcester whenever i shall get there of chandlers putnam willard paine swan c about their method they mended their ways by a rate i am sure samuel clark daniel nash—myrmidons of thayer luke lambard ben hayden samuel clark c—all the myrmidons of thayer c myrmidons bull dogs hounds creatures tools weymouth mends her ways by a rate—each man is rated so much and a days work is estimated at so much a horse a cart yoke of oxen c at so much so each man has his choice—to pay his money or to work it out i did not think to ask what sum they expended yearly to mend ways quære—how they mend their ways streets lanes alleys c in boston whether by a rate is not the town taxed for pavement of streets c q whether they ever permit those who choose it to work it out themselves march    saturday memorandum to inquire more particularly into the practice in weymouth—how they estimate a days work for a man horse yoke of oxen carts tools pickaxes spades shovels c how much money or what a sum they assess     upon the whole town annually to amend their ways whether the assessment is committed to the surveyor of all within his district c inquire too at boston of cunningham how they pave and repair the pavements of their great streets and lanes and alleys c whether poor people are left at their election to work or to pay and how they apportion their assessments but i presume it is not according to the poll tax but in proportion to the province tax or town and county so that rich men may contribute in proportion to their wealth to repairing as they contribute most by their equipages c to the wearing and spoiling the highways but a tax upon the polls and real and personal estates of the town will not bring the burthen to equality we will suppose that john ruggles and caleb hubbard are rated equally for heads and real and personal estates caleb hubbard carts down one thousand pounds worth of wood and timber to the landingplaces and so reaps three or four hundred pounds a year profit by improving the ways and by his heavy loads and wheels he breaks and cuts and crushes the ways to pieces but mr ruggles on the other hand confines himself to his farm and he neither receives benefit from any highways or does any damage to them further than riding to meeting on sundays and town meetings now what reason what propriety can there be in taxing ruggles and hubbard equally to the highways one gets his living by ruining the ways the other neither gets a farthing by them nor does them a farthings damage the power of a town the proviso in the eleventh of george chapter iv—that this act shall not extend to the preventing or altering the practice in any town of defraying the charge of repairing or amending the highways by a rate or tax or any other   0 method they have or shall agree upon the words agreed upon in this proviso i presume signify determined by the major part of the voters for the same words agreed upon are used in several other acts where their meaning must be so thus   w  m chapter v—the act to enable towns villages proprietors in common and undivided lands to sue and be sued messrs  i am an old man turned of seventy when i was young my common amusement was reading i had some engagements in business and was no enemy to innocent pleasure but as my circumstances were easy i gave a greater indulgence to my curiosity of conversing largely with the world than most persons of my age and rank in this course of life i soon found that human nature the dignity of which i heard extolled by some and debased by others was far from deserving that reverence and admiration which is due to great virtue and intelligence i found as i thought in that day a multitude of people who suffered themselves to be caught by hooks and snares covered over with such bait as would not have imposed even on fishes and birds and i found as i thought a few others the anglers of that day whose constant attention and pursuit was to allure and take that multitude the first instances of this sort that fell under my observation raised my compassion and indignation alternately i pitied poor deluded simplicity on one hand and i raged against cruelty and wickedness on the other and could not but think that to rescue the lamb from the jaws of the wolf would be a noble adventure but on further consideration the design seemed impracticable the attempt was odious the knaves would arise in a combination to ruin the reformer and the fools would be managed in no other way than that of their appetites and passions for this reason and to avoid the pungent misery of a disappointed despised patriot i determined to make a total alteration in the course and nature of my ideas and sentiments whenever i heard or saw an instance of atrocious treachery fraud hypocrisy injustice and cruelty the common effects of excessive ambition avarice and lust instead of indulging     the sentiments of nature which i found were a resentment bordering on rage i resolved instantly to set up a laugh and make myself merry whenever i saw a simple deluded creature brought by the craft of others to brutal debauchery sickness cold hunger prison whippingpost pillory or gallows instead of indulging sympathy and feeling i set myself to laughing i must own i found a good deal of difficulty to command myself at first in this bold attempt to alter the whole system of morality and in spite of my attention a flash of vengeance or a thrill of pity would sometimes escape me before i could bring my muscles into a risible posture but by long practice i have at last obtained a settled habit of making myself merry at all the wickedness and misery of the world and the causes of ridicule have been every hour increasing and multiplying from the twentyfifth year of my age when i first attempted the alteration of my mind to the present hour and now in spite of all the infirmities of old age i am the most tittering giggling mortal you ever saw but the amplest source of my merriment through the whole course of my life has been the affair of english privileges british liberty and all that i have heard men every day for fifty years boasting our constitution is the first under heaven we are governed by our own laws no tyrant can lord it over us the king is as accountable for his conduct as the subject no government that ever existed was so essentially free every man is his own monarch his will or the will of his agent and no other can bind him all these gallant blustering speeches i have heard in words and i never failed to raise a horse laugh for observe the pleasant course of these things the few who have real honor temperance and understanding who are desirous of getting their bread and paying their debts by their own industry apply their attention to their own business and leave the affairs of towns and provinces to others but a young fellow who happens to be by nature or by habit indolent and perhaps profligate begins by laying schemes by himself or his friends to live and get money without labor or care his first step is to procure a deputation from some sheriff by the help of writs and executions and drawing writs or employing some child c to draw them for a share one third or one fourth     of the fee then serving them and executions carrying tales and intelligence from one party to the other and then settling disputes vastly compassionating the party by taking twice lawful fees he wheedles himself into some connection with the people and considerable sums of money into his own pockets he presently grows a capable man very expert at calculations and well acquainted with the real and personal estates of the town and so very fit for selectman and after two or three years opposition from the most virtuous and independent part of a town he obtains an election after this his reputation increases very fast he becomes to those not already grappled to his interest by fear or affection very assiduous and obliging and when the season of the year approaches a swarm of candidates for approbation to keep taverns or dramshops surround him for his favor for one he will use his utmost interest for another he really thinks there is occasion for a public house where he lives for a third his circumstances are so needy he really thinks he ought to be assisted for a fourth he is so unable to work that he needs to be assisted and to a fifth he likes it very well for he thinks the more there are the better the more obliging they will be and the cheaper they will sell taverns and dramshops are therefore placed in every corner of the town where poor mankind allured by the smell of brandy and rum resort and carouse waste their time spend their money run in debt to tavern and others grow attached to the taverner who is attached to his patron both by gratitude and expectation the hero of this romance is presently extolled as a public blessing as the most useful man in town as a very understanding man and is at the next may meeting set up for a candidate as representative the same body of wealthy and virtuous persons who opposed the first step of his exaltation are still resolute to oppose the second and for the first few years he fails but by assiduity and impudence by extending and fortifying the parts of the same system he increases his interest and the virtuous few begin to dread the consequences they resolve not to be present and witnesses of the disgrace of the town they stay at home and the news is brought them that the person they despised c c has obtained his election in this manner men who are totally ignorant of all law human and divine natural civil ecclesiastical and common are     employed to make laws for their country while others who have been led by their education to search to the bottom of human nature and to examine the effect of all laws upon human affairs     it would be worth while to describe all the transformations of—s flattery yet there is always a salvo which shows his deceit and insincerity if mr adams should become in two or three years one of the most eminent lawyers in the county and remove to boston there you would find persons who have daughters to dispose of who have knowledge of the world and prudence enough to look out the best characters for matches to their daughters twenty such men would have their eyes upon you would dress out their daughters to the best advantage contrive interviews lay schemes and presently some one more beautiful or sensible or witty or artful than the rest will take you in we shall see you in spite of your philosophy and contempt for wife and mistress and all that sighing and dying with love here under a specious pretext of raillery for my boasted and affected indifference to ladies he is insinuating or would make me believe that he designed to insinuate that i am likely to be the ablest lawyer on the stage in two or three years that twenty gentlemen will eye me for a match to their daughters and all that this is the flattery yet in truth he only said if mr adams should become c so that if his consequences should never take place—oh i never expected they would for i did not expect you would be eminent besides if he was to speak his real sentiments—i am so illbred unpolished c that i never shall succeed with ladies or the world c c the same evening i showed him my draught of our licensed houses and the remarks upon it  oh he was transported he     was ravished he would introduce that plan at the sessions and read the remarks and say they were made as well as the plan by a gentleman to whom there could be no exception c he saw an abstract of the argument for and against writs of assistants  and says did you take this from those gentlemen as     they delivered it you can do any thing you can do as you please gridley did not use that language he never was master of such a style it is not in him c i will lay one hundred guineas that before twenty years you will raise the fees of the bar threefold if your eloquence should turn out equal to your understanding you will i know you will you have lord bolingbroke by heart with one cursory reading you have a deeper understanding of him and remember more of him than i do after three or four readings or than i should have after twenty readings with all your merit and learning and wit and sense and spirit and vivacity and all that— these are the bold gross barefaced flatteries that i hear every time i see that man can he think me such a ninny as to be allured and deceived by such gross arts he must think me vastly vain silly stupid if he thinks to impose on me if he thinks i cant see the deceit it must be deceit it cannot be any thing else if you ride over this whole province you will find that although taverns are generally too numerous  they are not half so numerous in any one county in proportion to the numbers of people and the necessity of business and travelling as in this in most country towns in this county you will find almost every other house with a sign of entertainment before it if you call you will find dirt enough very miserable accommodations of provision and lodging for yourself and your horse yet if you sit the evening you will find the house full of people     drinking drams flip toddy carousing swearing but especially plotting with the landlord to get him at the next town meeting an election either for selectman or representative thus the multiplicity of these houses by dividing the profits renders the landlords careless of travellers and allures the poor country people who are tired with labor and hanker after company to waste their time and money contract habits of intemperance and idleness and by degrees to lose the natural dignity and freedom of english minds and confer those offices which belong by nature and the spirit of all government to probity and honesty on the meanest and weakest and worst of human characters a good deal of this has happened as i believe partly from what i have seen and partly from credible information in the country but who is most to blame the court of sessions has made such rules for itself that the country justices can seldom attend the selectmen of the several towns have been so often disappointed that they are discouraged some houses to my knowledge have been licensed which never had any approbation from any selectman other persons have been licensed whom the selectmen have found by experience and certified to be guilty of misrule and therefore unfit others have been recognized for seven years together without any approbation from the selectmen through the whole time nay a man has been recognized though the selectmen certified good reasons for not approbating him—that he was very intemperate had poor accommodations and was subject to fits of caprice if not delirium that made it dangerous to come near him and although it was proved that the same man in one of these fits had but a few days before stabbed another with apparent design and great danger of murder now i agree that ambitious spirits in the country who have little honor will soon see that such houses must be favored and multiplied to promote their own designs and therefore retailers and taverners are generally in the country assessors or selectmen or representatives or esquires but are not we more to blame are not some of our justices importers of molasses are not others distillers and are not all of them fond of a lawful fee in short is it owing wholly to boston justices that those houses have been so shamefully multiplied in the country multiplied so that decent entertainment for a traveller is nowhere to be had     the freedom of censure is a matter of very great consequence under our government there are certain vices and follies certain indecencies of behavior beneath the inspection and censure of law and magistracy which must be restrained and corrected by satire and for this reason every piece of just ridicule in public or private bestowed on any wrong or foolish conduct gives me great pleasure even although i am myself the object from the same principle i was glad to see some animadversion on the late inconsistent conduct of the ministers of this town  and nothing but sacerdotal impudence and ecclesiastical pride can account for the surly revengeful manner in which those pieces have been received      june    thursday i have been for a week or fortnight engaged in a project have remarkably succeeded hitherto mr niles approved in all things major crosby approved in all things deacon palmer approved in all things they have given under their hands a very full and handsome character and recommendation of my brother—much more ample than i expected they have really spoken in hyperbole they have expressed themselves with warmth i expected only a signification of their consent and approbation but they have expressed themselves with zeal i ought to consider these credentials gratefully as a strong instance of friendship and take the first opportunity of making some return mr n has the worst opinion of ts morals he detests the base methods of debauchery and lying and duplicity that he has been in o despises him but scheming seldom has success i expect to come off but second best after all i expect that t will hear of my design and in order to defeat it continue in the office himself if he should i shall be pretty cool intrigue and making interest and asking favors is a new employment to me i am unpractised in intrigues for power i begin to feel the passions of the world—ambition avarice intrigue party all must be guarded my fears of failing are at last vanished the scheme succeeded in all things and is completed boylston is constituted     commissioned sworn and has this day undertaken to officiate now a new train of anxieties begins to take place fears of imperfect services imperfect and false returns voluntary and negligent escapes miscalculations want of strength courage celerity want of art and contrivance c rashness indolence timidity c the project was so well planned that success seemed certain all the justices recommended two other gentlemen of his acquaintance men of honor and figure also concurred and urged and dropped hints if not anecdotes vs the old one hints were dropped to him by others that i should employ constables and so deprive him of his profits—so that his interest his vanity his honor were all touched it cost me much pains—at least two journeys to boston one to mr niless one to germantown one to mr bullards and major crosbys the writing of a long bond the solicitation of credentials of sureties and of the office mere solicitation procured it and although it was not much disguised or concealed yet it was so silently conducted that i believe the adversary never once suspected it all the wiles and malice of the old serpent would have been employed against it if it had been known or suspected but there was one particular of mere luck to which we were much indebted namely the complaint of cudworth against t—that unfriendly unbrotherly unneighborly as well as rash and unmannerly spurning of the execution and then sending it to gould where it was lost gave the great man an ill opinion of his sub and made him more willing and ready at my solicitation to constitute another and even without consulting t  0 saturday i have latterly arisen much earlier than usual arose at five and at six oclock instead of eight and nine the mornings are very long and fine opportunities for study they   0 are cool and pleasant but i have not improved my time properly i have dosed and sauntered away much of my time this morning is very fine the clear sky the bright sun the clean groves and grass after so fine a rain are very pleasant but the books within this chamber have a much better title to my attention than any of the rural scenes and objects without it i have been latterly too much in the world and too little in this retreat abroad my appetites are solicited my passions inflamed and my understanding too much perverted to judge wisely of men or things but in this retreat when neither my senses nor appetites nor passions are excited i am able to consider all things more coolly and sensibly i was guilty of rash and profane swearing of rash virulence against the characters of goffe j russell lieutenantgovernor c not but that there have been faults in their characters and conduct that every honest man ought to resent i have been interrupted from reading this institute ever since february amidst the dissipations of business pleasure conversation intrigue party c what mortal can give attention to an old latin institute of the canon law but it is certainly worth while to proceed and finish it as i have already been two thirds through it august   saturday i am creating enemies in every quarter of the town the clarks hate—mother hubbard thayer lamb tirrell j brackett this is multiplying and propagating enemies fast i shall have the ill will of the whole town daniel white moses adams this will not do daniel pratt vs thomas colson this action was brought by plaintiff against colson as administrator on the estate of mr bolter for nonperformance of a covenant of indenture pratt was a poor fatherless child and his mother unable to provide for him bound him an apprentice to mr bolter he was then under ten years of age and so was bound for eleven years and some odd months in consideration of this very long and unusual term of apprenticeship his master covenanted to teach him to read write and cipher and to teach him the trade of a weaver but we complain that he never taught us either to read write or cipher or to weave call the proof     the law gentlemen is extremely tender and indulgent to such actions as these for such is the benignity and humanity of the english constitution that all the weak and helpless and friendless part of our species are taken under its peculiar care and protection—women children and especially widows and fatherless children and they have always from the compassion of the law peculiar privileges and indulgences allowed them therefore as a poor fatherless and friendless child the law would allow great indulgence and lenity to this plaintiff but he is to be favored for another reason because the english law greatly favors education in every english country some sort of education some acquaintance with letters is necessary that a man may fill any station whatever in the countries of slavery and romish superstition the laity must not learn to read lest they should detect the gross impostures of the priesthood and shake off the yoke of bondage but in protestant countries and especially in england and its colonies freedom of inquiry is allowed to be not only the privilege but the duty of every individual we know it to be our duty to read examine and judge for ourselves even of ourselves what is right no priest nor pope has any right to say what i shall believe and i will not believe one word they say if i think it is not founded in reason and in revelation now how can i judge what my bible justifies unless i can read my bible the english constitution is founded t is bottomed and grounded on the knowledge and good sense of the people the very ground of our liberties is the freedom of elections every man has in politics as well as religion a right to think and speak and act for himself no man either king or subject clergyman or layman has any right to dictate to me the person i shall choose for my legislator and ruler i must judge for myself but how can i judge how can any man judge unless his mind has been opened and enlarged by reading a man who can read will find in his bible in his common sermon books that common people have by them and even in the almanac and the newspapers rules and observations that will enlarge his range of thought and enable him the better to judge who has and who has not that integrity of heart and that compass of knowledge and understanding which forms the statesman     september  0 thursday spent the evening at zabs with the parson wibird i have seen a picture of oliver cromwell with this motto under it   careat successibus opto    quisquis ab eventu facta notanda putat i pray that he may want success who thinks that deeds are to be estimated from their event their success oliver was successful but not prudent nor honest nor laudable nor imitable october    saturday read in institute and lancelott began lancelotts institute last january and have read no further than lib   tit   de exceptionibus et replicationibus october    sunday arose at six read in popes satires nil admirari c i last night read through both of dr donnes satires versified by pope was most struck with these lines   bear me some god oh quickly bear me hence   to wholesome solitude the nurse of sense   where contemplation prunes her ruffled wings   and the free soul looks down to pity kings prayer a posture hands uplifted and eyes a very proper prayer for me to make when i am in boston solitude is a personage in a clean wholesome dress the nurse and nourisher of sense contemplation a

philip charles c november  0 tuesday  another year is come round and i can recollect still less reading than i could last november the increase of my business within twelve months has been nothing i drew fewer writs last october court than i drew the october court before though i drew an uncommon number at both yet i have advanced a few steps have procured my brother his office abated nathan spears writ battled it with captain     thayer at major crosbys recovered of jo tirrell for lambard recovered of lawrence for tirrell abated kings writ conducted the petition against taverners all these things have been done in one year besides have bought some books c but have read but little law this morning i have been reading archbishop sharps sermon—to the upright there ariseth light in the darkness his character of the upright man c same day read a number of his sermons in his first volume he is a moving affectionate preacher devotional more than tillotson but not so moral    saturday brother quincy and i were sworn before the superior court it is now more than five years since i began the study of the law and it is about three years since i was sworn at the inferior court  0 monday this day removed to my chamber and made a fire the forenoon was spent in conversation with zab in walking to doctor turners and up penns hill and this afternoon in conversation with grindal rawson and zab at mrs marshs yet i have caught several snatches of reading and thinking in blackstone gilbert c but i as usual expect great things from this chamber and this winter           june   saturday rode from basss to secretary olivers in company with judge oliver  the judge soon opened upon politics says he major stockbridge informs me that colonel ruggles makes a very good speaker he has behaved to universal approbation soon afterwards the judge said i never knew so easy an election in my life some of the bar interest themselves very much in the matter one gentleman has interested himself most infamously advanced that to be law in the house which is not law that the judges cannot sit in the house of commons is certain because there is an act of parliament against it but the judges may sit and vote in the house of lords that is they may if they are peers lord mansfield—think he dont sit and vote how can the bar expect protection from the court if the bar endeavors to bring the court into contempt he is forever abusing the court he said not long since in the representatives room that take all the superior judges and every inferior judge in the province and put them all together and they would not make one half of a common lawyer i said upon this that was a distracted speech it is a pity that gentleman was not better guided he has many fine talents the judge replied quick i have known him these twenty years and i have no opinion of his head or his heart if bedlamism is a talent he has it in perfection he will one time say of the lieutenantgovernor that he had rather have him than any man he knows in any one office and the next hour will represent him as the greatest tyrant and most despicable creature living i have treated him with as much friendship as ever i did a stranger in my life and he knows very well how he has treated me i blush even to think of what he has said to me i have him in the utmost contempt i have the utmost contempt of     him i had as lief say it to him as not i have the utmost contempt of him i have been twelve years concerned in the executive courts and i never knew so much ill usage given to the court by all the lawyers in the province put it all together for all that time as i have known him give in one term the origin of all his bustle is very well known i heard a gentleman say he would give his oath that otis said to him if his father was not made a judge he would throw the province into flames if it cost him his life  for that one speech a thousand other persons would have been indicted   tuesday went to taunton court—to the land of leonards—three judges of the common pleas of that name each of whom has a son who was bred at a college the honorable george leonard the first justice seems to me arbitrary he committed two old gentlemen who were near eighty years old to the custody of an officer only for speaking loud when they were both deaf and not conscious that they did speak loud a check a reproof an admonition would have been enough he was unwilling that the sessions should adjourn for an hour to take the verdict of the jury in a trial upon a presentment of a riot but would have had that jury kept together all night till the court should sit again next morning no other court in the province superior and inferior would have thought of keeping the jury up he broke in most abruptly upon bob paine he did not think it was right to run out against the kings witnesses for his part he did not love to hear it three or four times over c thus the haughty tyrant treats the county i lodged the first night at crosmans the second at major leonards of rainham and the third at captain cobbs with paine i dined the first day i was there wednesday at captain cobbs with colonel otis and paine and the second at colonel     whites drank tea once at colonel whites with the three young leonards george zeph and daniel and i spent two evenings at cobbs with colonel otis and paine and i rode from taunton to milton with colonel otis  he is vastly easy and steady in his temper he is vastly goodhumored and sociable and sensible learned he is not but he is an easy familiar speaker he gave me many anecdotes both of his law and politics august    sunday reading thinking writing—have i totally renounced all three tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis october    friday spent last monday in taking pleasure with mr wibird met him in the morning at mr borlands rode with him to squantum to the very lowest point of the peninsula next to thompsons island to the high steep rock from whence the squaw threw herself who gave the name to the place it is an hideous craggy precipice nodding over the ocean forty feet in height the rocks seem to be a vast collection of pebbles as big as hens eggs thrown into melted cement and cooled in you may pull them to pieces with your fingers as fast as you please various have been the conjectures of the learned concerning this sort of rocks upon this part of the peninsula is a number of trees which appear very much like the lime tree  of europe which gentlemen are so fond of planting in their gardens for their beauty returned to mr borlands  dined and afternoon rode to germantown where we spent our evening deacon palmer  showed us his lucern growing in his garden of which he has cut as he tells us four crops this year the deacon     had his lucern seeds of mr greenleaf of abington who had his of judge oliver the deacon watered his but twice this summer and intends to expose it uncovered to all the weather of the winter for a fair trial whether it will endure our winters or not each of his four crops had attained a good length it has a rich fragrance for a grass he showed us a cut of it in nature displayed and another of st foin and another of trefoil the cut of the lucern was exact enough the pod in which the seeds are is an odd thing a kind of ramshorn or straw we had a good deal of conversation upon husbandry the deacon has about seventy bushels of potatoes this year on about one quarter of an acre of ground trees of several sorts considered the wild cherry tree bears a fruit of some value the wood is very good for the cabinet maker and is not bad to burn it is a tree of much beauty its leaves and bark are handsome and its shape the locust good timber fattening to soil by its leaves blossoms c good wood quick growth c the larch tree there is but one  in the country that in the lieutenantgovernors yard at milton it looks somewhat like an evergreen but is not sheds its leaves i read in thompsons travels in turkey in asia mention of a turpentine called by the name of the turpentine of venice which is not the produce of venice but of dauphiné and flows from the larch tree it is thick and balsamic and used in several arts particularly that of enamelling    sunday before sunrise my thoughts have taken a sudden turn to husbandry have contracted with jo field to clear my swamp and to build me a long string of stone wall and with isaac to build me sixteen rods more and with jo field to build me six rods more and my thoughts are running continually from the orchard to the pasture and from thence to the swamp and thence to the house and barn and land adjoining sometimes i am at the orchard ploughing up acre after acre planting pruning appletrees mending fences carting dung sometimes in the pasture digging stones clearing bushes pruning trees building wall to redeem posts and rails and sometimes removing button trees down to my house sometimes i am at the old swamp burning bushes digging stumps and roots cutting ditches     across the meadows and against my uncle and am sometimes at the other end of the town buying posts and rails to fence against my uncle and against the brook and am sometimes ploughing the upland with six yoke of oxen and planting corn potatoes c and digging up the meadows and sowing onions planting cabbages c c sometimes i am at the homestead running cross fences and planting potatoes by the acre and corn by the two acres and running a ditch along the line between me and field and a fence along the brook against my brother and another ditch in the middle from fields line to the meadows sometimes am carting gravel from the neighboring hills and sometimes dust from the streets upon the fresh meadows and am sometimes ploughing sometimes digging those meadows to introduce clover and other english grasses november   friday the cause of jeffries town treasurer of boston and sewall and edwards and several others—being suits for the penalties arising by the law of the province for building and covering their buildings not with slate nor tile but with shingles mr gridley made a motion that those actions should be dismissed because the judges were all interested in the event of them two of the judges to wit wells and foster hutchinson being inhabitants of boston and the other two to wit eliakim hutchinson and watts having real estates in that town to the poor of which those penalties are appropriated after a long wrangle as usual when trowbridge is in a case the court determined to continue the action that application might be made to the governor and council for special judges wells and foster declining to sit and watts too the case of a witness was mentioned in the argument a witness cannot depose when he is interested a juryman may be challenged who is interested but persons belonging to corporations are allowed for the necessity to testify in cases where those corporations are interested and jurymen and judges belonging to this province sat in the case of gray and paxton though interested for the necessity this motion mr g said could not be reduced to a written plea he could not plead to the jurisdiction of the court the court of common pleas had undoubted jurisdiction of the cause     but the judges could not sit because interested their honors were not the court of common pleas but the justices of the court of common pleas the court of common pleas was a body politic an invisible system a frame in the mind a fiction of the law the president and fellows of harvard college are not harvard college the case in strange was produced in which lord raymond went off the bench the parish of abbots langley in which his lordship lived being interested an order of two justices for the removal of a pauper confined by the sessions was carried to kings bench by certiorari authorities from hobarts and cokes reports were produced to show the tenderness of the law for this maxim—that a man shall not be judge in his own cause and that an act of parliament against natural equity as that a man should be judge in his own cause would be void mem after the court had given judgment mr gridley moved for a minute of the reasons of the judgment wells said the court were not accountable to the bar for their reasons but otis said the courts at home never refused their reasons for any judgment when the bar requested them because if the bar are left ignorant of the reasons the court go upon they will not know how to advise and direct their clients and after some debate the clerk was ordered to minute the reason for the continuance which was that three of the judges apprehended themselves interested and so not a court competent to try the cause g—contended that if the court should continue the causes they could not refuse sitting on the trial because an imparlance was a judicial act and so an assumption of jurisdiction foster hutchinson said that dismissing the actions would be a judicial act as much as continuing q the humanity the utility the policy the piety of the sanguinary laws against robbery and stealing boston december  0 thursday at goldthwaits  office spent one quarter of an hour with lieutenantgovernor hutchinson   0 the first thing he said was a question to goldthwait—what was the date of the earliest records of the county court goldthwait answered    0 his honor replied there were county courts for forty years before that and said he wanted to settle something in his own mind concerning the origin and constitution of the courts that adultery was punished with death by the first settlers and many other offences were made capital that are not now so that commissioners were sent over by king charles in      to inquire into the constitution of the colonies though their authority was not owned goldthwait said there were a great many odd entries one of a prosecution of a man for taking sixpence for an horse a braintree man too as unjust and unrighteous his honor told of a record of a woman condemned for adultery because a man had debauched her when she was drunk and of another of a boy imprisoned for a capital trial for some of their trifling capital crimes—stealing from his master or something—which boy was liberated by the commissioners of      the story of pratts death was told his honor said it would be a loss to his family he was in a fair way to have raised it but the new yorkers will be glad of it this to be sure was familiarity and affability but goldthwait cringed down and put on the timid fawning face and air and tone      braintree february   tuesday last thursday afternoon rode to germantown and there stayed at my friend cranchs till the last night—four nights and four days those two families  well deserve the character they hold of friendly sensible and social the men women and children are all sensible and obliging mem the anecdote of mr erving he has prophesied so long and with so much confidence that canada would be restored to the french that because he begins to see his prediction will not be fulfilled he is now straining his invention for reasons why we ought not to hold it he says the restoration of that province can alone prevent our becoming luxurious effeminate inattentive to any danger and so an easy prey to an     invader he was so soundly bantered the other day in the council chamber that he snatched his hat and cloak and went off in a passion mem the other of a piece sent to fleet to be printed upon the unfitness of mr mauduit to represent this province at the british court both in point of age and knowledge he is as that writer says seventy years old an honest man but avaricious a woollen draper a mere cit so ignorant of court and public business that he knew not where the public offices were and that he told mr bollan that he was agent for new england he says that all the other agents laugh at this province for employing him and that all persons on that side of the water are surprised at us that the considerations on the present german war were written by a person unknown who hired or persuaded mr mauduit to father it  books—we read five sermons in dr sherlock and several chapters in the inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and the beautiful the chapter upon sympathy they all disapprove the author says—we have a real pleasure in the distresses and misfortunes of others mem to write a letter to sewall or quincy or lowell on the subject of that chapter i employed however too little of my time in reading and in thinking i might have spent much more the idea of m de vattel indeed scowling and frowning haunted me q do we take pleasure in the real distress of others what is my sensation when i see captain cunningham laid up with the gout and hear his plaintive groans what are the feelings of the women at groanings what is my feeling when i hear of an honest mans losing a ship at sea       saturday memorabilia of this week the bar agreed upon these four rules—   that the clerk call the plaintiff and if anybody answer except the plaintiff or some sworn attorney his power be demanded and no general power in such case be admitted   that no attorneys fee be taxed for the future where the declaration was not drawn by the plaintiff himself or some sworn attorney   that no attendance be taxed unless the party attend personally or by some sworn attorney   that no attorney be allowed to practise here unless sworn in this court or in the superior court mr gridley read these rules to the court as unexceptionable regulations agreed upon by the bar mr otis arose and said he had the credit of the motion but he never had moved for any such rules as these for they were against the province law against the rights of mankind and he was amazed that so many wise heads as that bar was blessed with could think them practicable and concluded that he was for one entirely against them and said that all schemes to suppress pettifoggers must rest on the honor of the bar foster hutchinson asked why then was the court troubled with the motion judge watts said if the bar was not agreed the court could do nothing and at last they determined to consider till april   thus with a whiff of otis pestilential breath   was this whole system blown away but the bar was in a great rage thacher said to kent auchmuty and me—whoever votes for him to be any thing more than a constable let him be anathema maranatha i pamphleteer for him again no ill pamphleteer against him kent damned him and said he had been abused by him personally in such a manner as he never would forgive unless he made him more satisfaction than he imagined was in his power thacher moved that in the cards to be sent to the judges the expression should be the bar exclusively of mr otis invites—and auchmuty kent gridley and i as well as thacher voted for it     auchmuty and fitch  were equally warm they talked about renouncing all commerce or connection with him gridley talked about treating him dryly and decently auchmuty said the two principles of all this were popularity and avarice he made the motion at first to get some of these understrappers into his service he could not bear that quincy and auchmuty should have underworkers and he none and he objected to the rules to save his popularity with the constables justices story and ruddock c and pettifoggers of the town and with the pettifoggers that he uses as tools and myrmidons in the house mr g said he went off to avoid a quarrel for he could not bear it—such tergiversation such trimming

event took place of no trifling consequence to the subsequent life of the writer      here it may be proper to recollect something which makes an article of great importance in the life of every man i was of an amorous disposition and very early from ten or eleven years of age was very fond of the society of females i had my favorites among the young women and spent many of my evenings in their company and this disposition although controlled for seven years after my entrance into college returned and engaged me too much till i was married i shall draw no characters nor give any enumeration of my youthful flames it would be considered as no compliment to the dead or the living this i will say—they were all modest and virtuous girls and always maintained their character through life no virgin or matron ever had cause to blush at the sight of me or to regret her acquaintance with me no father brother son or friend ever had cause of grief or resentment for any intercourse between me and any daughter sister mother or any other relation of the female sex these reflections to me consolatory beyond all expression i am able to make with truth and sincerity and i presume i am indebted for this blessing to my education this has been rendered the more precious to me as i have seen enough of the effects of a different practice corroding reflections through life are the never failing consequence of illicit amours in old as well as in new countries the happiness of life depends more upon innocence in this respect than upon all the philosophy of epicurus or of zeno without it i passed the summer of      in attending courts and pursuing my studies with some amusement on my little farm to which i was frequently making additions until the fall when on the   th of october i was married to miss smith second daughter of the rev william smith minister of weymouth granddaughter of the honorable john quincy of braintree a connection which has been the source of all my felicity although a sense of duty which forced me away from her and my children for so many years produced all the griefs of my heart and all that i esteem real afflictions in life     sodalitas a club of friends      january    thursday soon after i got to boston at january court mr fitch came to me upon change and told me that mr gridley and he had something to communicate to me that i should like—in sacred confidence however i waited on mr gridley at his office after many conjectures what the secret might be and he told me that he and mr fitch had proposed a law club a private association for the study of law and oratory as to the bar he thought of them as he did think of them—otis thacher auchmuty he was considering who was for the future to support the honor and dignity of the bar and he was determined to bring me into practice the first practice and fitch  too he could easily do it by recommending and he was very desirous of forming a junto a small sodality of himself and fitch and me—and dudley if he pleased might come—in order to read in concert the feudal law and tullys orations and for this purpose he lent me the corpus juris civilis in quatuor partes distinctum eruditissimis dionysii gothofredi j c clarissimi notis illustratum at the end of which are the feudorum consuetudines partim ex editione vulgatâ partim ex cujacianâ vulgatâ appositæ as also the epitome feudorum dionysio gothofredo authore we agreed to meet the next evening in one of ballards back chambers and determine upon times places and studies we accordingly met mr gridley fitch and i and spent the whole evening proposals were to read a reign and the statutes of that reign to read hurds dialogues and any new pieces but at last we determined to read the feudal law and cicero only lest we should lose sight of our main object by attending to too many thursday nights were agreed on and to meet first at mr gridleys office there we accordingly met on the thursday night following and suffered our conversation to ramble upon hurds dialogues the pandects their discovery in italy by lotharius in      in the reign of stephen upon lambard de     priscis anglorum legibus in saxon and latin upon lord kames mr blackstone c but we agreed to meet the next thursday night at mr fitchs and to read the three first titles of the feudal law and tullys oration for milo i rode to boston on purpose to meet at fitchs gridley came—we read the three first titles of the feudal law and we read gothofreds notes and we looked into strykius for the explanation of many hard words in those three titles the valvasors capitanei guardia and guastaldi this strykius wrote an examen juris feudalis by way of question and answer his account of the original of the consuetudines feudorum is that they were collected and written by gerardus niger and obertus the consuls of milan we read also part of tullys milo and are to read the fourth and fifth titles of the feudal law and the rest of that oration next thursday night the law of inheritances in england originates in the feudal law gilberts tenures originate there robertsons history of scotland gives the clearest account of the feudal system they say lord kames has given us the introduction of the feudal law into scotland q what say the law tracts and dalrymple on this subject gridley taylor observed to me when in england that no books were more proper for nisi prius oratory than the examiner craftsman and such controversial writings of the best hands i expect the greatest pleasure from this sodality that i ever had in my life and a pleasure too that will not be painful to my reflection milo was condemned and went into banishment at marseilles there he afterwards read the oration which had been corrected and polished for his perusal and sent to him by cicero for a present and an amusement reading it he broke out—si sic egisses marce tulli barbatos pisces non comedissem for he had been eating a sort of bearded fishes that he found at marseilles    thursday the snowy weather prevented me from going to dudleys the sodality however met and read the two titles assigned and assigned the three next namely the sixth episcopum vel abbatem vel abbatissam vel dominum plebis feudum     dare non posse tit  th de natura feudi and tit  th de successione feudi february    thursday at boston entertained the sodality at blodgets we were never in better spirits or more social we began the thirteenth title of the feudal law de alienatione feudi and read three titles gridley proposed that we should mark all those passages which are adopted by the english law that when we come to read lord coke we may recur back upon occasion to the originals of our law the fourteenth title is de feudo marchiæ vel ducatus vel comitatus here therefore we see the originals of english dignities marquisates dukedoms counties c the fifteenth title is an maritus succedat uxori in feudo i quoted to my brothers the preface to the historical law tracts—the feudal customs ought to be the study of every man who proposes to reap instruction from the history of the modern european nations because among these nations public transactions not less than private property were some centuries ago regulated by the feudal system sovereigns formerly were many of them connected by the relation of superior and vassal the king of england for example by the feudal tenure held of the french king many fair provinces i quoted also the sentiments of rousseau which are very inimical to the feudal system the notion of representatives says he is modern descending to us from the feudal system that most iniquitous and absurd form of government by which human nature was so shamefully degraded  fitch the feudal system was military it was a martial system a set of regulations as robertson calls it for the encampment of a great army and it was a wise and good system for a martial people in such circumstances for the feudal connections and subordination and services were necessary for their defence against the inroads and invasions of their neighbors c ego i think that the absurdity and iniquity lies in this—that nations at peace and in plenty who live by commerce and industry have adopted such a system     gridley there lies the absurdity and iniquity and the observation you quote proves that rousseau is shallow i might have quoted lord kamess british antiquities who says—it is the plan of the feudal law to bestow the whole land property upon the king and to subject to him the bulk of the people in quality of servants and vassals a constitution so contradictory to all the principles which govern mankind can never be brought about one should imagine but by foreign conquest or native usurpation and in another place he calls the feudal connection—the feudal yoke these epithets of absurd iniquitous unnatural c are not very agreeable to the opinion of strykius who says in answer to the question—unde originem trahunt feuda certo modo et si formam feudorum genericam consideres dici potest ex jure gentium hoc enim ratio naturalis junctâ necessitate publicâ exigit ut militibus potissimum prædia ab hostibus occupata pro bene meritis concederentur sub conditione tamen fidelitatis quo eo securior esset respublica et ad patriam defendendam magis allicerentur in milo we read from the twentyseventh to the thirtyfourth section in davidsons translation we begin the peroration next we had guthries and davidsons translations in point of accuracy and spirit davidsons is vastly superior mr gridley produced a book entitled in herennium commentarius as an introduction to tully de oratore and read the three sorts of orations—the demonstrative deliberative and judicial—and the several parts of an oration—the exordium c gridley our plan must be when we have finished the feudal law to read cokelittleton and after him a reign and the statutes of that reign it should also be a part of our plan to improve ourselves in writing by reading carefully the best english writers and by using ourselves to writing for it should be a part of our plan to publish pieces now and then let us form our style upon the ancients and the best english authors i hope and expect to see at the bar in consequence of this sodality a purity an elegance and a spirit surpassing any thing that ever appeared in america fitch said that he would not say he had abilities but he would say he had ambition enough to hope for the same thing this sodality has given rise to the following speculation of   0 my own which i commit to writing as hints for future inquiries rather than as a satisfactory theory  august    wednesday i hope it will give no offence to inquire into the grounds and reasons of the strange conduct of yesterday and last night at boston is there any evidence that mr oliver  ever wrote to the ministry or to anybody in england any unfavorable representations of the people of this province has he ever placed the character of the people their manners their laws their principles in religion or government their submission to order and magistracy in a false light is it known that he ever advised the ministry to lay internal taxes upon us that he ever solicited the office of distributer of stamps or that he has ever done any thing to injure the people or to incur their displeasure besides barely accepting of that office if there is no proof at all of any such injury done to the people by that gentleman has not the blind undistinguishing rage of the rabble done him irreparable injustice to be placed only in pageantry in the most conspicuous part of the town with such ignominious devices around him would be thought severity enough by any man of common sensibility but to be carried through the town in such insolent triumph and burned on a hill to have his garden torn in pieces his house broken open his furniture destroyed and his whole family thrown into confusion and terror is a very atrocious violation of the peace and of dangerous tendency and consequence but on the other hand let us ask a few questions has not his honor the lieutenantgovernor discovered to the people in innumerable instances a very ambitious and avaricious disposition     has he not grasped four of the most important offices in the province into his own hands has not his brotherinlaw oliver another of the greatest places in government is not a brother of the secretary a judge of the superior court has not that brother a son in the house has not the secretary a son in the house who is also a judge in one of the counties did not that son marry the daughter of another of the judges of the superior court has not the lieutenantgovernor a brother a judge of the pleas in boston and a namesake and near relation who is another judge has not the lieutenantgovernor a near relation who is register of his own court of probate and deputy secretary has he not another near relation who is clerk of the house of representatives is not this amazing ascendency of one family foundation sufficient on which to erect a tyranny is it not enough to excite jealousies among the people quære further has not many a member of both houses labored to the utmost of his ability to obtain a resolution to send home some petitions and remonstrances to the king lords and commons against the impositions they saw were about to be laid upon us has not the lieutenantgovernor all along been the very gentleman who has prevented it and wiped every spirited if not every sensible expression out of those petitions quære further when the court was about to choose an agent did not the governor lieutenantgovernor and secretary make use of all their influence to procure an election for mr jackson  was not mr jackson a secretary to mr grenville was not mr grenville the author of the late measures relative to the colonies was not mr jackson an agent and a particular friend of the governor was not all this considering the natural jealousy of mankind enough to excite suspicions among the vulgar that all these gentlemen were in a combination to favor the measures of the ministry at least to prevent any thing from being done here to discourage the minister from his rash mad and dogmatical proceedings would it not be prudence then in those gentlemen at this alarming conjuncture and a condescension that is due to the present fears and distresses of the people in some manner consistent with the dignity of their stations and characters to remove these jealousies from the minds of the people by giving an easy solution of these difficulties     after the fourteenth of august i went on a journey to marthas vineyard on the trial of a cause before referees between jerusha mayhew and her relations the keen understanding of this woman and the uncontrollable violence of her irascible passions had excited a quarrel of the most invidious inveterate and irreconcilable nature between the several branches of the mayhew family which had divided the whole island into parties the rancor of that fiend the spirit of party had never appeared to me in so odious and dreadful a light though i had heard much of it in a contest between roland cotton and parson jackson at woburn and had remarked enough of it in the trial between hopkins and ward  at worcester in all these cases it seemed to have wrought an entire metamorphosis of the human character it destroyed all sense and understanding all equity and humanity all memory and regard to truth all virtue honor decorum and veracity never in my life was i so grieved and disgusted with my species more than a week i think was spent in the examination of witnesses and the arguments of council mr paine on one side and i on the other we endeavored to argue the cause on both sides as well as we could but which of us got the cause i have forgotten it was indeed no matter for it was impossible for human sagacity to discover on which side justice lay we were pretty free with our vituperations on both sides and the inhabitants appeared to feel the justice of them i think the cause was compromised i forgot to mention that while we were at falmouth waiting to be ferried over to the island the news arrived from boston of the riots on the twentysixth of august in which lieutenantgovernor hutchinsons house was so much injured this year      was the epoch of the stamp act i drew up a petition to the selectmen of braintree and procured it to be signed by a number of the respectable inhabitants to call a meeting of the town to instruct their representative in relation to the stamps the public attention of the whole continent was     alarmed and my principles and political connections were well known i prepared a draught of instructions at home and carried them with me the cause of the meeting was explained at some length and the state and danger of the country pointed out a committee was appointed to prepare instructions of which i was nominated as one we retired to mr niless house my draught was produced and unanimously adopted without amendment reported to the town and accepted without a dissenting voice these were published in drapers paper as that printer first applied to me for a copy they were decided and spirited enough they rang through the state and were adopted in so many words as i was informed by the representatives of that year by forty towns as instructions to their representatives they were honored sufficiently by the friends of government with the epithets of inflammatory c i have not seen them now for almost forty years and remember very little of them i presume they would now appear a poor trifle but at that time they met with such strong feelings in the readers that their effect was astonishing to me and excited some serious reflections i thought a man ought to be very cautious what kinds of fuel he throws into a fire when it is thus glowing in the community although it is a certain expedient to acquire a momentary celebrity yet it may produce future evils which may excite serious repentance i have seen so many firebrands thrown into the flame not only in the worthless and unprincipled writings of the profligate and impious thomas paine and in the french revolution but in many others that i think every man ought to take warning in the braintree instructions however if i recollect any reprehensible fault it was that they conceded too much to the adversary not to say enemy  about this time i called upon my friend samuel adams and found him at his desk he told me the town of boston had employed him to draw instructions for their representatives that he felt an ambition which was very apt to mislead a man—that of doing something extraordinary and he wanted to consult a friend who might suggest some thoughts to his mind i read his instructions and showed him     a copy of mine i told him i thought his very well as far as they went but he had not gone far enough upon reading mine he said he was of my opinion and accordingly took into his some paragraphs from mine braintree december    wednesday how great is my loss in neglecting to keep a regular journal through the last spring summer and fall in the course of my business as a surveyor of highways as one of the committee for dividing planning and selling the north commons in the course of my two great journeys to pownalborough and marthas vineyard and in several smaller journeys to plymouth taunton and boston i had many fine opportunities and materials for speculation the year      has been the most remarkable year of my life that enormous engine fabricated by the british parliament for battering down all the rights and liberties of america i mean the stamp act has raised and spread through the whole continent a spirit that will be recorded to our honor with all future generations in every colony from georgia to new hampshire inclusively the stamp distributers and inspectors have been compelled by the unconquerable rage of the people to renounce their offices such and so universal has been the resentment of the people that every man who has dared to speak in favor of the stamps or to soften the detestation in which they are held how great soever his abilities and virtues had been esteemed before or whatever his fortune connections and influence had been has been seen to sink into universal contempt and ignominy the people even to the lowest ranks have become more attentive to their liberties more inquisitive about them and more determined to defend them than they were ever before known or had occasion to be innumerable have been the monuments of wit humor sense learning spirit patriotism and heroism erected in the several colonies and provinces in the course of this year our presses have groaned our pulpits have thundered our legislatures have resolved our towns have voted the crown officers have everywhere trembled and all their little tools and creatures been afraid to speak and ashamed to be seen this spirit however has not yet been sufficient to banish from     persons in authority that timidity which they have discovered from the beginning the executive courts have not yet dared to adjudge the stamp act void nor to proceed with business as usual though it should seem that necessity alone would be sufficient to justify business at present though the act should be allowed to be obligatory the stamps are in the castle mr oliver has no commission the governor has no authority to distribute or even to unpack the bales the act has never been proclaimed nor read in the province yet the probate office is shut the customhouse is shut the courts of justice are shut and all business seems at a stand yesterday and the day before the two last days of service for january term only one man asked me for a writ and he was soon determined to wave his request i have not drawn a writ since the first of november how long we are to remain in this languid condition this passive obedience to the stamp act is not certain but such a pause cannot be lasting debtors grow insolent creditors grow angry and it is to be expected that the public offices will very soon be forced open unless such favorable accounts should be received from england as to draw away the fears of the great or unless a greater dread of the multitude should drive away the fear of censure from great britain it is my opinion that by this inactivity we discover cowardice and too much respect to the act this rest appears to be by implication at least an acknowledgment of the authority of parliament to tax us and if this authority is once acknowledged and established the ruin of america will become inevitable this long interval of indolence and idleness will make a large chasm in my affairs if it should not reduce me to distress and incapacitate me to answer the demands upon me but i must endeavor in some degree to compensate the disadvantage by posting my books reducing my accounts into better order and by diminishing my expenses—but above all by improving the leisure of this winter in a diligent application to my studies i find that idleness lies between business and study that is the transition from the hurry of a multiplicity of business to the tranquillity that is necessary for intense study is not easy there must be a vacation an interval between them for the mind to recollect itself     the bar seem to me to behave like a flock of shot pigeons they seem to be stopped the net seems to be thrown over them and they have scarcely courage left to flounce and to flutter so sudden an interruption in my career is very unfortunate for me i was but just getting into my gears just getting under sail and an embargo is laid upon the ship thirty years of my life are passed in preparation for business i have had poverty to struggle with envy and jealousy and malice of enemies to encounter no friends or but few to assist me so that i have groped in dark obscurity till of late and had but just become known and gained a small degree of reputation when this execrable project was set on foot for my ruin as well as that of america in general and of great britain    thursday a fair morning after a severe storm of three days and four nights a vast quantity of rain fell about twelve oclock came in messrs crafts and chase and gave me a particular account of the proceedings of the sons of liberty on tuesday last  in prevailing on mr oliver to renounce his office of distributer of stamps by a declaration under his hand and under his oath taken before justice dana in hanover square under the very tree of liberty nay under the very limb where he had been hanged in effigy august   th      their absolute requisition of an oath and under that tree were circumstances extremely humiliating and mortifying as punishments for his receiving a deputation to be distributer after his pretended resignation and for his faint and indirect declaration in the newspapers last monday about one oclock came in mr clark one of the constables     of the town of boston with a letter from mr william cooper their townclerk in these words william cooper john adams december   th      boston sir— i am directed by the town to acquaint you that they have this day voted unanimously that jeremiah gridley james otis and john adams esquires be applied to as counsel to appear before his excellency the governor in council in support of their memorial praying that the courts of law in this province may be opened a copy of said memorial will be handed you on your coming to town i am sir your most obedient humble servant william cooper town clerk john adams esq  boston december   th      the reasons which induced boston to choose me at a distance and unknown as i am the particular persons concerned and measures concerted to bring this about i am wholly at a loss to conjecture as i am what the future effects and consequences will be both with regard to myself and the public but when i recollect my own reflections and speculations yesterday a part of which were committed to writing last night and may be seen under december   th and compare them with the proceedings of boston yesterday of which the foregoing letter informed me i cannot but wonder and call to mind my lord bacons observation about secret invisible laws of nature and communications and influences between places that are not discoverable by sense but i am now under all obligations of interest and ambition as well as honor gratitude and duty to exert the utmost of my abilities in this important cause how shall it be conducted shall we contend that the stamp act is void—that the parliament have no legal authority to impose internal taxes upon us because we are not represented in it—and therefore that the stamp act ought to be waved by the judges as against natural equity and the constitution shall we use these as arguments for opening the courts of law or shall we ground ourselves on necessity only      0 friday went to boston dined with mr bowe  in company with messrs gridley otis kent and dudley after dinner went to the townhouse and attended with the committee of the town of boston and many other gentlemen in the representatives room till about dark after candlelight when mr adams the chairman of the committee received a message from the governor by the deputy secretary purporting that his excellency and the council were ready to hear the memorial of the town of boston and their counsel in support of it but that no other persons might attend we accordingly went in his excellency recommended it to us who were of counsel for the town to divide the points of law and topics of argument among ourselves that repetition might as much as possible be avoided mr gridley answered that as he was to speak last he would endeavor to avoid repetition of what should be said by the two gentlemen who were to speak before him mr otis added that as he was to speak second he would observe the same rule then it fell upon me without one moments opportunity to consult any authorities to open an argument upon a question that was never made before and i wish i could hope it never would be made again that is whether the courts of law should be open or not my old friend thachers officina justitiæ i grounded my argument on the invalidity of the stamp act it not being in any sense our act having never consented to it but lest that foundation should not be sufficient on the present necessity to prevent a failure of justice and the present impossibility of carrying that act into execution     mr otis reasoned with great learning and zeal on the judges oaths c mr gridley on the great inconveniences that would ensue the interruption of justice the governor said many of the arguments used were very good ones to be used before the judges of the executive courts but he believed there had been no instance in america of an application to the governor and council and said that if the judges should receive any directions from the king about a point of law they would scorn to regard them and would say that while they were in those seats they only were to determine points of law the council adjourned to the morning and i repaired to my lodgings    saturday spent the morning in sauntering about and chatting with one and another—the sheriff mr goldthwaite brother sewall c—upon the times dined with brother kent   0 after dinner received a hint from the committee that as i was of counsel for the town i not only had a right but it was expected i should attend the meeting i went accordingly the committee reported the answer of the board to their petition which was in substance that the board had no authority to direct the courts of law in the manner prayed for that the memorial involved a question of law namely whether the officers of the government in the present circumstances of the province could be justified in proceeding with business without stamps that the board were desirous that the judges should decide that question freely without apprehension of censure from the board and that the board recommended it to the judges of the inferior court for the county of suffolk and to the other judges of the other courts in the province to determine that question as soon as may be at or before their next respective terms  the question was put whether that paper should be recorded passed in the affirmative the next question was whether it was a satisfactory answer to their memorial unanimously in the negative then several motions were made the first was that the meeting be adjourned to a future day and that the towns counsel be desired to consult together and give the town their opinions whether any other legal and constitutional steps can be taken by the town towards removing the obstructions to justice the second motion was that those of the towns counsel who were present should then give their opinion the third was that application should be made to the judges to determine the question speedily the second prevailed and i was called upon to give my opinion first i agreed with kent that an application to the judges might be out of character both for the town and the judges and that no person could be in any danger of penalties on the one hand or of having processes adjudged void on the other but many persons might entertain fears and jealousies and doubts which     would everlastingly be a grievance so that i had heard no proposal yet made for the future conduct of the town which had not difficulties and objections attending it so that i must conclude myself as yet in doubt and that i dared not give any opinion positively in a matter of so much importance without the most mature deliberation mr otis then gave his sentiments and declared once for all that he knew of no legal and constitutional course the town could take but to direct their representatives to request the governor to call a convention of the members of both houses as he could not legally call an assembly and if his excellency would not to call one themselves by requesting all the members to meet but concluded with observing that as one of their counsel was not present and another was in doubt he thought it would be best to take further time for consideration and the town accordingly voted an adjournment to next thursday ten oclock a consultation therefore i must have with messrs gridley and otis and we must all attend the town meeting next thursday what advice shall we give them the question is what legal and constitutional measures the town can take to open the courts of law the town in their memorial to his excellency in council assert that the courts of law within the province in which alone justice can be distributed among the people so far as respects civil matters are to all intents and purposes shut up for which no just and legal reason can be assigned the record of the board sent down in answer admits that the courts of law are to all intents and purposes shut up and says that before they can be opened a point of law must be decided namely whether the officers of the government in the present circumstances of the province can be justified in proceeding in their offices without stamps—which the judges are to determine are the board then agreed with the town that the courts of law are shut up but i hope the town will not agree with the board that the judges are the proper persons to decide whether they shall be open or not it is the first time i believe that such a question was ever put since william the conqueror nay since the days of king lear should the twelve judges of england and all other officers of justice judicial and ministerial     suddenly stop and shut up their offices i believe the king in council would hardly recommend any points of law to the consideration of those judges the king it is true of his prerogative could not remove the judges because in england a judge is quite another thing from what he is here but i believe the commons in parliament would immediately impeach them all of high treason my advice to the town will be to take the board at their word and to choose a committee immediately in the first place to wait on the governor in council as the supreme court of probate and request of them a determination of the point—whether the officers of the probate courts in the province can be justified in proceeding with business without stamps in the next place to wait on the honorable the judges of the superior court to request their determination of the same question and in the third place to wait on the judges of the inferior court for the county of suffolk with the same request in pursuance of the recommendation of the honorable board and unless a speedy determination of the question is obtained in all these courts in this way to request of the governor a convention of the two houses and if that is refused to endeavor to call one themselves what are the consequences of the supposition that the courts are shut up the king is the fountain of justice by the constitution and it is a maxim of the law that the king never dies are not protection and allegiance reciprocal and if we are out of the kings protection are we not discharged from our allegiance are not all the ligaments of government dissolved is it not an abdication of the throne in short where will such a horrid doctrine terminate it would run us into treason    sunday at home with my family thinking    monday went to boston after dinner rambled after messrs gridley and otis but could find neither went into mr dudleys mr danas mr otiss office and then to mr adamss and went with him to the monday night club there i found otis cushing wells pemberton gray austin two waldos inches dr parker and spent the evening very agreeably indeed politicians all at this club we had many curious anecdotes about governors counsellors representatives demagogues merchants c the behavior of these gentlemen is very familiar and friendly     to each other and very polite and complaisant to strangers gray  has a very tender mind is extremely timid he says when he meets a man of the other side he talks against him when he meets a man of our side he opposes him—so that he fears he shall be thought against everybody and so everybody will be against him but he hopes to prepare the way for his escape at next may from an employment that neither his abilities nor circumstances nor turn of mind are fit for cushing  is steady and constant and busy in the interest of liberty and the opposition is famed for secrecy and his talent at procuring intelligence adams  is zealous ardent and keen in the cause is always for softness and delicacy and prudence where they will do but is staunch and stiff and strict and rigid and inflexible in the cause otis is fiery and feverous his imagination flames his passions blaze he is liable to great inequalities of temper sometimes in despondency sometimes in a rage the rashnesses and imprudencies into which his excess of zeal have formerly transported him have made him enemies whose malicious watch over him occasion more caution and more cunning and more inexplicable passages in his conduct than formerly and perhaps views at the chair or the board or possibly more expanded views beyond the atlantic may mingle now with his patriotism the il penseroso however is discernible on the faces of all four adams i believe has the most thorough understanding of liberty and her resources in the temper and character of the people though not in the law and constitution as well as the most habitual radical love of it of any of them as well as the most correct genteel and artful pen he is a man of refined policy steadfast integrity exquisite humanity genteel erudition obliging engaging manners real as well as professed piety and     a universal good character unless it should be admitted that he is too attentive to the public and not enough so to himself and his family the gentlemen were warm to have the courts opened gridley had advised to wait for a judicial opinion of the judges i was for requesting of the governor that the general court might assemble at the time to which they stood prorogued and if the town should think fit to request the extrajudicial opinion of the judges i was for petitioning the governor and council to determine the question first as supreme ordinary gridley will be absent and so shall i but i think the apparent impatience of the town must produce some spirited measures perhaps more spirited than prudent    tuesday returned from boston spent the afternoon and evening at home    wednesday christmas at home thinking reading searching concerning taxation without consent concerning the great pause and rest in business by the laws of

for all the robberies done and also for the damages wingates abridgment title robberies nulli vendemus nulli negabimus aut deferemus justitiam every writ supposes the king present in all his courts of justice lord coke says against this ancient and fundamental law and in the face thereof i find an act of parliament made that as well justices of assize as justices of peace without any finding or presentment of twelve men upon a bare information for the king before them made should have full power and authority by their discretions to hear and determine all offences and contempts against the form ordinance and effect of any statute by     color of which act shaking this fundamental law it is not credible what horrible oppressions and exactions were committed by sir richard empson and edmund dudley and upon this unjust and injurious act a new office was created and they made masters of the kings forfeitures but at the parliament first henry viii this act    henry vii is recited made void and repealed the fearful end of these two oppressors should deter others from committing the like and admonish parliaments that instead of this ordinary and precious trial per legem terræ they bring not in absolute and partial trials by discretion went not to christmas dined at home drank tea at grandfather quincys  the old gentleman inquisitive about the hearing before the governor and council about the governors and secretarys looks and behavior and about the final determination of the board the old lady as merry and chatty as ever with her stories out of the newspapers spent the evening at home with my partner and no other company mr samuel adams told me he was glad i was nominated for several reasons first because he hoped that such an instance of respect from the town of boston would make an impression on my mind and secure my friendship to the town from gratitude secondly he was in hopes such distinction from boston would be of service to my business and interest thirdly he hoped that braintree finding the eyes of boston were upon me would fix theirs on me too next may his hopes in the two first particulars may be well grounded but i am sure not in the third a dissertation upon seekers—of elections of commissions from the governor of commissions from the crown of elections—when they give your one hundred pounds lawful money towards building a new meetinghouse and one hundred old tenor towards repairing one or fifty dollars towards repairing highways or ten dollars to the treasury towards the support of     the poor of the town or when they are very liberal of their drams of brandy and lumps of sugar and of their punch c on may meeting days these are commonly persons who have some further views and designs these largesses aim at something further than your votes these persons aim at being justices sheriffs judges colonels and when they get to court they will be hired and sell their votes as you sold yours to them but there is another sort of seekers worse than the other two—such as seek to be governors lieutenantgovernors secretaries customhouse officers of all sorts stampofficers of all sorts—in fine such as seek appointments from the crown these seekers are actuated by a more ravenous sort of ambition and avarice and they merit a more aggravated condemnation these ought to be avoided and dreaded as the plague as the destroying angels and the evil spirits are as good objects of your trust as they let no such man ever have the vote of a freeholder or a representative let no such man be trusted    friday in unforeseen cases that is when the state of things is found such as the author of the disposition has not foreseen and could not have thought of we should rather follow his intention than his words and interpret the act as he himself would have interpreted it had he been present or conformably to what he would have done if he had foreseen the things that happened this rule is of great use to judges vattel p   0 book   ch    s     if a case be presented in which one cannot absolutely apply the well known reason of a law or a promise this case ought to be excepted book   ch    s     every interpretation that leads to an absurdity ought to be rejected page     book   ch    s     every impossibility physical and moral is an absurdity at home all day mr shute called in the evening and gave     us a number of anecdotes about governor rogers  and secretary potter—their persecution in boston their flight to rhode island their sufferings there their deliverance from jail and voyage to antigua and ireland without money their reception in ireland and voyage to england their distresses in england till they borrowed money to get rogerss journal printed and present it to his majesty which procured each of them his appointment at michilimackinac shute is a jolly merry droll social christian he loves to laugh tells a story with a good grace delights in banter but yet reasons well is inquisitive and judicious has an eye that plays its lightnings sly and waggish and roguish is for sinking every person who either favors the stamps or trims about them into private station expects a great mortality among the counsellors next may in this i think he is right if there is any man who from wild ideas of power and authority from a contempt of that equality in knowledge wealth and power which has prevailed in this country or from any other cause can upon principle desire the execution of the stamp act those principles are a total forfeiture of the confidence of the people if there is any one who cannot see the tendency of that act to reduce the body of the people to ignorance poverty dependence his want of eyesight is a disqualification for public employment let the towns and the representatives therefore renounce every stamp man and every trimmer next may    saturday went to weymouth with my wife dined at father smiths heard much of the uneasiness among the people of hingham at a sermon preached by mr gay  on the day of     thanksgiving from a text in james out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing in which he said that the ancient weapons of the church were prayers and tears not clubs and inculcated submission to authority in pretty strong expressions his people said that mr gay would do very well for a distributer and they believed he had the stamps in his house and even threatened c this uneasiness it seems was inflamed by a sermon preached there the sunday after by mr smith which they admired very much and talk of printing as the best sermon they ever heard him preach this sermon of mr smiths was from—render therefore unto cæsar the things that are cæsars and unto god the things that are gods the tenor of it was to recommend honor reward and obedience to good rulers and a spirited opposition to bad ones interspersed with a good deal of animated declamation upon liberty and the times it seems there is a club consisting of colonel lincoln the two captain barkers one of them an halfpay officer colonel thaxter c who visit the parson gay every sunday evening and this club is wholly inclined to passive obedience as the best way to procure redress a very absurd sentiment indeed we have tried prayers and tears and humble begging and timid tame submission as long as trying is good and instead of redress we have only increased our burdens and aggravated our condemnation returned and spent the evening at home    sunday heard parson wibird—hear o heavens and give ear o earth i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me i began to suspect a tory sermon on the times from this text but the preacher confined himself to spirituals but i expect if the tories should become the strongest we shall hear many sermons against the ingratitude injustice disloyalty treason rebellion impiety and ill policy of refusing obedience to the stamp act the church clergy to be sure will be very eloquent the church people are many of them favorers of the stamp act at present major miller forsooth     is very fearful that they will be stomachful at home and angry and resentful mr veasey insists upon it that we ought to pay our proportion of the public burdens mr cleverly is fully convinced that they that is the parliament have a right to tax us he thinks it is wrong to go on with business we had better stop and wait till spring till we hear from home he says we put the best face upon it that letters have been received in boston from the greatest merchants in the nation blaming our proceedings and that the merchants dont second us letters from old mr lane and from mr deberdt he says that things go on here exactly as they did in the reign of king charles i that blessed saint and martyr thus that unaccountable man goes about sowing his pernicious seeds of mischief instilling wrong principles in church and state into the people striving to divide and disunite them and to excite fears to damp their spirits and lower their courage etter is another of the poisonous talkers but not equally so cleverly and veasey are slaves in principle they are devout religious slaves and a religious bigot is the worst of men cleverly converses of late at mr lloyds with some of the seekers of appointments from the crown—some of the dozen in the town of boston who ought as hancock says to be beheaded or with some of those who converse with the governor who ought as tom boylston says to be sent home with all the other governors on the continent with chains about their necks  0 monday we are now concluding the year      tomorrow is the last day of a year in which america has shown such magnanimity and spirit as never before appeared in any country for such a tract of country and wednesday will open upon us a new year      which i hope will procure us innumerable testimonies from europe in our favor and applause and which we all hope will produce the greatest and most extensive joy ever felt in america on the repeal both of the stamp act and sugar act at least of the former q who is it that has harangued the grand juries in every county and endeavored to scatter party principles in politics who has made it his constant endeavor to discountenance the odium in which informers are held who has taken occasion in finespun spick and span spruce nice pretty easy warbling   0 declamations to grand inquests to render the characters of informers honorable and respectable who has frequently expressed his apprehensions that the form of government in england was become too popular who is it that has said in public speeches that the most complete monarchy in europe was the government of france who is it that so often enlarges on the excellency of the government of queen elizabeth and insists upon it so often that the constitution about the time of her reign and under her administration was nearest the point of perfection who is it that has always given his opinion in favor of prerogative and revenue in every case in which they have been brought into question without one exception who is it that has endeavored to bias simple juries by an argument as warm and vehement as those of the bar in a case where the province was contending against a customhouse officer  and what were the other means employed in that cause against the resolutions of the general assembly who has monopolized almost all the power of the government to himself and his family and who has been endeavoring to procure more both on this side and the other side the atlantic read shakspeares life of king henry viii    tuesday went to mr jo basss and there read yesterdays paper walked in the afternoon into the common and quite through my hemlock swamp i find many fine bunches of young maples and nothing else but alders spent the evening at home with neighbor field the national attention is fixed upon the colonies the religion administration of justice geography numbers c of the colonies are a fashionable study but what wretched blunders do they make in attempting to regulate them they know not the character of americans      january   wednesday severe cold and a prospect of snow we are now upon the beginning of a year of greater expectation than any that has passed before it this year brings ruin or salvation to the british colonies the eyes of all america are fixed on the british parliament in short britain and america are staring at each other and they will probably stare more and more for some time     at home all day mr joshua hayward jr dined with me town politics the subject doctor tufts here in the afternoon american politics the subject read in the evening a letter from mr deberdt  our present agent to lord dartmouth in which he considers three questions   whether in equity or policy america ought to refund any part of the expense of driving away the french in the last war   whether it is necessary for the defence of the british plantations to keep up an army there   whether in equity the parliament can tax us each of which he discusses like a man of sense integrity and humanity well informed in the nature of his subject in his examination of the last question he goes upon the principle of the ipswich instructions namely that the first settlers of america were driven by oppression from the realm and so dismembered from the dominions till at last they offered to make a contract with the nation or the crown and to become subject to the crown upon certain conditions which contract subordination and conditions were wrought into their charters which gave them a right to tax themselves  this is a principle which has been advanced long ago i remember in the trial of the cause at worcester between governor hopkins of rhode island and mr ward one of the witnesses swore that he heard governor hopkins some years before in a banter with colonel amy advancing that we were under no subjection to the british parliament that our forefathers came from leyden c and indeed it appears from hutchinsons history and the massachusetts     records that the colonies were considered formerly both here and at home as allies rather than subjects the first settlement certainly was not a national act that is not an act of the people nor the parliament nor was it a national expense neither the people of england nor their representatives contributed any thing towards it nor was the settlement made on a territory belonging to the people nor the crown of england q how far can the concern the council at plymouth had in the first settlement be considered as a national act how far can the discoveries made by the cabots be considered as an acquisition of territory to the nation or the crown and quære whether the council at plymouth or the voyages of the cabots or of sir walter raleigh c were any expense to the nation in the paper there are also remarks on the proceedings of parliament relating to the stamp act taken from the london magazine september       this remarker says as a great number of new offences new penalties and new offices and officers are by this act created we cannot wonder at its being extremely disgustful to our fellow subjects in america even the patient and long suffering people of this country would scarcely have borne it at once they were brought to it by degrees and they will be more inconvenient in america than they can be in england the remarker says further that the design of one clause in the stamp act seems to be that there shall be no such thing as a practising lawyer in the country—the case of the saxons this design he says ludicrously by compelling every man to manage and plead his own cause would prevent many delays and perversions of justice and so be an advantage to the people of america but he seriously doubts whether the tax will pay the officers people will trust to honor like gamesters and stockjobbers he says he will not enter into the question whether the americans are right or wrong in the opinion they have been indulged in ever since their establishment that they could not be subjected to any taxes but such as should be imposed by their own respective assemblies he thinks a land tax the most just and convenient of any an extension of the british land tax to the american dominions but this would have occasioned a new assessment     of the improved value of the lands in england as well as here which probably prevented the scheme of a land tax for he hopes no views of extending the corruptive power of the ministers of the crown had any effect it is said at new york that private letters inform the great men are exceedingly irritated at the tumults in america and are determined to enforce the act this irritable race however will have good luck to enforce it they will find it a more obstinate war than the conquest of canada and louisiana   thursday a great storm of snow last night weather tempestuous all day waddled through the snow driving my cattle to water at doctor savils—a fine piece of glowing exercise brother spent the evening here in cheerful chat at philadelphia the heartandhand fire company has expelled mr hughes the stamp man for that colony the freemen of talbot county in maryland have erected a gibbet before the door of the courthouse twenty feet high and have hanged on it the effigies of a stamp informer in chains in terrorem till the stamp act shall be repealed and have resolved unanimously to hold in utter contempt and abhorrence every stamp officer and every favorer of the stamp act and to have no communication with any such person not even to speak to him unless to upbraid him with his baseness so triumphant is the spirit of liberty everywhere such a union was never before known in america in the wars that have been with the french and indians a union could never be effected i pity my unhappy fellow subjects in quebec and halifax for the great misfortune that has befallen them quebec consists chiefly of frenchmen who are mixed with a few english and awed by an army though it seems the discontent there is so great that the gazette is dropped halifax consists of a set of fugitives and vagabonds who are also kept in fear by a fleet and an army but can no punishment be devised for barbadoes and port royal in jamaica for their base desertion of the cause of liberty their tame surrender of the rights of britons their mean timid resignation to slavery meeching  sordid stupid creatures below contempt below pity they deserve to be made slaves to their     own negroes but they live under the scorching sun which melts them dissipates their spirits and relaxes their nerves yet their negroes seem to have more of the spirit of liberty than they i think we sometimes read of insurrections among their negroes i could wish that some of their blacks had been appointed distributers and inspectors c over their masters this would have but a little aggravated the indignity   friday fair weather and snow enough major miller dr savil and mr joseph penniman spent the evening with me agriculture commerce fishery arts manufactures town provincial american and national politics the subject   saturday edes and gills gazette brought in i find that somebody has published the very scene in shakspeares henry viii which i have put into lord clarendons letter to pym  this brings to my mind again lord bacons doctrine of secret invisible connections and communications and unknown undiscovered laws of nature hampden writes to pym on the failure of justice in america on the shutting up of the courts of justice since october he has given the public mr otiss argument before the governor and council from magna charta lord coke the judges oaths c and promises to give more   tuesday at boston hampden has given us in yesterdays gazette a long letter to pym upon shutting up the courts in which he proves from holts and pollexfens argument at the revolution conference from grotius de jure belli book   ch   s   that shutting up the courts is an abdication of the throne a discharge of the subjects from their allegiance and a total dissolution of government and reduction of all men to a state of nature and he proves from bracton that partial tumults c are not a tempus guerrium bellorum a time of war samuel waterhouse has made a most malicious ungenerous attack upon james lovell jr the usher of the grammar school as y z and h had attacked him about idleness and familiar     spirits and zanyship and expectancy of a deputation c this way of reviling one another is very shocking to humanity and very dangerous in its consequences to pry into a mans private life and expose to the world all the vices and follies of youth to paint before the public eye all the blots and stains in a mans private character must excite the commiseration of every reader to the object and his indignation against the author of such abuse  spent half an hour with father dana another with samuel quincy an hour with mr otis c otis is in high spirits is preparing for next mondays paper says that mr trail brings very comfortable news that conway told him the stamp act must be repealed that there was some difficulty about coming off with honor and that america would boast that she had conquered britain but he hoped the americans would petition he longed to receive some petitions c john wentworth  writes his uncle samuel that the marquis of rockingham told him he would give his interest to repeal one hundred stamp acts before he would run the risk of such confusions as would be caused by enforcing it that he knew there were already ten thousand workmen discharged from business in consequence of the advices from america   thursday at home   tentone novorum   proventu scelerum quærunt uter imperet urbi   vix tanti fuerat civilia bella moveri   ut neuter must such a number of new crimes be committed to decide which of these two cæsar or pompey shall be master in rome one would hardly purchase at that price the good fortune of having neither of them for master   0 friday went in the afternoon with my wife to her grandfathers mr cleverly here in the evening he says he     is not so clear as he was that the parliament has a right to tax us he rather thinks it has not thus the contagion of the times has caught even that bigot to passive obedience and nonresistance it has made him waver it is almost the first time i ever knew him converted or even brought to doubt and hesitate about any of his favorite points—as the authority of parliament to tax us was one nay he used to assert positively that the king was as absolute in the plantations as the great turk in his dominions mr quincy gave me some anecdotes about john boylston and jo green c green  refused to sign the resolutions of merchants at first but was afterwards glad to send for the paper they were at first afraid of salem newbury marblehead and plymouth but these towns have agreed unanimously to the same resolutions what will they say in england when they see the resolves of the american legislatures the petitions from the united colonies the resolutions of the merchants in boston new york philadelphia c    monday at boston the inferior court of common pleas opened present mr wells mr watts and mr foster hutchinson more than one hundred new entries the actions all called over and many defaulted and some continued so that the court has rushed upon the thick bosses of the buckler and into the thickest of the penalties and forfeitures dined at brother dudleys with gridley swift lowell and mr fayerweather fayerweather is one of the genteel folks he said he was dressed in black as mourning for the duke of cumberland he said he was wearing out his black clothes as fast as he could and was determined to get no more till the stamp act was repealed he designed to wear out all his old clothes and then go upon our own manufactures unless the stamp act was repealed one thompson came to me at cunninghams in the evening and engaged me in a cause of sampson vs buttar which is for entering a vessel at louisburg and taking away ten     barrels of rum buttar was or pretended to be a naval officer for the port of louisburg or secretary to governor whitmore and under color of that authority entered the vessel and seized and brought off the rum now buttar pretended to give commissions to officers under him to attend the wharves and keys of the port and to examine all goods imported and exported and to stop the same and report to him if illegal or contrary to the orders of the governor c mr gridley was in a very trifling humor today after dinner telling tales about overing  c and judges of inferior courts formerly and mccarty who built the court by the townhouse c and stories about colonel choate of ipswich c  the unsmotherable pride of his own heart broke out in his account of his disputes c with choate choate was a tyrant choate attempted things too large for him i have tumbled him over and over and twisted and tossed and tumbled him and yet he could say to me sir i was here at nine oclock by agreement and you was not come i answered him i was here sir at a quarter after nine and you was not here sir the honor of attending me might at any time dispense with a quarter of an hour  this is not pride if gridley had pride he would scorn such gross vanity a new england church he said was one object of dispute between them the people in the pale the deacons and the minister were the picture of a new england church no idea of it in the new testament platform too was a bone of contention spent the evening at mr adamss with him and brother swift  very socially        tuesday dined at mr william coopers  with messrs cushing story and john boylston cushing silent and sly as usual story i dont know what cooper and boylston principal talkers boylston affecting a philosophical indifference about dress furniture entertainments c laughed at the affectation of nicely distinguishing tastes such as the several degrees of sweet till you come up to the first degree of bitter laughed at the great expenses for furniture as nick boylstons carpets tables chairs glasses beds c which cooper said were the richest in north america the highest taste and newest fashion would soon flatten and grow old a curse or two upon the climate—preferable however to carolina but every part of europe preferable to this q is not this nicety of feeling this indisposition to be satisfied with the climate of the same nature with the delicacy of tastes and the curiosity about furniture just before exploded spent the evening at cunninghams    wednesday dined at mr isaac smiths—no company no conversation spent the evening with the sons of liberty at their own apartment in hanover square near the tree of liberty it is a countingroom in chase and speakmans distillery a very small room it is john avery distiller or merchant of a liberal education john smith the brazier thomas crafts the painter edes the printer stephen cleverly the brazier chase the distiller  joseph field master of a vessel henry bass george trott jeweller were present i was invited by crafts and trott to go and spend an evening with them and some others avery     was mentioned to me as one i went and was very civilly and respectfully treated by all present we had punch wine pipes and tobacco biscuit and cheese c i heard nothing but such conversation as passes at all clubs among gentlemen about the times no plots no machinations they chose a committee to make preparations for grand rejoicings upon the arrival of the news of a repeal of the stamp act and i heard afterwards they are to have such illuminations bonfires pyramids obelisks such grand exhibitions and such fireworks as were never before seen in america  i wish they may not be disappointed    thursday dined at mr nick boylstons with the two mr boylstons two mr smiths mr hallowell and their ladies—an elegant dinner indeed went over the house to view the furniture which alone cost a thousand pounds sterling a seat it is for a nobleman a prince the turkey carpets the painted hangings the marble tables the rich beds with crimson damask curtains and counterpanes the beautiful chimney clock the spacious garden are the most magnificent of any thing i have ever seen the conversation of the two boylstons and hallowell is a curiosity hotspurs all tantivy nick is a warm friend of the lieutenantgovernor and inclining towards the governor tom a firebrand against both tom is a perfect viper a fiend a jew a devil but is orthodox  in politics however hallowell tells stories about otis and drops hints about adams c and about mr dudley atkins of newbury otis told him he says that the parliament had a right to tax the colonies and he was a d—d fool who denied it and that this people never   0 would be quiet till we had a council from home till our charter was taken away and till we had regular troops quartered upon us he says he saw adams under the tree of liberty when the effigies hung there and asked him who they were and what he said he did not know—he could not tell—he wanted to inquire he says mr dudley atkins was too well acquainted with the secret of some riots there to be entirely depended on in his account c nick boylston full of stories about jemmy and solomon davis solomon says countryman i dont see what occasion there is for a governor and council and house you and the town would do well enough spent the evening at brackets with general winslow  colonel bradford mr otis father danforth colonel richmond mr brinley mr caldwell and captain hayward mr otis gave us some account of ruggless behavior at the congress  and winslow told us about catching bass with eel spears at the north river otis says that when they came to sign ruggles moved that none of them should sign but that the petitions should be carried back to the assemblies to see if they would adopt them this would have defeated the whole enterprise this ruggles has an inflexible oddity about him which has gained him a character for courage and probity but renders him a disagreeable companion in business  0 monday leonard  gave me an account of a club that he belongs to in boston it consists of john lowell elisha hutchinson frank dana josiah quincy and two other young fellows strangers to me leonard had prepared a collection of the arguments for and against the right of parliament to tax the colonies for said club his first inquiry was whether the subject could be taxed without his consent in person or by his     representative second whether we americans are represented in parliament or not leonard says that lowell is a courtier that he rips about all who stand foremost in their opposition to the stamp act at your otises and adamses c and says that no man can scribble about politics without bedaubing his fingers and every one who does is a dirty fellow he expresses great resentment against that line in edes and gill—retreat or you are ruined and says they ought to be committed for that single stroke thus it seems that the air of newbury and the vicinage of farnham chipman c have obliterated all the precepts admonitions instructions and example of his master thacher lowell is however very warm sudden quick and impetuous and all such people are unsteady  too much fire experientia docet leonard gave me also a relation of his going to providence court and spending an evening with the political club there  the club consists of governor hopkins judge jenks downer cole and others they were impatient to have the courts opened in this province not choosing to proceed in business alone were very inquisitive concerning all our affairs had much to say of hutchinson otis c admired the answer to the governors speech admired the massachusetts resolves hopkins said that nothing had been so much admired there through the whole course of the controversy as the answer to the speech though the massachusetts resolves were the best     digested and the best of any on the continent inquired who was the author of them  inquired also who it was that burlesqued the governors speeches who wrote jemmy bullero c thought hutchinsons history did not shine said his house was pulled down to prevent his writing any more by destroying his materials thought otis was not an original genius nor a good writer but a person who had done and would continue to do much good service were very inquisitive about mackintosh  whether he was a man of abilities or not whether he would probably rise in case this contest should be carried into any length jo green waterhouse and church were talked of as capable of bullero and the burlesques      the following letters were written to carry out the policy of association in resistance to the stamp act sons of liberty   february      boston john adams the sons of liberty to john adams boston   february      sir— you doubtless and every american must be sensible that where there is a union happily established we should endeavor to support it by all possible means especially when the grand object in view is the preservation of our invaluable rights and privileges the colonies we mean new york and connecticut have entered into certain reciprocal and mutual agreements concessions and associations a copy of which  we received by an express the last sunday with their desire to accomplish the like association with us which deserves our most serious attention as thereby it will be the means of strengthening this late union and in our humble opinion of preventing the execution of an act of parliament commonly known by the name of the stamp act but to avoid enlarging permit us to single out a few words by which you will know their intentions the worthy sons of liberty in new york and connecticut taking into their most serious consideration the melancholy and unsettled state of great britain and her north american colonies proceeding as they are fully persuaded from a design in her most inveterate enemies to alienate the affections of his majestys most loyal and faithful subjects in america from his person and government which they are determined to maintain and support—and for the preservation of which they have signified their resolution and determination to march with all despatch at their own costs and expense on the first proper notice with their whole force if required to the relief of those who shall or may be in danger from the stamp act or its abettors and to keep a watchful eye over all those who from the nature of their offices vocations or dispositions may be the most likely to introduce the use of stamped paper to the total subversion of the british constitution and american liberty we address ourselves to you as a gentleman well versed in     the constitution of your country and who consequently will do your utmost to oppose all measures detrimental to the welfare of it and we should be glad if you would inform us as soon as possible of your sentiments on the above and the disposition of the people in your town please to direct to us under cover to messrs edes and gill printers in boston we are sir your most humble servants the sons of liberty thomas crafts    february      boston john adams thomas crafts jr to john adams boston    february      friday night  0 oclock sir— yesterday i wrote you a few lines by dr tufts informing you the sons of liberty desired your company at boston next wednesday and mentioned for what occasion i would now desire it as a favor if you can spare the time to come on monday next because they want you to write those inscriptions that i mentioned to you when last at boston one in favor of liberty

expressive as possible the stamped paper i informed you of in my last was found straggling about this town but on thursday at eleven oclock shall commit it to its proper element with no small parade  i am with great respect your friend thomas crafts jr destroy this after reading it mr samuel adams sends his compliments and desires you would come p s we expect the news of the repeal of the act commonly called the stamp act in three weeks from this by the news we have had by the last ships from london which i doubt not you have heard of     n b an answer to a letter sent by the sons of liberty last saturday will be acceptable i had wrote this letter before i received yours and hope you will be here on thursday next march   saturday spent a part of last evening with mr jo cleverly he is a tiptoe for town meeting he has many schemes and improvements in his head—namely for separating the offices of constable and collector collecting taxes has laid the foundation for the ruin of many families he is for five selectmen and will vote for the old ones mr quincy and major miller he hears they are for turning out all the old selectmen and choosing a new set they for having but three c the only way is to oppose schemes to schemes and so break in upon them cleverly will become a great townmeeting man and a great speaker in town meeting q what effect will this have on the town affairs brother tells me that william veasey jr tells him he has but one objection against jonathan bass and that is bass is too forward when a man is forward we may conclude he has some selfish view some self ends brother asked him if he and his party would carry that argument through it holds stronger against captain thayer and major miller than it ever did against anybody in this town excepting colonel gooch and captain mills but i desire the proof of basss forwardness has he been more so than major miller come come mr veasey says master jo cleverly dont you say too much i ant of that mind ego bass is an active capable man but no seeker by mean begging or buying of votes   monday my brother peter mr etter and mr field having a number of votes prepared for mr quincy and me set themselves to scatter them in town meeting the town had been very silent and still my name had never been mentioned nor had our friends ever talked of any new selectmen at all excepting in the south precinct but as soon as they found there was an attempt to be made they fell in and assisted and although there were six different hats with votes for as many different persons besides a considerable number of scattering votes i had the major vote of the assembly the first time mr     quincy had more than one hundred and sixty votes i had but one vote more than half some of the church people—mr jo cleverly his brother ben and son c and mr ben veasey of the middle precinct mr james faxon c—i found were grieved and chagrined for the loss of their dear major miller  etter and my brother took a skilful method they let a number of young fellows into the design john ruggles peter newcomb c who were very well pleased with the employment and put about a great many votes many persons i hear acted slyly and deceitfully this is always the case i own it gave me much pleasure to find i had so many friends and that my conduct in town has been not disapproved the choice was quite unexpected to me i thought the project was so new and sudden that the people had not digested it and would generally suppose the town would not like it and so would not vote for it but my brothers answer was that it had been talked of last year and some years before and that the thought was familiar to the people in general and was more agreeable than any thing of the kind that could be proposed to many and for these reasons his hopes were strong but the triumph of the party was very considerable though not complete for thayer and miller and the late lessees of the north commons  and many of the church people and many other had determined to get out deacon penniman but instead of that their favorite was dropped and i more obnoxious to that party than even deacon penniman or any other man was chosen in his room and deacon penniman was saved with more than one hundred and thirty votes—a more reputable election than even thayer himself had     mr jo bass was extremely sorry for the loss of major miller he would never come to another meeting mr jo cleverly could not account for many things done at town meetings his motion for choosing collectors was slighted his motion for lessening his fine was thrown out and he made no sort of figure as a speaker so that i believe mr cleverly will make no hand elisha niles says set a knave to catch a knave a few days before a former march meeting he told thayer that he had a mind to get in deacon penniman thayer asked him who he would have with him he answered captain allen thayer made him no answer but when the meeting came was chosen himself mr thomas faxon of this end of the town told my wife he never saw anybody chosen so neatly in his life—not a word not a whisper beforehand peter newcomb gave him a vote he had one before for miller and had heard nothing of me but he thought i should have one so he dropped that for miller jo nightingale asked my wife mr adams will have too much business will he not the courts to attend selectman and representative at may c mr john baxter the old gentleman told me he was very well pleased with the choice at the north end c old mr john ruggles voted for me but says that thayer will be chosen at may if i would set up he would vote for me and i should go but mr quincy will not lieutenant holbrook i hear was much in my favor c thus the town is pretty generally disputing about me i find but this choice will not disconcert thayer at may though it will weaken him but as i said before the triumph was not complete—cornet bass had the most votes the first time and would have come in the second but the north end people his friends after putting in their votes the first time withdrew for refreshment by which accident he lost it to their great regret mark the fruits of this election to me will the church people be angry and grow hot and furious or will they be cooler and calmer for it will thayers other precinct friends resent it and become more violent or will they be less so in short i cannot answer these questions many of them will be disheartened i know some will be glad  0 monday last week went to boston and to weymouth c i hear that mr benjamin cleverly has already bespoke mr john ruggles jr against may meeting—promised him     as much as he can eat and drink of the best sort if he will vote for captain thayer told him he would not have acted as he did at march if it had not been for thomas newcomb and that he would vote for thayer at may if it was not for thomas newcomb by this the other side are alarmed the craft they think is in danger but i believe their fears are groundless though i wish there was good reason for them drank tea at mr etters he says all the blame is laid to him and that a certain man takes it very ill of him by the way i heard today that major miller and james bracket jr were heard since march meeting raving against deacon palmer and said he was a knave c q about this quarrel i find the late choice has brought upon me a multiplicity of new cares the schools are one great object of my attention it is a thing of some difficulty to find out the best most beneficial method of expending the school money captain adams says that each parishs proportion of the school money has not been settled since my fathers day thomas faxon says it would be more profitable to the children to have a number of womens schools about than to have a fixed grammar school q whether he has not a desire that his wife should keep one jonathan bass says the same q his wife is a schoolmistress so that two points of examination occur the portion between the parishes that is the sum which this parish ought to have and whether a standing grammar school is preferable to a number of schoolmistresses part of the year and a grammar school part another great object is the poor persons are soliciting for the privilege of supplying the poor with wood corn meat c the care of supplying at cash price and in weight and measure is something the care of considering and deciding the pretensions of the claimants is something a third and the greatest is the assessment here i am not so thorough i must inquire a great while before i shall know the polls and estates real and personal of all the inhabitants of the town or parish the highways the districts to surveyors and laying out new ways or altering old ones are a fourth thing perambulations of lines are another thing dorchester milton stoughton bridgewater abington weymouth—orders for services of many sorts to c     it will increase my connections with the people    tuesday went to boston the chief justice not there a piece of political finesse to make the people believe he was under a necessity of going a journey this week but would be here by the next was put about while care was taken to secure an agreement to an adjournment for three or four weeks so that hutchinson is to trim and shift and luff up and bear away and elude the blame of the ministry and the people cushing spoke out boldly and said he was ready to go on he had no difficulty about going on lynde said we are here oliver said here am i in duress and if i must go on i must thus popular compulsion fear of violence of the sons of liberty c was suggested to be the only motive with him to go on     wednesday returned to braintree    friday yesterday and today the severest storm of snow we have had this year    saturday the snow is as deep and in as mountainous banks as it has been at any time this winter the unanimous agreement of the court and bar was to try a few civil causes one at least and then adjourn over    monday rain a piece in evening post march  0th remarks and observations on hutchinsons history the writer seems concerned lest his countrymen should incur the censure of hissing from the stage all merit of their own growth but quære allowing mr hutchinsons great merit what disposition have his countrymen discovered to hiss it from the stage has not his merit been sounded very high by his countrymen for twenty years have not his countrymen loved admired revered rewarded nay almost adored him have not ninetynine in a hundred of them really thought him the greatest and best man in america has not the perpetual language of many members of both houses and of a majority of his brother counsellors been that mr hutchinson is a great man a pious a wise a learned a good man an eminent saint a philosopher c the greatest man in the province the greatest on the continent c nay have not the affection and admiration of his countrymen arisen so high as often to style him the   0 greatest and best man in the world that they never saw nor heard nor read of such a man—a sort of apotheosis like that of alexander and that of cæsar while they lived as to rewards have they not admitted him to the highest honors and profits in the province have they not assisted him cheerfully in raising himself and his family to almost all the honors and profits to the exclusion of much better men have they not rewarded him so far as to form invincible combinations to involve every man of any learning and ingenuity in general detestation obloquy and ruin who has been so unfortunate as to think him rather too craving there is also another piece in the same paper called remarks on the times possibly by the same hand about political enthusiasm disordered pulses precipices vertigoes falling on rugged cliffs men of hot enthusiastical turn of mind c  went to town meeting through a fierce wind a soaking rain and miry roads and banks of snow    tuesday went to weymouth found the family mourning the loss and preparing for the funeral of old tom after my return rode to mr halls and in my return stopped at mr jo basss for the papers major miller soon afterwards came in and he and i looked on each other without wrath or shame or guilt at least without any great degree of either though i must own i did not feel exactly as i used to in his company and i am sure by his face and eyes that he did not in mine we were very social c    friday i have omitted writing a week dr tufts lodged here last night with yesterdays paper the january packet arrived at new york has brought the kings speech the addresses of lords and commons   th of january and many private letters which inform that mr pitt was in the house of commons and declared himself against grenville and for a repeal of the stamp act upon principle called it the most impolitic arbitrary     oppressive and unconstitutional act that ever was passed denied that we were represented in the house of commons q whether the house of commons or the parliament and asserted that the house granted taxes in their representative capacity not in their legislative and therefore that the parliament had not the right to tax the colonies q what has been said in america which mr pitt has not confirmed otis adams hopkins c have said no more hampden f a the feudal system and lord clarendon  have gone no further than pitt no epithets have been used in america worse than impolitic arbitrary oppressive unconstitutional—unless it be cursed damned supercursed c what shall we think of mr pitt what shall we call him the genius and guardian angel of britain and british america or what is it possible that grenville offensive to his king disagreeable to the people should prevail against the whole new ministry and mr pitt april  0 friday at plymouth court open and business proceeding    tuesday went to boston the superior court adjourned again for a fortnight hutchinson cushing and oliver present what insolence and impudence and chicanery is this fleet of yesterday gives us a piece from london gazette january  th signed vindex patriæ the sole question he says is if the americans are represented in parliament colonists by charters shall have same privileges as if born in england that is that england shall be reputed their natale solum massachusetts by fiction supposed to lie in england q whether this thought was not suggested by the braintree instructions  a fiction of law insensible in theory and injurious in practice all england is represented then massachusetts is    saturday the last thursdays paper is full the resolves of the house of commons are the most interesting the bill which is to be brought in upon the first resolve and the sixth has excited my curiosity and apprehensions the most     the first resolve is that king lords and commons have an undoubted right to make laws for the colonies in all cases whatever i am solicitous to know whether they will lay a tax in consequence of that resolution or what kind of a law they will make the first resolve is in these words that the kings majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons of great britain in parliament assembled had hath and of right ought to have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of america subjects of the crown of great britain in all cases whatever now upon this resolution a bill is to be brought in q what is the end and design of that bill another resolution is that all who have suffered damages for their desire to comply with any act of parliament or to assist in the execution of any ought to be amply compensated but who are they who have manifested a desire to comply with the stamp act or to assist in the execution of it winslow foster clap brown c were for submission in order to obtain a repeal everybody has disowned any desire to comply or assist who will lay claim to the character of dutiful and loyal subjects and to the protection of the house of commons in consequence of the fifth resolution prophecies are the most airy visionary things in nature i remember the time when pratt was universally called by the hutchinsonians a bad politician and i never could hear any other reason given but this—that his prophecies about the king of prussia and general amherst did not turn out right now hutchinson himself olivers trowbridges ruggleses winslows have been prophesying that fleets and armies would be sent to enforce the stamp act but they are as false prophets as ever uttered oracles foresight judgment sagacity penetration c are but very feeble infirm things in these great affairs of state and war what hutchinson said in the probate office was as good a way as any i never was more at a loss in my life about any thing future what the new ministry will do i know not if mr pitt was in i should be at no loss at all in this way an air of deep important wisdom is preserved without danger of being proved mistaken by time        sunday heard mr smith in the evening yesterday i had a great deal of conversation with ezekiel price about politics c i provoked him to speak freely by calling him a hutchinsonian i swear says he i think the lieutenantgovernor an honest man and i think he has been most damnably abused and slandered and belied c i know all his violent opposers i know them and what they are after and their disciples in and about the capital there is no man in the province would fill any one of his offices as he does he is the best judge of probate c flings about otis and adams and about being one of their disciples c    tuesday at boston to this day the superior court was adjourned hutchinson lynde and cushing were present two of the bar agreed to continue an action hutchinson leans over and orders winthrop to minute an agreement to continue we will consider of it says he another of the bar moved for a continuance and no opposition hutchinson orders the clerk to enter it motion for a continuance c then the court went to playing off a farce and to trying to get a cause for the jury but none was then ready then hutchinson proposed—what if we should adjourn to the first tuesday in june then otis and swift moved that complaints might be read and passed upon or affirmed hutchinson said i shall be very open in my judgment i am not for making up judgment on any complaints i am upon principle in it it would not be regular nor prudent at this critical juncture cushing thought that in some cases of necessity it might be done with one of his most jesuitical looks lynde declared he would not belong to the general court in all advents this year hutchinson seemed in tortures he wanted to be out of town to be at home he was never so easy as when he was there he did not love to spend his time idly if there was no business to be done he was for being where he could be employed thus the chief justice is now mustering up fortitude enough to make public to manifest his desire to comply with the stamp act and to assist in carrying it into execution in order to lay claim to the protection of the house of commons and to claim a compensation for his damages ay he is now assuming the character of a dutiful and loyal subject i kept an obstinate silence the whole time i said not one word for or against the     adjournment i saw the court were determined before i came in and they had no right to expect that i would fall in with that determination and i had no disposition to foment an opposition to it because an opposition made with any warmth might have ended in the demolition of the earthly house of his honors tabernacle but let me look back to the sixth page in this book that is to tuesday   th of march  and read what was said by cushing lynde c and can we be sufficiently amazed at the chicanery the finesse the prevarication the insincerity the simulation nay the lies and falsehoods of the judges of the superior court these are harsh words but true the times are terrible and made so at present by hutchinson chief justice i cannot say that oliver fibbed but cushing did abominably on   th march nathaniel hatch says they are right for nothing hindered the repeal of the stamp act but what has been done here—the riots and resolves and doing business c thus america will ring with riots resolves opening courts instructions edes and gills gazette writers c—all the evil will be laid upon them and the congress too and recalling orders for goods may   sunday returning from meeting this morning i saw for the first time a likely young buttonwood tree lately planted on the triangle made by the three roads by the house of mr james bracket the tree is well set well guarded and has on it an inscription the tree of liberty and cursed is he who cuts this tree q what will be the consequences of this thought i never heard a hint of it till i saw it but i hear that some persons grumble and threaten to girdle it    sunday mem to write some speculations upon the union of legislative and executive powers  and upon the knot the junto the combination    monday i have been very unfortunate in running the gauntlet through all the rejoicings for the repeal of the stamp act     monday last at two oclock  was our town meeting and the same evening were all the rejoicings in boston and in plymouth after meeting i mounted for plymouth and reached dr halls of pembroke the only rejoicings i heard or saw were at hingham where the bells rung cannons were fired drums beaten and landlady cushing on the plain illuminated her house the county of plymouth has made a thorough purgation winslow clap foster howard keen oliver alden are all omitted and warren sever thomas turner vinal edson sprout are chosen what a change a duller day than last monday when the province was in a rapture for the repeal of the stamp act i do not remember to have passed my wife who had long depended on going to boston and my little babe were both very ill of an whooping cough myself under obligation to attend the superior court at plymouth the next day and therefore unable to go to boston and the town of braintree insensible to the common joy    wednesday general election at boston after lecture dined at mr austins the winecooper with the rev messrs prentice of charlestown and adams  of roxbury adams and austin were the disputants in politics prentice a moderator this morning adams was chosen clerk and otis speaker governor bernard negatived him cushing was chosen in the afternoon they proceeded to choose counsellors when hutchinson and the two olivers were dropped and trowbridge was dropped  and mr pitts colonel gerrish colonel white bowers powell and mr saunders and dexter were chosen what a change this day seems to be the literal accomplishment of a prophecy of mr otis published two or three winters ago in the newspaper the day is hastening on with large strides when a dirty very dirty witless rabble i mean the great vulgar shall go down with deserved infamy to all posterity thus the triumph     of otis and his party are complete but what changes are yet to come will not the other party soon be uppermost    thursday the governor negatived otis sparhawk dexter saunders gerrish and bowers and made the two houses a most nitrous sulphureous speech what will be the consequence this morning in hatchs office mr paxton came in this is the laziest town upon the globe poor proud and lazy is the character of this town they wont work if the neutrals  were gone there would be nobody to throw the water out of the long boat in this town trowbridge told stories about the virtue of some neutrals their strict justice their aversion to profaneness c paxton said they were never drunk never disorderly never before a magistrate c c c all this from goffe  and paxton was meant in favor of roman catholic religion and civil slavery i doubt not goffe said he had been reading the history of england and he found that there had always arisen men to defend liberty in the same manner and from the same principles as they do here he said further that for himself he felt so happily after his death  that he was pretty sure he had behaved well during his lifetime for himself he was easy but the poor secretary is infirm it will bear hard upon him and for the lieutenantgovernor now the act is repealed and considering how he has been used instead of doing any thing to make up his loss to leave him out of council and so to confirm in the minds of the people a suspicion that he has been an enemy to the country is very hard for a man who has behaved so well as he has july    monday after commencement last saturday i accidentally found a curious volume which oakes angier found in a chest of books belonging to an uncle of his who died fortyfive years ago the titlepage and all the rest is gone till you come to the eighteenth page it seems to be a collection of pamphlets published in the memorable year    0 bound up together in one quarto volume lord digbies speech   november    0 concerning grievances and the triennial parliament     harbottle grimstones speech   th december    0 moving for an impeachment of the archbishop he calls him the great and common enemy of all goodness and good men pyms speech after the articles against strafford were read pyms speech after the articles against sir george ratcliffe were read     sunday thanksgiving for the repeal of the stamp act mr smiths text was the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice and the multitude of the isles be glad thereof mr wibirds was genesis  0th  0th but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive america is joseph the king lords and commons josephs father and brethren our forefathers sold into egypt that is persecuted into america c wibird shone they say    monday at boston a meeting of the bar at the coffee house for the admission of three young gentlemen mr oliver mr quincy  and mr blowers and another meeting appointed next friday sevennight to consider of some measures for limitation making a pause c they swarm and multiply—sed the country grows amazingly and the time will not be long ere many who are now upon the stage will be in their graves four years must pass before the three young gentlemen admitted this night will assume the gown and four years will make a great alteration in the bar it is not so long since pratt and thacher were in their glory at the bar since colonel otis reigned in three southern counties c mr gridley and mr dana are between sixty and seventy kent is near sixty fitch otis auchmuty are about forty benjamin gridley and mr dudley are about thirtyfive and sewall s quincy and i about thirty within four years possibly some of all these ranks may depart but the bar has at last introduced a regular progress to the gown and seven years must be the state of probation gridley otis and auchmuty were the chief speakers gridley however was not in trim i never saw him more out of spirits otis told some stories auchmuty told more and scolded and railed about the lowness of the fees this is auchmutys commonplace     topic in jamaica barbadoes south carolina and new york a lawyer will make an independent fortune in ten years    tuesday at boston bought gilberts law of evidence auchmuty is employed in sessions and everywhere the same heavy dull insipid way of arguing everywhere as many repetitions as a presbyterian parson in his prayer volubility voluble repetition and repeated volubility fluent reiterations and reiterating fluency such nauseous eloquence always puts my patience to the torture in what is this man conspicuous—in reasoning in imagination in painting in the pathetic or what in confidence in dogmatism c his wit is flat his humor is affected and dull to have this man represented as the first at the bar is a libel upon it a reproach and disgrace to it  0 wednesday at boston the weather cloudy going to the common pleas today let me take minutes let me remark the speakers their action their pronunciation their learning their reasoning their art and skill let me remark the causes the remarkable circumstances c and report august    tuesday set out with my wife for salem dined at boston drank tea at dr simon tuftss at medford lodged at mr bishops    wednesday set out from mr bishops oated at norwoods alias martins and reached brother cranchs at twelve oclock dined and drank tea and then rode down to the neck gate and then back through the common and down to beverly ferry then back through the common and round the back part of the town home then walked round the other side of the town to colonel brownes who not being at home we returned the town is situated on a plain a level a flat scarce an eminence can be found anywhere to take a view the streets are broad and straight and pretty clean the houses are the most elegant and grand that i have seen in any of the maritime towns    thursday in the morning rode a single horse in company with mrs cranch and mrs adams in a chaise to marblehead the road from salem to marblehead four miles is pleasant indeed the grass plats and fields are delightful but marblehead differs from salem the streets are narrow and rugged     and dirty but there are some very grand buildings returned and dined at cranchs after dinner walked to witchcraft hill a hill about half a mile from cranchs where the famous persons formerly executed for witches were buried somebody within a few years has planted a number of locust trees over the graves as a memorial of that memorable victory over the prince of the power of the air this hill is in a large common belonging to the proprietors of salem c from it you have a fair view of the town of the river the north and south fields of marblehead of judge lyndes pleasurehouse c of salem village c    monday went to taunton lodged at mcwhorters    tuesday dined at captain cobbs with colonel g leonard paine leonard young cobb c  0 wednesday spent evening at lodgings with charles cushing and daniel oliver of middleborough paine and leonard socially    thursday morning fine weather feel well november   monday set off with my wife for salem stopped half an hour at boston crossed the ferry and at three oclock arrived at hills the tavern in malden the sign of the rising eagle at the brook near mr emersons meetinghouse five miles from norwoods where namely at hills we dined here we fell in company with kent and sewall we all oated at martins where we found the new sheriff of essex colonel saltonstall we all rode into town together arrived at my dear brother cranchs about eight and drank tea and are all very happy sat and heard the ladies talk about ribbon catgut and paris net ridinghoods cloth silk and lace brother cranch came home and a very happy evening we had cranch is now in a good situation for business near the courthouse and mr barnards meetinghouse and on the road to marblehead his house fronting the wharves the harbor and shipping has a fine prospect before it   tuesday a fine morning attended court all day heard the charge to grand jury and a prayer by mr barnard deacon pickering was foreman of one of the juries this man famous for his writing in newspapers concerning church order and government they tell me is very rich his appearance is perfectly plain like a farmer his smooth combed locks flow behind him  00 like deacon cushings though not so gray he has a quick eye like— he has an hypocritical demure on his face like deacon foster his mouth makes a semicircle when he puts on that devout face deacon penniman is somewhat like him though penniman has more of the grave solemnity in his behavior than the other the picture of governor endicott c in the council chamber is of this sort they are puritanical faces at this court i also saw a young gentleman lately sworn in the inferior court whose name is samuel porter he lived with mr farnham took his second degree last year and lives at ipswich thus every county of the province swarms with pupils and students and young practitioners of law   wednesday attended court heard the trial of an action of trespass brought by a mulatto woman for damages for restraining her of her liberty this is called suing for liberty the first action that ever i knew of the sort though i have heard there have been many heard another action for assault and battery of a mariner by the master of a vessel a little fellow was produced as a witness who is a spaniard speaks intelligible english black eyes thin sharp features has been among the english three or four years here i saw nathaniel peaslee sargeant of methuen  two years an attorney of superior court now commencing a barrister he took his degree the year i entered college he has the character of sense ingenuity c but not of fluency he is a stout man not genteel nor sprightly this is the gentleman whom thacher recommended for a justice and admired for his correctness and conciseness as another father read here i found the famous joseph eaton at law as usual i knew him when i lived at worcester where he had a suit i believe every court while i lived there he now lives at lynn end on the borders between essex and middlesex this is one of the stirring instruments that goffe has patronized and encouraged for many years i remember to have heard goffe celebrate him for selfgovernment for a cool steady command of his passions and for firmness of mind c eaton is now at law with the harts whose characters are as curious as his and more so  0  this eaton goffe set up as pynchon tells me to be a justice but thacher got him indicted in the county of essex for a barrator which defeated the scheme of goffe and he came near conviction goffe grew warm and said that eatons character was as good as any mans at the bar spent the evening at mr pynchons with farnham sewall sargeant colonel saltonstall c very agreeably punch wine bread and cheese apples pipes and tobacco popes and bonfires this evening at salem and a swarm of tumultuous people attending them   thursday a fine morning oated at martins where we saw five boxes of dollars containing as we were told about eighteen thousand of them going in a horsecart from salem customhouse to boston in order to be shipped for england a guard of armed men with swords hangers pistols and muskets attended it we dined at dr tuftss in medford there i first heard that the old custom and privilege of electing orators thesis collectors c by the class has been lately taken away and that this invasion of their privileges contributed more than the butter towards the late spirit of insurrection there  drank tea at mrs kneelands got home before eight oclock   friday went up to my common pasture to give directions about trimming the trees that is lopping and trimming the walnuts and oaks and felling the pines and savins and hemlocks an irregular misshapen pine will darken the whole scene in some places these i fell without mercy to open the prospect and let in the sun and air that the other wood may grow the faster and that the grass may get in for feed i prune all the trees i leave buttonwoods elms maples oaks walnuts savins hemlocks and all the pines that grow in that pasture are that is the white pines are very knotty crooked unthrifty things i am desirous of clearing out the rocky gutter that is of clearing away the bushes and pruning all the trees that we may see clearly the course of the water there and judge whether it is worth while to dig up the rocks and make a ditch for the water and for another reason too namely to let in the sun and air because that rocky gutter produces a great deal of feed which i should be glad to sweeten  0  afternoon went to major crosbys to see him execute a codicil to his will the old gentleman is very desirous that the province should comply with the kings recommendation to make up the damages to the sufferers   saturday fine weather still yesterday clement hayden came in to major crosbys he seemed to hope he said that the court would not vote to make up the losses  but he heard today that the king had requested it and if that was true he knew not what to say the king had been so gracious as to repeal the stamp act and now to deny him such a trifle would seem ungrateful and ungenerous and it was our best interest to be always in favor with him and if we should refuse his request it might be ten times more damage to us than to pay it and he believed if this town was to meet and to be fully informed about it they would not vote against it in short clem talked like a reasonable man he said that in all the wars and all other times nothing ever happened that affected him like the stamp act he said if it had been insisted on he knew it would not be borne and that he expected dismal scenes the repeal of it was great joy and he should be willing to do any thing in reason out of duty to the king this morning i asked john clark some questions about it he thinks if the king has requested it it will be difficult to refuse it but yet it will be hard upon us to pay it    tuesday rain deacon webb here at tea and put this strange question to me—what do you think of the lieutenantgovernor sir i told him what i once thought of him and that i now hoped i was mistaken in my judgment i told him i once thought that his death in a natural way would have been a smile of providence upon the public and would have been the most joyful news to me that i could have heard the deacon thought him a devout pious man a professor of religion a good man a christian c and a capable man and the best judge of probate that ever we had this forty years and that he had been envied this observation of his being envied i have heard made by nat thayer before now he was  0  capable and greatly promoted and therefore envied at the same time a craving man i presume it will not be denied that this province is at present in a state of peace order and tranquillity that the people are as quiet and submissive to government as any people under the sun as little inclined to tumults riots seditions as they were ever known to be since the first foundation of the government the repeal of the stamp act has hushed into silence almost every popular clamor and composed every wave of popular disorder into a smooth and peaceful calm as the indemnification recommended by his majesty seems at present the reigning topic of conversation a few thoughts upon that subject may not be improper after the repeal of the stamp act every newspaper and pamphlet every public and private letter which arrived in america from england seemed to breathe a spirit of benevolence tenderness and generosity the utmost delicacy was observed in all the state papers in the choice of expressions that no unkind impression might be left upon the minds of the people in america the letters from the ministry to the governor recommended the mildest softest most lenient and conciliating measures and even the resolve of the house of commons and the recommendation from his majesty concerning an indemnification to the sufferers was conceived in the most alluring language oblivion of every disagreeable circumstance which had happened through the warmth of the people in the late unhappy times was recommended in the strongest terms what kind of behavior might have been expected from a governor in consequence of such advices from home at such a time when the house of representatives newly chosen by the people and a house which thought like the people had proceeded with as much calm composed deliberation as was ever known to the choice of a speaker would it be expected that the governor should negative that speaker especially as that gentleman had been a long time in great esteem in the province had but just before been unanimously chosen upon the congress at new york and had executed that trust to the universal acceptance of the province at such a time when the two houses had proceeded with equal solemnity to the choice of counsellors and had completed  0  the election could it be believed that a governor should by his mighty negative slaughter six of the list at a blow six of the most steady capable and active friends of the people in the whole board after all this which was borne without a murmur does it not exceed all credibility that this same governor should meet the two houses and open the session with a speech—a speech—a speech i want words to express my sentiments of this speech december   monday dined at dr tuftss drank tea at dr halls pembroke lodged at captain littles kingston i find a general opposition in the county of plymouth to compensation jacobs tells me that scituate voted against it with great warmth judge cushing moderator did not see fit to say a word nor was there a word said or a hand up in favor of the bill though they had voted for it in october keen of pembroke was warm and stumped soule the moderator to lay down the money and prevent a tax upon the poor kingston was so fixed against it that they would not call a meeting the more considerate and sensible people however in all these towns are in favor of it landlord and landlady little are full of politics mr little could get in general winslow and did get in mr sever and mr sever is sensible of it we had over the affairs of collector of excise little does not like judge cushing nor brigadier ruggles because they opposed his collectorship c at plymouth the province has been drawn in cleverly to make itself guilty of the riots everybody out of the province will say so the province has been brought to pay what ought to have been paid by boston every farthing of it paine the mystery of iniquity opens more now in time of peace than it did in time of confusion sever said he believed goffe would be glad to punish all the transgressors in the late times hally said he had tried to persuade goffe to enter a nolle prosequi against the rioters in berkshire but he would not and was very high c paine said the continent ought to have paid the damage nat clap these townmeeting laws are the most awful things and the town of boston ought to be stigmatized for setting the example  0     tuesday i heard yesterday for the first time that young jonathan hayward the son of lieutenant joseph hayward of the south precinct had got a deputation from the sheriff captain thayer was the person who went to the sheriff and procured it for him silas wild thomas penniman stephen penniman lieutenant hayward and zebulon thayer were his bondsmen a goodly class a clever group a fine company a bright cluster but what will be the consequences of this deputation and what were the causes of it my brothers disregard and neglect of the office and his neglect to pay greenleaf were the causes      march saturday went with captain thayer to visit robert peacock and his poor distressed family we found them in one chamber which serves them for kitchen cellar diningroom parlor and bedchamber two beds in one of which lay peacock where he told us he had lain for seven weeks without going out of it further than the fire he had a little child in his arms another bed stood on one side of the chamber where lay three other children the mother only was up by a fire made of a few chips not larger than my hand the chamber excessive cold and dirty these are the conveniences and ornaments of a life of poverty these the comforts of the poor this is want this is poverty these the comforts of the needy the bliss of the necessitous we found upon inquiry that the woman and her two oldest children had been warned out of boston but the man had not and three children had been born since upon this discovery we waited on colonel jackson the first selectman of boston and acquainted him with the facts and that we must be excused from any expense for their support when i was in that chamber of distress i felt the meltings of commiseration this office of overseer of the poor leads a man into scenes of distress and is a continual exercise of the benevolent principles in his mind his compassion is constantly excited and his benevolence increased april   saturday suits generally spring from passion jones vs bigelow cotton and nye arose from ambition jones and bigelow were competitors for elections in the town of weston cotton and nye were rivals at sandwich such rivals have no friendship for each other from such rivalries  0  originate contentions quarrels and suits actions of defamation are the usual fruits of such competitions what affection can there be between two rival candidates for the confidence of a town the famous action of slander at worcester  between hopkins and ward of rhode island sprouted from the same stock there the aim was at the confidence of the colony poor nye of sandwich seems dejected i should suspect by his concern that cotton gained ground against him he seems to be hipped it frets and worries and mortifies him he cant sleep a nights his health is infirm cotton is insane wild his proposal of giving his house and farm at sandwich to the province is a proof of insanity he has relations that are poor john cotton is now poor enough he has a brother josiah cotton the minister whom he procured to be removed to woburn and thereby to be ruined who is very poor maintained by charity roland was josiahs ruin yet he did not choose to give his estate to josiah besides his behavior at boston upon that occasion was wild his sitting down at the council table with his hat on and calling for his deed and a justice to acknowledge it when the council was sitting cottons method of getting papers signed by members in order to demolish poor nye is new the certificate from murray and foster if genuine is a mean scandalous thing it was mean in murray and foster to sign that paper for one representative to give a constituent a weapon to demolish another representative is ungentlemanlike   wednesday mounted my horse in a very rainy morning for barnstable leaving my dear brother cranch and his family at my house where they arrived last night and my wife all designing for weymouth this afternoon to keep the fast with my father smith and my friend tufts arrived at dr tuftss where i found a fine wild goose on the spit and cranberries stewing in the skillet for dinner tufts as soon as he heard that cranch was at braintree determined to

saturday night at howlands in plymouth returned this day from barnstable the case of cotton and nye at sandwich is remarkable cotton has been driving his interest this driving of an interest seldom succeeds jones of weston by driving his drove it all away where two persons in a town get into such a quarrel both must be very unhappy—reproaching each other to their faces relating facts concerning each other to their neighbors these relations are denied repeated misrepresented additional and fictitious circumstances put to them passions inflamed malice hatred envy pride fear rage despair all take their turns father and son uncle and nephew neighbor and neighbor friend and friend are all set together by the ears my clients have been the sufferers in both these representative causes the court was fixed in the sandwich case cotton is not only a tory but a relation of some of the judges cushing particularly cushing married a cotton sister of john cotton the register of deeds at plymouth cushing was very bitter he was not for my arguing to the jury the question whether the words were actionable or not he interrupted me stopped me short snapped me up—keep to the evidence keep to the point dont ramble all over the world to ecclesiastical councils dont misrepresent the evidence this was his impartial language oliver began his speech to the jury with—a disposition to slander and defamation is the most cursed temper that ever the world was plagued with and i believe it is the cause of the greatest part of the calamities that mankind labor under this was the fair candid impartial judge they adjudged solemnly that i should not dispute to the jury whether the words were actionable or not spent the evening at mr hoveys with deacon foster and dr thomas the deacon was very silent the doctor pretty sociable  0  monday morning a fine sun and air cushing at barnstable said to me—happy is he whom other mens errors render wise otis by getting into the general court has

end and purpose of my studies journeys labors of all kinds of body and mind of tongue and pen am i grasping at money or scheming for power am i planning the illustration of my family or the welfare of my country these are great questions in truth i am tossed about so much from post to pillar that i have not leisure and tranquillity enough to consider distinctly my own views objects and feelings i am mostly intent at present upon collecting a library and i find that a great deal of thought and care as well as money are necessary to assemble an ample and well chosen assortment of books but when this is done it is only a means an instrument whenever i shall have completed my library my end will not be answered fame fortune power say some are the ends intended by a library the service of god

straight succeeds   another still and still another spreads   friend parent neighbor first it will embrace   his country next and next all human race i am certain however that the course i pursue will neither lead me to fame fortune power nor to the service of my friends clients or country what plan of reading or reflection or business can be pursued by a man who is now at pownalborough then at marthas vineyard next at boston then at taunton presently at barnstable then at concord now at salem then at cambridge and afterwards at worcester now at sessions  0  then at pleas now in admiralty now at superior court then in the gallery of the house what a dissipation must this be is it possible to pursue a regular train of thinking in this desultory life by no means it is a life of here and everywhere to use the expression that is applied to othello by desdemonas father  here and there and everywhere—a rambling roving vagrant vagabond life a wandering life at meins bookstore at bowess shop at danas house at fitchs otiss office and the clerks office in the court chamber in the gallery at my own fire i am thinking on the same plan   0 extract from the autobiography in the beginning of the year      my friends in boston were very urgent with me to remove into town i was afraid of my health but they urged so many reasons and insisted on it so much that being determined at last to hazard the experiment i wrote a letter to the town of braintree  declining an election as one of their selectmen and removed in a week or two with my family into the white house as it was called in brattle square which several of the old people told me was a good omen as mr bollan had lived formerly in the same house for many years the year before this that is in      my son john quincy adams was born on the eleventh day of july at braintree and at the request of his grandmother smith christened by the name of john quincy on the day of the death of his great grandfather john quincy of mount wollaston in the course of this year      my friend mr jonathan sewall who was then attorneygeneral called on me in brattle street and told me he was come to dine with me this was always an acceptable favor from him for although we were at antipodes in politics we had never abated in mutual esteem or cooled in the warmth of our friendship after dinner mr sewall desired to have some conversation with me alone and proposed adjourning to the office mrs adams arose and chose to adjourn to her chamber we were accordingly left alone mr sewall then said he waited on me at that time at the request of the governor mr bernard who had sent for him a few days before and charged him with a message to me the office of advocategeneral in the court of admiralty was then vacant and the governor had made inquiry of gentlemen the best qualified to give him information and particularly of one of great authority meaning lieutenantgovernor and chief justice hutchinson      and although he was not particularly acquainted with me himself the result of his inquiries was that in point of talents integrity reputation and consequence at the bar mr adams was the best entitled to the office and he had determined accordingly to give it to me it was true he had not power to give me more than a temporary appointment till his majestys pleasure should be known but that he would give immediately all the appointment in his power and would write an immediate recommendation of me to his majesty and transmit it to his ministers and there was no doubt i should receive the kings commission as soon as an answer could be returned from england for there had been no instance of a refusal to confirm the appointment of a governor in such cases although this offer was unexpected to me i was in an instant prepared for an answer the office was lucrative in itself and a sure introduction to the most profitable business in the province and what was of more consequence still it was a first step in the ladder of royal favor and promotion but i had long weighed this subject in my own mind for seven years i had been solicited by some of my friends and relations as well as others and offers had been made me by persons who had influence to apply to the governor or to the lieutenantgovernor to procure me a commission for the peace such an officer was wanted in the country where i had lived and it would have been of very considerable advantage to me but i had always rejected these proposals on account of the unsettled state of the country and my scruples about laying myself under any restraints or obligations of gratitude to the government for any of their favors the new statutes had been passed in parliament laying duties on glass paint c and a board of commissioners of the revenue was expected which must excite a great fermentation in the country of the consequences of which i could see no end my answer to mr sewall was very prompt that i was sensible of the honor done me by the governor but must be excused from accepting his offer mr sewall inquired why     what was my objection i answered that he knew very well my political principles the system i had adopted and the connections and friendships i had formed in consequence of them he also knew that the british government including the king his ministers and parliament apparently supported by a great majority of the nation were persevering in a system wholly inconsistent with all my ideas of right justice and policy and therefore i could not place myself in a situation in which my duty and my inclination would be so much at variance to this mr sewall returned that he was instructed by the governor to say that he knew my political sentiments very well but they should be no objection with him i should be at full liberty to entertain my own opinions which he did not wish to influence by this office he had offered it to me merely because he believed i was the best qualified for it and because he relied on my integrity i replied this was going as far in the generosity and liberality of his sentiments as the governor could go or as i could desire if i could accept the office but that i knew it would lay me under restraints and obligations that i could not submit to and therefore i could not in honor or conscience accept it mr sewall paused and then resuming the subject asked why are you so quick and sudden in your determination you had better take it into consideration and give me an answer at some future day i told him my answer had been ready because my mind was clear and my determination decided and unalterable that my advice would be that mr fitch should be appointed to whose views the office would be perfectly agreeable mr sewall said he should certainly give me time to think of it i said that time would produce no change and he had better make his report immediately we parted and about three weeks afterwards he came to me again and hoped i had thought more favorably on the subject that the governor had sent for him and told him the public business suffered and the office must be filled i told him my judgment and inclination and determination were unalterably fixed and that i had hoped that mr fitch would have been appointed before that time mr fitch however never was appointed he acted for the crown by the appointment of the judge from day to day but never had any commission from the crown or appointment of the governor     this year      i attended the superior court at worcester and the next week proceeded to springfield in the county of hampshire where i was accidentally engaged in a cause between a negro and his master which was argued by me i know not how but it seems it was in such a manner as engaged the attention of major hawley and introduced an acquaintance which was soon after strengthened into a friendship that continued till his death during my absence on this circuit a convention  sat in boston the commissioners of the customs had arrived and an army landed  on my return i found the town full of troops and as dr byles of punning memory expressed it our grievances reddressed through the whole succeeding fall and winter a regiment was exercised by major small in brattle square directly in front of my house the spiritstirring drum and the earpiercing fife aroused me and my family early enough every morning and the indignation they excited though somewhat soothed was not allayed by the sweet songs violins and flutes of the serenading sons of liberty under my windows in the evening in this way and a thousand others i had sufficient intimations that the hopes and confidence of the people were placed in me as one of their friends and i was determined that     so far as depended on me they should not be disappointed and that if i could render them no positive assistance at least i would never take any part against them my daily reflections for two years at the sight of those soldiers before my door were serious enough their very appearance in boston was a strong proof to me that the determination in great britain to subjugate us was too deep and inveterate ever to be altered by us for every thing we could do was misrepresented and nothing we could say was credited on the other hand i had read enough in history to be well aware of the errors to which the public opinions of the people were liable in times of great heat and danger as well as of the extravagances of which the populace of cities were capable when artfully excited to passion and even when justly provoked by oppression in ecclesiastical controversies to which i had been a witness in the contest at woburn and on marthas vineyard and especially in the trial of hopkins and ward which i had heard at worcester i had learned enough to show me in all their dismal colors the deceptions to which the people in their passions are liable and the total suppression of equity and humanity in the human breast when thoroughly heated and hardened by party spirit the danger i was in appeared in full view before me and i very deliberately and indeed very solemnly determined at all events to adhere to my principles in favor of my native country which indeed was all the country i knew or which had been known by my father grandfather or great grandfather but on the other hand i never would deceive the people nor conceal from them any essential truth nor especially make myself subservient to any of their crimes follies or eccentricities these rules to the utmost of my capacity and power i have invariably and religiously observed to this day  i was solicited to go to the town meetings and harangue there this i constantly refused my friend dr warren the most frequently urged me to this my answer to him always was that way madness lies the symptoms of our great friend otis at that time suggested to warren a sufficient comment on those words at which he always smiled and said it was true     although i had never attended a meeting the town was pleased to choose me upon their committee to draw up instructions to their representatives this year      and the next      the committee always insisted on my preparing the draught which i did and the instructions were adopted without alteration by the town they will be found in the boston gazette for those years  and although there is nothing extraordinary in them of matter or style they will sufficiently show the sense of the public at that time in the fall of the year      a great uproar was raised in boston on account of the unlading in the night of a cargo of wines from the sloop liberty from madeira belonging to mr hancock without paying the customs mr hancock was prosecuted upon a great number of libels for penalties upon acts of parliament amounting to ninety or an hundred thousand pounds sterling he thought fit to engage me as his counsel and advocate and a painful drudgery i had of his cause  there were few days through the whole winter when i was not summoned     to attend the court of admiralty it seemed as if the officers of the crown were determined to examine the whole town as witnesses almost every day a fresh witness was to be examined upon interrogatories they interrogated many of his near relations and most intimate friends and threatened to summon his amiable and venerable aunt the relict of his uncle thomas hancock who had left the greatest part of his fortune to him i was thoroughly weary and disgusted with the court the officers of the crown the cause and even with the tyrannical bell that dangled me out of my house every morning and this odious cause was suspended at last only by the battle of lexington which put an end forever to all such prosecutions      august  0 boston john tudor esq came to me and for the third time repeated his request that i would take his son william into my office i was not fond of the proposal as i had but ten days before taken jonathan williams austin for three years at last however i consented and tudor is to come tomorrow morning what shall i do with two clerks at a time and what will the bar and the world say as to the last i am little solicitous but my own honor reputation and conscience are concerned in doing my best for their education and advancement in the world for their advancement i can do little for their education much if i am not wanting to myself and them    friday mr tudor  came for the first time and attended the office all day and paid me ten pounds sterling in the morning i went to take a view of mr copleys pictures and afterwards to hear news of the letters arrived in scot the mystery of iniquity seems to be unravelled i spent the evening at mr william coopers the doctor came in and was very social he came from a meeting of the overseers of the college at cambridge which was called to advise the corporation to proceed to the choice of a president    sunday at mr quincys  here is solitude and retirement     still calm and serene cool tranquil and peaceful—the cell of the hermit out at one window you see mount wollaston the first seat of our ancestors and beyond that stony field hill  covered over with corn and fruits out at the other window an orchard and beyond that the large marsh called the broad meadows from the east window of the opposite chamber you see a fine plain covered with corn and beyond that the whole harbor and all the islands from the end window of the east chamber you may see with a prospectglass every ship sloop schooner and brigantine that comes in or goes out heard mr wibird upon resignation and patience under afflictions in imitation of the ancient prophets and apostles a sermon calculated for my uncles family whose funeral was attended last week in the afternoon elizabeth adams the widow of micajah adams lately deceased was baptized and received into full communion with the church she never knew that she was not baptized in her infancy till since her husbands decease when her aunt came from lynn and informed her mr wibird prayed that the loss of her husband might be sanctified to her this she bore with some firmness but when he came to pray that the loss might be made up to her little fatherless children the tears could no longer be restrained then the congregation sang a hymn upon submission under afflictions to the tune of the funeral thought the whole together was a moving scene and left scarcely a dry eye in the house after meeting i went to colonel quincys  to wait on mr fiske  of salem seventynine years old this mr fiske and his sister madam marsh  the former born in the very month of the revolution under sir edmund andros and the latter ten years before that made a very venerable appearance        monday  dined with three hundred and fifty sons of liberty at robinsons the sign of liberty tree in dorchester we had two tables laid in the open field by the barn with between three and four hundred plates and an awning of sailcloth over head and should have spent a most agreeable day had not the rain made some abatement in our pleasures mr dickinson the farmers brother and mr reed the secretary of new jersey  were there both cool reserved and guarded all day after dinner was over and the toasts drunk we were diverted with mr balchs mimicry he gave us the lawyers head and the hunting of a bitch fox we had also the liberty song—that by the farmer and that by dr church and the whole company joined in the chorus this is cultivating the sensations of freedom there was a large collection of good company otis and adams are politic in promoting these festivals for they tinge the minds of the people they impregnate them with the sentiments of liberty they render the people fond of their leaders in the cause and averse and bitter against all opposers to the honor of the sons i did not see one person intoxicated or near it  between four and five oclock the carriages were all got ready and the company rode off in procession—mr hancock first in his chariot and another chariot bringing up the rear i took my leave of the gentlemen and turned off for taunton oated at dotys and arrived long after dark at noices there i put up i should have been at taunton if i had not turned back in the morning from roxbury but i felt as if i ought not to lose this     feast as if it was my duty to be there i am not able to conjecture of what consequence it was whether i was there or not jealousies arise from little causes and many might suspect that i was not hearty in the cause if i had been absent whereas none of them are more sincere and steadfast than i am    tuesday rode to taunton sixteen miles before nine oclock though i stopped and breakfasted at haywards in easton nine miles from taunton spent all the leisure moments i could snatch in reading a debate in parliament in      upon a motion to inquire into the conduct of admiral matthews and viceadmiral lestock in the mediterranean when they had and neglected so fine an opportunity of destroying the combined fleets of france and spain off toulon september   saturday night though this book has been in my pocket this fortnight i have been too slothful to make use of it dined at mr smiths heard that messrs otis and adams went yesterday to concert hall and there had each of them a conference with each of the commissioners and that all the commissioners met mr otis this morning at six oclock at the british coffee house  the cause and end of these conferences are subjects of much speculation in town   sunday heard dr cooper in the forenoon mr champion of connecticut in the afternoon and mr pemberton in the evening at the charity lecture spent the remainder of the evening and supped with mr otis in company with mr adams mr william davis and mr john gill the evening spent in preparing for the next days newspaper—a curious employment cooking up paragraphs articles occurrences c working the political engine otis talks all he grows the most talkative man alive no other gentleman in company can find a space to put in a word as dr swift expressed it he leaves no elbow room there is much sense knowledge spirit and humor in his conversation but he grows narrative like an old man abounds with stories   monday spent the evening at dr peckers with the club   0 mr otis introduced a stranger a gentleman from georgia recommended to him by the late speaker of the house in that province otis indulged himself in all his airs attacked the selectmen inches and pemberton for not calling a town meeting to consider the letters of the governor general commodore commissioners collector comptroller c charged them with timidity haughtiness arbitrary dispositions and insolence of office but not the least attention did he show to his friend the georgian no questions concerning his province their measures against the revenue acts their growth manufactures husbandry commerce no general conversation concerning the continental opposition nothing but one continued scene of bullying bantering reproaching and ridiculing the selectmen airs and vapors about his moderatorship and membership and cushings speakership there is no politeness nor delicacy no learning nor ingenuity no taste or sense in this kind of conversation   wednesday mr cudworth told me on the townhouse steps that mr charles paxton the commissioner told him this day that it was possible he might be sent with some process on board a man of war and he advised him as a friend not to attempt to take any man from on board the man of war for you have no right to and if you attempt it you will never come away alive and i want to see otis the deputy sheriff to give him the same advice cudworth told this to otis in my hearing and otis went directly to mr paxtons as i since hear and mr paxton gave him the same advice october    thursday last night i spent the evening at the house of john williams esq the revenue officer in company with mr otis jonathan williams esq and mr mcdaniel a scotch gentleman who has some connection with the commissioners as clerk or something williams is as sly secret and cunning a fellow as need be the turn of his eye and cast of his countenance is like t of braintree in the course of the evening he said that he knew that lord townsend borrowed money of paxton when in america to the amount of five hundred pounds sterling at least that is not paid yet he also said in the course of the evening that if he had drank a glass of wine that came out of a seizure he would take a puke to throw it up he had such a contempt for the thirds of seizures he affects to speak slightly of the commissioners and of their conduct     though guardedly and to insinuate that his connections and interest and influence at home with the boards c are greater than theirs mcdaniel is a composed grave steady man to appearance but his eye has its fire still if you view it attentively otis bore his part very well conversible enough but not extravagant not rough nor sour the morning at brackets upon the case of the whale the afternoon at the office posting books    sunday last i rode to braintree in the morning and heard mr gay of hingham forenoon and afternoon upon these words in the proverbs the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness the good old gentleman had been to the funeral of his aged brother at dedham and seemed to be very much affected he said in his prayer that god in the course of his providence was admonishing him that he must very soon put off this tabernacle and prayed that the dispensation might be sanctified to him and he told the people in the introduction to his sermon that this would probably be the last exhortation they would ever hear from him their old acquaintance  i have not heard a more affecting or more rational entertainment on any sabbath for many years dined with my friend and uncle mr quincy and returned after meeting to boston november saturday after attending court in the morning i dined by particular invitation at mr winthrops the clerk of the superior court with all the bar—messrs dana kent otis fitch reed s quincy b gridley cazneau blowers otis b gridley kent and s quincy were the principal talkers otis talked the most b gridley next kent the next and s quincy next the rest of the company said very little b gridley told us a story of his uncle jeremiah the late head of the bar when i was a schoolboy at master lovells mr gridley my uncle used to make me call at his office sometimes     to repeat my lesson to him i called there one day for that purpose well ben what have you to say ben says he  i am come to say my lesson sir to you says i  ay ben what book have you there under your arm  virgil sir  ay ben is that the poet virgil  yes sir  well ben take it and read to me ben read in the beginning of the æneid ben  yes sir so i opened my book and began  arma virumque cāno trojæ qui primus ab oris  arma virumque cāno ben you blockhead does john lovell teach you to read so—read again so i began again arma virumque cāno—  cāno you villain canō and gave me a tremendous box on the ear  arma virumque canō you blockhead is the true reading thinks i what is this i have blockheading and boxing enough at master lovells i wont have it repeated here and in a great passion i threw the virgil at his head hit him in the face and bruised his lip and ran away  ben ben you blockhead you villain you rascal ben however away i went and went home that evening uncle jeremy came to our house and sat down with my father  brother i have something to say to you about that young rogue of a son of yours that ben he came to my office i bid him read a line in virgil and he read it wrong and i boxed him and he threw his virgil in my face and wounded me he bruised me in my lip—here is the mark of it you must lick him you must thrash him brother i was all this time a listening and heard my father justify me  ben did right says he you had no right to box him you was not his master and if he read wrong you should have taught him how to read right not have boxed him  ay then i find you justify the rogue  yes says father i think he did right  ay then you wont thrash him for it will you  no i think he ought not to be thrashed i think you ought not to have boxed him      what justify the young villain in throwing his book at me and wounding me in this manner about two or three evenings afterwards uncle jeremy was at club with jo green and john lovell and others and began with great solemnity and sobriety—jo what shall i do two or three days ago i was guilty of a bad action and i dont know how to repair it i boxed a little boy a nephew of mine very unrighteously and he is so little so mere a child that i cant ask his pardon and so in solemn sadness he told the whole story to the club whether there is truth in any part of this story or not i cant say but if it is mere fiction there are certainly strong marks of ingenuity in the invention the pride obstinacy and sauciness of ben are remembered in ben in the circumstance of throwing the virgil the same temper in his father is preserved in the circumstance of his justifying it the suddenness and imperiousness of jeremiah in the boxing and his real integrity candor benevolence and goodnature in repenting of it at club and wishing to make reparation b gridley after this gave us another story of colonel byfield and his marrying a sailor which occasioned a great laugh upon the whole this same ben gridley discovered a capacity a genius real sentiment fancy wit humor judgment and observation yet he seems to be totally lost to the world he has no business of any kind lies abed till ten oclock drinks laughs and frolics but neither studies nor practises in his profession  otis spent almost all the afternoon in telling two stories one of gridleys offending the suffolk inferior court in the dispute about introducing demurrers and of his making the amende honorable making concessions c before that contemptible tribunal and another about a conversation between pratt kent and him—kents asking the question what is the chief end of man and pratts answer to provide food c for other animals before dinner kent proposed his project of an act of parliament against devils like to that against witches otis catched at it and proposed the draught of a bill be it enacted c that whereas many of the subjects of this realm     have heretofore time out of mind believed in certain imaginary beings called devils therefore be it enacted that no one shall mention the devil hereafter c on pain of high treason c thus are mens brains eternally at work according to the proclamation of king james i dont think the world can furnish a more curious collection of characters than those that made up this company otis kent dana gridley fitch winthrop c december    saturday night at my office reading sydney i have been musing this evening upon a report of the case of the four sailors who were tried last june before the special court of admiralty for killing lieutenant panton a publication     only of the record i mean the articles plea to the jurisdiction testimonies of witnesses c would be of great utility the arguments that were used are scarcely worth publishing those which might be used would be well worth the perusal of the public a great variety of useful learning might be brought into a history of that case and the great curiosity of the world after the case would make it sell i have half a mind to undertake it the great questions concerning the right of juries in the colonies upon a comparison of the three statutes and concerning the right of impressing seamen for his majestys service whether with or without warrants from the lords of the admiralty upon     orders of the king in council are very important such a pamphlet might suggest alterations in the statutes and might possibly procure us for the future the benefit of juries in such cases and the world ought to know at least the american part of it more than it does of the true foundation of impresses if they have any    0 january    at my office all day last evening at dr peckers with the club otis is in confusion yet he loses himself he rambles and wanders like a ship without a helm attempted to tell a story which took up almost all the evening the story may at any time be told in three minutes with all the graces it is capable     of but he took an hour i fear he is not in his perfect mind the nervous concise and pithy were his character till lately now the verbose roundabout and rambling and longwinded he once said he hoped he should never see t h in heaven dan waldo took offence at it and made a serious affair of it said otis very often bordered upon profaneness if he was not strictly profane otis said if he did see h there he hoped it would be behind the door in my fathers house are many mansions some more and some less honorable in one word otis will spoil the club he talks so much and takes up so much of our time and fills it with trash obsceneness profaneness nonsense and distraction that we have none left for rational amusements or inquiries he mentioned his wife said she was a good wife too good for him but she was a tory  a high tory she gave him such curtain lectures c in short i never saw such an object of admiration reverence contempt and compassion all at once as this i fear i tremble i mourn for the man and for his country many others mourn over him with tears in their eyes monday february    or thereabouts rode from weymouth—stopped at my house veaseys blacksmith shop my brothers my mothers and robinsons these five stops took up the day when i came into town i saw a vast collection of people near liberty tree inquired and found the funeral of the child lately killed by richardson      was to be attended went into mr rowes and warmed me and then went out with him to the funeral a vast number of boys walked before the coffin a vast number of women and men after it and a number of carriages my eyes never beheld such a funeral the procession extended further than can be well imagined this shows there are many more lives to spend if wanted in the service of their country it shows too that the faction is not yet expiring that the ardor of the people is not to be quelled by the slaughter of one child and the wounding of another at club this evening mr scott and mr cushing gave us a most alarming account of otis he has been this afternoon raving mad raving against father wife brother sister friend c     it is a little remarkable that no notice is taken in the diary of the case of captain preston and the soldiers for several years after the time at which it occurred here recourse must be had to the autobiography which gives the following narrative the year    0 was memorable enough in these little annals of my pilgrimage the evening of the fifth of march i spent at mr henderson inchess house at the south end of boston in company with a club with whom i had been associated for several years about nine oclock we were alarmed with the ringing of bells and supposing it to be the signal of fire we snatched our hats and cloaks broke up the club and went out to assist in quenching the fire or aiding our friends who might be in danger in the street we were informed that the british soldiers had fired on the inhabitants killed some and wounded others near the townhouse a crowd of people was flowing down the street to the scene of action when we arrived we saw nothing but some fieldpieces placed before the south door of the townhouse and some engineers and grenadiers drawn up to protect them mrs adams was then in circumstances to make me apprehensive of the effect of the surprise upon her who was alone excepting her maids and a boy in the house having therefore surveyed round the townhouse and seeing all quiet i walked down boylston alley into brattle square where a company or two of regular soldiers were drawn up in front of dr coopers old church with their muskets all shouldered and their bayonets all fixed i had no other way to proceed but along the whole front in a very narrow space which they had left for foot passengers pursuing my way without taking the least notice of them or they of me any more than if they had been marble statues i went directly home to cole lane my wife having heard that the town was still and likely to continue so had recovered from her first apprehensions and we had nothing but our reflections to interrupt our repose these reflections were to me disquieting enough endeavors had been systematically pursued for many months by certain busy characters to excite quarrels rencounters and combats single or compound   0 in the night between the inhabitants of the lower class and the soldiers and at all risks to enkindle an immortal hatred between them i suspected that this was the explosion which had been intentionally wrought up by designing men who knew what they were aiming at better than the instruments employed if these poor tools should be prosecuted for any of their illegal conduct they must be punished if the soldiers in selfdefence should kill any of them they must be tried and if truth was respected and the law prevailed must be acquitted to depend upon the perversion of law and the corruption or partiality of juries would insensibly disgrace the jurisprudence of the country and corrupt the morals of the people it would be better for the whole people to rise in their majesty and insist on the removal of the army and take upon themselves the consequences than to excite such passions between the people and the soldiers as would expose both to continual prosecution civil or criminal and keep the town boiling in a continual fermentation the real and full intentions of the british government and nation were not yet developed and we knew not whether the town would be supported by the country whether the province would be supported by even our neighboring states of new england nor whether new england would be supported by the continent these were my meditations in the night the next morning i think it was sitting in my office near the steps of the townhouse stairs mr forrest came in who was then called the irish infant i had some acquaintance with him with tears streaming from his eyes he said i am come with a very solemn message from a very unfortunate man captain preston in prison he wishes for counsel and can get none i have waited on mr quincy who says he will engage if you will give him your assistance without it he positively will not even mr auchmuty declines unless you will engage i had no hesitation in answering that counsel ought to be the very last thing that an accused person should want in a free country that the bar ought in my opinion to be independent and impartial at all times and in every circumstance and that persons whose lives were at stake ought to have the counsel they preferred but he must be sensible this would be as important a cause as was ever tried in any court or country of the world and that every lawyer must hold himself responsible     not only to his country but to the highest and most infallible of all tribunals for the part he should act he must therefore expect from me no art or address no sophistry or prevarication in such a cause nor any thing more than fact evidence and law would justify captain preston he said requested and desired no more and that he had such an opinion from all he had heard from all parties of me that he could cheerfully trust his life with me upon those principles and said forrest as god almighty is my judge i believe him an innocent man i replied that must be ascertained by his trial and if he thinks he cannot have a fair trial of that issue without my assistance without hesitation he shall have it upon this forrest offered me a single guinea as a retaining fee and i readily accepted it from first to last i never said a word about fees in any of those cases and i should have said nothing about them here if calumnies and insinuations  had not been propagated that i was tempted by great fees and enormous sums of money before or after the trial preston sent me ten guineas and at the trial of the soldiers afterwards eight guineas more which were all the fees i ever received or were offered to me and i should not have said any thing on the subject to my clients if they had never offered me any thing this was all the pecuniary reward i ever had for fourteen or fifteen days labor in the most exhausting and fatiguing causes i ever tried for hazarding a popularity very general and very hardly earned and for incurring a clamor popular suspicions and prejudices  which are not yet worn out and never will be forgotten as long as the history of this period is read it was immediately bruited abroad that i had engaged for preston and the soldiers and occasioned a great clamor which the friends of government delighted to hear and slily and secretly     fomented with all their art the trial of the soldiers was continued for one term and in the mean time an election came on for a representative of boston mr otis had resigned mr bowdoin was chosen in his stead at the general election mr bowdoin was chosen into the council and mr hutchinson then governor did not negative him a town meeting was called for the choice of a successor to mr bowdoin mr ruddock a very respectable justice of the peace who had risen to wealth and consequence by a long course of industry as a master shipwright was set up in opposition to me notwithstanding the late clamor against me and although mr ruddock was very popular among all the tradesmen and mechanics in town i was chosen by a large majority i had never been at a boston town meeting and was not at this until messengers were sent to me to inform me that i was chosen i went down to faneuil hall and in a few words expressive of my sense of the difficulty and danger of the times of the importance of the trust and of my own insufficiency to fulfil the expectations of the people i accepted the choice many congratulations were offered which i received civilly but they gave no joy to me i considered the step as a devotion of my family to ruin and myself to death for i could scarce perceive a possibility that i should ever go through the thorns and leap all the precipices before me and escape with my life at this time i had more business at the bar than any man in the province my health was feeble i was throwing away as bright prospects as any man ever had before him and i had devoted myself to endless labor and anxiety if not to infamy and to death and that for nothing except what indeed was and ought to be all in all a sense of duty in the evening i expressed to mrs adams all my apprehensions that excellent lady who has always encouraged me burst into a flood of tears but said she was very sensible of all the danger to her and to our children as well as to me but she thought i had done as i ought she was very willing to share in all that was to come and to place her trust in providence i immediately attended the general court at cambridge to which place the governor had removed it to punish the town of boston in obedience however as he said i suppose truly to an instruction he had received from the king the proceedings     of the legislature at that time and place may be seen in their journals if they are not lost among other things will be found a labored controversy between the house and the governor concerning these words in general court assembled and by the authority of the same i mention this merely on account of an anecdote which the friends of government circulated with diligence of governor shirley who then lived in retirement at his seat in roxbury having read this dispute in the public prints he asked who has revived those old words they were expunged during my administration he was answered the boston seat and who are the boston seat mr cushing mr hancock mr samuel adams and mr john adams mr cushing i knew and mr hancock i knew replied the old governor but where the devil this brace of adamses came from i know not this was archly circulated by the ministerialists to impress the people with the obscurity of the original of the par nobile fratrum as the friends of the country used to call us by way of retaliation this was to me a fatiguing session  for they put me upon all     the drudgery of managing all the disputes and an executive court had a long session which obliged me to attend almost     constantly there upon a number of very disagreeable causes not long after the adjournment of the general court came on     the trials of captain preston and the soldiers i shall say little of these cases prestons trial was taken down in short hand and sent to england but was never printed here i told the court and jury in both causes that as i was no authority i would propose to them no law from my own memory but would read to them all i had to say of that nature from books which the court knew and the counsel on the other side must acknowledge to be indisputable authorities this rule was carefully observed but the authorities were so clear and full that no question of law was made the juries in both cases in my opinion gave correct verdicts it appeared to me that the greatest service which could be rendered to the people of the town was to lay before them the law as it stood that they might be fully apprized of the dangers of various kinds which must arise from intemperate heats and irregular commotions although the clamor was very loud among some sorts of people it has been a great consolation to me through life that i acted in this business with steady impartiality and conducted it to so happy an issue ipswich june    tuesday morning rambled with kent round landlord treadwells pastures to see how our horses fared we found them in the grass up to their eyes—excellent pastures this hill on which stand the meetinghouse and courthouse is a fine elevation and we have here a fine air and the pleasant prospect of the winding river at the foot of the hill    boston blowers in the reign of richard ii or henry vi you may find precedents for any thing this observation was echoed from some tory who applied it to a late quotation of the house of representatives it is true richard ii and henry vi were weak and worthless princes and their parliaments were bold and resolute but weak princes may arise hereafter and then there will be need of daring and determined parliaments the reigns of richard ii and henry vi were the reigns of evil counsellors and favorites and they exhibit notable examples of the public mischiefs     arising from such administrations and of national and parliamentary vengeance on such wicked minions    last of service very little business this court the bar and the clerks universally complain of the scarcity of business so little was perhaps never known at july term  the cause must be the nonimportation agreement and the declension of trade so that the lawyers lose as much by this patriotic measure as the merchants and tradesmen stephens the connecticut hemp man was at my office with mr counsellor powell and mr kent stephens says that the whole colony of connecticut has given more implicit observance to a letter from the selectmen of boston than to their bibles for some years and that in consequence of it the country is vastly happier than it was for every family has become a little manufactoryhouse and they raise and make within themselves many things for which they used to run in debt to the merchants and traders so that nobody is hurt but boston and the maritime towns i wish there was a tax of five shillings sterling on every button from england it would be vastly for the good of this country c as to all the bustle and bombast about tea it has been begun by about half a dozen holland teasmugglers who could not find so much profit in their trade since the ninepence was taken off in england thus he some sense and some nonsense    wednesday morning very fine likely to be hot at my office early the only way to compose myself and collect my     thoughts is to sit down at my table place my diary before me and take my pen into my hand this apparatus takes off my attention from other objects pen ink and paper and a sitting posture are great helps to attention and thinking took an airing in the chaise with my brother samuel adams who returned and dined with me he says he never looked forward in his life never planned laid a scheme or formed a design of laying up any thing for himself or others after him i told him i could not say that of myself if that had been true of me you would never have seen my face and i think this was true i was necessitated to ponder in my youth to consider of ways and means of raising a subsistence food and raiment and books and money to pay for my education to the bar so that i must have sunk into total contempt and obscurity if not perished for want if i had not planned for futurity and it is no damage to a young man to learn the art of living early if it is at the expense of much musing and pondering and anxiety    thursday mr goldthwaite do you call tomorrow and dine with us at flax pond near salem rowe davis brattle and half a dozen as clever fellows as ever were born are to dine there under the shady trees by the pond upon fish and bacon and pease c and as to the madeira nothing can come up to it do you call well give a genteel dinner and fix you off on your journey rumors of ships and troops a fleet and an army ten regiments and a number of lineofbattle ships were talked of today if an armament should come what will be done by the people will they oppose them if by supporting the rights of mankind and of invincible truth i shall contribute to save from the agonies of death one unfortunate victim of tyranny or of ignorance equally fatal his blessing and tears of transport will be a sufficient consolation to me for the contempt of all mankind essay on crimes and punishments  page        i have received such blessing and enjoyed such tears of transport and there is no greater pleasure or consolation journeying to plymouth at a tavern i found a man who either knew me before or by inquiring of some person then present discovered who i was he went out and saddled my horse and bridled him and held the stirrup while i mounted mr adams says he as a man of liberty i respect you god bless you ill stand by you while i live and from hence to cape cod you wont find ten men amiss a few years ago a person arraigned for a rape at worcester named me to the court for his counsel i was appointed and the man was acquitted but remanded in order to be tried on another indictment for an assault with intention to ravish when he had returned to prison he broke out of his own accord god bless mr adams god bless his soul i am not to be hanged and i dont care what else they do to me here was his blessing and his transport which gave me more pleasure when i first heard the relation and when i have recollected it since than any fee would have done this was a worthless fellow but nihil humanum alienum his joy which i had in some sense been instrumental in procuring and his blessings and good wishes occasioned very agreeable emotions in the heart this afternoon mr william frobisher gave me a narration of his services to the province in introducing the manufacture of potashes and pearlashes and of his unsuccessful petitions to the general court for a compensation he says he has suffered in his fortune by his labors and expenses and has been instrumental of introducing and establishing the manufacture and can obtain nothing that twentyfive thousand pounds worth of potashes have been exported from this town yearly for five years past and more than that quantity for the last two years as appears by the customhouse books and mr sheaff the collector was his informer that he has invented a method of making potashes in much greater quantity and better quality than heretofore has been done from the same materials without   0 any augmentation of expense that he went to hingham and worked with mr lincoln a month and has a certificate from him to the foregoing purpose that his new method separates from the potash a neutral salt that is very pure and of valuable use in medicine c and that if his method was adopted no russian potash would sell at any market where american was to be had thus projectors ever restless    friday began my journey to falmouth in casco bay baited my horse at martins in lynn where i saw t fletcher and his wife c dined at goodhues in salem where i fell in company with a stranger his name i knew not he made a genteel appearance was in a chair himself with a negro servant seemed to have a general knowledge of american affairs said he had been a merchant in london had been at maryland philadelphia new york c one year more he said would make americans as quiet as lambs they could not do without great britain they could not conquer their luxury c oated my horse and drank balm tea at treadwells in ipswich where i found brother porter and chatted with him half an hour then rode to rowley and lodged at captain jewetts jewett had rather the house should sit all the year round than give up an atom of right or privilege the governor cant frighten the people with c  0 saturday arose not very early and drank a pint of new milk and set off oated my horse at newbury rode to clarks at greenland meetinghouse where i gave him hay and oats and then set off for newington turned in at a gate by colonel marchs and passed through two gates more before i came into the road that carried me to my uncles  i found the old gentleman in his eightysecond year as hearty and alert as ever his son and daughter well their children grown up and     every thing strange to me i find i had forgot the place it is seventeen years i presume since i was there my reception was friendly cordial and hospitable as i could wish took a cheerful agreeable dinner and then set off for york over bloody point ferry a way i never went before and arrived at woodbridges half an hour after sunset i have had a very unsentimental journey excepting this day at dinner time have been unfortunate enough to ride alone all the way and have met with very few characters or adventures soon after i alighted at woodbridges in york mr winthrop mr sewall and mr farnham returned from an excursion they had made to agamenticus on a party of pleasure it is the highest mountain in this part of the world seen first by sailors coming in from sea it is in the town of york about seven miles from the courthouse they talk much this evening of erecting a beacon upon it i forgot yesterday to mention that i stopped and inquired the name of a pond in wenham which i found was wenham pond and also the name of a remarkable little hill at the mouth of the pond which resembles a high loaf of our country brown bread and found that it is called peterss hill to this day from the famous hugh peters who about the year    0 or before preached from the top of that hillock to the people who congregated round the sides of it without any shelter for the hearers before any buildings were erected for public worship  by accidentally taking this new route i have avoided portsmouth and my old friend the governor of it but i must make my compliments to him as i return it is a duty—he is my friend and i am his i should have seen enough of the pomps and vanities and ceremonies of that little world portsmouth if i had gone there but formalities and ceremonies are an abomination in my sight—i hate them in religion government science life july   sunday arose early at paul dudley woodbridges a cloudy morning took a walk to the pasture to see how my horse fared saw my old friend and classmate david sewall      walking in his garden my little mare had provided for herself by leaping out of a bare pasture into a neighboring lot of mowingground and had filled herself with grass and water these are important materials for history no doubt my biographer will scarcely introduce my little mare and her adventures in quest of food and water the children of the house have got a young crow a sight i never saw before—the head and bill are     monstrous the legs and claws are long and sprawling but the young crow and the little mare are objects that will not interest posterity landlord says david sewall is not of the liberty side the moultons lymans and sewalls and sayward are all of the prerogative side they are afraid of their commissions and rather than hazard them they would ruin the country we had a fair trial of them when we met to return thanks to the ninetytwo antirescinders  none of them voted for it though none of them but sayward  and his bookkeeper had courage enough to hold up his hand when the vote was put the contrary way this same landlord i find is a high son he has upon his signboard entertainment for the sons of liberty under the portrait of mr pitt thus the spirit of liberty circulates through every minute artery of the province heard mr lyman all day they have four deacons and three elders in this church bradbury is an elder and sayward is a deacon lyman preached from—which things the angels desire to look into drank coffee at home with mr farnham who came in to see me and then went to d sewalls where i spent an hour with farnham winthrop sewall and when i came away took a view of the comet which was then near the north star a large bright nucleus in the centre of a nebulous circle came home and took a pipe after supper with landlord who is a staunch zealous son of liberty he speaks doubtfully of the new counsellor gowing of kittery says he always runs away till he sees how a thing will go says he will lean to the other side says that he the landlord loves peace and should be very glad to have the matter settled upon friendly terms without bloodshed but he would venture his own life and spend all he had in the world before he would give up he gives a sad account of the opposition and persecution he has suffered from the tories for his zeal and firmness against their schemes says they that is the moultons sewalls and     lymans contrived every way to thwart vex and distress him and have got a thousand pounds sterling from him at least but he says that providence has seemed to frown upon them—one running distracted and another c—and has favored him in ways that he did not foresee   monday morning in my sulky before five oclock mr winthrop farnham and d sewall with me on horseback rode through the woods the tide being too high to go over the beach and to cross cape neddick river came to littlefields in wells a quarter before eight oclock stopped there and breakfasted afterwards sewall and i stopped at the door of our classmate hemmenway  whom we found well and very friendly complaisant and hospitable invited us to alight to stop on our return and take a bed with him and he inquired of me where i lived in boston said he would make it his business to come and see me c rode to pattens of arundel and mr winthrop and i turned our horses into a little close to roll and cool themselves and feed upon white honeysuckle farnham and sewall are gone forward to james sullivans  to get dinner ready stopped at james sullivans at biddeford and drank punch dined at allens a tavern at the bridge after dinner farnham winthrop sewall sullivan and i walked a quarter of a mile down the river to see one poke a woman at least one hundred and ten years of age some say one hundred and fifteen when we came to the house nobody was at home but the old woman and she lay in bed asleep under the window we looked in at the window and saw an object of horror—strong muscles withered and wrinkled to a degree that i never saw before after some time her daughter came from a neighbors house and we went in the old woman roused herself and looked round very composedly upon us without saying a word the daughter told her here is a number of gentlemen come to see you gentlemen says the old antediluvian i am glad     to see them i want them to pray for me my prayers i fear are not answered i used to think my prayers were answered but of late i think they are not i have been praying so long for deliverance—oh living god come in mercy lord jesus come in mercy sweet christ come in mercy i used to have comfort in god and set a good example but i fear c her mouth was full of large ragged teeth and her daughter says since she was one hundred years old she had two new double teeth come out her hair is white as snow but there is a large quantity of it on her head her arms are nothing but bones covered over with a withered wrinkled skin and nerves in short any person will be convinced from the sight of her that she is as old as they say at least she told us she was born in ireland within a mile of derry came here in the reign of king william she remembers the reign of king charles ii james ii william and mary she remembers king jamess wars c but has got quite lost about her age her daughter asked her how old she was she said upwards of threescore but she could not tell got into my chair after my return from the old woman rode with elder bradbury through sir william pepperells woods stopped and oated at millikens and rode into falmouth and put up at mr jonathan webbs  where i found my classmate charles cushing mr george lyde the collector here and mr johnson and one mr crocker   sunday this week has been taken up in the hurry of the court and i have not been able to snatch a moment to put down any thing the softly people where i lodge don webb and his wife are the opposites of every thing great spirited and enterprising his father was a dissenting parson and a relation of mine a zealous puritan and famous preacher this son however without the least regard to his education his connections relations reputation or examination into the controversy turns about and goes to church merely because a handful of young foolish fellows here took it into their heads to go don never was or aimed to be any thing at college but a silent hearer of a few rakes and he continues to this day the same     man—rather the same softly living thing that creepeth upon the face of the earth he attempted trade but failed in that now keeps school and takes boarders and his wife longs to be genteel to go to dances assemblies dinners suppers c but cannot make it out for want thereof such imbecility of genius such poverty of spirit such impotence of nerve is often accompanied with a fribbling affectation of politeness which is to me completely ridiculous green tea if we could but get it madeira wine if i could but get it collectors genteel company dances late suppers and clubs c c    thursday afternoon   oclock got into my désobligeant to go home two or three miles out of town i overtook two men on horseback they rode sometimes before me then would fall behind and seemed a little unsteady at last one of them came up what is your name why of what consequence is it what my name is why says he only as we are travelling the road together i wanted to know where you came from and what your name was i told him my name where did you come from boston where have you been to falmouth upon a frolic i suppose no upon business what business pray business at court thus far i humored his impertinence well now says he do you want to know my name yes my name is robert jordan i belong to cape elizabeth and am now going round there my forefathers came over here and settled a great many years ago after a good deal more of this harmless impertinence he turned off and left me i baited at millikens and rode through saco woods and then rode from saco bridge through the woods to pattens after night many sharp steep hills many rocks many deep ruts and not a footstep of man except in the road it was vastly disagreeable lodged at pattens    friday arose and walked with patten to see the neighboring fields of english grass and grain and indian corn consuming before the worms a long black worm crawls up the stalk of rye or grass and feeds upon the leaves the indian corn looked stripped to a skeleton and that was black with the worms i found that they prevail very much in arundel and wells and so all along to portsmouth and to hampton stopped two hours at mr hemmenways and then rode     through the woods in excessive heat to york dined at woodbridges who was much elated with his new license and after dinner was treating his friends—some of them spent an hour at mr sewalls with elder bradbury and then went to portsmouth crossed the ferry after nine oclock and put up at tiltons the sign of the marquis of rockingham a very good house i will call no more at staverss i found very good entertainment and excellent attendance a very convenient house a spacious yard good stables and an excellent garden full of carrots beets cabbages onions cauliflowers c this tiltons is just behind the state house    saturday arose at four got ready as soon as i could and rode out of town a few miles to breakfast breakfasted at lovetts in hampton ten miles from portsmouth and twelve from newbury threatened with a very hot day i hope i shall not be so overcome with heat and fatigue as i was yesterday i fully intended to have made a long visit to governor wentworth upon this occasion but he was unluckily gone to wolfborough so that this opportunity is lost august    sunday last friday went to the lighthouse with the committee of both houses mr royal tyler began to pick chat with me mr adams have you ever read doctor souths sermon upon the wisdom of this world no ill lend it to you i should be much obliged have you read the fable of the bees yes and the marquis of halifaxs character of a trimmer and hurds dialogue upon sincerity in the commerce of life and machiavel and cæsar borgia—hard if these are not enough tyler the author of the fable of the bees understood human nature and mankind better than any man that ever lived i can follow him as he goes along every man in public life ought to read that book to make him jealous and suspicious c yesterday he sent the book and excellent sermons they are concise and nervous and clear strong ebullitions of the loyal fanaticism of the times he lived in at and after the restoration but notwithstanding those things there is a degree of sense and spirit and taste in them which will ever render them valuable the sermon which mr tyler recommended to my perusal is a sermon preached at westminster abbey april  0      from   corinthians iii    for the wisdom of this world is foolishness     with god the doctor undertakes to show what are those rules or principles of action upon which the policy or wisdom in the text proceeds and he mentions four rules or principles   a man must maintain a constant continued course of dissimulation in the whole tenor of his behavior   that conscience and religion ought to lay no restraint upon men at all when it lies opposite to the prosecution of their interest or in the words of machiavel that the show of religion was helpful to the politician but the reality of it hurtful and pernicious   that a man ought to make himself and not the public the chief if not the sole end of all his actions   that in showing kindness or doing favors no respect at all is to be had to friendship gratitude or sense of honor but that such favors are to be done only to the rich or potent from whom a man may receive a farther advantage or to his enemies from whom he may otherwise fear a mischief mr winthrop mr adams and myself endeavored to recollect the old distich— gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed sæpe cadendo so far we got but neither of these gentlemen had ever heard the other part i who had some years ago been very familiar with it could not recollect it but it is— sic homo fit doctus non vi sed sæpe legendo mr mason led us a jaunt over sharp rocks to the point of the island opposite to nantasket where in a hideous cavern formed by a great prominent rock he showed us the animal plant or flower a small spongy muscular substance growing fast to the rock in figure and feeling resembling a young girls breast shooting out at the top of it a flower which shrinks in and disappears upon touching the substance  0 monday the first maxim of worldly wisdom constant dissimulation may be good or evil as it is interpreted if it means only a constant concealment from others of such of our sentiments actions desires and resolutions as others have not a right to know it is not only lawful but commendable because when these are once divulged our enemies may avail themselves of the knowledge of them to our damage danger and confusion so that some things which ought to be communicated     to some of our friends that they may improve them to our profit or honor or pleasure should be concealed from our enemies and from indiscreet friends lest they should be turned to our loss disgrace or mortification i am under no moral or other obligation to publish to the world how much my expenses or my incomes amount to yearly there are times when and persons to whom i am not obliged to tell what are my principles and opinions in politics or religion there are persons whom in my heart i despise others i abhor yet i am not obliged to inform the one of my contempt nor the other of my detestation this kind of dissimulation which is no more than concealment secrecy and reserve or in other words prudence and discretion is a necessary branch of wisdom and so far from being immoral and unlawful that it is a duty and a virtue yet even this must be understood with certain limitations for there are times when the cause of religion of government of liberty the interest of the present age and of posterity render it a necessary duty for a man to make known his sentiments and intentions boldly and publicly so that it is difficult to establish any certain rule to determine what things a man may and what he may not lawfully conceal and when but it is no doubt clear that there are many things which may lawfully be concealed from many persons at certain times and on the other hand there are things which at certain times it becomes mean and selfish base and wicked to conceal from some persons    wednesday rode to cambridge in company with colonel severn ayers and mr hewitt from virginia mr bull and mr trapier from south carolina messrs cushing hancock adams tom brattle dr cooper and william cooper mr professor winthrop showed us the college the hall chapel philosophyroom apparatus library and museum we all dined at stedmans and had a very agreeable day the virginia gentlemen are very full and zealous in the cause of american liberty colonel ayers is an intimate friend of mr patrick henry the first mover of the virginia resolves in      and is himself a gentleman of great fortune and of great figure and influence in the house of burgesses both he and mr hewitt were bred at the virginia college and appear to be men of genius and learning ayers informed me that in the reign of charles ii an act was sent over from england with an   0 instruction to the governor and he procured the assembly to pass it granting a duty of two shillings a hogshead upon all tobacco exported from the colony  to his majesty forever this duty amounts now to a revenue of five thousand pounds sterling a year which is given part to the governor part to the judges c to the amount of about four thousand pounds and what becomes of the other one thousand is unknown the consequence of this is that the governor calls an assembly when he pleases and that is only once in two years these gentlemen are all valetudinarians and are taking the northern tour for their health if i would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so i might be knighted shakspeare the good of the governed is the end and rewards and punishments are the means of all government the government of the supreme and allperfect mind over all his intellectual creation is by proportioning rewards to piety and virtue and punishments to disobedience and vice virtue by the constitution of nature carries in general its own reward and vice its own punishment even in this world but as many exceptions to this rule take place upon earth the joys of heaven are prepared and the horrors of hell in a future state to render the moral government of the universe perfect and complete human government is more or less perfect as it approaches nearer or diverges further from an imitation of this perfect plan of divine and moral government in times of simplicity and innocence ability and integrity will be the principal recommendations to the public service and the sole title to those honors and emoluments which are in the power of the public to bestow but when elegance luxury and effeminacy begin to be established these rewards will begin to be distributed to vanity and folly but when a government becomes totally corrupted the system of god almighty in the government of the world and the rules of all good government upon earth will be reversed and virtue integrity and ability will become the objects of the malice hatred and revenge of the     men in power and folly vice and villany will be cherished and supported in such times you will see a governor of a province for unwearied industry in his endeavors to ruin and destroy the people whose welfare he was under every moral obligation to study and promote knighted and ennobled  you will see a philanthrop for propagating as many lies and slanders against his country as ever fell from the pen of a sycophant rewarded with the places of solicitorgeneral  attorneygeneral advocategeneral and judge of admiralty with six thousands a year you will see seventeen rescinders  wretches without sense or sentiment rewarded with commissions to be justices of peace justices of the common pleas and presently justices of the kings bench the consequence of this will be that the iron rod of power will be stretched out against the poor people in every          january  0 thursday dined at the honorable john ervings  with gray pitts hancock adams townsend j erving jr g erving boardman we had over the nominations of nat hatch to be judge of the common pleas and edmund quincy to be a justice of the quorum and h grays story of a letter from a repentant whig to him h gray the general court is a good school for such conversation as this that is doubleentendre affectation of wit pun smut or at least distant and delicate allusions to what may bear that name gray said he could sometimes consent to a nomination when he could not advise to it and says he i can illustrate it to you mr hancock—suppose a young gentleman should ask his fathers consent that he should marry such a young woman or     a young lady should ask her fathers consent that she should marry such a young man the father says i cannot advise you to have a person of his or her character but if you have a desire i wont oppose it you shall have my consent now mr hancock i know this simile will justify the distinction to a young gentleman of your genius a light brush happened too between pitts and gray pitts hinted something about the strongest side gray said there were two or three of us last may that were midwives i know but you have been always of the strongest side you have been so lucky february   friday met a committee of the house at the representatives room  to consider of a plan for a society for encouraging arts agriculture manufactures and commerce within the province such a plan may be of greater extent and duration than at first we may imagine it might be useful at any time there are in this province natural productions enough hemp silk and many other commodities might be introduced here and cultivated for exportation the mulberry tree succeeds as well in our climate and soil as in any    wednesday at a time when the barriers against popery erected by our ancestors are suffered to be destroyed to the hazard even of the protestant religion when the system of the civil law which has for so many ages and centuries been withstood by the people of england is permitted to become fashionable when so many innovations are introduced to the injury of our constitution of civil government it is not surprising that the great securities of the people should be invaded and their fundamental rights drawn into question while the people of all the other great kingdoms in europe have been insidiously deprived of their liberties it is not unnatural to expect that such as are interested to introduce arbitrary government should see with envy detestation and malice the people of the british empire by their sagacity and valor defending theirs to the present times there is nothing to distinguish the government of great britain from that of france or of spain but the part which the people are by the constitution appointed to take in the passing     and execution of laws of the legislature the people constitute one essential branch and while they hold this power unlimited and exercise it frequently as they ought no law can be made and continue long in force that is inconvenient hurtful or disagreeable to the mass of the society no wonder then that attempts are made to deprive the freeholders of america and of the county of middlesex of this troublesome power so dangerous to tyrants and so disagreeable to all who have vanity enough to call themselves the better sort in the administration of justice too the people have an important share juries are taken by lot or by suffrage from the mass of the people and no man can be condemned of life or limb or property or reputation without the concurrence of the voice of the people as the constitution requires that the popular branch of the legislature should have an absolute check so as to put a peremptory negative upon every act of the government it requires that the common people should have as complete a control as decisive a negative in every judgment of a court of judicature no wonder then that the same restless ambition of aspiring minds which is endeavoring to lessen or destroy the power of the people in legislation should attempt to lessen or destroy it in the execution of laws the rights of juries and of elections were never attacked singly in all the english history the same passions which have disliked one have detested the other and both have always been exploded mutilated or undermined together the british empire has been much alarmed of late years with doctrines concerning juries their powers and duties which have been said in printed papers and pamphlets to have been delivered from the highest tribunals of justice whether these accusations are just or not it is certain that many persons are misguided and deluded by them to such a degree that we often hear in conversation doctrines advanced for law which if true would render juries a mere ostentation and pageantry and the court absolute judges of law and fact it cannot therefore be an unseasonable speculation to examine into the real powers and duties of juries both in civil and criminal cases and to discover the important boundary between the power of the court and that of the jury both in points of law and of fact every intelligent man will confess that cases frequently occur in which it would be very difficult for a jury to determine the     question of law long chains of intricate conveyances obscure perplexed and embarrassed clauses in writings researches into remote antiquity for statutes records histories judicial decisions which are frequently found in foreign languages as latin and french which may be all necessary to be considered would confound a common jury and a decision by them would be no better than a decision by lot and indeed juries are so sensible of this and of the great advantages the judges have to determine such questions that as the law has given them the liberty of finding the facts specially and praying the advice of the court in the matter of law they very seldom neglect to do it when recommended to them or when in any doubt of the law but it will by no means follow from thence that they are under any legal or moral or divine obligation to find a special verdict when they themselves are in no doubt of the law the oath of a juror in england is to determine causes according to your evidence in this province according to law and the evidence given you it will be readily agreed that the words of the oath at home imply all that is expressed by the words of the oath here and whenever a general verdict is found it assuredly determines both the fact and the law it was never yet disputed or doubted that a general verdict given under the direction of the court in point of law was a legal determination of the issue therefore the jury have a power of deciding an issue upon a general verdict and if they have is it not an absurdity to suppose that the law would oblige them to find a verdict according to the direction of the court against their own opinion judgment and conscience it has already been admitted to be most advisable for the jury to find a special verdict where they are in doubt of the law but this is not often the case a thousand cases occur in which the jury would have no doubt of the law to one in which they would be at a loss the general rules of law and common regulations of society under which ordinary transactions arrange themselves are well enough known to ordinary jurors the great principles of the constitution are intimately known they are sensibly felt by every briton it is scarcely extravagant to say they are drawn in and imbibed with the nurses milk and first air now should the melancholy case arise that the judges should give their opinions to the jury against one of these fundamental     principles is a juror obliged to give his verdict generally according to this direction or even to find the fact specially and submit the law to the court every man of any feeling or conscience will answer no it is not only his right but his duty in that case to find the verdict according to his own best understanding judgment and conscience though in direct opposition to the direction of the court a religious case might be put of a direction against a divine law the english law obliges no man to decide a cause upon oath against his own judgment nor does it oblige any man to take any opinion upon trust or to pin his faith on the sleeve of any mere man    thursday dined at mr hancocks with the members warren church cooper c and mr harrison and spent the whole afternoon and drank green tea from holland i hope but dont know    friday evening going to mr pittss to meet the kennebec company—bowdoin gardiner hallowell and pitts there i shall hear philosophy and politics in perfection from h high flying high church high state from g sedate cool moderation from b and warm honest frank whiggism from p i never spent an evening at pittss what can i learn tonight came home and can now answer the question—i learned nothing the company was agreeable enough the complicated cares of my legal and political engagements the slender diet to which i was obliged to confine myself the air of the town of boston which was not favorable to me who had been born and passed almost all my life in the country but especially the constant obligation to speak in public almost every day for many hours had exhausted my health brought on a pain in my breast and a complaint in my lungs which seriously threatened my life and compelled me to throw off a great part of the load of business both public and private and return to my farm in the country early in the spring of      i removed my family to braintree still holding however an office in boston the air of my native spot and the fine breezes from the sea on one side and the rocky mountains of pine and savin on the other together with daily rides on horseback and the amusements of agriculture always delightful to me soon restored my health in a considerable degree april    tuesday evening last wednesday my furniture was all removed to braintree saturday i carried up my wife     and youngest child and spent the sabbath there very agreeably on the  0th or   th of april      i removed into boston in the three years i have spent in that town have received innumerable civilities from many of the inhabitants many expressions of their good will both of a public and private nature of these i have the most pleasing and grateful remembrance i wish all the blessings of this life and that which is to come to the worthy people there who deserve from mankind in general much better treatment than they meet with i wish to god it was in my power to serve them as much as it is in my inclination but it is not—my wishes are impotent my endeavors fruitless and ineffectual to them and ruinous to myself what are to be the consequences of the step i have taken time only can discover whether they shall be prosperous or adverse my design was good and therefore i never shall repent it monday morning i returned to town and was at my office before nine i find that i shall spend more time in my office than ever i did now my family is away i feel no inclination at all no temptation to be anywhere but at my office i am in it by six in the morning i am in it at nine at night and i spend but a small space of time in running down to my brothers to breakfast dinner and tea yesterday i rode to town from braintree before nine attended my office till near two then dined and went over the ferry to cambridge attended the house the whole afternoon returned and spent the whole evening in my office alone and i spent the time much more profitably as well as pleasantly than i should have done at club this evening is spending the same way in the evening i can be alone at my office and nowhere else i never could in my family    thursday fast day tuesday i staid at my office in town yesterday went up to cambridge returned at night to boston and to braintree—still calm happy braintree—at nine oclock at night this morning cast my eyes out to see what my workmen had done in my absence and rode with my wife over to weymouth there we are to hear young blake—a pretty fellow  0 saturday friday morning by nine oclock arrived at my office in boston and this afternoon returned to braintree arrived just at tea time drank tea with my wife since this hour a week ago i have led a life active enough have been to     boston twice to cambridge twice to weymouth once and attended my office and the court too but i shall be no more perplexed in this manner i shall have no journeys to make to cambridge no general court to attend but shall divide my time between boston and braintree between law and husbandry—farewell politics every evening i have been in town has been spent till after nine at my office last evening i read through a letter from robert morris barrister at law and late secretary to the supporters of the bill of rights to sir richard aston a judge of the kings bench a bold free open elegant letter it is annihilation would be the certain consequence of such a letter here where the domination of our miniature infinitesimal deities far exceeds any thing in england this mettlesome barrister gives us the best account of the unanimity of the kings bench that i have ever heard or read according to him it is not uncommon abilities integrity and temper as mr burrow would persuade us but sheer fear of lord mansfield the scottish chief which produces this miracle in the moral and intellectual world that is of four judges agreeing perfectly in every rule order and judgment for fourteen years together four men never agreed so perfectly in sentiment for so long a time before four clocks never struck together a thousandth part of the time four minds never thought reasoned and judged alike before for a ten thousandth part    sunday last night went up to braintree and this evening down to boston called at s adamss and found mr otis colonel warren and doctor warren otis is steady and social and sober as ever and more so    monday in the morning mounted for worcester with pierpont caleb and robert davis josiah quincy c baited the horses at brewers and at colonel buckminsters    thursday dined last monday at brighams in southborough and lodged at furnasses in shrewsbury next day dined at mr putnams in worcester and at same place dined on wednesday this day dined at mr paines with much company at about two oclock this day we finished the famous cause of cutler vs pierpont and davis—an action of trespass for compelling the plaintiff to store his goods with the committee at boston and carting him c we had stories     about fort george the duke of york and a warm gentleman at cambridge bob temple the duke of york was in a battle at sea a cannon ball hit a mans head and dashed his blood and brains in the dukes face and eyes the duke started and leaped quite out of the rank the officer who commanded said pray your highness dont be frightened the duke replied oh sir i am not frightened but i wonder what business that fellow had here with so much brains in his head the warm gentleman at cambridge was bob temple a number of gentlemen at cambridge his friends got into a quarrel and squabble and somebody knowing that all had a great esteem of temple begged him to interpose and use his influence to make peace at last he was persuaded and went in among the persons and one of the first steps he took to make peace was to give one of the persons a blow in the face with his fist thus the defendants are to be laughed and storied out of large damages no doubt however the jury gave none they could not agree eight were for defendant four for plaintiff  may   wednesday saturday i rode from martins in northborough to boston on horseback and from thence to braintree in a chaise and when i arrived at my little retreat i was quite overcome with fatigue next morning felt better and arose early and walked up penns hill and then round by the meadow home after meeting in the afternoon mr tudor and i rambled up the western common and took a view of a place which i have never seen since my removal to boston i felt a joy i enjoyed a pleasure in revisiting my old haunts and recollecting my old meditations among the rocks and trees which was very intense indeed the rushing torrent the purling stream the gurgling rivulet the dark thicket the rugged ledges and precipices are all old acquaintances of mine the young trees walnuts and oaks which were pruned and trimmed by me are grown remarkably nay the pines have grown the better for lopping this evening at the bar meeting i asked and obtained the unanimous consent of the bar to take mr elisha thayer of braintree son of captain ebenezer thayer jr as a clerk how     few years are gone since this gentleman was pleased to call me a petty lawyer at major crosbys court  now is soliciting me to take his son and complimenting c me with being the first lawyer in the province as he did in express words though it was but a compliment and if sincere in him was not true but a gross mistake nay what is more remarkable still complimenting me with his seat in the house of representatives as he did by assuring me in words that if i had an inclination to come from braintree he would not stand in my way such are the mistakes we are apt to make in the characters of men and in our conjectures of their future fortune this however is a wretched triumph a poor victory a small antagonist to defeat and i have very few of this kind of conquests to boast of the governor tells of a vast number of these changes in sentiment concerning him and will be able to tell of many more   thursday the triumphs and exultation of ezekiel goldthwait and his pert pupil price at the election of a registrar of deeds are excessive  they crow like dunghill cocks they are rude and disgusting goldthwait says he would try the chance again for twenty dollars and he would get it by a majority of one hundred votes even in this town nay more he says if he would be representative and would set up he would be chosen representative before adams adams the lawyer dont succeed in the interest he makes for people he is not successful n b very true price says to me if you was to go and make interest for me to be clerk in the room of cook i should get it no doubt these are the insults that i have exposed myself to by a very small and feeble exertion for s adams to be registrar of deeds thus are the friends of the people after such dangerous efforts and such successful ones too left in the lurch even by the people themselves i have acted my sentiments with the utmost frankness at the hazard of all and the certain loss of ten times more than it is in the power of the people to give me for the sake of the people and now i reap nothing but insult ridicule   0 and contempt for it even from many of the people themselves however i have not hitherto regarded consequences to myself i have very cheerfully sacrificed my interest and my health and ease and pleasure in the service of the people i have stood by their friends longer than they would stand by them i have stood by the people much longer than they would stand by themselves but i have learned wisdom by experience i shall certainly become more retired and cautious i shall certainly mind my own farm and my own office   friday last evening i went in to take a pipe with brother cranch and there i found zab adams he told me he heard that i had made two very powerful enemies in this town and lost two very valuable clients treasurer gray and ezekiel goldthwaite and that he heard that gray had been to me for my account and paid it off and determined to have nothing more to do with me oh the wretched impotent malice they show their teeth they are eager to bite but they have not strength i despise their anger their resentment and their threats but i can tell mr treasurer that i have it in my power to tell the world a tale which will infallibly unhorse him whether i am in the house or out if this province knew that the public money had never been counted these twenty years and that no bonds were given last year nor for several years before there would be so much uneasiness about it that mr gray would lose his election another year  it may be said that i have made enemies by being in the general court the governor lieutenantgovernor gray goldthwaite the gentry at cambridge c are made my bitter foes but there is nothing in this these people were all my foes before but they thought it for their interest to disguise it but now they think themselves at liberty to speak it out but there is not one of them but would have done me all the harm in his power secretly before this evening mr otis came into my office and sat with me most of the evening more calm more solid decent and cautious than he ever was even before his late disorders i have this week had an opportunity of returning an obligation of     repaying an old debt to that gentleman which has given me great pleasure mr otis was one of the three gentlemen mr gridley and mr thacher were the other two who introduced me to practice in this county i have this week strongly recommended fourteen clients from wrentham and three or four in boston to him and they have accordingly by my persuasion engaged him in their causes and he has come out to court and behaved very well so that i have now introduced him to practice this indulgence to my own grateful feelings was equally my duty and my pleasure he is a singular man it will be amusing to observe his behavior upon his return to active life in the senate and at the bar and the influence of his presence upon the public councils of this province  i was an hour with him this morning at his office and there he was off his guard and reserve with me i find his sentiments are not altered and his passions are not eradicated the fervor of his spirit is not abated nor the irritability of his nerves lessened   thursday from saturday to wednesday morning i staid at braintree and rode walked rambled and roamed enjoyed a serenity and satisfaction to which i have been three years a stranger this day arrived hall from london with news of the commitment of the mayor and mr alderman oliver to the tower by the house of commons i read this morning in the english papers and the political register for april all the proceedings against the printers thompson and wheble and against the mayor and aldermen wilkes and oliver  what the consequence will be of these movements it is not easy to foresee or conjecture  a struggle a battle so serious and determined between two such bodies as the house and the city must produce confusion and carnage     without the most delicate management on both sides or the most uncommon concurrence of accidents    tuesday yesterday came to town with my wife a fine rain all night captain bradford sent his compliments and desired me to meet the club at his house this evening which i did doctor cooper mr lathrop otis adams doctor greenleaf william greenleaf doctor warren thomas brattle william cooper c bradford a very pleasant evening otis gave us an account of a present from doctor cumings of concord to harvard college chapel of a brass branch of candlesticks such as isaac royal esq gave to the representatives room and that it was sent to n hurds to have an inscription engraved on it the inscription is—   in sacelli hujusce ornatum et splendorem   phosphoron hoc munus benigne contulit   cumings armiger medicus concordiensis  danforth the inscription was much faulted by the wits at club and as it was to be a durable thing for the criticisms of strangers and of posterity it was thought that it ought to be altered doctor cooper mentioned an old proverb that an ounce of mother wit is worth a pound of clergy mr otis mentioned another which he said conveyed the same sentiment—an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of wit this produced a dispute and the sense of the company was that the word wit in the second proverb meant the faculty of suddenly raising pleasant pictures in the fancy but that the phrase mother wit in the first proverb meant natural parts and clergyacquired learning—book learning doctor cooper quoted another proverb from his negro glasgow—a mouse can build an house without trouble and then told us another instance of glasgows intellect of which i had before thought him entirely destitute the doctor was speaking to glasgow about adams fall and the introduction of natural and moral evil into the world and glasgow said they had in his country a different account of this matter the tradition was that a dog and a toad were to run a race and if the dog reached the goal first the world was to     continue innocent and happy but if the toad should outstrip the dog the world was to become sinful and miserable everybody thought there could be no danger but in the midst of the career the dog found a bone by the way and stopped to gnaw it and while he was interrupted by his bone the toad constant in his malevolence hopped on reached the mark and spoiled the world    wednesday argued before the sessions the question whether the court had authority by law to make an allowance of wages and expenses above the fees established by law to the jurors who tried captain preston and the soldiers the two quincys otis and adams argued otis is the same man he used to be   he spares not friend nor foe but calls to mind   like doomsday all the faults of all mankind he will certainly soon relapse into his former condition he trembles his nerves are irritable he cannot bear fatigue brother a has argued so prodigiously like a representative that i cant help considering him as the ghost of one c    wednesday at plymouth put up at witherells near the countyhouse lodged with mr angier where we had a chamber wholly to ourselves—very still and retired very serene and happy mrs howland and her family i hear are very much grieved and hurt and concerned about my passing by their house but my health is my excuse for all my removals i am not strong enough to bear the smoke and dirt and noise of howlands and their late hours at night heard of the election of colonel edson at bridgewater and colonel gilbert of freetown  which proves to me that the system of the province will be different this year from what it was the last the house was very near equally divided the whole of the last session and these two members will be able to make a balance in favor of timidity artifice and trimming how     easily the people change and give up their friends and their interest    wednesday general election went to boston and to cambridge and returned to boston at night  0 thursday mounted my horse for connecticut stopped and chatted an hour with tom crafts who is very low with rheumatism and an hectic but the same honest good humored man as ever stopped again at little cambridge at the house by the meetinghouse and gave my horse hay and oats at mr jacksons rode alone my mind has been running chiefly upon my farm and its inhabitants and furniture my horses oxen cows swine walls fences c i have in several late rambles very particularly traced and pursued every swamp and spring upon the north side of penns hill from its source to its outlet and i think if i owned the whole of that side of the hill i could make great improvements upon it by means of springs and descents and falls of water    friday lodged at mr putnams in worcester june   saturday spent the day at worcester in riding about with mr putnam to see his farm he does what he pleases with meadows and rivers of water he carries round the streams wherever he pleases took one ride up to bogachoag hill one way and another up the lane by doolittles shop and i found that great alterations have been made and many improvements in thirteen years—for it is so long since i was in either of those parts of the town of worcester before in the latter road i missed many objects of my former acquaintance many shady thickets and gloomy grottos where i have sat by the hour together to ruminate and listen to the falls of water this pleasure of revisiting an old haunt is very great mr putnam says he was lately at danvers and visited the very path where he used to drive the cows to pasture when he was seven years old it gave him a strange feeling it made him feel young—seven years old     i visited dr willard i see little alteration in him or his wife in sixteen years his sons are grown up sam the eldest who has been to college is settled at uxbridge in the practice of physic levi is at home i met colonel gardner chandler he said he heard i was in quest of health if i found more than i wanted he begged a little no poor creature ever suffered more for want of it thus he is the same man sixteen years i have been a witness to his continual complaints of weakness and want of health   sunday heard mr wheeler late minister of harvard at worcester all day here i saw many faces much altered and many others not at all since i first knew this place which is now sixteen years here i saw many young gentlemen who were my scholars and pupils when i kept school here—john chandler esq of petersham rufus chandler the lawyer  dr william paine who now studies physic with dr holyoke of salem nat chandler who studies law with mr putnam and dr thad maccarty who is now in the practice of physic at dudley most of these began to learn latin with me mem gardner chandler yesterday said that many regulations were wanting but the town of boston more than any thing and that after election everybody used to be inquiring who were chosen counsellors—very anxious and inquisitive to know but now nobody asked any thing about it nobody cared any thing about it and putnam said yesterday he did not like the town of boston he did not like their manners c i record these curious speeches because they are characteristic of persons and of the age drank tea at mr putnams with mr paine mrs paine dr holyokes lady and dr billy paine the doctor is a very civil agreeable and sensible young gentleman went in the evening over to g chandlers and chatted with him an hour he is very bitter against the town of boston i hate them from my soul says he great patriots were for nonimportation while their old rags lasted and as soon as they were sold at enormous prices they were for importing no more to be heard about manufactures and now there is a greater flood of     goods than ever were known and as to tea those who were most strenuous against it are the only persons who have any to sell john chandler esq of petersham came into ps in the evening from boston yesterday and gave us an account of mr otiss conversion to toryism  adams was going on in the old road and otis started up and said they had gone far enough in that way the governor had an undoubted right to carry the court where he pleased and moved for a committee to represent the inconveniences of sitting there and for an address to the governor he was a good man the ministers said so the justices said so and it must be so and moved to go on with business and the house voted every thing he moved for boston people say he is distracted c   monday oated in spencer turned my horse to grass at wolcotts in brookfield i ride alone i find no amusement no conversation and have nothing to think about but my office and farm frequently steal into my mind and seem to demand my return they must both suffer for want of my presence the road to stafford turns off by brookfield meetinghouse into brimfield in the county of hampshire dined at cheneys of western in the county of hampshire an old man came in and after some conversation with the old landlady she asked him if he was not the man who called here about seventeen years ago and was intrusted with a gill of west india rum he said yes hant you had your money no well i sent it by a brimfield man within a fortnight after ill at him about it im desperate glad you mentioned it i had the rum i was driving down a drove of hogs my two boys were with me—i lost them both in the year      one at crown point and one about eighteen miles from albany—they drinked the rum with me i am glad you mentioned it the money is justly your due ill pay you now how much is it two shillings and four pence but says i interposing for curiosity that will hardly do justice for the interest is as much as the principal the whole debt is four shillings and eight pence im a poor man says he landlady wont ask me     interest i was much amused with the old womans quick and tenacious memory and with the old mans honesty but it seems to me that the whole anecdote shows that these are but twopenny people this honest man whose name is frost hearing that i was bound to the springs and unacquainted with the way very obligingly waited for me to show me the way as far as he went which was several miles his father came from billerica to springfield mrs cheney says her husband came from roxbury i found that frost was a great partisan of the mineral spring he said he had been weakly these thirty years and the spring had done him more good in a few days than all the doctors had done in thirty years and he went on and told of a great number of marvellous instances of cure wrought by washing and drinking while he was there oated at silas hodgess in brimfield near the baptist meetinghouse there i find they have not so much faith in the spring lodged at colburns the first house in stafford there i found one david orcutt who came from bridgewater thirty years ago a relation of the orcutts in weymouth he i find is also a great advocate for the spring he was miserable many years with rheumatism c and by means of the spring was now a comfortable man the landlord came with his father thirty years ago from roxbury he has a farm of two hundred acres of land one hundred under improvement keeps near thirty head of neat cattle three horses fifty sheep and yet offers to sell me his place for five hundred pounds lawful money   tuesday rode over to the spring one child had built a small house within a few yards of the spring and there some of the lame and infirm people keep the spring rises at the foot of a steep high hill between a cluster of rocks very near the side of a river the water is very clear limpid and transparent the rocks and stones and earth at the bottom are tinged with a reddish yellow color and so is the little wooden gutter that is placed at the mouth of the spring to carry the water off indeed the water communicates that color which resembles that of the rust of iron to whatever object it washes mrs child furnished me with a glass mug broken to pieces and puttied together again and with that i drank pretty plentifully of the water it has the taste of fair water with an infusion of some     preparation of steel in it which i have taken heretofore sal martis somewhat like copperas they have built a shed over a little reservoir made of wood about three feet deep and into that have conveyed the water from the spring and there people bathe wash and plunge for which child has eight pence a time i plunged in twice but the second time was superfluous and did me more hurt than good it is very cold indeed mrs child directed me to one greens about half a mile from the spring as a place to lodge at and when i got there i found it was my old acquaintance john green who lived with colonel chandler at worcester while i lived with putnam the place where i now sit in the chamber in greens house has the command of a great view this is a mountainous country this house stands upon very high land and here is a fine spacious road laid out very wide and of great length and quite straight which lies right before me now with the meetinghouse in the middle of it more than half a mile off colonel abijah willard and sam ward and another bought of william browne of salem or virginia seven thousand acres of land in this town and they are about erecting iron mills here furnaces c and there is a talk of making this a shire town c unimproved land is to be bought in this town in great plenty for six shillings an acre at night green called to his wife come put by your work and come in and takes his family bible and reads a chapter and then makes a long prayer of half an hour and we all go to bed   wednesday rode to the spring drank and plunged dipped but once sky cloudy activity and industry care and economy are not the characteristics of this family green was to set out upon a journey to providence today to get stores c and stock for trade but he lounged and loitered away hour after hour till nine oclock before he mounted the cow whose teats strut with milk is unmilked till nine oclock my horse would stand by the head hour after hour if i did not put him out myself though i call upon the father and the sons to put him out looking into a little closet in my chamber this morning i found a pretty collection of books—the preceptor douglasss history paradise lost the musical miscellany in two volumes the life of the czar peter the great c i laid hold of the second volume of the preceptor and began to read the elements     logic and considered the fourfold division of the subject—simple apprehension or perception judgment or intuition reasoning and method this little compendium of logic i admired at college i read it over and over i recommended it to others particularly to my chum david wyer and i took the pains to read a great part of it to him and with him by simple apprehension or perception we get ideas by sensation and by reflection the ideas we get are simple c mem i hope i shall not forget to purchase these preceptors and to make my sons transcribe this treatise on logic entirely with their own hands in fair characters as soon as they can write in order to imprint it on their memories nor would it hurt my daughter to do the same i have a great opinion of the exercise of transcribing in youth about eleven oclock arrived dr mckinstry of taunton and spoke for lodgings for himself and co barrell and his wife it is not you is it says he persons in your way are subject to a certain weak muscle and lax fibre which occasions glooms to plague you but the spring will brace you i joy and rejoice at his arrival i shall have opportunity to examine him about this mineral medicinal water i have spent this day in sauntering about down in the pasture to see my horse and over the fields in the neighborhood took my horse after noon and rode away east a rugged rocky road to take view of the lands about the town and went to the spring thirty people have been there today they say—the halt the lame the vapory hypochondriac scrofulous c all resort here met dr mckinstry at the spring we mounted our horses together and turned away the western road toward somers to see the improvements that i saw yesterday from the mountain by the spring and returned to our lodgings the doctor i find is a very learned man he said that the roman empire came to its destruction as soon as the people got set against the nobles and commons as they are now in england and they went on quarrelling till one brutus carried all before him and enslaved em all cæsar you mean doctor no i think it was brutus want it thus we see the doctor is very booklearned and when we were drinking tea i said five hundred years hence there would be a great number of empires in america independent of europe and of each other oh says he i have no   0 idea that the world will stand so long—not half five hundred years the world is to conform to the jewish calculations—every seventh day was to be a day of rest every seventh year was to be a jubilee and the seventh thousand years will be a thousand years of rest and jubilee no wars no fightings and there is but about two hundred and thirty wanting to complete the six thousand years till that time there will be more furious wars than ever thus i find i shall have in the doctor a fund of entertainment he is superficial enough and conceited enough and enthusiastical enough to entertain   thursday spent this fine day in rambling on horseback and on foot with dr mckinstry east and west north and south went with him twice to the spring and drank freely of the waters and rode about to hire a horse to carry me to springfield and northampton at last obtained one the doctor is alert and cheerful and obliging and agreeable in the afternoon colburn barrell and his wife and daughter came and took lodgings at our house drank tea and spent the evening with them when the doctor took his hat to go out to a neighbors to lodge colburn sprung out of his chair and went up to the doctor took him by the hand and kissed him before all the company in the room this is sandemanianism rode this day beyond the meetinghouse and found my old acquaintance the parson john willard at his own door he lives in a little meanlooking hut how many of my contemporaries at college worthy men live in poor and low circumstances few of them have so much of this worlds goods as have fallen even to my share though some of them have much more let me enjoy then what i have and be grateful mr barrell confirms the account of mr otiss behavior in the house which mr chandler gave me at worcester but says he cannot reconcile this to mr otiss whole conduct for a course of years   friday went to the spring with the doctor and drank a glass and a half that is a gill and a half my horse was brought very early my own mare i shall leave in a very fine pasture with oats for her twice a day that she may rest and recruit rode to somers over a very high large mountain which the people here call chesnut hill it is five miles over very bad     road very high land it is one of a range of great mountains which runs north and south parallel with connecticut river about ten miles to the east of it as another similar range runs on the western side of it there is a mountain which they call the bald mountain which you pass by as you cross chesnut hill much higher from whence you can see the great river and many of the great towns upon it as they say dined at kibbys met people going over to the spring in kibbys barroom in a little shelf within the bar i espied two books i asked what they were he said every man his own lawyer and gilberts law of evidence upon this i asked some questions of the people there and they told me that kibby was a sort of a lawyer among them that he pleaded some of their home cases before justices and arbitrators c upon this i told kibby to purchase a copy of blackstones commentaries rode from kibbys over to enfield which lies upon connecticut river oated and drank tea at peases—a smart house and landlord truly well dressed with his ruffles c and upon inquiry i found he was the great man of the town their representative c as well as tavernkeeper and just returned from the general assembly at hartford somers and enfield are upon a level a fine champaign country suffield lies over the river on the west side of it rode along the great river to windsor and put up at bissells that is in east windsor for the town of windsor it seems lies on the west side of the river the people in this part of connecticut make potash and raise a great number of colts which they send to the west indies and barter away for rum c they trade with boston and new york but most to new york they say there is a much greater demand for flaxseed of which they raise a great deal at new york than there is at boston and they get a better price for it kibby at somers keeps a shop and sells west india goods and english trinkets keeps a tavern and pettifogs it at enfield you come into the great road upon connecticut river which runs back to springfield deerfield northampton c northward and down to windsor and hartford wethersfield and middletown southward the soil as far as i have ridden upon the river if i may judge by the road is dry and sandy but the road is three quarters of a mile from the river and the interval land lies between     i begin to grow weary of this idle romantic jaunt i believe it would have been as well to have staid in my own country and amused myself with my farm and rode to boston every day i shall not suddenly take such a ramble again merely for my health i want to see my wife my children my farm my horse oxen cows walls fences workmen office books and clerks i want to hear the news and politics of the day but here i am at bissells in windsor hearing my landlord read a chapter in the kitchen and go to prayers with his family in the genuine tone of a puritan   saturday bissell says there are settlements upon this river for three hundred miles that is from seabrook where it discharges itself the river in the spring when the snow melts swells prodigiously and brings down the washings of mountains and old swamps rotten wood and leaves c to enrich the interval lands upon its banks at eleven oclock arrived at wrights in wethersfield i have spent this morning in riding through paradise my eyes never beheld so fine a country from bissells in windsor to hartford ferry eight miles is one continued street houses all along and a vast prospect of level country on each hand the lands very rich and the husbandry pretty good the town of hartford is not very compact there are some very handsome and large houses some of brick the state house is pretty large and looks well i stopped only to oat my horse and get my head and face shaved and then rode to wethersfield four miles on the west side of the river here is the finest ride in america i believe nothing can exceed the beauty and fertility of the country the lands upon the river the flat lowlands are loaded with rich noble crops of grass and grain and corn wright says some of their lands will yield two crops of english grass and two tons and a half at each crop and plenty of afterfeed besides but these must be nicely managed and largely dunged they have in wethersfield a large brick meetinghouse lockwood the minister a gentleman came in and told me that there was not such another street in america as this at wethersfield excepting one at hadley and that mr ingersol the stampmaster told him he had never seen in philadelphia nor in england any place equal to hartford and wethersfield dined at the widow griswolds in wethersfield about three     miles from wrights the road and country are equally pleasant all the way sat down to table with the old woman and another woman and a dirty long graybearded carpenter who was at work for landlady and might be smelled from one room to the other so that these republicans are not very decent or neat landlady and her housewright very very chatty about boston providence newport marthas vineyard and nantucket landlady says the deputygovernor calls here and always has some comical story to tell her he asked her the other day to come down and see his wife make cheese he has twentytwo cows and his women make cheese in the forenoon and then dress up and go out or receive company at home rode to middletown and put up for the sabbath at shalers near the courthouse middletown i think is the most beautiful town of all when i first came into the town which was upon the top of a hill there opened before me the most beautiful prospect of the river and the intervals and improvements on each side of it and the mountains at about ten miles distance both on the east and west side of the river and of the main body of the town at a distance i went down this hill and into a great gate which led me to the very banks of the river and on the right hand is a fine level track of interval land as rich as the soil of egypt the lots are divided by no fence but here are strips running back at right angles from the river—on one is indian corn on another parallel to it is rye on another barley on another flax on another a rich burden of clover and other english grasses and after riding in this enchanting meadow for some time you come to another gate which lets you into the main body of the town which is ornamented as is the meadow i just mentioned with fine rows of trees and appears to me as populous as compact and as polite as hartford the air all along from somers to middletown appears to me to be very clear dry and elastic and therefore if i were to plan another journey for my health i would go from boston to lancaster and lunenburg thence to no    and thence down to northampton deerfield hadley springfield then to enfield and along the river down to seabrook and from thence over to rhode island and from thence to braintree and here i might possibly that is at no   look up some land to purchase for my benefit or the benefit     of my children but i hope i shall not take another journey merely for my health very soon i feel sometimes sick of this i feel guilty i feel as if i ought not to saunter and loiter and trifle away this time i feel as if i ought to be employed for the benefit of my fellow men in some way or other in all this ramble from stafford i have met with nobody that i knew excepting jo trumbull who with his father the governor was crossing the ferry for the east side when i was for the west bespoke entertainment for the sabbath at shalers and drank tea she brought us in the finest and sweetest of wheat bread and butter as yellow as gold and fine radishes very good tea and sugar i regaled without reserve but my wife is one hundred and fifty miles from me at least and i am not yet homeward bound i wish connecticut river flowed through braintree but the barren rocky mountains of braintree are as great a contrast as can be conceived to the level smooth fertile plains of this country yet braintree pleases me more i long to be foul of deacon belchers orchard i am impatient to begin my canal and bank to convey the water all round by the road and the house i must make a pool in the road by the corner of my land at the yard in front of the house for the cool spring water to come into the road there that the cattle and hogs and ducks may regale themselves there looking into the almanac i am startled supreme court ipswich is the   th day of june i thought it a week later   th so that i have only next week to go home one hundred and fifty miles i must improve every moment it is twentyfive miles a day if i ride every day next week   sunday feel a little discomposed this morning rested but poorly last night anxious about my return fearful of very hot or rainy weather i have before me an uncomfortable journey to casco bay little short of three hundred miles looking into a little bedroom in this house shalers i found a few books the musical miscellany johnsons dictionary the farmers letters and the ninth volume of dr clarkes sermons this last i took for my sabbathday book and read the sermon on the fundamentals of christianity which he says are the doctrines concerning the being and providence of god the necessity of repentance and obedience to his commands the certainty of a life to come a resurrection from the dead and a future judgment     read also another sermon on the reward of justice there is says the doctor a duty of justice towards the public there is incumbent upon men the very same obligation not to wrong the community as there is not to violate any private mans right or defraud any particular person of his property the only reason why men are not always sufficiently sensible of this so that many who are very just in their dealings between man and man will yet be very fraudulent or rapacious with regard to the public is because in this latter case it is not so obviously and immediately apparent upon whom the injury falls as it is in the case of private wrongs but so long as the injury is clear and certain the uncertainty of the persons upon whom the injury falls in particular or the number of the persons among whom the damage may chance to be divided alters not at all the nature of the crime itself went to meeting in the morning and tumbled into the first pew i could find heard a pretty sensible yalensian connecticutensian preacher at meeting i first saw dr eliot rawson an old schoolfellow he invited me to dine his house is handsome without but neither clean nor elegant within in furniture or any thing else his wife is such another old puritan as his cousin peter adamss wife at braintree his children are dirty and illgoverned he first took me into his physic room and showed me a number of curiosities which he has collected in the course of his practice his diningroom is crowded with a bed and a cradle c c we had a picked up dinner went to meeting with him in the afternoon and heard the finest singing that ever i heard in my life the front and side galleries were crowded with rows of lads and lasses who performed all their parts in the utmost perfection i thought i was trap up a row of women all standing up and playing their parts with perfect skill and judgment added a sweetness and sprightliness to the whole which absolutely charmed me the more i see of this town the more i admire it i regret extremely that i cant pursue my tour to new haven the doctor thinks hancock vain told a story—i was at school with him and then upon a level with him my father was richer than his but i was not long since at his store and said to mr glover whom i knew this i think is mr hancock mr hancock just asked my name and nothing more it was such a     piece of vanity there is not the meanest creature that comes from your way but i take notice of him and i ought what though i am worth a little more than they i am glad of it and that i have it that i may give them some of it i told the doctor that mr hancock must have had something upon his mind that he was far from being arrogant c drank tea with landlady and her son mr shaler in pretty western room but they are not very sociable in short i have been most miserably destitute of conversation here the people here all trade to new york and have very little connection with boston after tea went over to the doctors and found him very social and very learned we talked much about history c he says that boston lost the trade of this colony by the severe laws against their old tenor but they may easily regain the trade for the people here are much disgusted with new york for their defection from the nonimportation agreement and for some frauds and unfair practices in trade he says they have found out that new york merchants have wrote home to the manufacturers in england to make their goods narrower and of a meaner fabric that they might sell cheaper and undersell boston landlady has an only son nat shaler and she is very fond and very proud of him he lived with a merchant is now twentyfive or twentysix and contents himself still to keep that merchants books without any inclination to set up for himself is a great proficient in music plays upon the flute fife harpsichord spinet c associates with the young and the gay and is a very fine connecticut young gentleman oh the misery the misfortune the ruin of being an only son i thank my god that i was not and i devoutly pray that none of mine may ever be  0 monday took my departure from middletown homewards the same way i went down very hot oated at hartford and reached bissells of windsor twentythree miles before dinner just as they had got their indian pudding and their pork and greens upon the table one quarter after twelve after dinner attempted to cut off an angle by striking over by goshen that is ellington to kibbys at somers but lost my way and got bewildered among woods and cross paths and after riding ten miles to no purpose returned to bissells and took the old     road to enfield excessive hot lodged at peases but passed a very restless uncomfortable night overcome with fatigue and inflamed with heat i could not sleep and my meditations on my pillow were unhappy    tuesday rode to kibbys at somers but got caught in the rain very heavy plentiful showers i was much wet thus i have hitherto had not very good luck upon my homeward bound voyage dined at kibbys and then rode over the mountain to stafford went to the spring and drank of the waters with a gentleman from new jersey who was there with a servant dr mckinstry was gone to brookfield to accompany mr barrell so far in his way home    wednesday set out upon my return home oated at warreners in brimfield caught in a cold rain obliged to stop at cheneys in western in order to dine landlord very sick of a pleurisy while i was at cheneys five chaises went by jonathan amory and wife deacon newhall and wife ned paine and wife and sister and servants c oated at spencer drank tea and put up at serjeants in leicester a very good house neat and clean and convenient c i have had a naked barren journey my brains have been as barren the whole time as a sandy plain or a gravelly knoll my soul has been starved came off just when company began to collect this week and the next would have brought together a curious collection of characters from all parts of new england and some perhaps from the southern provinces and some from the west indies    thursday remarkable the change of thoughts and feelings and reasonings which are occasioned by a change of objects a man is known by his company and evil communications corrupt good manners man is a social creature and his passions his feelings his imaginations are contagious we receive a tincture of the character of those we converse with stopped at mr putnams and at the courthouse went in and bowed to the court and shook hands with the bar said how dye and came off dined at colonel williamss drank tea at munns with dr cooper and his lady captain jonathan freeman and his lady and mr nat barrett and his lady who were upon their return from a tour to lancaster rode this day from worcester to munns in company with one     green of leicester who was very social and good company—an honest clever man by him i learn that thomas faxon of braintree has removed with his family to leicester and hired a house near the meetinghouse and i met joseph crane today in marlborough going to rutland he is about removing his family there but i find that people in rutland and leicester and worcester c are more disposed to emigrate still further into the wilderness than the inhabitants of the old towns i hear much today and yesterday of the harmony prevailing between the governor and the house cushing is unanimously commissary not negatived and goldthwaite is truckmaster behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it seems to be forgotten entirely by what means hutchinson procured the government by his friendship for bernard and by supporting and countenancing all bernards measures and the commissioners and army and navy and revenue and every other thing we complain of i read today an address from the convention of ministers and from the clergy in the northern part of the county of hampshire and from the town of almsbury all conceived in very high terms of respect and confidence and affection posterity will scarcely find it possible to form a just idea of this gentlemans character but if this wretched journal should ever be read by my own family let them know that there was upon the scene of action with mr hutchinson one determined enemy to those principles and that political system to which alone he owes his own and his familys late advancement one who thinks that his character and conduct have been the cause of laying a foundation for perpetual discontent and uneasiness between britain and the colonies of perpetual struggles of one party for wealth and power at the expense of the liberties of this country and of perpetual contention and opposition in the other party to preserve them and that this contention will never be fully terminated but by wars and confusions and carnage cæsar by destroying the roman republic made himself perpetual dictator hutchinson by countenancing and supporting a system of corruption and all tyranny has made himself governor and by the mad idolatry of the people always the surest instruments of their own servitude laid prostrate at the feet of both with great anxiety and     hazard with continual application to business with loss of health reputation profit and as fair prospects and opportunities of advancement as others who have greedily embraced them i have for ten years together invariably opposed this system and its fautors it has prevailed in some measure and the people are now worshipping the authors and abettors of it and despising insulting and abusing the opposers of it edward and alfred—   closed their long glories with a sigh to find   th unwilling gratitude of base mankind as i came over sudbury causey i saw a chaplain of one of the kings ships fishing in the river—a thick fat man with rosy cheeks and black eyes at night he came in with his fish i was in the yard and he spoke to me and told me the news the governor gave a very elegant entertainment to the gentlemen of the army and navy and revenue and mrs gambier in the evening a very elegant ball as elegant a cold collation as perhaps you ever see all in figures c c c read this days paper the melodious harmony the perfect concords the entire confidence and affection that seem to be restored greatly surprise me will it be lasting  i believe there is no man in so curious a situation as i am—i am for what i can see quite left alone in the world    monday set out upon the eastern circuit stopped at boston at my office and nowhere else came over charlestown ferry and penny ferry and dined at kettels in malden by the meetinghouse kettel is a deputy sheriff the meetinghouse is mr j thachers i mounted my horse and rode to boston in a cloth coat and waistcoat but was much pinched with a cold raw harsh northeast wind at boston i put on a thick flannel shirt and that made me comfortable and no more so cold am i or so cold is the weather—  th june overtook judge cushing in his old curricle and two lean horses and dick his negro at his right hand driving the curricle   0 this is the way of travelling in     —a judge of the circuits a judge of the superior court a judge of the kings bench common pleas and exchequer for the province travels with a pair of wretched old jades of horses in a wretched old dungcart of a curricle and a negro on the same seat with him driving but we shall have more glorious times anon when the sterling salaries are ordered out of the revenue to the judges c as many most ardently wish and the judges themselves among the rest i suppose stopped at martins in lynn with judge cushing oated and drank a glass of wine and heard him sigh and groan the sighs and groans of seventyseven though he kept active he conversed in his usual hinting insinuating doubting scrupling strain rode with king a deputy sheriff who came out to meet the judges into salem put up at goodhues the negro that took my horse soon began to open his heart—he did not like the people of salem wanted to be sold to captain john dean of boston he earned two dollars in a forenoon and did all he could to give satisfaction but his mistress was cross and said he did not earn salt to his porridge c and would not find him clothes c thus i find discontents in all men—the black thinks his merit rewarded with ingratitude and so does the white the black estimates his own worth and the merit of his services higher than anybody else so does the white this flattering fond opinion of himself is found in every man i have hurt myself today by taking cold in the forenoon and by drinking too much wine at kettels and at martins i drank half a pint at kettels and two glasses at martins just after i had drank tea and got my fire made in my chamber my old neighbor jo barrell came and lodged at goodhues in the same chamber with me his grief is intense indeed he spent the whole evening and a long time after we got to bed in lamenting the loss of his wife  in enumerating her excellencies c heartily wishes himself with her would have been very glad to have gone with her he married from pure regard utterly against the will of his mother and all his friends because     she was poor but she made him happy she was the best of women the world has lost all its charms to him she beckoned to me but a few minutes before she died when her hands were as cold as clods she whispered to me i love you now if i could but carry you and the children with me i should go rejoicing in this eloquent strain of grief did he run on millions of thoughts did this conversation occasion me i thought i should have had no sleep all night however i got to sleep and slept well    tuesday rode with mr barrell to ipswich and put up at treadwells every object recalls the subject of grief barrell all the way to ipswich was like the turtle bemoaning the loss of his mate fine season and beautiful scenes but they did not charm him as they used to he had often rode this way a courting with infinite pleasure c i cant realize that she has left me forever when she was well i often thought i could realize the loss of her but i was mistaken i had no idea of it in short this mans mournings have melted and softened me beyond measure    saturday spent this week at ipswich in the usual labors and drudgery of attendance upon court boarded at treadwells have had no time to write landlord and landlady are some of the grandest people alive landlady is the great granddaughter of governor endicott and has all the great notions of high family that you find in winslows hutchinsons quincys salttonstalls chandlers leonards otises and as you might find with more propriety in the winthrops yet she is cautious and modest about discovering it she is a new light continually canting and whining in a religious strain the governor was uncommonly strict and devout eminently so in his day and his great great granddaughter hopes to keep up the honor of the family in hers and distinguish herself among her contemporaries as much terrible things sin causes sighs and groans the pangs of the new birth the death of christ shows above all things the heinous nature of sin how awfully mr kent talks about death how lightly and carelessly i am sure a man of his years who can talk so about death must be brought to feel the pangs of the new birth here or made to repent of it forever how dreadful it seems to me to hear him i that am so afraid of death and so concerned lest i ant fit and     prepared for it what a dreadful thing it was that mr gridley died so—too great too big too proud to learn any thing would not let any minister pray with him said he knew more than they could tell him asked the news and said he was going where he should hear no news c thus far landlady as to landlord he is as happy and as big as proud as conceited as any nobleman in england always calm and goodnatured and lazy but the contemplation of his farm and his sons and his house and pasture and cows his sound judgment as he thinks and his great holiness as well as that of his wife keep him as erect in his thoughts as a noble or a prince indeed the more i consider of mankind the more i see that every man seriously and in his conscience believes himself the wisest brightest best happiest c of all mankind i went this evening spent an hour and took a pipe with judge trowbridge at his lodgings he says you will never get your health till your mind is at ease if you tire yourself with business but especially with politics you wont get well i said i dont meddle with politics nor think about them—except says he by writing in the papers ill be sworn says i i have not wrote one line in a newspaper these two years c the judge says he had a hint that foster hutchinson was appointed judge because of the judgment of the court in the case of spear vs leen the merchants took the alarm and said that instead of lawyers they ought to have merchants upon the bench and mr hutchinson being both a lawyer and a merchant he was the man against the governors determination a little time before but this is one instance among a thousand of the governors disguise before those that he induces to believe have his entire familiarity and confidence he made mr goffe understand he intended to make worthington or some other lawyer a judge when he fully designed to make his brother not indeed to please the merchants or because foster was a merchant but because he was his brother and that the family might have a majority in that court he is impenetrable to those who dont desire to reach any imperfection in him and who are determined not to fathom him where they may the bigoted the superstitious the enthusiastical the tools the interested the timid are all dazzled with his glare and cant see clearly when he is in the horizon        sunday in the morning my horse was gone went to meeting all day and heard old mr rogers a good wellmeaning man i believe after meeting rode to newbury and visited brother lowell brother farnham and then went and supped with mr jonathan jackson in company with captain tracy mr hooper mr williams mr frazier and brother lowell then went and lodged with lowell    monday reached portsmouth with lowell and walked half an hour with him on the townhouse floor with mr livius and mr jonathan warner c put up at tiltons and intend to visit the governor this afternoon had a good deal of chat with lowell on the road he practises much in new hampshire and gave me an account of many strange judgments of the superior court at portsmouth that an infant if allowed to trade by his parents is bound by his contract c and he gave me an account also of the politics of the province a controversy is arising or has arisen in the wentworth family the old governor by his will gave all his estate to his wife and she is since married to one michael wentworth which has a little disappointed the governor and he not long since asked the advice of his council whether he might not reassume the lands which were formerly granted by the late governor to himself or at least reserved to himself in each grant of a township and grant them over again to a third person from whom he might take a conveyance of them to himself all the council except livius advised him to the reassumption he having laid before them the opinion of s fitch of boston that the governor could not grant land to himself livius dissented and entered his protest and gave his reasons for which the governor has displaced him as a judge of one of their courts at tiltons in portsmouth i met with my cousin joseph adams whose face i was once as glad to see as i should have been to see an angel the sight of him gave me a new feeling when he was at college and used to come to braintree with his brother ebenezer how i used to love him he is broken to pieces with rheumatism and gout now to what cause is his ruin to be ascribed after dinner a gentleman came to tiltons to inquire me out and it proved to be mr pickering a lawyer he treated me with great politeness and seems a very sensible     and well accomplished lawyer after dinner rode to york and put up at ritchies with lowell and bradbury    tuesday at york court dined with the judges and spent the evening at ritchies with bradbury and hale of portsmouth—a sensible young lawyer    wednesday yesterday i had a good deal of conversation with judge trowbridge he seems alarmed about the powers of the court of probate he says if judge danforth was to die tomorrow and the governor was to offer that place to him he would not take it because he thinks it ought always to be given to some judge of the inferior court and then some one lawyer might be found in each county who would take a seat upon the inferior bench if he could be made a judge of probate at the same time he says he is utterly against foster hutchinsons holding the probate office in boston if he takes his place upon the superior bench and if the governor is an integral part of the court of probate the supreme ordinary that is if he is not with the members of the council only primus inter pares but has a negative upon all their decrees as governor shirley governor bernard and the late secretary were of opinion he thinks we may be in great danger from the court of probate and judge russell always opposed every attempt to extend the power of the court of probate he used to say we might have bishops here and the court of probate might get into their hands and therefore we ought to be upon our guard    friday at york yesterday i spent in walking one way and another to view the town i find that walking serves me much it sets my blood in motion much more than riding had some conversation this week with chadburn of berwick he says that jo lee came to him on the electionday morning and said i know you are a peaceable man why cant you vote for a few gentlemen who would be agreeable to the governor and then perhaps some gentleman may not be negatived who would be agreeable to you why cant you promote a coalition chadburn answered i dont know who would be agreeable to the governor i have not had a list lee then mentioned mr ropes lieutenant governor oliver and some of the judges why cant you choose some of those old statesmen who have been long and intimately acquainted with the policy of the province c thus the governors emissaries     are busy instilling insinuating their notions and principles c had a little chat this week with colonel sparhawk of kittery  he says now you are come away they are become peaceable you kept up a shocking clamor while you was there this he said laughing but there was rather too much truth in it to be made a jest they do you the justice to say that no man ever spoke more freely than you did and in opposition to the rising sun but in order to take off from your virtue they say there is some private pique between the governor and you i told him there was none he had always treated me well personally if i had been actuated by private pique i would not have left the general court but i would have remained there on purpose to plague him i could at least have been a thorn in his side c but that i had been fully convinced in my own mind these ten years that he was determined to raise himself and family at all hazards and even on the ruins of the province and that i had uniformly expressed that opinion these ten years sparhawk mentioned the intrepidity of samuel adams a man he says of great sensibility of tender nerves and harassed dependent in their power yet he had borne up against all it must have penetrated him very deeply c july   tuesday at falmouth at mr jonathan webbs who has removed to a house very near the court house last friday morning i mounted with brother bradbury and his brother bradbury at york for falmouth went over the sands but could not ford cape neddick and so was obliged to go round over the bridge by the mill dined at littlefields in wells drank tea and lodged at allens in biddeford colonel tyng and his son in law jo tyler came along and lodged there tyng being the owner of the house and farm there fortyseven rods wide upon the river and four miles and a half long next day saturday it rained and jonathan sewall mr lowell and mr leonard jarvis came in and after noon judges lynch and cushing with their servants but the house had not lodgings for them the judges went back to ladds sewall and lowell went to james sullivans sunday morning the weather was     fair and we set off for scarborough put up at millikins went to meeting forenoon and afternoon heard mr briggs a young gentleman and after meeting rode to falmouth and i put up at webbs where i have been ever since reading the achievements of don quixote this has been the most flat insipid spiritless tasteless journey that ever i took especially from ipswich i have neither had business nor amusement nor conversation it has been a moping melancholy journey upon the whole i slumber and mope away the day tyng tyler sewall lowell jarvis were all characters which might have afforded me entertainment perhaps instruction if i had been possessed of spirits to enjoy it saturday afternoon i projected making a backgammon table and about it sewall lowell and jarvis and jo tyler went got pieces of cedar c and while they were playing i went to sleep sunday jarvis was telling of an instance of cruelty and inhumanity in hall the wharfinger in boston in ordering a poor widow to be taken with a single writ when her daughter was dying and of his being bail for her sewall said hall would certainly be damned and you will certainly go to heaven let you do what you will i feel myself weary of this wandering life my heart is at home it would be more for my health to ride to boston every fair morning and to braintree every fair afternoon this would be riding enough and i could then have one eye to my office and another to my farm after my return i shall try the experiment in the evening went to the club or friendly society as they call themselves where i found william cushing wyer with whom i went that is at his invitation mr lyde child simmons jarvis dr coffin captain wait and don webb conversation decent but upon trifles and common matters saw mr simmons at court a gentleman from england who has been at falmouth a number of years as a factor for several merchants in england purchasing deals   thursday dined with d wyer in company with his father farnham sewall cushing lowell c conversation turns upon revelations prophecies jews c spent the evening with the bar at shattucks the tavern in high spirits     agreed unanimously to recommend tim langdon to be sworn all in good spirits very cheerful and chatty many good stories c this day argued the cause of freeman and child a suit for ten pounds penalty for taking greater fees in the customhouse than those allowed by the province law   friday cadwallader ford came to me this morning and congratulated me on the verdict for freeman sir says he i shall think myself forever obliged to you for the patriotic manner in which you conducted that cause you have obtained great honor in this county by that speech i never heard a better c all this is from old cadwallader langdon told me that a man came running down when i had done speaking and said that mr adams has been making the finest speech i ever heard in my life hes equal to the greatest orator that ever spoke in greece or rome what an advantage it is to have the passions prejudices and interests of the whole audience in a mans favor these will convert plain common sense into profound wisdom nay wretched doggerel into sublime heroics this cause was really and in truth and without partiality or affectation of modesty very indifferently argued by me but i have often been surprised with claps and plaudits and hosannas when i have spoken but indifferently and as often met with inattention and neglect when i have thought i spoke very well—how vain and empty is breath tuesday went to boston with my wife and the next day to commencement at cambridge was only at three chambers—palmers frenchs and rogerss    monday after rambling about my farm and giving some directions to my workmen i went to boston there soon came into my office ruddock  and story it seems that andrew belchers widow has sued story as deputy register of the admiralty under her husband in his lifetime and ruddock as his bondsman upon the bond given for the faithful discharge of his office three or four hundred pounds sterling of the kings third of a seizure is not accounted for and ruddock is in trouble this ruddock is as curious a character as any of his age a finished     example of selfconceit and vanity i am plunged i never was concerned in any affair before that i could not have any thoughts of my own upon it i know there are several laws by one law the sheriffs bonds are not to be put in suit after two years and the treasurers are limited to three years but whether these precedents will govern this case i cannot tell i consulted mr pratt once about an affair and he advised me to do something i told him i was of a different opinion every line in his face altered when i said this you are certainly wrong said he well says i you will be my lawyer when we come to court yes said he but next morning he told me brother ruddock i have been ruminating your affair on my pillow and i find you was right and i was wrong  thus mr justice ruddock is mighty in counsel i told andrew belcher if he would not do so and so he should never be chosen counsellor again he would not do it and the next year he was left out i told him further that i would not accept of any post in the world to stop my mouth about liberty but i would write home and get away his post of register of the admiralty thus squire ruddock thinks himself powerful at court the instances of this mans vanity are innumerable his soul is as much swollen as his carcass i dined at my lodgings came early to my office went home and drank tea at six oclock and returned to my office and here i am what a multitude passes my window every day mr otiss servant brought his horse to the door at seven and he took a ride treasurer gray stalked along from new boston where his daughter otis  lives down to the british coffee house where the club meets as i suppose about half after seven spent an hour or two in the evening at mr cranchs mr jo greenleaf came in and parson hilliard  of barnstable and we were very chatty sister cranch says she has had an opportunity of making many observations this year at commencement and she has quite altered her mind about dancing and dancingschools and mr cranch seems convinced too and says it seems that all such as learn to dance are so taken up with it     that they cant be students so that if they should live to bring up their son to college they would not send him to dancingschool nor their daughters neither what a sudden and entire conversion is this that mrs c should change so quick is not so wonderful but that his mathematical metaphysical mechanical systematical head should be turned round so soon by her report of what she saw at cambridge is a little remarkable however the exchange is for the better it is from vanity to wisdom from foppery to sobriety and solidity i never knew a good dancer good for any thing else i have known several men of sense and learning who could dance—otis sewall paine—but none of them shone that way and neither of them had the more sense or learning or virtue for it i would not however conclude peremptorily against sending sons or daughters to dancing or fencing or music but had much rather they should be ignorant of them all than fond of any one of them    tuesday the court sat nothing remarkable it is a pity that a day should be spent in the company of courts c and nothing be heard or seen worth remembering but this is the case of all that i have heard from judges lawyers jurors clients clerks i cannot recollect a word a sentence worth committing to writing took a pipe in the beginning of the evening with mr cranch and then supped with dr warren the indian preacher cried good god that ever adam and eve should eat that apple when they knew in their own souls it would make good cider    and    thursday and friday both these days spent in the trial of mr otiss case against mr robinson    saturday the jury this morning delivered their verdict for two thousand pounds sterling damages and costs  i have spent this morning in reading the centinels there is a profuse collection of knowledge in them in law history government that indicates to me the only author i think a great variety of knowledge    0 the subject of the governors independency is a serious a dangerous and momentous thing it deserves the utmost attention j q says mr o was quite wild at the bar meeting cursed the servants for not putting four candles on the table swore he could yet afford to have four upon his own c c august    or    spent the evening at cordiss the british coffee house in the front room towards the long wharf where the merchants club has met this twenty years it seems there is a schism in that church a rent in that garment a mutiny in that regiment and a large detachment has decamped and marched over the way to ingersols this evening the commissary and speaker and speaker and commissary mr cushing was present the clerk of the house mr adams mr otis mr john pitts dr warren mr molineux mr josiah quincy and myself were present    and    thursday and friday at the office mr otiss gestures and motions are very whimsical his imagination is disturbed his passions all roiled his servant he orders to bring up his horse and to hold him by the head at the stone of his door an hour before he is ready to mount then he runs into one door and out at another and window c c c november   tuesday at salem fine weather deacon thurston of rowley came in last night a venerable old man with his snowy hoary locks kent and the deacon soon clashed upon religion dont you think sir says the deacon we are here probationers for eternity no by no means says kent we are here probationers for the next state and in the next we shall be probationers for the next that is to follow and so on through as many states as there are stars or sands to all eternity you have gone through several states already before this ay says the deacon where do you get this dont you believe the scriptures i put in my oar he made it deacon out of the whole cloth it never existed out of his imagination kent i get it from analogy it is the delight of this kents heart to tease a minister or deacon with his wild conceits about religion        saturday at salem all this week at court dined one day at chief justice lyndes all the rest of the week till this day with the court dined this day spent the afternoon and drank tea at judge ropess with judges lynde oliver and hutchinson sewall putnam and winthrop mrs ropes is a fine woman very pretty and genteel our judge oliver is the best bred gentleman of all the judges by far there is something in every one of the others indecent and disagreeable at times in company—affected witticisms unpolished fleers coarse jests and sometimes rough rude attacks—but these you dont see escape judge oliver drank tea at judge ropess spent the     evening at colonel pickmans he is very sprightly sensible and entertaining talks a great deal tells old stories in abundance about the witchcraft paper money governor belchers administration c  0 sunday heard mr cutler of ipswich hamlet dined at dr putnams with colonel putnam and lady and two young gentlemen nephews of the doctor and colonel— and a mrs scollay colonel putnam told a story of an indian upon connecticut river who called at a tavern in the fall of the year for a dram the landlord asked him two coppers for it the next spring happening at the same house he called for another and had three coppers to pay for it how is this landlord says he last fall you asked but two coppers for a glass of rum now you ask three oh says the landlord it costs me a good deal to keep rum over winter it is as expensive to keep a hogshead of rum over winter as a horse ay says the indian i cant see through that he wont eat so much hay—maybe he drink as much water this was sheer wit pure satire and true humor humor wit and satire in one very short repartee kent brought with him utopia or the happy republic a philosophical romance by sir thomas more translated by bishop burnet there is a sensible preface by the translator prefixed and some testimonies concerning more by great and learned men of different nations and religions—cardinal pole erasmus jo cochlæus paulus jovius jo rivius charles v c the translation i think is better than mine which is by another hand the romance is very elegant and ingenious the fruit of a benevolent and candid heart a learned and strong mind the good humor hospitality humanity and wisdom of the utopians is charming their elegance and taste is engaging their freedom from avarice and foppery and vanity is admirable      february   sunday have omitted now for three months almost to keep any note of time or of its loss thomas newcomb dined with me he says that etter the stockingweaver told him about a fortnight ago that he saw the governor within these three months and told him he hoped the people would be contented and easy now they had a governor from among themselves the governor said there were some discontents remaining occasioned by continual clamors     in the newspapers and that a great part of those clamors came from his etters town braintree this was partly i suppose to pump etter and get something out of him and partly to put etter upon the right scent as the governor thought that he might hunt down the seditious writer at braintree this conversation shows that the governor is puzzled and wholly ignorant of the real writers that molest him the centinel has puzzled him mr thomas edwards our schoolmaster and mr joseph crosby a senior sophister at college spent the evening with me our conversation was upon austin tudor bulkley morton thayer angier colonel thayer the settlement of the militia algebra fenning dr sanderson c c edwards is balancing in his mind the several professions in order to choose one is at a loss between divinity and law but his inclination is to the latter asked me to take him i only answered there were such swarms of young ones that there was no encouragement   tuesday took a ride in the afternoon with my wife and little daughter to make a visit to my brother but finding him and sister just gone to visit my mother we rode down there and drank tea all together chatted about the new promotions in the militia and speculated about the future officers of this company upon supposition that the old officers should resign—billings brother c c it is curious to observe the effect these little objects of ambition have upon mens minds the commission of a subaltern in the militia will tempt these little minds as much as crowns and stars and garters will greater ones these are things that strike upon vulgar rustic imaginations more strongly than learning eloquence and genius of which common persons have no idea my brother seems to relish the thought of a commission and if rawson and bass resign i hope he will have one under billings   sunday if i would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so i might be knighted shakspeare shakspeare that great master of every affection of the heart and every sentiment of the mind as well as of all the powers of expression is sometimes fond of a certain pointed oddity of language a certain quaintness of style that is an imperfection     in his character the motto prefixed to this paper may be considered as an example to illustrate this observation abstracted from the point and conceit in the style there is sentiment enough in these few words to fill a volume it is a striking representation of that struggle which i believe always happens between virtue and ambition when a man first commences a courtier by a courtier i mean one who applies himself to the passions and prejudices the follies and vices of great men in order to obtain their smiles esteem and patronage and consequently their favors and preferment human nature depraved as it is has interwoven in its very frame a love of truth sincerity and integrity which must be overcome by art education and habit before the man can become entirely ductile to the will of a dishonest master when such a master requires of all who seek his favor an implicit resignation to his will and humor and these require that he be soothed flattered and assisted in his vices and follies perhaps the blackest crimes that men can commit the first thought of this will produce in a mind not yet entirely debauched a soliloquy something like my motto as if he should say— the minister of state or the governor would promote my interest would advance me to places of honor and profit would raise me to titles and dignities that will be perpetuated in my family in a word would make the fortune of me and my posterity forever if i would but comply with his desires and become his instrument to promote his measures but still i dread the consequences he requires of me such compliances such horrid crimes such a sacrifice of my honor my conscience my friends my country my god as the scriptures inform us must be punished with nothing less than hellfire eternal torment and this is so unequal a price to pay for the honors and emoluments in the power of a minister or governor that i cannot prevail upon myself to think of it the duration of future punishment terrifies me if i could but deceive myself so far as to think eternity a moment only i could comply and be promoted such as these are probably the sentiments of a mind as yet pure and undefiled in its morals and many and severe are the pangs and agonies it must undergo before it will be brought to yield entirely to temptation notwithstanding this we see every day that our imaginations     are so strong and our reason so weak the charms of wealth and power are so enchanting and the belief of future punishment so faint that men find ways to persuade themselves to believe any absurdity to submit to any prostitution rather than forego their wishes and desires their reason becomes at last an eloquent advocate on the side of their passions and they bring themselves to believe that black is white that vice is virtue that folly is wisdom and eternity a moment the brace of adamses  q is it not a pity that a brace of so obscure a breed should be the only ones to defend the household when the generous mastiffs and bestblooded hounds are all hushed to silence by the bones and crumbs that are thrown to them and even cerberus himself is bought off with a sop the malice of the court and its writers seems to be principally directed against these two gentlemen they have been steadfast and immovable in the cause of their country from the year      and one of them mr samuel adams for full twenty years before they have always since they were acquainted with each other concurred in sentiment that the liberties of this country had more to fear from one man the present governor hutchinson than from any other man nay than from all other men in the world this sentiment was founded in their knowledge of his character his unbounded ambition and his unbounded popularity this sentiment they have always freely though decently expressed in their conversation and writings which the governor well knows and which will be remembered as long as his character and administration it is not therefore at all surprising that his indignation and that of all his creatures should fall upon these gentlemen their maker has given them nerves that are delicate and of consequence their feelings are exquisite and their constitutions tender and their health especially of one of them very infirm but as a compensation for this he has been pleased to bestow upon them spirits that are unconquerable by all the art and all the     power of governor hutchinson and his political creators and creatures on both sides of the atlantic that art and power which have destroyed a thacher a mayhew an otis may destroy the health and the lives of these gentlemen but can never subdue their principles or their spirit they have not the cheering salubrious prospect of honors and emoluments before them to support them under all the indignities and affronts the insults and injuries the malice and slander that can be thrown upon men they have not even the hope of those advantages that the suffrages of the people only can bestow but they have a sense of honor and a love of their country the testimony of a good conscience and the consolation of philosophy if nothing more which will certainly support them in the cause of their country to their last gasp for breath whenever that may happen  0 monday went to boston to the court of admiralty and returned at night i went upon the first appeal that has been yet made and prosecuted before judge auchmuty and as it is a new thing the judge has directed an argument and a search of books concerning the nature of appeals by the civil law i found time to look into calvins lexicon title appellatio et provocatio and into maranta who has treated largely of appeals borrowed ayliff but there is no table and could find nothing about the subject domat i could not find  june  0 tuesday falmouth casco bay my office at boston will miss me this day it is the last day of arresting for july court what equivalent i shall meet with here is uncertain it has been my fate to be acquainted in the way of my business with a number of very rich men—gardiner bowdoin pitts hancock rowe lee sargent hooper doane hooper gardiner rowe lee and doane have all acquired their wealth by their own industry bowdoin and hancock received theirs by succession descent or devise pitts by marriage  but     there is not one of all these who derives more pleasure from his property than i do from mine my little farm and stock and cash afford me as much satisfaction as all their immense tracts extensive navigation sumptuous buildings their vast sums at interest and stocks in trade yield to them the pleasures of property arise from acquisition more than possession from what is to come rather than from what is these men feel their fortunes they feel the strength and importance which their riches give them in the world their courage and spirits are buoyed up their imaginations are inflated by them the rich are seldom remarkable for modesty ingenuity or humanity their wealth has rather a tendency to make them penurious and selfish i arrived in this town on sunday morning went to meeting all day heard mr smith and mr deane drank tea with brother bradbury and spent the evening with him at mr deanes sat in the pew with mr smith son of the minister in the morning and with william tyng  esquire sheriff

september    at boston paid dr gardiner and took up my last note to him i have now got completely through my purchase of deacon palmer colonel quincy and all my salt marsh being better than twenty acres and have paid two hundred and fifty pounds old tenor towards my house in boston and have better than three hundred pounds left in my pocket at thirtyseven years of age almost this is all that my most intense application to study and business has been able to accomplish an application that has more than once been very near costing me my life and that has so greatly impaired my health i am now writing in my own house in queen street to which i am pretty well determined to bring my family this fall if i do i shall come with a fixed resolution to meddle not with public affairs of town or province i am determined my own life and the welfare of my whole family which is much dearer to me are too great sacrifices for me to make i have served my country and her professed friends at an immense expense to me of time peace health money and preferment both of which last have courted my acceptance and been inexorably refused lest i should be laid under a temptation to forsake the sentiments of the friends of this country these last are such politicians as to bestow all their favors upon their professed and declared enemies i will devote myself wholly to my private business my office and my farm and i hope to lay a foundation for better fortune to my children and a happier life than has fallen to my share this the last training day for the year have been out to view     the

agreeable they have five sons—james now at college winslow charles henry and george five fine boys at taunton this week has been a remarkable one    monday boston the day of the month reminds me of my birthday which will be on the  0th i was born october          thirtyseven years more than half the life of man are run out what an atom an animalcule i am the remainder of my days i shall rather decline in sense spirit and activity my season for acquiring knowledge is past and yet i have my own and my childrens fortunes to make my boyish habits and airs are not yet worn off    tuesday at the printing office this morning mr otis came in with his eyes fishy and fiery looking and acting as wildly as ever he did you mr edes you john gill and you paul revere can you stand there three minutes yes well do brother adams go along with me up chamber we went he locks the door and takes out the key sit down têteàtête you are going to cambridge today yes so am i if i please i want to know if i was to come into court and ask the court if they were at leisure to hear a motion and they should say yes and i should say—may it please your honors i have heard a report and read an account that your honors are to be paid your salaries for the future by the  00 crown out of a revenue raised from us without our consent as an individual of the community as a citizen of the town as an attorney and barrister of this court i beg your honors would inform me whether that report is true and if it is whether your honors determine to accept of such an appointment or suppose the substance of this should be reduced to a written petition would this be a contempt is mere impertinence a contempt in the course of this curious conversation it oozed out that cushing adams and he had been in consultation but yesterday in the same chamber upon that subject in this chamber otis was very chatty he told me a story of colonel erving whose excellency lies he says not in military skill but in humbugging erving met parson moorhead  near his meetinghouse you have a fine steeple and bell says he to your meetinghouse now yes by the liberality of mr hancock and the subscriptions of some other gentlemen we have a very handsome and convenient house of it at last but what has happened to the vane mr moorhead it dont traverse it has pointed the same way these three weeks ay i did not know it ill see about it away goes moorhead storming among his parish and the tradesmen who had built the steeple for fastening the vane so that it could not move the tradesmen were alarmed and went to examine it but soon found that the fault was not in the vane but the weather the wind having set very constantly at east for three weeks before he also said there was a report about town that moorhead had given thanks publicly that by the generosity of mr hancock and some other gentlemen they were enabled to worship god as genteelly now as any other congregation in town after we came down stairs something was said about military matters says otis to me you will never learn military exercises ay why not that you have a head for it needs no commentary but not a heart ay how do you know you never searched my heart yes i have—tired with one years service dancing from boston to  0  braintree and from braintree to boston moping about the streets of this town as hipped as father flynt at ninety and seemingly regardless of every thing but to get money enough to carry you smoothly through this world this is the rant of mr otis concerning me and i suppose of two thirds of the town but be it known to mr otis i have been in the public cause as long as he though i was never in the general court but one year i have sacrificed as much to it as he i have never got my father chosen speaker and counsellor by it my brotherinlaw chosen into the house and chosen speaker by it nor a brotherinlaws brotherinlaw into the house and council by it nor did i ever turn about in the house betray my friends and rant it on the side of prerogative for a whole year to get a father into a probate office and a first justice of a court of common pleas and a brother into a clerks office there is a complication of malice envy and jealousy in this man in the present disordered state of his mind that is quite shocking  i thank god my mind is prepared for whatever can be said of me the storm shall blow over me in silence rode to cambridge and made a mornings visit to judge trowbridge in his solitary gloomy state he is very dull talks about retiring from court says he cannot fix his attention as he could is in doubt whether he ought to sit in a capital case lest he should omit something that is material c c was inquisitive however about politics and what the town of boston was likely to do about the judges salaries said he heard they were about to choose a committee to wait upon the court to inquire of them c c comparing this with otiss distracted proposal to me about a motion or petition i concluded that something of this kind had been talked of in town though i never heard a hint of it from any but these two trowbridge thought there never was a time when every thing was so out of joint—our general court gave cushing for a fortnights work as much as the judges for two years the ministry gave six hundred pounds  0  a year to the admiralty judges for doing no more business than the superior court did in one term though the latter had a control over the former for his part he could not look upon it in any other light than as an affront this is nearly the same that he said to colonel warren attended court all day dined with the judges c at bradishs brattle was there and was chatty fitch came in blustering when dinner was half over november    next tuesday i shall remove my family to boston after residing in braintree about nineteen months i have recovered a degree of health by this excursion into the country though i am an infirm man yet i hope i have profited by retirement and reflection and learned in what manner to live in boston how long i shall be able to stay in the city i know not if my health should again decline i must return to braintree and renounce the town entirely i hope however to be able to stay there many years to this end i must remember temperance exercise and peace of mind above all things i must avoid politics political clubs town meetings general court c c i must ride frequently to braintree to inspect my farm and when in boston must spend my evenings in my office or with my family and with as little company as possible eleven years have passed since i minuted any thing in this book  what an admirable advantage it would have been if i had recorded every step in the progress of my studies for these eleven years if i had kept an exact journal of all my journeys on the circuit of all the removes of my family my buildings purchases the gradual increase of my library and family as well as of the improvement of my mind by my studies the whole would have composed entertaining memoirs to me in my old age and to my family after my decease one thing in this book shall be a lesson to me the gentleman to whom the letter is directed  an extract of which is in the beginning of this book eleven years ago i thought the best friend i had in the world i loved him accordingly and corresponded  0  with him many years without reserve but the scene is changed at this moment i look upon him as the most bitter malicious determined and implacable enemy i have god forgive him the part he has acted both in public and private life it is not impossible that he may make the same prayer for me i am now about removing a second time from braintree to boston in april      i removed to boston to the white house in brattle square in the spring      i removed to cole lane to mr fayerweathers house in    0 i removed to another house in brattle square where dr cooper now lives in      i removed from boston to braintree in the month of april where i have lived to this time i hope i shall not have occasion to remove so often for four years and a half to come the numerous journeys and removes that i have taken in this period have put my mind into an unsettled state they have occasioned too much confusion and dissipation i hope to pass a more steady regular life for the future in all respects when i chance to meet with any of my own compositions of ten years old i am much inclined to think i could write with more accuracy and elegance then than i can now and that i had more sense and knowledge then than i have now my memory and fancy were certainly better then and my judgment i conjecture quite as good    friday this week namely last tuesday my family and goods arrived at boston where we have taken possession of my house in queen street where i hope i shall live as long as i have any connection with boston this day major martin came into the office and chatted an hour very sociably and pleasantly he says that politics are the finest study and science in the world but they are abused real patriotism or love of ones country is the greatest of moral virtues c he is a man of sense and knowledge of the world his observation upon politics is just they are the grandest the noblest the most useful and important science in the whole circle a sensible soldier is as entertaining a companion as any man whatever they acquire an urbanity by travel and promiscuous conversation that is charming this major martin has conversed familiarly in scotland in england and in america and seems to understand every subject of general conversation very well i have now got through the hurry of my business my fatherinlaw  0  mr hall and my mother are well settled in my farm at braintree the produce of my farm is all collected in my own family is removed and well settled in boston my wood and stores are laid in for the winter my workmen are nearly all paid i am disengaged from public affairs and now have nothing to do but to mind my office my clerks and my children but this week which has been so agreeable to me in the course of my own affairs has not been so happy for my friends beware of idleness luxury and all vanity folly and vice the conversation of the town and country has been about the strange occurrence of last week a piracy said to have been committed on a vessel bound to cape cod three men killed a boy missing and only one man escaped to tell the news a mysterious inexplicable affair  about wilkess probable mayoralty and about the salaries to the judges these are the three principal topics of conversation at present december    wednesday dined with the rev mr simeon howard of west boston in company with dr chauncy captain phillips dr warren mrs howard miss betsey mayhew and a young gentleman whose name i dont know had a very agreeable conversation mr howard was silent dr chauncy very sociable glories much in his inflexible adherence to rules of diet exercise study sleep c if he had not lived as regularly as the sun moves in the heavens he should long ago have mouldered to dust so as not to be distinguished from common earth never reads nor studies after eight oclock he would not for all the commissions in the gift of all the potentates upon earth become the tool of any man alive told us of his writing to england and scotland and of the politics he wrote among the rest that in twentyfive years there would be more people here than in the three kingdoms c—the greatest empire on earth our freeholds would preserve us for interest would not lie if ever he should give the charge at an ordination he would say we bishops c c he told us of mr temples keeping a fair journal of all the proceedings of the board of commissioners c and that the ministry provided for him to prevent his raising a  0  clamor captain phillips would not have got his appointment if mr temple had not been his friend c phillips says they are all still and quiet at the southward and at new york they laugh at us  0 sunday heard dr chauncy in the morning upon these words as paul reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled the doctor dilated upon the subject of pauls discourse—the great moral duties of justice and temperance as they are connected with the future judgment upon the apostles manner—he reasoned c and upon the effect that such reasoning had upon felix—it made him tremble in the afternoon dr cooper sounded harmoniously upon the deceitfulness of sin the doctors air and action are not graceful they are not natural and easy his motions with his head body and hands are a little stiff and affected his style is not simple enough for the pulpit it is too flowery too figurative his periods too much or rather too apparently rounded and labored this however sub rosâ because the doctor passes for a master of composition and is an excellent man    wednesday major martin at the office he is very gracious with the first man in the province the governor spoke very handsomely of all my counsel he did you justice c c the major is to dine with me tomorrow he wishes for war wants to be a colonel to get one thousand pounds sterling for eight or ten years that he may leave something to his children c c an ensign in the army is company for any nobleman in england a colonel in the army with one thousand pounds a year will spend an evening with an ensign who can but just live upon his pay and make him pay his club the company that the officers are obliged to keep makes them poor as bare as a scraped carrot c c the manners of these gentlemen are very engaging and agreeable took a walk this morning to the south end and had some conversation with my old friends crafts and trott  i find they are both cooled both flattened away they complain especially crafts that they are called tories c c crafts has got swifts contests and dissensions of the nobles and commons of  0  athens and rome and is making extracts from it about clodius and curio popular leaders c c my wife says her father never inculcated any maxim of behavior upon his children so often as this—never to speak ill of any body to say all the handsome things she could of persons but no evil and to make things rather than persons the subjects of conversation these rules he always impressed upon us whenever we were going abroad if it was but to spend an afternoon he was always remarkable for observing these rules in his own conversation her grandfather quincy was remarkable for never praising any body he did not often speak evil but he seldom spoke well    thursday major martin mr blowers and mr williams dined with me all agreeable this day i heard that mr hancock had purchased twenty writs for this court of mr s quincy oh the mutability of the legal commercial social political as well as material world for about three or four years i have done all mr hancocks business and have waded through wearisome anxious days and nights in his defence but farewell    tuesday spent the last sunday evening with dr cooper at his house with justice quincy and mr william cooper we were very social and we chatted at large upon cæsar cromwell c yesterday parson howard and his lady lately mrs mayhew drank tea with mrs adams heard many anecdotes from a young gentleman in my office of admiral montagues manners a coachman a jacktar before the mast would be ashamed nay a porter a shoeblack or chimney sweeper would be ashamed of the coarse low vulgar dialect of this sea officer though a rear admiral of the blue and though a second son of a genteel if not a noble family in england an american freeholder living in a log house twenty feet square without a chimney in it is a wellbred man a polite accomplished person a fine gentleman in comparison of this beast of prey this is not the language of prejudice for i have none against him but of truth his brutal hoggish manners are a disgrace to the royal navy and to the kings service his lady is very much disliked they say in general she is very full of her remarks at the assembly and concert can this lady  0  afford the jewels and dress she wears oh that ever my son should come to dance with a mantuamaker the high commission court the star chamber court the court of inquisition for the trial of the burners of the gaspee at rhode island are the present topic of conversation the governor of that colony has communicated to the assembly a letter from the earl of dartmouth  the colony are in great distress and have applied to their neighbors for advice how to evade or sustain the shock    tuesday this afternoon i had a visit from samuel pemberton esquire and mr samuel adams mr p said they were a subcommittee deputed by the standing committee of the town of boston to request that i would deliver an oration in public upon the ensuing  th of march he said that they two were desirous of it and that the whole committee was unanimously desirous of it i told them that the feeble state of my health rendered me quite willing to devote myself forever to private life that far from taking any part in public i was desirous to avoid even thinking upon public affairs and that i was determined to pursue that course and therefore that i must beg to be excused they desired to know my reasons i told them that so many irresistible syllogisms rushed into my mind and concluded decisively against it that i did not know which to mention first but i thought the reason that had hitherto actuated the town was enough namely the part i took in the trial of the soldiers though the subject of the oration was quite compatible with the verdict of the jury in that case and indeed even with the absolute innocence of the soldiers yet i found the world in general were not capable or not willing to make the distinction and therefore by making an oration upon  0  this occasion i should only expose myself to the lash of ignorant and malicious tongues on both sides of the question besides that i was too old to make declamations the gentlemen desired i would take time to consider of it i told them no that would expose me to more difficulties i wanted no time it was not a thing unthought of by me though this invitation was unexpected that i was clearly fully absolutely and unalterably determined against it and therefore that time and thinking would answer no end the gentlemen then desired that i would keep this a secret and departed  0 wednesday spent this evening with mr samuel adams at his house had much conversation about the state of affairs cushing phillips hancock hawley gerry hutchinson sewall quincy c adams was more cool genteel and agreeable than common concealed and restrained his passions c he affects to despise riches and not to dread poverty but no man is more ambitious of entertaining his friends handsomely or of making a decent an elegant appearance than he he has lately newcovered and glazed his house and painted it very neatly and has newpapered painted and furnished his rooms so that you visit at a very genteel house and are very politely received and entertained mr adams corresponds with hawley gerry and others he corresponds in england and in several of the other provinces his time is all employed in the public service    thursday this evening at mr cranchs i found that my constitutional or habitual infirmities have not entirely forsaken me mr collins an english gentleman was there and in conversation about the high commission court for inquiring after the burners of the gaspee at providence i found the old warmth heat violence acrimony bitterness sharpness of my temper and expression was not departed i said there was no more justice left in britain than there was in hell that i wished for war and that the whole bourbon family was upon the back of great britain avowed a thorough disaffection to that country wished that any thing might happen to them and as the clergy prayed of our enemies in time of war that they might be brought to reason or to ruin i cannot but reflect upon myself with severity for these rash inexperienced boyish raw and awkward expressions a man  0  who has no better government of his tongue no more command of his temper is unfit for every thing but childrens play and the company of boys a character can never be supported if it can be raised without a good a great share of selfgovernment such flights of passion such starts of imagination though they may strike a few of the fiery and inconsiderate yet they lower they sink a man with the wise they expose him to danger as well as familiarity contempt and ridicule   0 it was i believe in      that governor hutchinson in an elaborate speech to both houses endeavored to convince them their constituents and the world that parliament was our sovereign legislature and had a right to make laws for us in all cases whatsoever to lay taxes on all things external and internal on land as well as on trade the house appointed a committee to answer this speech an answer was drawn prettily written     the draught of a report was full of very popular talk and of those democratical principles which have done so much mischief in this country i objected to them all and got them all expunged which i thought exceptionable and furnished the committee with the law authorities and the legal and constitutional reasonings that are to be seen on the part of the house in that controversy how these papers would appear to me or to others at this day i know not having never seen them since their first publication but they appeared to me at that time to be correct this statement of the authorship of the most elaborate statepaper of the revolutionary controversy in massachusetts corresponds with the exception of the date which was january      with the account given by hutchinson who says mr hawley and mr samuel adams were the persons who had the greatest share in preparing it being assisted by mr john adams who was not at this time a member but whose character as a man of strong natural powers and of good knowledge in the laws was established yet—since a claim has been very confidently made in behalf of mr samuel adams and as mr webster in his celebrated eulogy of john adams and thomas jefferson incidentally notices what he denominates the singular ability of the discussion without appearing conscious of the part had in it by one of the persons of whose public services he was then speaking—it seems not irrelevant here to introduce the fullest account of the matter which the author left behind him this is found in a letter addressed by him to judge tudor on the eighth of march      in order to make way for this a portion of the same narrative found in the autobiography has been omitted as needless repetition the probability is that mr samuel adams incorporated all the legal and constitutional reasoning furnished by his namesake into the fair draught made by him as the report of the committee and that the existence of this paper in the handwriting of the former constituted the evidence upon which the claim of authorship in his behalf was advanced but—apart from the internal evidence in the paper of the mind of a jurist which samuel adams was not and over and above the subjoined   0a     narrative—there is among the papers of john adams a brief note from his kinsman which seems to set the question at rest an exact imitation of this note accompanies the present volume it was written because governor hutchinson in his reply to the house denied one of the main positions of their answer and because it became necessary that the person who had originally advanced that position should be called upon when disputed to make it good the letter to judge tudor now follows  vanity of vanities all is vanity the french have a distinction between eulogy and apology i know not under which of these heads to class the following anecdote governor hutchinson in the plenitude of his vanity and selfsufficiency thought he could convince all america and all europe that the parliament of great britain had an authority supreme sovereign absolute and uncontrollable over the colonies in all cases whatsoever in full confidence of his own influence at the opening of a session of the legislature he made a speech to both houses in which he demonstrated as he thought those mighty truths beyond all contradiction doubt or question the public stood astonished the two houses appointed committees to take into consideration the governors speech if any honest historian should ever appear he will search these records the proceedings of the council i shall leave to the historian the house appointed a committee to take into consideration the governors speech major hawley who far from assuming the character of commanderinchief of the house pretended to nothing still however insisted with the committee in private that they should invite john adams to meet with them and to take his opinion and advice upon every question so critical was the state of affairs that samuel adams john hancock thomas cushing and all their friends and associates could carry no question upon legal and constitutional subjects in the house without the countenance concurrence and support of major hawley john adams was therefore very civilly invited requested and urged to meet the committee which he did every evening till their report was finished when i first met the gentlemen they had an answer to his excellencys speech already prepared neatly and elegantly composed which i then believed had been written by samuel adams but which i have since had some reasons to suspect was drawn     at his desire and with his coöperation by my friend dr joseph warren it was full of those elementary principles of liberty equality and fraternity which have since made such a figure in the world principles which are founded in nature and eternal unchangeable truth but which must be well understood and cautiously applied it is not safe at all times and in every case to apply the ratio ultima rerum—resort to club law and the force of arms there was no answer nor attempt to answer the governors legal and constitutional arguments such as they were i found myself in a delicate situation as you may well suppose in the first place the selflove of the composer who i believed to be samuel adams having then no suspicion of warren would be hurt by garbling his infant in the second place to strike out principles which i loved as well as any of the people would be odious and unpopular we read that west would give five hundred dollars for a red lion that he painted for a sign post i poor as i am would give as much for a copy of that answer to governor hutchinson but i fear it is lost forever  it may however be hereafter found and i wish it may can i describe to you my dear tudor the state of my mind at that time i had a wife—and what a wife i had children—and what children i was determined never to accept any office place or employment from the government of great britain or its representatives governors in america on the other hand i knew here was nothing for me to depend on but popular breath which i knew to be as variable and uncertain as any one of the thirtytwo points of the compass in this situation i should have thought myself the happiest man in the world if i could have retired to my little hut and forty acres which my father left me in braintree and lived on potatoes and seaweed for the rest of my life but i had taken a part i had adopted a system i had encouraged my fellowcitizens and i could not abandon them in conscience nor in honor i determined therefore to set friends and enemies at     defiance and follow my own best judgment whatever might fall thereon to borrow a phrase from our old legal formulary we read the answer paragraph by paragraph i suggested my doubts scruples and difficulties the committee seemed to see and to feel the force of them the gentlemen condescended to ask my opinion what answer would be proper for them to report i modestly suggested to them the expediency of leaving out many of those popular and eloquent periods and of discussing the question with the governor upon principles more especially legal and constitutional the gentlemen very civilly requested me to undertake the task and i agreed to attempt it the committee met from evening to evening and i soon made my report i drew a line over the most eloquent parts of the oration they had before them and introduced those legal and historical authorities which appear on the record it is more than forty years since i have seen any one of those papers which composed that controversy and i know not how they would appear to the present generation nor indeed how they would appear to myself they stand upon record and were printed together in a pamphlet and no doubt in the newspapers they ought to be looked up for the effect of them upon public opinion was beyond expectation the governors reasoning instead of convincing the people that parliament had sovereign authority over them in all cases whatsoever seemed to convince all the world that parliament had no authority over them in any case whatsoever mr hutchinson really made a meagre figure in that dispute he had waded beyond his depth he had wholly misunderstood the legal doctrine of allegiance in all great affairs there is always something ridiculous et malheureusement jai toujours été trop incliné a saisir les ridicules i had quoted largely from a law authority which no man in massachusetts at that time had ever read hutchinson and all his law counsels were in fault they could catch no scent they dared not deny it lest the book should be produced to their confusion it was humorous enough to see how hutchinson wriggled to evade it he found nothing better to say than that it was the artificial reasoning of lord coke the book was moores reports the owner of it for alas master it was borrowed was a buyer but not a reader of books it had been mr gridleys          january the first being friday i have felt very well and been in very good spirits all day i never was happier in my whole life than i have been since i returned to boston i feel easy and composed and contented the year to come will be a pleasant a cheerful a happy and a prosperous year to me at least such are the forebodings of my mind at present my resolutions to devote myself to the pleasures the studies the business and the duties of private life are a source of ease and comfort to me that i scarcely ever experienced before peace be still my once anxious heart a head full of schemes and a heart full of anxiety are incompatible with any degree of happiness i have said above that i have the prospect before me of a happy and prosperous year and i will not retract it because i feel a great pleasure in the expectation of it and i think that there is a strong probability and presumption of it yet fire may destroy my substance diseases may desolate my family and death may put a period to my hopes and fears pleasures and pains friendships and enmities virtues and vices this evening my friend mr pemberton invited me and i went with him to spend the evening with jere wheelwright mr wheelwright is a gentleman of a liberal education about fifty years of age and constantly confined to his chamber by lameness a fortune of about two hundred pounds a year enables him to entertain his few friends very handsomely and he has them regularly at his chamber every tuesday and friday evening the speaker dr warren and mr swift were there and we six had a very pleasant evening our conversation turned upon the distress of rhode island upon the judges dependency the late numerous townmeetings upon brattles publication in drapers paper of yesterday and upon each others characters we were very free especially upon one another i told cushing as ruggles told tyler that i never knew a pendulum swing so clear warren told me that pemberton said i was the proudest and cunningest fellow he ever knew we all rallied pemberton upon the late appointment of tommy hutchinson  to be a judge of the common bench and pretended to insist upon it that he     was disappointed and had lost all his late trimming and lukewarmness and toryism warren thought i was rather a cautious man but that he could not say i ever trimmed when i spoke at all i always spoke my sentiments this was a little soothing to my proud heart no doubt brattle has published a narration of the proceedings of the town of cambridge at their late meeting and he has endeavored to deceive the world march   thursday the two last months have slided away i have written a tedious examination of brattles absurdities the governor and general court have been engaged for two months upon the greatest question ever yet agitated i stand amazed at the governor for forcing on this controversy he will not be thanked for this his ruin and destruction must spring out of it either from the ministry and parliament on one hand or from his countrymen on the other he has reduced himself to a most ridiculous state of distress he is closeting and soliciting mr bowdoin mr denny dr church c c and seems in the utmost agony the original of my controversy with brattle is worthy to be committed to writing in these memoranda at the town meeting in cambridge called to consider of the judges salaries he advanced for law that the judges by this appointment would be completely independent for that they held estates for life in their offices by common law and their nomination and appointment and he said this i aver to be law and i will maintain it against anybody i will dispute it with mr otis mr adams mr john adams i mean and mr josiah quincy i would dispute it with them here in town meeting nay i will dispute it with them in the newspapers he was so elated with that applause which this inane harangue procured him from the enemies of this country that in the next thursdays gazette he roundly advanced the same doctrine in print and the thursday after invited any gentleman to dispute with him upon his points of law these vain and frothy harangues and scribblings would have had no effect upon me if i had not seen that his ignorant doctrines were taking root in the minds of the people many of whom were in appearance if not in reality taking it for granted that the judges held their places during good behavior     upon this i determined to enter the lists and the general was very soon silenced  whether from conviction or from policy or contempt i know not it is thus that little incidents produce great events i have never known a period in which the seeds of great events have been so plentifully sown as this winter a providence is visible in that concurrence of causes which produced the debates and controversies of this winter the court of inquisition at rhode island the judges salaries the massachusetts bay town meetings  general brattles folly all conspired in a remarkable a wonderful manner my own determination had been to decline all invitations to public affairs and inquiries but brattles rude indecent and unmeaning challenge of me in particular laid me under peculiar obligations to undeceive the people and changed my resolution i hope that some good will come out of it—god knows in the year      arose a controversy concerning the independence of the judges the king had granted a salary to the judges of our superior court and forbidden them to receive their salaries as usual from the grants of the house of representatives and the council and governor as had been practised till this time this as the judges commissions were during pleasure made them entirely dependent on the crown for bread as well as office the friends of government were anxious to persuade the people that their commissions were during good behavior brigadiergeneral brattle who had been a practitioner of law and was at this time in his majestys council after some time came out with his name in one of the gazettes with a formal attempt to prove that the judges held their offices for life perhaps i should not have taken any public notice of this if it had not been industriously circulated among the people that the general had at a town meeting in cambridge the week before advanced this doctrine and challenged me by name to dispute the point with him his challenge i should have disregarded     but as his appeal to me was public if i should remain silent it would be presumed that my opinion coincided with his it was of great importance that the people should form a correct opinion on this subject and therefore i sent to the press a letter in answer which drew me on to the number of eight letters which may be seen in the boston gazette for this year the doctrine and the history of independence of judges was detailed and explained as well as my time avocations and information enabled me imperfect and unpolished as they were they were welltimed the minds of all men were awake and every thing was eagerly read by every one who could read these papers accordingly contributed to spread correct opinions concerning the importance of the independence of the judges to liberty and safety and enabled the convention of massachusetts in      to adopt them into the constitution of the commonwealth as the state of new york had done before partially and as the constitution of the united states did afterwards in      the principles developed in these papers have been very generally indeed almost universally prevalent among the people of america from that time   friday heard an oration at mr hunts  meetinghouse by dr benjamin church in commemoration of the massacre in king street three years ago that large church was filled and crowded in every pew seat alley and gallery by an audience of several thousands of people of all ages and characters and of both sexes i have reason to remember that fatal night the part i took in defence of captain preston and the soldiers procured me anxiety and obloquy enough it was however one of the most gallant generous manly and disinterested actions of my whole life and one of the best pieces of service i ever rendered my country judgment of death against those soldiers would have been as foul a stain upon this country as the executions of the quakers or witches anciently as the evidence was the verdict of the jury was exactly right this however is no reason why the town should not call the action of that night a massacre nor is it any argument in favor     of the governor or minister who caused them to be sent here but it is the strongest of proofs of the danger of standing armies    monday this afternoon received a collection of seventeen letters written from this province rhode island connecticut and new york by hutchinson oliver moffat paxton and rome in the years                 they came from england under such injunctions of secrecy—as to the person to whom they were written by whom and to whom they are sent here and as to the contents of them no copies of the whole or any part to be taken—that it is difficult to make any public use of them these curious projectors and speculators in politics will ruin this country cool thinking deliberate villain malicious and vindictive as well as ambitious and avaricious the secrecy of these epistolary genii is very remarkable profoundly secret dark and deep april   wednesday at charlestown what shall i write say do sterility vacuity barrenness of thought and reflection what news shall we hear    saturday i have communicated to mr norton quincy and to mr wibird the important secret they are as much affected by it as any others bone of our bone born and educated among us mr hancock is deeply affected is determined in conjunction with major hawley to watch the vile serpent and his deputy serpent brattle the subtlety of this serpent is equal to that of the old one aunt is let into the secret and is full of her interjections     but cushing tells me that powell told him he had it from a tory or one who was not suspected to be any thing else that certain letters were come written by four persons which would show the causes and the authors of our present grievances this tory we conjecture to be bob temple who has received a letter  in which he is informed of these things if the secret —out by this means i am glad it is not to be charged upon any of us to whom it has been committed in confidence fine gentle rain last night and this morning which will lay a foundation for a crop of grass my men at braintree have been building me a wall this week against my meadow this is all the gain that i make by my farm to repay me my great expense i get my land better secured and manured april    sunday heard dr chauncy in the morning and dr cooper this afternoon dr cooper was upon revelations xii  —and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him q whether the doctor had not some political allusions in the choice of this text may    tuesday tomorrow is our general election the plots plans schemes and machinations of this evening and night will be very numerous by the number of ministerial governmental people returned and by the secrecy of the friends of liberty relating to the grand discovery of the complete evidence of the whole mystery of iniquity i much fear the elections will go unhappily for myself i own i tremble at the thought of an election what will be expected of me what will be required of me what duties and obligations will result to me from an election what duties to my god my king my country my family my friends myself what perplexities   0 and intricacies and difficulties shall i be exposed to what snares and temptations will be thrown in my way what selfdenials and mortifications shall i be obliged to bear if i should be called in the course of providence to take a part in public life i shall act a fearless intrepid undaunted part at all hazards though it shall be my endeavor likewise to act a prudent cautious and considerate part but if i should be excused by a nonelection or by the exertions of prerogative  from engaging in public business i shall enjoy a sweet tranquillity in the pursuit of my private business in the education of my children and in a constant attention to the preservation of my health this last is the most selfish and pleasant system the first the more generous though arduous and disagreeable but i was not sent into this world to spend my days in sports diversions and pleasures i was born for business for both activity and study i have little appetite or relish for any thing else i must double and redouble my diligence i must be more constant to my office and my pen constancy accomplishes more than rapidity continual attention will do great things frugality of time is the greatest art as well as virtue this economy will produce knowledge as well as wealth spent this evening at wheelwrights with parson williams of sandwich parson lawrence of lincoln mr pemberton and swift williams took up the whole evening with stories about colonel otis and his son the major  the major

proclamation in crotchets colonel otis reads to large circles of the common people allens oration on the beauties of liberty and recommends it as an excellent production     stories of colonel otiss ignorance of law about jointtenancies criticizing upon the word householdgoods in a will of the parsons writing and saying it was a word the law knew nothing of it should have been householdstuff colonel otiss orthodoxy and yet some years ago his arguing in the strain of tindal against christianity yet some years ago otis and williams were very friendly these prejudices against otis and his family are very carefully cultivated by the tories in that county and by the judges of the superior court they generally keep sabbath there the chief justice went to spend the evening with him this year when i was at sandwich in order to keep up his spirits and fill his head with malicious stories after i got home my wife surprised me she had been to justice quincys mr hancock came in and gave before a large company of both sexes to mr cooper a particular account of all the plans of operation for tomorrow  which he and many others had been concerting cooper no doubt carried it directly to

could not proceed without the originals nor with them if there was any material obliteration or erasure though i had not examined and was not certain of this point nor did i remember whether there was any obliteration on romes and moffats letters mr dana says the falsehoods and misrepresentations in romes letters are innumerable and very flagrant spent the evening with cushing adams pemberton and

hear from us with horror you are chargeable before god and man with our blood the soldiers were but passive instruments mere machines neither moral nor voluntary agents in our destruction more than the leaden pellets with which we were wounded you was a free agent you acted coolly deliberately with all that premeditated malice not against us in particular but against the people in general which in the sight of the law is an ingredient in the composition of murder you will hear further from us hereafter chrispus attucks august    monday went this morning to mr boylstons to make a wedding visit to mr gill  and his lady a very cordial polite and friendly reception i had mr gill showed me mr boylstons garden and a large beautiful and agreeable one it is a great variety of excellent fruit plums pears peaches grapes currants c c a fig tree c     mr and mrs gill both gave me a very polite invitation to sup and spend the evening there with mr lynch and his lady which i promised to do at noon i met mr boylston upon change and he repeated the invitation in a very agreeable manner in the evening i waited on my wife there and found mr lynch  and his lady and daughter mr smith his lady and daughter and miss nabby taylor and a very agreeable evening we had mr lynch is a solid sensible though a plain man a hearty friend to america and her righteous cause his lady has the behavior and appearance of a very worthy woman and the daughter seems to be worthy of such parents  0 monday spent the evening with my wife at her uncle smiths in company with mr lynch his lady and daughter colonel howarth his sister and daughter mr edward green and his wife c the young ladies miss smith and miss lynch entertained us upon the spinet c mr lynch still maintains the character colonel howarth attracted no attention until he discovered his antipathy to a cat december    last night three cargoes of bohea tea were emptied into the sea this morning a manofwar sails this is the most magnificent movement of all  there is a dignity a majesty a sublimity in this last effort of the patriots that i greatly admire the people should never rise without doing something to be remembered something notable and striking this destruction of the tea is so bold so daring so firm intrepid and inflexible and it must have so important consequences and so lasting that i cannot but consider it as an epocha in history this however is but an attack upon property another similar exertion of popular power may produce the destruction of lives many persons wish that as many dead carcasses were floating in the harbor as there are chests of tea a much less number of lives however would remove the causes of all our calamities the malicious pleasure with which hutchinson the governor the consignees of the tea and the officers of the customs have     stood and looked upon the distresses of the people and their struggles to get the tea back to london and at last the destruction of it is amazing tis hard to believe persons so hardened and abandoned what measures will the ministry take in consequence of this will they resent it will they dare to resent it will they punish us how by quartering troops upon us by annulling our charter by laying on more duties by restraining our trade by sacrifice of individuals or how the question is whether the destruction of this tea was necessary i apprehend it was absolutely and indispensably so they could not send it back the governor admiral and collector and comptroller would not suffer it it was in their power to have saved it but in no other it could not get by the castle the menofwar c then there was no other alternative but to destroy it or let it be landed to let it be landed would be giving up the principle of taxation by parliamentary authority against which the continent has struggled for ten years it was losing all our labor for ten years and subjecting ourselves and our posterity forever to egyptian taskmasters to burthens indignities to ignominy reproach and contempt to desolation and oppression to poverty and servitude but it will be said it might have been left in the care of a committee of the town or in castle william to this many objections may be made deacon palmer and mr isaac smith dined with me and mr trumbull came in they say the tories blame the consignees as much as the whigs do and say that the governor will lose his place for not taking the tea into his protection before by means of the ships of war i suppose and the troops at the castle i saw him this morning pass my window in a chariot with the secretary and by the marching and countermarching of counsellors i suppose they have been framing a proclamation offering a reward to discover the persons their aiders abettors counsellors and consorters who were concerned in the riot last night spent the evening with cushing pemberton and swift at wheelwrights cushing gave us an account of bollans letters of the quantity of tea the east india company had on hand forty millions weight that is seven years consumption—two millions weight in america        saturday j quincy met me this morning and after him kent and told me that the governor said yesterday in council that the people had been guilty of high treason and that he would bring the attorneygeneral on monday to convince them that it was so and that hancock said he was for having a body meeting  to take off that brotherinlaw of his   in the interval between these entries in his diary that is on the twentyfifth of january      the following letter was received by mr adams thomas wilson john wilkes    september      london tavern supporters of the bill of rights london tavern    september      sir— in pursuance of a resolution of this society i am to signify to you that you have this day been duly elected a member thereof i am sir your most humble servant thomas wilson chairman signed by his order john wilkes stephen sayre    october      london london    october      sir— i have the honor of transmitting you the inclosed resolution of the society of the bill of rights which was unanimous it affords me great pleasure to find so very respectable a gentleman of america disposed to unite with the friends of liberty in england for our mutual safety and defence i am most respectfully your very obedient humble servant stephen sayre           february    i purchased of my brother my fathers homestead and house where i was born the house barn and thirtyfive acres of land of which the homestead consists and eighteen acres of pasture in the north common cost me four hundred and forty pounds this is a fine addition to what i had there before of arable and meadow the buildings and the water i wanted very much that beautiful winding meandering brook which runs through this farm always delighted me how shall i improve it shall i try to introduce fowlmeadow and herdsgrass into the meadows or still better clover and herdsgrass i must ramble over it and take a view march   wednesday last evening at wheelwrights with cushing pemberton and swift lieutenantgovernor oliver senseless and dying the governor sent for and olivers sons flucker  has laid in to be lieutenantgovernor and has persuaded hutchinson to write in his favor this will make a difficulty chief justice oliver and flucker will interfere much said of the impeachment against the chief justice and upon the question whether the council have the power of judicature in parliament which the lords have at home or whether the governor and council have this power it is said by some that the council is too precarious a body to be intrusted with so great a power so far from being independent and having their dignities and power hereditary they are annually at the will both of the house and the governor and therefore are not sufficiently independent to hold such powers of judicature over the lives and fortunes of mankind but the answer is this they may be intrusted with the powers of judicature as safely as with the powers of legislation and it should be remembered that the council can in no case here be triers of fact as well as law as the lords are at home when a peer is impeached because the council are all commoners and no more the house of representatives are the triers of the facts and their vote impeaching is equivalent to a bill of indictment and their vote demanding judgment is equivalent to a verdict of a jury according to selden are not the life and liberty and property of the subject thus guarded as secure as they ought to be when no     man can be punished without the vote of the representatives of the whole people and without the vote of the council board if he can be without the assent of the governor but it is said that there is no court of judicature in the province erected by the charter only that in the charter a power is given to the general court to erect courts that the general court has not made the governor and council a court of judicature and therefore it is not one only in cases of marriage and probate to this it may be answered by inquiring how the council came by their share in the legislative  the charter says indeed that the general court shall consist of governor council and house and that they shall make laws but it nowhere says the council shall be an integral part of this general court—that they shall have a negative voice it is only from analogy to the british legislative that they have assumed this importance in our constitution why then may they not derive from the same analogy the power of judicature about nine at night i stepped over the way and took a pipe with justice quincy and a mr wendell of portsmouth mr wendell seems a man of sense and education and not ill affected to the public cause     at this period the universal cry among the friends of their country was what shall we do to be saved it was by all agreed as the governor was entirely dependent on the crown and the council in danger of becoming so if the judges were made so too the liberties of the country would be totally lost and every man at the mercy of a few slaves of the governor but no man presumed to say what ought to be done or what could be done intimations were frequently given that this arrangement should not be submitted to i understood very well what was meant and i fully expected that if no expedient could be suggested the judges would be obliged to go where secretary oliver had gone to liberty tree and compelled to take an oath to renounce the royal salaries some of these judges were men of resolution and the chief justice  in particular piqued himself so much upon it and had so often gloried in it on the bench that i shuddered at the expectation that the mob might put on him a coat of tar and feathers if not put him to death i had a real respect for the judges three of them trowbridge cushing and brown i could call my friends oliver and ropes abstracted from their politics were amiable men and all of them were very respectable and virtuous characters i dreaded the effect upon the morals and tempers of the people which must be produced by any violence offered to the persons of those who wore the robes and bore the sacred characters of judges and moreover i felt a strong aversion to such partial and irregular recurrences to original power the poor people themselves who by secret manœuvres are excited to insurrection are seldom aware of the purposes for which they are set in motion or of the consequences which may happen to themselves and when once heated and in full career they can neither manage themselves nor be regulated by others full of these reflections i happened to dine with mr samuel winthrop at new boston who was then clerk of the superior court in company with several members of the general court of both houses and with several other gentlemen of the town     dr john winthrop philosophical professor at college and dr cooper of boston both of them very much my friends were of the company the conversation turned wholly on the topic of the day and the case of the judges all agreed that it was a fatal measure and would be the ruin of the liberties of the country but what was the remedy it seemed to be a measure that would execute itself there was no imaginable way of resisting or eluding it there was lamentation and mourning enough but no light and no hope the storm was terrible and no blue sky to be discovered i had been entirely silent and in the midst of all this gloom dr winthrop addressing himself to me said mr adams we have not heard your sentiments on this subject how do you consider it i answered that my sentiments accorded perfectly with all that had been expressed the measure had created a crisis and if it could not be defeated the liberties of the province would be lost the stroke was levelled at the essence of the constitution and nothing was too dear to be hazarded in warding it off it levelled the axe at the root and if not opposed the tree would be overthrown from the foundation it appeared so to me at that time and i have seen no reason to suspect that i was in an error to this day but said dr winthrop what can be done i answered that i knew not whether any one would approve of my opinion yet i believed there was one constitutional resource but i knew not whether it would be possible to persuade the proper authority to have recourse to it several voices at once cried out a constitutional resource what can it be i said it was nothing more nor less than an impeachment of the judges by the house of representatives before the council an impeachment why such a thing is without precedent i believed it was in this province but there had been precedents enough and by much too many in england it was a dangerous experiment at all times but it was essential to the preservation of the constitution in some cases that could be reached by no other power but that of impeachment but whence can we pretend to derive such a power from our charter which gives us in words as express as clear and as strong as the language affords all the rights and privileges of englishmen and if the house of commons in england is the grand inquest of the nation the house of representatives is the grand inquest of this province   0 and the council must have the powers of judicature of the house of lords in great britain this doctrine was said by the company to be wholly new they knew not how far it could be supported but it deserved to be considered and examined after all if it should be approved by the house the council would not convict the judges that i said was an after consideration if the house was convinced that they had the power and that it was their duty to exercise it they ought to do it and oblige the council to inquire into their rights and powers and duties if the council would not hearken to law or evidence they must be responsible for the consequences and the guilt and blame must lie at their door the company separated and i knew that the governor and the judges would soon have information of this conversation and as several members of both houses were present and several gentlemen of the town i was sensible that it would soon become the talk of the legislature as well as of the town the next day i believe major hawley came to my house and told me he heard i had broached a strange doctrine he hardly knew what an impeachment was he had never read any one and never had thought on the subject i told him he might read as many of them as he pleased there stood the state trials on the shelf which was full of them of all sorts good and bad i showed him seldens works in which is a treatise on judicature in parliament and gave it him to read i added that judicature in parliament was as ancient as common law and as parliament itself that without this high jurisdiction it was thought impossible to defend the constitution against princes and nobles and great ministers who might commit high crimes and misdemeanors which no other authority would be powerful enough to prevent or punish that our constitution was a miniature of the british that the charter had given us every power jurisdiction and right within our limits which could be claimed by the people or government of england with no other exceptions than those in the charter expressed we looked into the charter together and after a long conversation and a considerable research he said he knew not how to get rid of it in a day or two another lawyer in the house came to me full of doubts and difficulties he said he heard i had shown major hawley some books relative to the subject and desired to see them     i showed them to him and he made nearly the same comments upon them it soon became the common topic and research of the bar major hawley had a long friendship for judge trowbridge and a high opinion of his knowledge of law which was indeed extensive he determined to converse with the judge upon the subject went to cambridge on saturday and staid till monday on this visit he introduced this subject and appealed to lord coke and selden as well as to the charter and advanced all the arguments which occurred to him the judge although he had renounced the salary we may suppose was not much delighted with the subject on account of his brothers he did however declare to the major that he could not deny that the constitution had given the power to the house of representatives the charter was so full and express but that the exercise of it in this case would be vain as the council would undoubtedly acquit the judges even if they heard and tried the impeachment hawley was not so much concerned about that as he was to ascertain the law the first time i saw judge trowbridge he said to me i see mr adams you are determined to explore the constitution and bring to life all its dormant and latent powers in defence of your liberties as you understand them i answered i should be very happy if the constitution could carry us safely through all our difficulties without having recourse to higher powers not written the members of the house becoming soon convinced that there was something for them to do appointed a committee to draw up articles of impeachment against the chief justice oliver major hawley who was one of this committee would do nothing without me and insisted on bringing them to my house to examine and discuss the articles paragraph by paragraph which was readily consented to by the committee several evenings were spent in my office upon this business until very late at night one morning meeting ben gridley he said to me brother adams you keep late hours at your house as i passed it last night long after midnight i saw your street door vomit forth a crowd of senators the articles when prepared were reported to the house of representatives adopted by them and sent up to the council board the council would do nothing and there they rested     the friends of administration thought they had obtained a triumph but they were mistaken the articles were printed in the journals of the house and in the newspapers and the people meditated on them at their leisure when the superior court came to sit in boston the grand jurors and petit jurors as their names were called over refused to take the oaths when examined and demanded their reasons for this extraordinary conduct they answered to a man that the chief justice of that court stood impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors before his majestys council and they would not sit as jurors while that accusation was depending at the charlestown court the jurors unanimously refused in the same manner they did so at worcester and all the other counties the court never sat again until a new one was appointed by the council exercising the powers of a governor under the charter after the battle of lexington on the   th of april      march   saturday heard the oration pronounced by colonel hancock in commemoration of the massacre an elegant a pathetic a spirited performance a vast crowd rainy eyes c the composition the pronunciation the action all exceeded the expectations of everybody they exceeded even mine which were very considerable many of the sentiments came with great propriety from him his invective  particularly against a preference of riches to virtue came from him with a singular dignity and grace  dined at neighbor quincys with my wife mr john denny and son there denny gave a few hints of vacating the charter and sending troops and depriving the province of advantages quartering troops c but all pretty faint the happiness of the family where i dined upon account of the colonels justly applauded oration was complete the justice and his daughters were all joyous    sunday heard dr cooper in the morning paine drank coffee with me paine is under some apprehensions of troops     on account of the high proceedings he says there is a ship in today with a consignment of tea from some private merchants at home c last thursday morning march  d died andrew oliver esq lieutenantgovernor this is but the second death which has happened among the conspirators  the original conspirators against the public liberty since the conspiracy was first regularly formed and begun to be executed in      or      judge russell who was one died in      nat rogers who was not one of the originals but came in afterwards died in    0 this event will have considerable consequences—peter oliver will be made lieutenantgovernor hutchinson will go home and probably be continued governor but reside in england and peter oliver will reside here and rule the province the duty on tea will be repealed troops may come but what becomes of the poor patriots they must starve and mourn as usual the hutchinsons and olivers will rule and overbear all things as usual an event happened last friday that is surprising at a general council which was full as the general court was then sitting hutchinson had the confidence to nominate for justices of the peace george bethune nat taylor ned loyd benjamin gridley and sam barrett and informed the board that they had all promised to take the oath the council had the pusillanimity to consent by their silence at least to these nominations nothing has a more fatal tendency than such prostitution of the council they tamely supinely timorously acquiesce in the appointment of persons to fill every executive department in the province with tools of the family who are planning our destruction neighbor quincy spent the evening with me   monday this morning brought us news from south carolina of the destruction of the tea there and from england of a duel between mr temple and mr whately and mr franklins explicit declaration that he alone sent the governors letters to boston and that both temple and whately were ignorant and innocent of it and that three regiments are ordered to boston and new york that the judges opinions are required and the board of trade in motion and great things are to be laid     before parliament c c twentyeight chests of tea arrived yesterday which are to make an infusion in water at seven oclock this evening  this evening there has been an exhibition in king street of the portraits of the soldiers and the massacre and of hutchinson and c j oliver in the horrors—reminded of the fate of empson and dudley whose trunks were exposed with their heads off and the blood fresh streaming after the axe    tuesday last night twentyeight chests and a half of tea were drowned   wednesday returned from charlestown court with colonel tyng of dunstable who told me some anecdotes of bernard and brattle otis hutchinson c bernard said he never thought of pratt he would find a place for him now upon the bench brattle shall be colonel and brigadier c bernard     said afterwards this miff broke out into a blaze jemmy russell was as sociable and familiar with dix and gorham and stone and with all the members of the house as possible an artful fellow deeply covered he told a saying of the admiral at the funeral yesterday there was never any thing in turkey nor in any part of the world so arbitrary and cruel as keeping old mr clarke at the castle all this winter an old man  from his family this day the general court prorogued in anger by the governor    friday dined at charlestown with mr thomas russell with mr temple mr jacob rowe mr nichols mr bliss and several other gentlemen and ladies to me unknown no politics but mr temples duel and the pieces in the london papers relative to it a young brother of mr russell came in conversation about making porter here our barley hops c the right of private judgment and the liberty of conscience were claimed by the papists and allowed them in the reign of james ii but have been prohibited by law ever since the advocates for the administration now in america claim the right of private judgment to overthrow the constitution of this province the privileges of all america and british liberties into the bargain sed non allocatur    saturday there has been and is a party in the nation a very small one indeed who have pretended to be conscientiously persuaded that the pretender has a right to the throne their principles of loyalty hereditary right and passive obedience have led them to this judgment and opinion and as long as they keep these opinions to themselves there is no remedy against them but as soon as they express these opinions publicly and endeavor to make proselytes especially if they take any steps to introduce the pretender they become offenders and must suffer the punishment due to their crimes private judgment might be alleged in excuse for many crimes a poor enthusiast might bring himself to believe it lawful for him to steal from his rich neighbor to supply his necessities but the law will not allow of this plea the man must be punished for his theft ravaillac and felton probably thought they were     doing their duty and nothing more when they were committing their vile assassinations but the liberty of private conscience did not exempt them from the most dreadful punishment that civil authority can inflict or human nature endure hutchinson and oliver might be brought by their interested views and motives sincerely to think that an alteration in the constitution of this province and an abridgment of what are called english liberties would be for the good of the province of america and of the nation in this they deceived themselves and became the bubbles of their own avarice and ambition the rest of the world are not thus deceived they see clearly that such innovations will be the ruin not only of the colonies but of the empire and therefore think that examples ought to be made of these great offenders in terrorem the enmity of governor bernard hutchinson and oliver and others to the constitution of this province is owing to its being an obstacle to their views and designs of raising a revenue by parliamentary authority and making their own fortunes out of it the constitution of this province has enabled the people to resist their projects so effectually that they see they shall never carry them into execution while it exists their malice has therefore been directed against it and their utmost efforts have been employed to destroy it there is so much of a republican spirit among the people which has been nourished and cherished by their form of government that they never would submit to tyrants or oppressive projects the same spirit spreads like a contagion into all the other colonies into ireland and into great britain too from this single province of massachusetts bay that no pains are too great to be taken no hazards too great to be run for the destruction of our charter    sunday heard mr lathrop in the forenoon and dr cooper in the afternoon last evening justice pemberton spent with me he says that moses gill has made many justices by lending money    monday rode with brother josiah quincy to ipswich court arrived at piemonts in danvers in good order and well conditioned spent the evening and lodged agreeably walked out in the morning to hear the birds sing piemont says there is a report that the sons of liberty have received some advices from england which makes them look down that    a     they have received a letter from mr bollan that they must submit and other letters which they keep secret     tuesday rode to ipswich and put up at the old place treadwells the old lady has got a new copy of her great grandfather governor endicotts picture hung up in the house the old gentleman is afraid they will repeal the excise upon tea and then that we shall have it plenty wishes they would double the duty and then we should never have any more the question is who is to succeed judge ropes whether brown or pynchon or lee or hatch the bar here are explicit against the two last as unfit lowell says pynchon would take it because he wants to make way for wetmore who is about marrying his daughter pynchon says judge ropes was exceedingly agitated all the time of his last sickness about the public affairs in general and those of the superior court in particular afraid his renunciation would be attributed to timidity afraid to refuse to renounce worried about the opinion of the bar c mr farnham is exceedingly mollified is grown quite modest and polite in comparison with what he used to be in politics lowell is so too seems inclined to be admitted among the liberty men at a meeting of the bar a doubt of brother lowell was mentioned upon the law of the province for the relief of poor prisoners for debt questions were asked whether appealing an action was not fraud whether trading without insuring was not fraud c a question also about the duty of the sheriff whether a party plaintiff could control the kings precept c by ordering the sheriff not to serve it c mr wetmore was agreed to be recommended for the oath c  0 wednesday a dull day my head is empty but my heart is full i am wanted at my office but not wanted here there is business there but none here my wife perhaps wants to see me i am anxious about her i cannot get the thoughts of her state of health out of my mind i think she must remove to braintree and the family at least for the season    thursday let me ask my own heart have i patience and industry enough to write a history of the contest between britain and america it would be proper to begin at the treaty of peace in      or at the commencement of governor bernards administration or at the accession of george iii to     the throne the reign or the peace would not it be proper to begin with those articles in the treaty of peace which relate to america the cession of canada louisiana and florida to the english franklin lee chatham camden grenville and shelburne hillsborough dartmouth whately hutchinson oliver judge oliver bernard paxton otis thacher adams mayhew hancock cushing phillips hawley warren with many other figures would make up the group june  0 monday at piemonts in danvers bound to ipswich there is a new and a grand scene open before me a congress this will be an assembly of the wisest men upon the continent who are americans in principle that is against the taxation of americans by authority of parliament i feel myself unequal to this business a more extensive knowledge of the realm the colonies and of commerce as well as of law and policy is necessary than i am master of what can be done will it be expedient to propose an annual congress of committees to petition will it do to petition at all—to the king to the lords to the commons what will such consultations avail deliberations alone will not do we must petition or recommend to the assemblies to petition or— the ideas of the people are as various as their faces one thinks no more petitions—former having been neglected and despised some are for resolves spirited resolves and some are for bolder counsels i will keep an exact diary of my journey as well as journal of the proceedings of congress    saturday since the court adjourned without day this afternoon i have taken a long walk through the neck as they call it a fine tract of land in a general field corn rye grass interspersed in great perfection this fine season i wander alone and ponder i muse i mope i ruminate i am often in reveries and brown studies the objects before me are too grand and multifarious for my comprehension we have not men fit for the times we are deficient in genius in education in travel in fortune in every thing i feel unutterable anxiety god grant us wisdom and fortitude should the opposition be suppressed should this country submit what infamy and ruin god forbid death in any form is less terrible     extract from the autobiography it is well known that in june      the general court at cambridge  appointed members to meet with others from the other states in congress on the  th of august  mr bowdoin mr cushing mr samuel adams mr john adams and mr robert treat paine were appointed after this election i went for the tenth and last time on the eastern circuit at york at dinner with the court happening to sit at table next to mr justice sayward a representative of york but of the unpopular side we entered very sociably and pleasantly into conversation and among other things he said to me mr adams you are going to congress and great things are in agitation i recommend to you the doctrine of my former minister mr moody upon an occasion of some gloomy prospects for the country he preached a sermon from this text they know not what they do after a customary introduction he raised this doctrine from his text that in times of great difficulty and danger when men know not what to do it is the duty of a person or a people to be very careful that they do not do they know not what this oracular jingle of words which seemed however to contain   0 some good sense made us all very gay but i thought the venerable preacher when he had beat the drum ecclesiastic to animate the country to undertake the expedition to louisburg in      and had gone himself with it as a chaplain had ventured to do he knew not what as much as i was likely to do in the expedition to congress i told the deacon that i must trust providence as mr moody had done when he did his duty though he could not foresee the consequences  to prepare myself as well as i could for the storm that was coming on i removed my family to braintree they could not indeed have remained in safety in boston and when the time arrived mr bowdoin having declined the appointment mr cushing mr adams mr paine and myself set out on our journey together in one coach boston august  0 wednesday the committee for the congress  took their departure from boston from mr cushings house and rode to coolidges where they dined in company with a large number of gentlemen who went out and prepared an entertainment for them at that place a most kindly and affectionate meeting we had and about four in the afternoon we took our leave of them amidst the kind wishes and fervent     prayers of every man in the company for our health and success this scene was truly affecting beyond all description affecting  i lodged at colonel bucks    monday mr silas deane  of wethersfield came over to hartford to see us he is a gentleman of a liberal education about forty years of age first kept a school

trade and are willing to renounce all their trade mr deane gave us an account of the delegates of new york duane and jay are lawyers livingston low and alsop are merchants livingston is very popular jay married a livingston peters daughter  and is supposed to be of his side mr deane says the sense of connecticut is that the resolutions of the congress shall be the laws of the medes and persians

meetinghouse to hear the singing we were invited into mr churchs mr seymour mr payne lawyers and mr bull merchant came to see us and invited us to dine with them this day with the principal gentlemen of the place this morning mr deane and two young gentlemen messrs webbs came to see us from wethersfield mr deane says there are thirty thousand bushels of flaxseed sent to new york yearly in exchange

horses to the west indies and brings great quantities of rum as well as sugar and molasses to new york some lumber they send—staves hoops heading c there is a stream of provisions continually running

and the people men women and children were crowding at the doors and windows as if it was to see a coronation at nine oclock the cannon were fired about a dozen guns i think these expressions of respect to us are intended as demonstrations of the sympathy of this people with the massachusetts bay and its capital and to show their expectations from the congress and their determination to carry into execution whatever shall be agreed upon no governor of a province nor general of an army was ever treated with so much ceremony and assiduity as we have been throughout the whole colony of connecticut hitherto but especially all the way from hartford to new haven inclusively nothing shows to me the spirit of the town of new haven in a stronger point of light than the politeness of mr ingersoll judge of admiralty for the pennsylvanian middle district who came over with his neighbors this evening and made his compliments very respectfully to tom cushing sam adams john adams and bob paine the numbers of gentlemen who have waited on us from hartford to this place the heat of the weather and the shortness of the time have made it impossible for me to learn their names    wednesday at new haven we are told here that new york is now well united and very firm this morning roger sherman esquire one of the delegates for connecticut came to see us at the tavern isaac bearss he is between fifty and sixty a solid sensible man he said he read mr otiss rights c in      and thought that he had conceded away the rights of america he thought the reverse of the declaratory act was true namely that the parliament of great britain had authority to make laws for america in no case whatever he would have been very willing that massachusetts should have rescinded that part of their circular letter  where they allow parliament to be the supreme legislative over the colonies in any case mr jones mr douglass and several other gentlemen accompanied us to take a view of the town it is very pleasant—there are three congregational meetinghouses and one episcopal     church near together went to view the gravestone of dixwell the regicide in the buryingyard went to college and saw

odell mr smith mr sherman and a number of ladies were very genteelly entertained and spent the whole afternoon in politics the depths of politics mr douglass showed us his garden which is a very good one fine fruit and muskmelons and watermelons such as i never saw before a muskmelon seventeen inches long and a watermelon whose inside looked as if it was painted an inquiry was started who were the members of the house of commons who had plantations in the west indies and who were returned by the interest of the west india planters no one could tell none could pretend to foresee the effect of a total nonexportation to the west indies jamaica was said to be the most independent part of the world they had their plantain for bread they had vast forests and could make their own heading staves and hoops they could raise their own provisions this afternoon and evening we had a plentiful rain    thursday mr babcock is of the same mind with major hawley that a nonimportation and nonconsumption agreement will not be faithfully observed that the congress have not power to enforce obedience to their laws that they will be like a legislative without an executive we had a good deal of chat last evening with mr bears our landlord by his account the parade which was made to introduce us into town was a sudden proposal in order to divert the populace from erecting a liberty pole c ingersolls friends were at the bottom of it breakfasted at bryants in milford where there are two meetinghouses and a church we visited the buryingyard and the tomb of paines great grandfather r treat thirty

hulls a tavern the sign the bunch of grapes we rode by several very elegant country seats before we came to the city this city will be a subject of much speculation to me from hulls we went to private lodgings at mr tobias stoutenbergs in king street very near the city hall one way and the french church the other mr mcdougall and mr platt came to see us mr platt asked us to dinner next monday mr mcdougall staid longer and talked a good deal he is a very sensible man and an open one  he has none of the mean cunning which disgraces so many of my countrymen he offers to wait on us this afternoon to see the city     after dinner mr mcdougall and mr platt came and walked with us to every part of the city first we went to the fort where we saw the ruins of that magnificent building the governors house  from the parade before the fort you have a fine prospect of hudson river and of the east river or the sound and of the harbor of long island beyond the sound river and of new jersey beyond hudsons river the walk round this fort is very pleasant though the fortifications are not strong between the fort and the city is a beautiful ellipsis of land railed in with solid iron in the centre of which is a statue of his majesty on horseback very large of solid lead gilded with gold standing on a pedestal of marble very high we then walked up the broad way a fine street very wide and in a right line from one end to the other of the city in this route we saw the old church and the new church the new is a very magnificent building cost twenty thousand pounds york currency the prison is a large and a handsome stone building there are two sets of barracks we saw the new york college which is also a large stone building a new hospital is building of stone we then walked down to a shipyard where a dutch east india ship is building of eight hundred tons burthen then we walked round through another street which is the principal street of business saw the several markets after this we went to the coffeehouse which was full of gentlemen read the newspapers c here were introduced to us mr morin scott and a mr litchfield who invited us to hulls tavern where we went and staid till eleven oclock we supped together and had much conversation mr scott is a lawyer of about fifty years of age a sensible man but not very polite he is said to be one of the readiest speakers upon the continent it was he who harangued the people and prevailed upon them to discard the resolves of their committee of fiftyone as void of vigor sense and integrity  mr scott was censuring mcdougall in a friendly free way for not insisting upon choosing delegates by ballot c mr     platt said but little but mcdougall was talkative and appears to have a thorough knowledge of politics the two great families in this province upon whose motions all their politics turn are the delanceys and livingstons there is virtue and abilities as well as fortune in the livingstons but not much of either of the three in the delanceys according to him the streets of this town are vastly more regular and elegant than those in boston and the houses are more grand as well as neat they are almost all painted brick buildings and all in our walks they showed us the house of mr william smith one     of their council and the famous lawyer mr thomas smith c mr rivingtons store c    sunday went to meeting at the old presbyterian society where dr pemberton formerly preached we heard dr rogers on seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things shall be added unto you after service mr peter vanbrugh livingston and mr thomas smith came to our lodgings introduced to us by mr mcdougall mr livingston is an old man extremely staunch in the cause and very sensible he tells us that dr chandler and dr cooper and other episcopal clergymen were met together about the time of the news of the boston port bill and were employed night and day writing letters and sending despatches to the other colonies and to england this he thinks was to form an union of the episcopal party through the continent in support of ministerial measures he says they have never been able to obtain a charter for their buryingyard or the ground on which their presbyterian church stands they have solicited their governors and have solicited at home without success in the afternoon we went to the same meeting and heard mr treat from these shall go away into everlasting punishment both these clergymen are good speakers and without notes the psalmody is an exact contrast to that of hartford it is in the old way as we call it—all the drawling quavering discord in the world after meeting mr mcdougall introduced me and mr paine to mr william smith the historian of new york  a gentleman a little turned of forty a plain composed man to appearance he very politely invited us to tea at his house but we were engaged he then inquired where we lodged and said he would wait on us after meeting we went to mr mcdougalls where we saw his lady a charming woman and his daughter an agreeable miss mrs clymer was there from philadelphia who inquired very kindly after mr hancock and his aunt and mr jonathan mason and his family this is a very facetious and social lady at mr mcdougalls colonel folsom and major sullivan the delegates from new hampshire came to see us they were hastening over the ferry for     fear of the smallpox neither of them having had that distemper also mr low a relation of the delegate from new york of that name mr lamb mr hughes a schoolmaster and many others whose names i cannot recollect we then went to mr david van hornes who sent his compliments to mr mcdougall and requested him to introduce us to his house as he was sick and unable to come out he seems well affected to the public cause and speaks very sensibly about it    monday this morning we took mr mcdougall into our coach and rode three miles out of town to mr morin scotts to breakfast—a very pleasant ride mr scott has an elegant seat there with hudsons river just behind his house and a rural prospect all around him mr scott his lady and daughter and her husband mr litchfield were dressed to receive us we sat in a fine airy entry till called into a front room to breakfast a more elegant breakfast i never saw—rich plate a very large silver coffeepot a very large silver teapot napkins of the very finest materials toast and bread and butter in great perfection after breakfast a plate of beautiful peaches another of pears and another of plums and a muskmelon were placed on the table mr scott mr william smith and mr william livingston are the triumvirate who figured away in younger life against the church of england who wrote the independent reflector the watch tower and other papers  they are all of them children of yale college scott and livingston are said to be lazy smith improves every moment of his time livingston is lately removed into new jersey and is one of the delegates for that province mr scott is an eminent lawyer he drew the answer of the council to governor coldens reasons in favor of an appeal in the case of forsey vs cunningham  he is said to be one of the readiest speakers on the continent scott told me that the state of the new york claim massachusetts claim new hampshire claim and canada claim which is printed in the journal of the house in new york      to the lands contested between connecticut and hudsons river was principally drawn by mr   0 duane who has unhappily involved almost all his property in those lands he has purchased patents of government and claims of soldiers c to the amount of one hundred thousand acres mr duane is an episcopalian so are all the delegates from new york excepting mr livingston mr jay is a young gentleman of the law of about twentysix mr scott says a hard student and a good speaker mr alsop is a merchant of a good heart but unequal to the trust in point of abilities as mr scott thinks mr low the chairman of the committee of fiftyone they say will profess attachment to the cause of liberty but his sincerity is doubted mr william bayard mr mcevers and mr beech are gentlemen who were very intimate with general gage when he was here mr bayard has a son and a soninlaw in the army and a son in the service of the east india company these are connected with mr apthorp and his contracts and are lookersup to government for favors are correspondents of general gage and will favor his measures though they profess attachment to the american cause mr mcdougall gave a caution to avoid every expression here which looked like an allusion to the last appeal he says there is a powerful party here who are intimidated by fears of a civil war and they have been induced to acquiesce by assurances that there was no danger and that a peaceful cessation of commerce would effect relief another party he says are intimidated lest the levelling spirit of the new england colonies should propagate itself into new york  another party are prompted by episcopalian prejudices against new england another party are merchants largely concerned in navigation and therefore afraid of nonimportation nonconsumption and nonexportation agreements another party are those who are looking up to government for favors about eleven oclock four of the delegates for the city and county of new york came to make their compliments to us—mr duane mr livingston mr low and mr alsop mr livingston is a downright straightforward man mr alsop is a soft sweet man mr duane has a sly surveying eye a little squinteyed between forty and fortyfive i should guess very sensible i think and very artful he says their private correspondence and their     agents letters mr burke  are that the nation is against us that we cannot depend upon any support of any kind from thence that the merchants are very much against us that their pride is touched and what they call their rights by our turning away their ships from our ports a question arose whether it was a prerogative of the crown at common law to license wharves i thought it was by statutes at home which were never extended to america before the boston port bill mr duane was of my opinion mr livingston thought it was a prerogative of the crown at common law said it had been so understood here that all the public wharves in this town were by charter from the governor he questioned whether the officers of the customs were obliged to attend any wharves but licensed ones mr morin scott called upon us at our lodgings and politely insisted upon our taking a seat in his chariot to mr platts we accepted the invitation and when we came there were shown into as elegant a chamber as ever i saw—the furniture as rich and splendid as any of mr boylstons mr low mr peter vanbrugh livingston mr philip livingston dr treat a brother of the minister and mr mcdougall mr scott and mr litchfield dined with us and spent the afternoon p v livingston is a sensible man and a gentleman he has been in trade is rich and now lives upon his income phil livingston is a great rough rapid mortal there is no holding any conversation with him he blusters away says if england should turn us adrift we should instantly go to civil wars among ourselves to determine which colony should govern all the rest seems to dread new england the levelling spirit c hints were thrown out of the goths and vandals mention was made of our hanging the quakers c i told him the very existence of the colony was at that time at stake—surrounded with indians at war against whom they could not have defended the colony if the quakers had been permitted to go on    tuesday we went upon the new dutch church steeple and took a view of the city you have a very fine view of the whole city at once the harbor east river north river long island new jersey c the whole city is upon a level a flat the houses in general are smaller than in boston and the city     occupies less ground we breakfasted with mr low a gentleman of fortune and in trade his lady is a beauty rich furniture again for the tea table mr lott the treasurer of the province did us the honor to breakfast with us and politely asked us to dine or to breakfast with him but we were engaged for all the time we were to stay the conversation turned upon the constitution of the city the mayor and recorder are appointed by the governor the aldermen and common council are annually elected by the people the aldermen are the magistrates of the city and the only ones they have no justices of the peace in the city so that the magistracy of the city are all the creatures of the people the city cannot tax itself the constables assessors c are chosen annually they petition the assembly every year to be empowered by law to assess the city for a certain sum the whole charge of the province is annually between five and six thousand pounds york money mr cushing says the charge of the massachusetts is about twelve thousand lawful money which is sixteen thousand york currency the support of harvard college and of forts and garrisons and other things makes the difference about eleven oclock mr low mr curtenius mr pascall smith mr van schaack and others a deputation from the committee of correspondence from this city waited on us with an invitation to dine with them thursday next which we accepted one of the gentlemen said he was in england at the time of a former nonimportation agreement and it was not much felt among the merchants or manufacturers another of them replied the true cause of that was the german contract and the demand from russia mr ebenezer hazard waited on me with a letter requesting my assistance in making his collection of american state papers i recommended him to mr s adams and dr samuel mather i advised him to publish from hackluyt the voyage of sebastian cabot in this collection he thought it good advice hazard is certainly very capable of the business he has undertaken he is a genius went to the coffee house and saw the virginia paper the spirit of the people is prodigious their resolutions are really grand we then went to mr peter vanbrugh livingstons where at three oclock we dined with scott mcdougall philip livingston mr thomas smith and a young gentleman son of mr peter livingston     smith and young livingston seem to be modest decent and sensible men the way we have been in of breakfasting dining drinking coffee c about the city is very disagreeable on some accounts although it introduces us to the acquaintance of many respectable people here yet it hinders us from seeing the college the churches the printers offices and booksellers shops and many other things which we should choose to see with all the opulence and splendor of this city there is very little good breeding to be found we have been treated with an assiduous respect but i have not seen one real gentleman one wellbred man since i came to town at their entertainments there is no conversation that is agreeable there is no modesty no attention to one another they talk very loud very fast and altogether if they ask you a question before you can utter three words of your answer they will break out upon you again and talk away    wednesday this day cushing and paine went over to long island to dine with phil livingston adams and i sent our excuse that we were not very well it was raw and wet    thursday mr mathew cushing came and escorted us into trinity church and churchyard under the chancel of this church mr pratt was buried this is an old building we then went into saint pauls this is a new building which cost eighteen thousand pounds york money it has a piazza in front and some stone pillars which appear grand but the building taken altogether does not strike me like the stone chapel or like dr coopers meetinghouse either on the inside or outside we then went to see mr cushing work his new constructed pumps which work easier he says and convey more water than any other we then went to college were introduced to mr harper who showed us the library the books and curiosities we were then introduced to dr clossy who was exhibiting a course of experiments to his pupils to prove the elasticity of the air there is but one building at this college and that is very far from full of scholars they never have had forty scholars at a time we then made a visit of ceremony to mr william smith a counsellor at law and a counsellor by mandamus this gentleman has the character of a great lawyer a sensible and learned     man and yet a consistent unshaken friend to his country and her liberties he entertained us with an account of his negotiating between the governor colden the general gage and the people in the year      when the people attacked the fort to obtain the stamped papers in which he acted an intrepid an honest and a prudent part mr mcdougall told me of the part he acted in the affair of the prosecution of him for a libel  the governor asked him if he would not act for the crown mr smith said he would not do the dirty jobs of government he would not hold any thing under the crown upon such terms mr smith expressed his sentiments of general gage and his new station and character very freely he said he had a great personal regard for the general that he was a goodnatured peaceable and sociable man here but that he was altogether unfit for a governor of the massachusetts that he would lose all the character he had acquired as a man a gentleman and a general and dwindle down into a mere scribbling governor a mere bernard or hutchinson mr smith received us very politely we afterwards made a visit to friend holt the liberty printer and to noel and hazards we afterwards dined in the exchange chamber at the invitation of the committee of correspondence with more than fifty gentlemen at the most splendid dinner i ever saw a profusion of rich dishes c c i had a great deal of conversation with mr duane who is a sensible an artful and an insinuating man he talked of mr pratt said he had the greatest memory of any man he ever saw that he had read a great deal but that he had not a clear head one of the bar used to say that mr pratt thickened the clear that he knew mr pratt try eight criminals in a forenoon upon different indictments and with the same jury that he took no notes but summed the evidence with great exactness remembered every circumstance of every testimony and the names of all the witnesses although the witnesses were dutch people and their names such as mr pratt never could have heard after dinner the connecticut delegates came in in the evening several gentlemen came to our lodgings and among others mr sears    friday this morning we went to see the city hall the     chamber where the supreme court sits and that where the mayor and recorder sit afterwards we went down to the new dutch church which is a much more elegant building than saint pauls it is the most elegant building in the city the pillars are smaller than dr coopers and the pews are all painted but the building is not so handsome at nine oclock we crossed paulus hook ferry to new jersey then hackinsack ferry then newark ferry and dined at elizabethtown after dinner we rode twenty miles crossed brunswick ferry and put up at farmers in the city of brunswick that part of the province of new jersey which we have passed is all upon a level as fine a road as ever was trod yet the lands seem to be good    saturday went to view the city of brunswick there is a church of england a dutch church and a presbyterian church in this town there is some little trade here small craft can come up to the town we saw a few small sloops the river is very beautiful there is a stone building for barracks which is tolerably handsome it is about the size of boston jail some of the streets are paved and there are three or four handsome houses only about one hundred and fifty families in the town rode ten miles to joness where we stopped to blow our horses this whole colony of new jersey is a champaign about twelve oclock we arrived at the tavern in princeton which holds out the sign of hudibras near nassau hall college the tavern keepers name is hire the college is a stone building about as large as that at new york it stands upon rising ground and so commands a prospect of the country after dinner mr pigeon a student of nassau hall son of mr pigeon of watertown from whom we brought a letter took a walk with us and showed us the seat of mr stockton a lawyer in this place and one of the council and one of the trustees of the college as we returned we met mr euston the professor of mathematics and natural philosophy who kindly invited us to his chamber we went the college is conveniently constructed instead of entries across the building the entries are from end to end and the chambers are on each side of the entries there are such entries one above another in every story each chamber has three windows two studies with one window in each and one window between the studies to enlighten the chamber mr euston then showed us the library     it is not large but has some good books he then led us into the apparatus here we saw a most beautiful machine—an orrery or planetarium constructed by mr rittenhouse of philadelphia it exhibits almost every motion in the astronomical world the motions of the sun and all the planets with all their satellites the eclipses of the sun and moon c he showed us another orrery which exhibits the true inclination of the orbit of each of the planets to the plane of the ecliptic he then showed us the electrical apparatus which is the most complete and elegant that i have seen he charged the bottle and attempted an experiment but the state of the air was not favorable by this time the bell rang for prayers we went into the chapel the president soon came in and we attended the scholars sing as badly as the presbyterians at new york after prayers the president attended us to the balcony of the college where we have a prospect of an horizon of about eighty miles diameter we went into the presidents house and drank a glass of wine he is as high a son of liberty as any man in america he says it is necessary that the congress should raise money and employ a number of writers in the newspapers in england to explain to the public the american plea and remove the prejudices of britons he says also we should recommend it to every colony to form a society for the encouragement of protestant emigrants from the three kingdoms the doctor waited on us to our lodgings and took a dish of coffee he is one of the committee of correspondence and was upon the provincial congress for appointing delegates from this province to the general congress mr william livingston and he labored he says to procure an instruction that the tea should not be paid for livingston he says is very sincere and very able in the public cause but a bad speaker though a good writer here we saw a mr hood a lawyer of brunswick and a mr jonathan dickinson sergeant a young lawyer of princeton both cordial friends to american liberty in the evening young whitwell a student at this college son of mr whitwell at boston to whom we brought a letter came to see us by the account of whitwell and pigeon the government of this

sent a card to mr sergeant a lawyer he dined drank coffee and spent the evening with us he is a young gentleman of about twentyfive perhaps very sociable he gave us much light concerning the characters of the delegates from new york philadelphia virginia c and concerning the characters of the principal lawyers in all these provinces smith he says is the oracle of new york for chamber counsel scott is a character very much like that of old mr auchmuty sit up all night at his bottle yet argue to admiration next day an admirable speaker according to him duane is a plodding body but has a very effeminate feeble voice he says the virginians speak in raptures about richard henry lee and patrick henry one the cicero and the other the demosthenes of the age  jo reed is at the head of his profession in philadelphia fisher is next waln and dickinson have retired    monday rode to trenton upon delaware river to breakfast at williamss the tavern at trenton ferry we saw four very large black walnut trees standing in a row behind the house it seems that these trees are plenty in these southern provinces all the blackwalnut timber which is used by our cabinet makers in boston is brought from the southern provinces this town of trenton is a pretty village it appears to be the largest town that we have seen in the jerseys larger than elizabethtown brunswick or princeton we then crossed the ferry over delaware river to the province of pennsylvania we then rode across an elbow and came to the delaware again a beautiful river navigable up as far as trenton the country on each side is very level we arrived at bristol about eleven oclock—a village on the delaware opposite to which is burlington the scenes of nature are delightful here this is twenty miles from philadelphia

at taunton court from being whipped and sold for horsestealing we then went into the sickrooms which are very long large walks with rows of beds on each side and the lame and sick upon them a dreadful scene of human wretchedness the weakness and languor the distress and misery of these objects is truly a woful sight dr shippen then carried us into his chamber where he showed us a series of anatomical paintings of exquisite art here was a great variety of views of the human body whole and in parts the doctor entertained us with a very clear concise and comprehensive lecture upon all the

agreeable dinner and afternoon we had notwithstanding the violent heat we were all vastly pleased with mr lynch he is a solid firm judicious man he told us that colonel washington made the most

all the gentlemen of the congress who were arrived in town met at smiths the new city tavern and spent the evening together twentyfive members were come virginia north carolina maryland and the city of new york were not arrived mr william livingston from the jerseys lately of new york was there he is a plain man tall black wears his hair nothing elegant or genteel about him they say he is no public speaker but very sensible and learned and a ready writer mr rutledge the elder was there but his appearance is not very promising there is no keenness in his eye no depth in his countenance nothing of the profound sagacious brilliant or sparkling in his first appearance yesterday we removed our lodgings to the house of miss jane port in arch street about half way between front street and second street i find that there is a tribe of people here exactly like the tribe in the massachusetts of hutchinsonian addressers there is indeed a set in every colony we have seen the revolutions of their sentiments their opinions have undergone as many changes as the moon at the time of the stamp act and just before it they professed to be against the parliamentary claim of right to tax americans to be friends to our constitutions our charter c bernard was privately secretly endeavoring to procure an alteration of our charter but he concealed his designs until his letters were detected hutchinson professed to be a staunch friend to liberty and to our charter until his letters were detected a great number of good people thought him a good man and a sincere friend to the     congregational interest in religion and to our charter privileges they went on with this machiavelian dissimulation until those letters were detected after that they waited until the boston port bill was passed and then thinking the people must submit immediately and that lord north would carry his whole system triumphantly they threw off the mask dr smith mr galloway mr vaughan and others in this town are now just where the hutchinsonian faction were in the year      when we were endeavoring to obtain a repeal of the stamp act   friday dined at mr thomas mifflins with mr lynch mr middleton and the two rutledges with their ladies the two rutledges are good lawyers governor hopkins and governor ward were in company mr lynch gave us a sentiment the brave dantzickers who declare they will be free in the face of the greatest monarch in europe we were very sociable and happy after coffee we went to the tavern where we were introduced to peyton randolph esquire speaker of virginia colonel harrison richard henry lee esquire and colonel bland randolph is a large well looking man lee is a tall spare man bland is a learned bookish man these gentlemen from virginia appear to be the most spirited and consistent of any harrison said he would have come on foot rather than not come bland said he would have gone upon this occasion if it had been to jericho   saturday breakfasted at dr shippens dr witherspoon was there col r h lee lodges there he is a masterly man this mr lee is a brother of the sheriff of london and of dr arthur lee and of mrs shippen they are all sensible and deep thinkers lee is for making the repeal of every revenue law—the boston port bill the bill for altering the massachusetts constitution and the quebec bill and the removal of all the troops the end of the congress and an abstinence from all dutied articles the means—rum molasses sugar tea wine fruits c he is absolutely certain that the same ship which carries home the resolution will bring back the redress if we were to suppose that any time would intervene he should be for exceptions he thinks we should inform his majesty that we never can be happy while the lords bute mansfield and north are his confidants and counsellors he took his pen and attempted a calculation of the numbers of people represented by     the congress which he made about two millions two hundred thousand and of the revenue now actually raised which he made eighty thousand pounds sterling he would not allow lord north to have great abilities he had seen no symptoms of them his whole administration had been blunder he said the opposition had been so feeble and incompetent hitherto that it was time to make vigorous exertions mrs shippen is a religious and a reasoning lady she said she had often thought that the people of boston could not have behaved through their trials with so much prudence and firmness at the same time if they had not been influenced by a superior power mr lee thinks that to strike at the navigation acts would unite every man in britain against us because the kingdom could not exist without them and the advantages they derive from these regulations and restrictions of our trade are an ample compensation for all the protection they have afforded us or will afford us dr witherspoon enters with great spirit into the american cause he seems as hearty a friend as any of the natives an animated son of liberty this forenoon mr cæsar rodney of the lower counties on delaware river two mr tilghmans from maryland were introduced to us we went with mr william barrell to his store and drank punch and eat dried smoked sprats with him read the papers and our letters from boston dined with mr joseph reed the lawyer with mrs deberdt and mrs reed mr willing mr thomas smith mr dehart c spent the evening at mr mifflins with lee and harrison from virginia the two rutledges dr witherspoon dr shippen dr steptoe and another gentleman an elegant supper and we drank sentiments till eleven oclock lee and harrison were very high lee had dined with mr dickinson and drank burgundy the whole afternoon harrison gave us for a sentiment a constitutional death to the lords bute mansfield and north paine gave us may the collision of british flint and american steel produce that spark of liberty which shall illumine the latest posterity wisdom to britain and firmness to the colonies may britain be wise and america free the friends of america throughout the world union of the colonies unanimity to the congress may the result of the congress answer the expectations of the people union of britain and the     colonies on a constitutional foundation and many other such toasts young rutledge told me he studied three years at the temple he thinks this a great distinction says he took a volume of notes which j quincy transcribed says that young gentlemen ought to travel early because that freedom and ease of behavior which is so necessary cannot be acquired but in early life this rutledge is young sprightly but not deep he has the most indistinct inarticulate way of speaking speaks through his nose a wretched speaker in conversation how he will shine in public i dont yet know he seems goodnatured though conceited his lady is with him in bad health his brother still maintains the air of reserve design and cunning like duane and galloway and bob auchmuty cæsar rodney is the oddest looking man in the world he is tall thin and slender as a reed pale his face is not bigger than a large apple yet there is sense and fire spirit wit and humor in his countenance he made himself very merry with ruggles and his pretended scruples and timidities at the last congress mr reed told us at dinner that he never saw greater joy than he saw in london when the news arrived that the nonimportation agreement was broke they were universally shaking hands and congratulating each other he says that george hayley is the worst enemy to america that he knew there swore to him that he would stand by government in all its measures and was always censuring and cursing america   sunday went to the presbyterian meeting and heard mr sprout in the forenoon he uses no notes dont appear to have any opens his bible and talks away not a very numerous nor very polite assembly dined at our lodgings at mrs yards with major de bure a french gentleman a soldier mr webb and another went in the afternoon to christ church and heard mr coombe this is a more noble building and a genteeler congregation the organ and a new choir of singers were very musical mr coombe is celebrated here as a fine speaker he is sprightly has a great deal of action speaks distinctly but i confess i am not charmed with his oratory his style was indifferent his method confused in one word his composition was vastly inferior to the ordinary sermons of our how hunt chauncy cooper eliot and even stillman mr mifflin spent the sunday evening with us at our lodgings       monday at ten the delegates all met at the city tavern and walked to the carpenters hall where they took a view of the room and of the chamber where is an excellent library there is also a long entry where gentlemen may walk and a convenient chamber opposite to the library the general cry was that this was a good room and the question was put whether we were satisfied with this room and it passed in the affirmative a very few were for the negative and they were chiefly from pennsylvania and new york then mr lynch arose and said there was a gentleman present who had presided with great dignity over a very respectable society greatly to the advantage of america and he therefore proposed that the honorable peyton randolph esquire one of the delegates from virginia and the late speaker of their house of burgesses should be appointed chairman and he doubted not it would be unanimous the question was put and he was unanimously chosen mr randolph then took the chair and the commissions of the delegates were all produced and read then mr lynch proposed that mr charles thomson a gentleman of family fortune and character in this city should be appointed secretary which was accordingly done without opposition though mr duane and mr jay discovered at first an inclination to seek further mr duane then moved that a committee should be appointed to prepare regulations for this congress several gentlemen objected i then arose and asked leave of the president to request of the gentleman from new york an explanation and that he would point out some particular regulations which he had in his mind he mentioned particularly the method of voting whether it should be by colonies or by the poll or by interests mr henry then arose and said this was the first general congress which had ever happened that no former congress could be a precedent that we should have occasion for more general congresses and therefore that a precedent ought to be established now that it would be great injustice if a little colony should have the same weight in the councils of america as a great one and therefore he was for a committee      major sullivan observed that a little colony had its all at stake as well as a great one this is a question of great importance if we vote by colonies this method will be liable to great inequality and injustice for five small colonies with one hundred thousand people in each may outvote four large ones each of which has five hundred thousand inhabitants if we vote by the poll some colonies have more than their proportion of members and others have less if we vote by interests it will be attended with insuperable difficulties to ascertain the true importance of each colony is the weight of a colony to be ascertained by the number of inhabitants merely or by the amount of their trade the quantity of their exports and imports or by any compound ratio of both this will lead us into such a field of controversy as will greatly perplex us besides i question whether it is possible to ascertain at this time the numbers of our people or the value of our trade it will not do in such a case to take each others word it ought to be ascertained by authentic evidence from records the following brief notes of the discussion this day upon the method of voting are found in a separate sheet debates mr henry government is dissolved fleets and armies and the present state of things show that government is dissolved where are your landmarks your boundaries of colonies we are in a state of nature sir i did propose that a scale should be laid down that part of north america which was once massachusetts bay and that part which was once virginia ought to be considered as having a weight will not people complain ten thousand virginians have not outweighed one thousand others i will submit however i am determined to submit if i am overruled a worthy gentleman ego near me seemed to admit the necessity of obtaining a more adequate representation i hope future ages will quote our proceedings with applause it is one of the great duties of the democratical part of the constitution     to keep itself pure it is known in my province that some other colonies are not so numerous or rich as they are i am for giving all the satisfaction in my power the distinctions between virginians pennsylvanians new yorkers and new englanders are no more i am not a virginian but an american slaves are to be thrown out of the question and if the freemen can be represented according to their numbers i am satisfied  mr lynch i differ in one point from the gentleman from virginia that is in thinking that numbers only ought to determine the weight of colonies i think that property ought to be considered and that it ought to be a compound of numbers and property that should determine the weight of the colonies i think it cannot be now settled mr rutledge we have no legal authority and obedience to our determinations will only follow the reasonableness the apparent utility and necessity of the measures we adopt we have no coercive or legislative authority our constituents are bound only in honor to observe our determinations governor ward there are a great number of counties in virginia very unequal in point of wealth and numbers yet each has a right to send two members mr lee but one reason which prevails with me and that is that we are not at this time provided with proper materials i am afraid we are not mr gadsden i cant see any way of voting but by colonies colonel bland i agree with the gentleman ego who spoke near me that we are not at present provided with materials to ascertain the importance of each colony the question is whether the rights and liberties of america shall be contended for or given up to arbitrary powers mr pendleton if the committee should find themselves unable to ascertain the weight of the colonies by their numbers and property they will report this and this will lay the foundation for the congress to take some other steps to procure evidence of numbers and property at some future time mr henry i agree that authentic accounts cannot be had if by authenticity is meant attestations of officers of the crown     i go upon the supposition that government is at an end all distinctions are thrown down all america is thrown into one mass we must aim at the minutiæ of rectitude mr jay could i suppose that we came to frame an american constitution instead of endeavoring to correct the faults in an old one—i cant yet think that all government is at an end the measure of arbitrary power is not full and i think it must run over before we undertake to frame a new constitution to the virtue spirit and abilities of virginia we owe much i should always therefore from inclination as well as justice be for giving virginia its full weight i am not clear that we ought not to be bound by a majority though ever so small but i only mentioned it as a matter of danger worthy of consideration    tuesday went to congress again received by an express an intimation of the bombardment of boston  a confused account but an alarming one indeed god grant it may not be found true   wednesday went to congress again heard mr duché read prayers the collect for the day the  th of the month was most admirably adapted though this was accidental or rather providential a prayer which he gave us of his own composition was as pertinent as affectionate as sublime as devout as i ever heard offered up to heaven  he filled every bosom present      dined with mr miers fisher a young quaker and a lawyer we saw his library which is clever but this plain friend and his plain though pretty wife with her thees and thous had provided us the most costly entertainment ducks hams chickens beef pig tarts creams custards jellies fools trifles floating islands beer porter punch wine and a long c we had a large collection of lawyers at table mr andrew allen the attorneygeneral a mr morris the prothonotary mr fisher mr mckean mr rodney besides these we had mr reed governor hopkins and governor ward we had much conversation upon the practice of law in our different provinces but at last we got swallowed up in politics and the great question of parliamentary jurisdiction mr allen asks me from whence do you derive your laws how do you entitle yourselves to english privileges is not lord mansfield on the side of power   thursday attended my duty on the committee all day   0 and a most ingenious entertaining debate we had the happy news were brought us from boston that no blood had been spilled but that general gage had taken away the provincial powder from the magazine at cambridge this last was a disagreeable circumstance dined at mr powells with mr duché dr morgan dr steptoe mr goldsborough mr johnson and many others a most sinful feast again every thing which could delight the eye or allure the taste curds and creams jellies sweetmeats of various sorts twenty sorts of tarts fools trifles floating islands whipped sillabubs c c parmesan cheese punch wine porter beer c at evening we climbed up the steeple of christ church with mr reed from whence we had a clear and full view of the whole city and of delaware river debates september   in the committee for stating rights grievances and means of redress colonel lee the rights are built on a fourfold foundation on nature on the british constitution on charters and on immemorial usage the navigation act a capital violation mr jay it is necessary to recur to the law of nature and the british constitution to ascertain our rights the constitution of great britain will not apply to some of the charter rights a mother country surcharged with inhabitants they have a right to emigrate it may be said if we leave our country we cannot leave our allegiance but there is no allegiance without protection and emigrants have a right to erect what government they please mr j rutledge emigrants would not have a right to set up what constitution they please a subject could not alienate his allegiance lee cant see why we should not lay our rights upon the broadest bottom the ground of nature  our ancestors found here no government     mr pendleton consider how far we have a right to interfere with regard to the canada constitution if the majority of the people there should be pleased with the new constitution would not the people of america and of england have a right to oppose it and prevent such a constitution being established in our neighborhood lee it is contended that the crown had no right to grant such charters as it has to the colonies and therefore we shall rest our rights on a feeble foundation if we rest them only on charters nor will it weaken our objections to the canada bill mr rutledge our claims i think are well founded on the british constitution and not on the law of nature colonel dyer part of the country within the canada bill is a conquered country and part not it is said to be a rule that the king can give a conquered country what law he pleases mr jay i cant think the british constitution inseparably attached to the person of every subject whence did the constitution derive its authority from compact might not that authority be given up by compact mr william livingston a corporation cannot make a corporation charter governments have done it king cant appoint a person to make a justice of peace all governors do it therefore it will not do for america to rest wholly on the laws of england mr sherman the ministry contend that the colonies are only like corporations in england and therefore subordinate to the legislature of the kingdom the colonies not bound to the king or crown by the act of settlement but by their consent to it there is no other legislative over the colonies but their respective assemblies the colonies adopt the common law not as the common law but as the highest reason mr duane upon the whole for grounding our rights on the laws and constitution of the country from whence we sprung and charters without recurring to the law of nature because this will be a feeble support charters are compacts between the crown and the people and i think on this foundation the charter governments stand firm england is governed by a limited monarchy and free constitution privileges of englishmen were inherent their birthright     and inheritance and cannot be deprived of them without their consent objection that all the rights of englishmen will make us independent i hope a line may be drawn to obviate this objection james was against parliament interfering with the colonies in the reign of charles ii the sentiments of the crown seem to have been changed the navigation act was made massachusetts denied the authority but made a law to enforce it in the colony lee life and liberty which is necessary for the security of life cannot be given up when we enter into society mr rutledge the first emigrants could not be considered as in a state of nature they had no right to elect a new king mr jay i have always withheld my assent from the position that every subject discovering land does it for the state to which he belongs mr galloway i never could find the rights of americans in the distinction between taxation and legislation nor in the distinction between laws for revenue and for the regulation of trade i have looked for our rights in the law of nature but could not find them in a state of nature but always in a state of political society i have looked for them in the constitution of the english government and there found them we may draw them from this source securely power results from the real property of the society the states of greece macedon rome were founded on this plan none but landholders could vote in the comitia or stand for offices english constitution founded on the same principle among the saxons the landholders were obliged to attend and shared among them the power in the norman period the same when the landholders could not all attend the representatives of the freeholders came in before the reign of henry iv an attempt was made to give the tenants in capite a right to vote magna charta—archbishops bishops abbots earls and barons and tenants in capite held all the lands in england it is of the essence of the english constitution that no laws shall be binding but such as are made by the consent of the proprietors in england     how then did it stand with our ancestors when they came over here they could not be bound by any laws made by the british parliament excepting those made before i never could see any reason to allow that we are bound to any law made since nor could i ever make any distinction between the sorts of law i have ever thought we might reduce our rights to one—an exemption from all laws made by british parliament since the emigration of our ancestors it follows therefore that all the acts of parliament made since are violations of our rights these claims are all defensible upon the principles even of our enemies—lord north himself when he shall inform himself of the true principles of the constitution c i am well aware that my arguments tend to an independency of the colonies and militate against the maxims that there must be some absolute power to draw together all the wills and strength of the empire   friday attended my duty upon committees dined at home extract from the autobiography the more we conversed with the gentlemen of the country and with the members of congress the more we were encouraged to hope for a general union of the continent as the proceedings of this congress are in print i shall have occasion to say little of them a few observations may not be amiss after some days of general discussions two committees were appointed of twelve members each one from each state georgia not having yet come in the first committee was instructed to prepare a bill of rights as it was called or a declaration of the rights of the colonies the second a list of infringements or violations of those rights congress was pleased to appoint me on the first committee as the member for massachusetts it would be endless to attempt even an abridgment of the discussions in this committee which met regularly every morning for many days successively till it became an object of jealousy to all the other members of congress it was indeed very much against my judgment that the committee was so soon     appointed as i wished to hear all the great topics handled in congress at large in the first place they were very deliberately considered and debated in the committee however the two points which labored the most were   whether we should recur to the law of nature as well as to the british constitution and our american charters and grants mr galloway and mr duane were for excluding the law of nature i was very strenuous for retaining and insisting on it as a resource to which we might be driven by parliament much sooner than we were aware   the other great question was what authority we should concede to parliament whether we should deny the authority of parliament in all cases whether we should allow any authority to it in our internal affairs or whether we should allow it to regulate the trade of the empire with or without any restrictions these discussions spun into great length and nothing was decided after many fruitless essays the committee determined to appoint a subcommittee to make a draught of a set of articles that might be laid in writing before the grand committee and become the foundation of a more regular debate and final decision i was appointed on the subcommittee in which after going over the ground again a set of articles were drawn and debated one by one after several days deliberation we agreed upon all the articles excepting one and that was the authority of parliament which was indeed the essence of the whole controversy some were for a flat denial of all authority others for denying the power of taxation only some for denying internal but admitting external taxation after a multitude of motions had been made discussed negatived it seemed as if we should never agree upon any thing mr john rutledge of south carolina one of the committee addressing himself to me was pleased to say adams we must agree upon something you appear to be as familiar with the subject as any of us and i like your expressions—the necessity of the case and excluding all ideas of taxation external and internal i have a great opinion of that same idea of the necessity of the case and i am determined against all taxation for revenue come take the pen and see if you cant produce something that will unite us some others of the committee seconding mr rutledge i took a sheet of paper and drew up an article when it was read i believe not one of the committee was fully satisfied with it but they all     soon acknowledged that there was no hope of hitting on any thing in which we could all agree with more satisfaction all therefore agreed to this and upon this depended the union of the colonies the subcommittee reported their draught to the grand committee and another long debate ensued especially on this article and various changes and modifications of it were attempted but none adopted      the articles were then reported to congress and debated paragraph by paragraph the difficult article was again attacked and defended congress rejected all amendments to it and the general sense of the members was that the article demanded as little as could be demanded and conceded as much as could be conceded with safety and certainly as little as would be accepted by great britain and that the country must take its fate in     consequence of it when congress had gone through the articles i was appointed to put them into form and report a fair draught for their final acceptance this was done and they were finally accepted the committee of violations of rights reported a set of articles which were drawn by mr john sullivan of new hampshire and these two declarations the one of rights and the other of violations which are printed in the journals of congress for      were two years afterwards recapitulated in the declaration of independence on the fourth of july       0 saturday attended my duty upon the subcommittee dined at home dr morgan dr cox mr spence and several other gentlemen major sullivan and colonel folsom dined with us upon salt fish rambled in the evening with jo reed and fell into mr sprouts meeting where we heard mr spence preach mr reed returned with mr adams and me to our lodgings and a very sociable agreeable and communicative     evening we had he says we never were guilty of a more masterly stroke of policy than in moving that mr duché might read prayers it has had a very good effect c he says the sentiments of people here are growing more and more favorable every day    sunday there is such a quick and constant succession of new scenes characters persons and events turning up before me that i cant keep any regular account this mr reed is a very sensible and accomplished lawyer of an amiable disposition soft tender friendly c he is a friend to his country and to liberty mr reed was so kind as to wait on us to mr sprouts meeting where we heard mr spence these ministers all preach without notes we had an opportunity of seeing the custom of the presbyterians in administering the sacrament the communicants all come to a row of seats placed on each side of a narrow table spread in the middle of the alley reaching from the deacons seat to the front of the house three sets of persons of both sexes came in succession each new set had the bread and the cup given them by a new minister mr sprout first mr treat next and mr spence last each communicant has a token which he delivers to the deacons or elders i dont know which they call them as we came out of meeting a mr webster joined us who has just come from boston and has been a generous benefactor to it in its distresses he says he was at the town meeting and he thinks they managed their affairs with great simplicity moderation and discretion dined at mr willings who is a judge of the supreme court here with the gentlemen from virginia maryland and new york a most splendid feast again—turtle and every thing else mr willing told us a story of a lawyer here who the other day gave him upon the bench the following answer to a question why the lawyers were so increased   you ask me why lawyers so much are increased   tho most of the country already are fleeced   the reason im sure is most strikingly plain—   tho sheep are oft sheared yet the wool grows again   and tho you may think eer so odd of the matter   the oftener theyre fleeced the wool grows the better   thus downy chind boys as oft i have heard   by frequently shaving obtain a large beard     by mr peters  written at the bar and given to a judge mr willing who had asked the question at dinner in pleasantry mr willing is the most sociable agreeable man of all he told us of a law of this place that whereas oysters between the months of may and september were found to be unwholesome food if any were brought to market they should be forfeited and given to the poor we drank coffee and

   tuesday attended my duty all day on the subcommittee agreed on a report    wednesday visited mr gadsden mr deane colonel dyer c at their lodgings gadsden is violent against allowing to parliament any power of regulating trade or allowing that they have any thing to do with us power of regulating trade he says is power of ruining us as bad as acknowledging them a supreme legislative in all cases whatsoever a right of regulating trade is a right of legislation and a right of legislation in one case is a right in all this i deny attended the congress and committee all the forenoon dined with dr   0 cox dr morgan dr rush mr bayard and old mr smith dined with us dr rush lives upon water street and has from the window of his back room and chamber a fine prospect of delaware river and of

about the conduct of the bostonian merchants since the year    0 in importing tea and paying the duty mr hancock it is said has received the freight of many chests of tea i think the bostonian

inquiry in    0 the annual tax was thirteen millions last year it was only ten millions land tax malt tax perpetual funds amount to only ten millions they are compelled to raise ten millions in time of peace the emigrations from great britain prove that they are taxed as far as they can bear a total nonimportation and nonexportation to great britain and the west indies must produce a national bankruptcy in a very short space of time  the foreign trade of great britain is but four millions and a half as great a man as ever britain produced calculated the trade with the colonies at two millions i believe the importation to the colonies now represented may be three millions a nonexportation amounts to three millions more and the debt due to four millions two thirds in the colonies are clothed in british manufactures nonexportation of vastly more importance than a nonimportation it affects the merchants as well as manufacturers the trade as well as the revenue sixty thousand hogsheads of tobacco two hundred and twentyfive british ships employed     i am for a nonexportation of lumber to the west indies immediately the importance of the trade of the west indies to great britain almost exceeds calculation the sugar carries the greatest revenue the rum a great deal if you dont stop the lumber immediately you cant stop it at all if it takes place immediately they cant send home their next years crop a nonexportation at a future day cannot avail us what is the situation of boston and the massachusetts a nonexportation at the virginia day will not operate before the fall of      i would not affect the trade of the colonies to the mediterranean or other parts of the world i am for a more distant day than the first of november mr lynch we want not only redress but speedy redress the mass cant live without government i think one year nothing less than what has been proposed by the gentleman last speaking will put the colonies in the state i wish to see them in i believe the parliament would grant us immediate relief bankruptcy would be the consequence if they did not mr gadsden by saving our own liberties we shall save those of the west indies i am for being ready but i am not for the sword the only way to prevent the sword from being used is to have it ready though the virginians are tied up  i would be for doing it without them boston and new england cant hold out the country will be deluged in blood if we dont act with spirit     dont let america look at this mountain and let it bring forth a mouse mr chase we cant come into a nonexportation immediately without virginia mr cushing for a nonimportation nonexportation and nonconsumption and immediately colonel bland it has been our glory— mr hooper we make some tobacco i was instructed to protest against petitioning alone tar pitch and turpentine we can ship nowhere but to great britain the whole of the subsistence of the people in the southern ports is from naval stores great britain cannot do without naval stores from north carolina mr edward rutledge a gentleman from the other end of the room talked of generosity true equality is the only public generosity if virginia raises wheat instead of tobacco they will not suffer our rice is an enumerated commodity we shall therefore lose all our trade  i am both for nonimportation and nonexportation to take place immediately mr henry we dont mean to hurt even our rascals if we have any i move that december may be inserted instead of november mr jay negotiation suspension of commerce and war are the only three things war is by general consent to be waved at present i am for negotiation and suspension of commerce     colonel lee all considerations of interest and of equality of sacrifice should be laid aside produce of the other colonies is carried to market in the same year when it is raised even rice tobacco is not until the next year mr sullivan we export masts boards plank fish oil and some potash ships we load with lumber for the west indies and thence carry sugar to england and pay our debts that way every kind of lumber we export to the west indies our lumber is made in the winter our ships sail in january or february for the west indies colonel dyer they have now drawn the sword in order to execute their plan of subduing america and i imagine they will not sheathe it but that next summer will decide the fate of america to withdraw all commerce with great britain at once would come upon them like a thunderclap by what i heard yesterday great britain is much more in our power than i expected—the masts from the northward the naval stores from north carolina we are struggling for the liberties of the west indies and of the people of great britain as well as our own and perhaps of europe stopping the flaxseed to ireland would greatly distress them mr cushing whoever considers the present state of great britain and america must see the necessity of spirited measures great britain has drawn the sword against us and nothing prevents her sheathing it in our bowels but want of sufficient force i think it absolutely necessary to agree to a nonimportation and nonexportation immediately    wednesday dined with mr r penn a magnificent house and a most splendid feast and a very large company mr dickinson and general lee were there and mr moylan besides a great number of the delegates spent the evening at home with colonel lee colonel washington and dr shippen who came in to consult with us      debates among all the difficulties in the way of effective and united action in     —and they were far greater than the members of the congress were at the time for very obvious reasons willing to admit or than the people of the present generation who judge only from results are apt to imagine—no more alarming one happened than the plan of a proposed union between great britain and the colonies presented on the   th of september by mr joseph galloway a delegate from pennsylvania himself a gentleman of abilities of property and of extensive influence on the popular side he seems to have accepted a seat in this congress rather for the purpose of sitting on the skirts of the american advocates than of promoting any valuable end he prefaced his formidable motion with a speech of which the outline is now to be given how near he came to success may be judged not only from his own account which he afterwards gave in a pamphlet but still more from the extreme earnestness of his opponents to expunge from the record all traces of the proceedings and to discredit his statements as those of a renegade and a traitor nevertheless there is no good reason for doubting his substantial accuracy he says of the fate of his scheme— the plan read and warmly seconded by several gentlemen of the first abilities after a long debate was so far approved as to be thought worthy of further consideration and referred under a rule for that purpose by a majority of the colonies under this promising aspect of things and an expectation that the rule would have been regarded or at least that something rational would take place to reconcile our unhappy differences the member proposing it was weakly led to sign the nonimportation agreement although he had uniformly opposed it but in this he was disappointed the measures of independence and sedition were soon after preferred to those of harmony and liberty and no arguments however reasonable and just could prevail on a majority of the colonies to desert them candid examination of the mutual claims of great britain and the colonies the plan was not a new one it had been suggested to governor hutchinson and opposed by him early in the controversy though it does not appear in the journals its details were published by mr galloway himself in the pamphlet from which the preceding extract is taken and it has been inserted in its place in the republication made by mr force in the american archives of      it was defeated by the close vote of six colonies to five the mover continued nevertheless to act with the majority and he actually signed the nonimportation agreement and the address to the king but in the next year he got himself excused from further service in congress and in      he openly joined the royalist forces in new york mr galloway the proposal i intended to make having been opposed i have waited to hear a more effectual one a general nonimportation from great britain and ireland has     been adopted but i think this will be too gradual in its operation for the relief of boston a general nonexportation i have ever looked on as an undigested proposition it is impossible america can exist under a total nonexportation we in this province should have tens of thousands of people thrown upon the cold hand of charity our ships would lie by the walls our seamen would be thrown out of bread our shipwrights c out of employ and it would affect the landed interest it would weaken us in another struggle which i fear is too near to explain my plan i must state a number of facts relative to great britain and relative to america i hope no facts which i shall state will be disagreeable in the last war america was in the greatest danger of destruction this was held up by the massachusetts and by the congress in      they said we are disunited among ourselves there is no indifferent arbiter between us requisitions came over a number of the colonies gave most extensively and liberally others gave nothing or late pennsylvania gave late not for want of zeal or loyalty but owing to their disputes with proprietors their disunited state these delinquencies were handed up to the parent state and these gave occasion to the stamp act america with the greatest reason and justice complained of the stamp act had they proposed some plan of policy some negotiation been set afoot it would have terminated in the most happy harmony between the two countries they repealed the stamp act but they passed the declaratory act without some supreme legislature some common arbiter you are not say they part of the state i am as much a friend of liberty as exists and no man shall go further in point of fortune or in point of blood than the man who now addresses you burlamaqui grotius puffendorf hooker there must be a union of wills and strength distinction between a state and a multitude a state is animated by one soul as we are not within the circle of the supreme jurisdiction of the parliament we are independent states the law of great britain does not bind us in any case whatever we want the aid and assistance and protection of the arm of our mother country protection and allegiance are reciprocal     duties can we lay claim to the money and protection of great britain upon any principles of honor or conscience can we wish to become aliens to the mother state we must come upon terms with great britain some gentlemen are not for negotiation i wish i could hear some reason against it the minister must be at twenty or thirty millions expense to enforce his measures i propose this proposition the plan—two classes of laws   laws of internal policy   laws in which more than one colony are concerned—raising money for war no one act can be done without the assent of great britain no one without the assent of america a british american legislature mr duane as i mean to second this motion i think myself bound to lay before the congress my reasons new york thought it necessary to have a congress for the relief of boston and massachusetts and to do more to lay a plan for a lasting accommodation with great britain whatever may have been the motive for departing from the first plan of the congress i am unhappy that we have departed from it the postoffice act was before the year      can we expect lasting tranquillity i have given my full assent to a nonimportation and nonexportation agreement the right of regulating trade from the local circumstances of the colonies and their disconnection with each other cannot be exercised by the colonies massachusetts disputed the navigation act because not represented but made a law of their own to inforce that act virginia did the same nearly i think justice requires that we should expressly cede to parliament the right of regulating trade in the congress of      which consisted of the greatest and best men in the colonies this was considered as indispensable a civil war with america would involve a national bankruptcy colonel lee how did we go on for one hundred and sixty years before the year      we flourished and grew this plan would make such changes in the legislature of the colonies that i could not agree to it without consulting my constituents mr jay i am led to adopt this plan it is objected that this plan will alter our constitutions and therefore cannot be adopted   0 without consulting constituents does this plan give up any one liberty or interfere with any one right mr henry the original constitution of the colonies was founded on the broadest and most generous base the regulation of our trade was compensation enough for all the protection we ever experienced from her we shall liberate our constituents from a corrupt house of commons but throw them into the arms of an american legislature that may be bribed by that nation which avows in the face of the world that bribery is a part of her system of government before we are obliged to pay taxes as they do let us be as free as they let us have our trade open with all the world we are not to consent by the representatives of representatives i am inclined to think the present measures lead to war mr edward rutledge i came with an idea of getting a bill of rights and a plan of permanent relief i think the plan may be freed from almost every objection i think it almost a perfect plan mr galloway in every government patriarchal monarchial aristocratical or democratical there must be a supreme legislature i know of no american constitution a virginia constitution a pennsylvania constitution we have we are totally independent of each other every gentleman here thinks the parliament ought to have the power over trade because britain protects it and us why then will we not declare it because parliament and ministry is wicked and corrupt and will take advantage of such declaration to tax us and will also reason from this acknowledgment to further power over us answer we shall not be bound further than we acknowledge it is it not necessary that the trade of the empire should be regulated by some power or other can the empire hold together without it no who shall regulate it shall the legislature of nova scotia or georgia regulate it massachusetts or virginia pennsylvania or new york it cant be pretended our legislative powers extend no further than the limits of our governments where then shall it be placed there is a     necessity that an american legislature should be set up or else that we should give the power to parliament or king protection acquiescence massachusetts virginia advantages derived from our commerce    thursday dined at home with the delegates from north carolina and a number of other gentlemen   0 friday dined at mr jonathan smiths dr allison mr sprout and many other gentlemen      october   saturday dined with mr webster spent the evening with stephen collins went to see the election at the state house mr dickinson was chosen   sunday went to christ church and heard mr coombe upon judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment went to mr sprouts in the afternoon and heard mr tennent spent the evening at home with mr mcdougall mr cary of charlestown mr reed and colonel floyd   monday breakfasted at home with colonel dagworthy of maryland captain dagworthy his brother major de bois mr webb dr clopton c the hurry of spirits i have been in since my arrival in this city has prevented my making remarks in my journal as i wished to have done the quick succession of objects the variety of scenes and characters have rendered it impracticable major de bois says he will drink dispute this morning the congress not come to decision yet dined at home this day charles thomson and thomas mifflin were chosen burgesses for this city the change in the elections for this city and county is no small event mr dickinson and mr thomson now joined to mr mifflin will make a great weight in favor of the american cause   tuesday dined with mr alexander wilcox with all the delegates from new york and several other gentlemen this evening general lee came to my lodgings and showed me an address from the c to the people of canada which he had    wednesday dined with dr cadwallader in company with governor hamilton general lee mr henry mr pendleton mr de hart and many others spent the evening at home with mr mcdougall and mr sherman in sad and solemn consultation about the miseries and distresses of our dear town of boston   thursday dined with mr hodge fatherinlaw to mr bayard     debates the following brief and fragmentary report of a discussion upon the proposition of a nonimportation agreement has no date attached to it the probability is that it took place on or before the  th of october when the committee appointed to consider and report upon the subject were finally instructed to insert the following clause— that from and after the first day of december next no molasses coffee or pimento from the british plantations or from dominica or wines from madeira and the western islands or foreign indigo be imported into these colonies mr gadsden there are numbers of men who will risk their all i shudder at the thought of the blood which will be spilled and would be glad to avoid it mr pendleton how is the purchaser to know whether the molasses sugar or coffee has paid the duty or not it cant be known shant we by this hang out to all the world our intentions to smuggle dont we complain of these acts as grievances and shant we insist on the repeal but this will give an advantage to the west indians and will make it their interest to oppose our obtaining any redress colonel dyer this subject as every part of our deliberations is important the question is how far to extend the nonimportation of dutiable articles mr chase i am against the question before you what are the ways and means of obtaining redress in the manner it is penned it would not answer the end how shall the buyer know whether the duties have been paid or not our enemies will think that we mean to strike at the right of parliament to lay duties for the regulation of trade i am one of those who hold the position that parliament has a right to make laws for us in some cases to regulate the trade and in all cases where the good of the whole empire requires it my fears were up when we went into the consideration of a bill of rights i was afraid we should say too little or too much it is said this is not a nonimportation resolution but it is for there is no importation of goods but according to the law of the land mr lynch i came here to get redress of grievances and to     adopt every means for that end which could be adopted with a good conscience in my idea parliament has no power to regulate trade but these duties are all for revenue not for regulation of trade many gentlemen in this room know how to bring in goods sugars and others without paying duties will any gentleman say he will never purchase any goods until he is sure that they were not smuggled mr mifflin we shall agree i suppose to a nonexportation of lumber to the west indies they cannot send their sugars to england nor to america therefore they cant be benefited mr low gentlemen have been transported by their zeal into reflections upon an order of men who deserve it the least of any men in the community we ought not to deny the just rights of our mother country we have too much reason in this congress to suspect that independency is aimed at i am for a resolution against any tea dutch as well as english we ought to consider the consequences possible as well as probable of every resolution we take and provide ourselves with a retreat or a resource what would be the consequence of an adjournment of the congress for six months or a recommendation of a new election of another to meet at the end of six months is not it possible they may make it criminal as treason misprision of treason or felony or a præmunire both in the assemblies who choose and in the members who shall accept the trust would the assemblies or members be intimidated would they regard such an act will can the people bear a total interruption of the west india trade can they live without rum sugar and molasses will not this impatience and vexation defeat the measure this would cut up the revenue by the roots if wine fruit molasses and sugar were discarded as well as tea but a prohibition of all exports to the west indies will annihilate the fishery because that cannot afford to lose the west india market and this would throw a multitude of families in our fishing towns into the arms of famine     october   friday dined with mr thomas smith with a large company the virginians and others    saturday dined with mr george clymer mr dickinson and a large company again   sunday went to hear dr allison an aged gentleman it was sacrament day and he gave us a sacramental discourse this dr allison is a man of abilities and worth but i hear no preachers here like ours in boston excepting mr duché coombe indeed is a good speaker but not an original but a copy of duché the multiplicity of business and ceremonies and company that we are perpetually engaged in prevents my writing to my friends in massachusetts as i ought and prevents my recording many material things in my journal philadelphia with all its trade and wealth and regularity is not boston the morals of our people are much better their manners are more polite and agreeable they are purer english our language is better our taste is better our persons are handsomer our spirit is greater our laws are wiser our religion is superior our education is better we exceed them in every thing but in a market and in charitable public foundations went in the afternoon to the romish chapel and heard a good discourse upon the duty of parents to their children founded in justice and charity the scenery and the music are so calculated to take in mankind that i wonder the reformation ever succeeded the paintings the bells the candles the gold and silver our saviour on the cross over the altar at full length and all his wounds bleeding the chanting is exquisitely soft and sweet  0 monday the deliberations of the congress are spun out to an immeasurable length there is so much wit sense learning acuteness subtlety eloquence c among fifty gentlemen each of whom has been habituated to lead and guide in his own province that an immensity of time is spent unnecessarily johnson of maryland has a clear and a cool head an extensive knowledge of trade as well as law he is a deliberating     man but not a shining orator his passions and imagination dont appear enough for an orator his reason and penetration appear but not his rhetoric galloway duane and johnson are sensible and learned but cold speakers lee henry and hooper are the orators paca is a deliberator too chase speaks warmly mifflin is a sprightly and spirited speaker john rutledge dont exceed in learning or oratory though he is a rapid speaker young edward rutledge is young and zealous a little unsteady and injudicious but very unnatural and affected as a speaker  dyer and sherman speak often and long but very heavily and clumsily    tuesday dined with mr mckean in market street with mr reed rodney chase johnson paca dr morgan mr r penn c spent the evening with mr henry at his lodgings consulting about a petition to the king  henry said he had on public education at fifteen he read virgil and livy and has not looked into a latin book since his father left him at that age and he has been struggling through life ever since he has high notions talks about exalted minds c he has a horrid opinion of galloway jay and the rutledges their system he says would ruin the cause of america he is very impatient to see such fellows and not be at liberty to describe them in their true colors    wednesday dined with captain richards with dr coombe        thursday dined with mr dickinson with chase paca low mifflin mr penn and general lee at six oclock from ten oclock until half after four we were debating about the parliamentary power of regulating trade five colonies were for allowing it five against it and two divided among themselves that is massachusetts and rhode island mr duane has had his heart set upon asserting in our bill of rights the authority of parliament to regulate the trade of the colonies he is for grounding it on compact acquiescence necessity protection not merely on our consent    friday went in the morning to see dr chovet and his skeletons and waxworks—most admirable exquisite representations of the whole animal economy four complete skeletons a leg with all the nerves veins and arteries injected with wax two complete bodies in wax full grown waxen representations of all the muscles tendons c of the head brain heart lungs liver stomach c this exhibition is much more exquisite than that of dr shippen at the hospital the doctor reads lectures for two half joes a course which takes up four months these waxworks are all of the doctors own hands  dined with dr morgan an ingenious physician and an honest patriot he showed us some curious paintings upon silk which he brought from italy which are singular in this country and some bones of an animal of enormous size found upon the banks of the river ohio mr middleton the two rutledges mr mifflin and mr william barrell dined with us mrs morgan is a sprightly pretty lady in the evening we were invited to an interview at carpenters hall with the quakers and anabaptists mr backus is come here from middleborough with a design to apply to the congress for a redress of grievances of the antipedobaptists in our province the cases from chelmsford the case of mr white of haverhill the case of ashfield and warwick were mentioned by mr backus old israel pemberton was quite rude and his rudeness was resented but the conference which held till eleven oclock i hope will produce good     there is an anecdote which ought not to be omitted because it had consequences of some moment at the time which have continued to operate for many years and indeed are not yet worn out though the cause is forgotten or rather was never generally known governor hopkins and governor ward of rhode island came to our lodgings and said to us that president manning of rhode island college and mr backus of massachusetts were in town and had conversed with some gentlemen in philadelphia who wished to communicate to us a little business and wished we would meet them at six in the evening at carpenters hall whether they explained their affairs more particularly to any of my colleagues i know not but i had no idea of the design we all went at the hour and to my great surprise found the hall almost full of people and a great number of quakers seated at the long table with their broadbrimmed beavers on their heads we were invited to seats among them and informed that they had received complaints from some anabaptists and some friends in massachusetts against certain laws of that province restrictive of the liberty of conscience and some instances were mentioned in the general court and in the courts of justice in which friends and baptists had been grievously oppressed i know not how my colleagues felt but i own i was greatly surprised and somewhat indignant being like my friend chase of a temper naturally quick and warm at seeing our state and her delegates thus summoned before a selfcreated tribunal which was neither legal nor constitutional israel pemberton a quaker of large property and more intrigue began to speak and said that congress were here endeavoring to form a union of the colonies but there were difficulties in the way and none of more importance than liberty of conscience the laws of new england and particularly of massachusetts were inconsistent with it for they not only compelled men to pay to the building of churches and support of ministers but to go to some known religious assembly on first days c and that he and his friends were desirous of engaging us to assure them that our state would repeal all those laws and place things as they were in pennsylvania a suspicion instantly arose in my mind which i have ever     believed to have been well founded that this artful jesuit for i had been before apprized of his character was endeavoring to avail himself of this opportunity to break up the congress or at least to withdraw the quakers and the governing part of pennsylvania from us for at that time by means of a most unequal representation the quakers had a majority in their house of assembly and by consequence the whole power of the state in their hands i arose and spoke in answer to him the substance of what i said was that we had no authority to bind our constituents to any such proposals that the laws of massachusetts were the most mild and equitable establishment of religion that was known in the world if indeed they could be called an establishment that it would be in vain for us to enter into any conferences on such a subject for we knew beforehand our constituents would disavow all we could do or say for the satisfaction of those who invited us to this meeting that the people of massachusetts were as religious and conscientious as the people of pennsylvania that their consciences dictated to them that it was their duty to support those laws and therefore the very liberty of conscience which mr pemberton invoked would demand indulgence for the tender consciences of the people of massachusetts and allow them to preserve their laws that it might be depended on this was a point that could not be carried that i would not deceive them by insinuating the faintest hope for i knew they might as well turn the heavenly bodies out of their annual and diurnal courses as the people of massachusetts at the present day from their meetinghouse and sunday laws pemberton made no reply but this oh sir pray dont urge liberty of conscience in favor of such laws if i had known the particular complaints which were to be alleged and if pemberton had not broken irregularly into the midst of things it might have been better perhaps to have postponed this declaration however the gentlemen proceeded and stated the particular cases of oppression which were alleged in our general and executive courts it happened that mr cushing and mr samuel adams had been present in the general court when the petitions had been under deliberation and they explained the whole so clearly that every reasonable man must have been satisfied mr paine and i had been concerned at the bar in every action in the executive courts which was complained  00 of and we explained them all to the entire satisfaction of impartial men and showed that there had been no oppression or injustice in any of them the quakers were not generally and heartily in our cause they were jealous of independence they were then suspicious and soon afterwards became assured that the massachusetts delegates and especially john adams were advocates for that obnoxious measure and they conceived prejudices which were soon increased and artfully inflamed and are not yet worn out october    saturday dined at mr wests with the rutledges and mr middleton an elegant house rich furniture and a splendid dinner    sunday staid at home all day very busy in the necessary business of putting the proceedings of the congress into order   0 thursday dined with the whole congress at the city tavern at the invitation of the house of representatives of the province of pennsylvania the whole house dined with us making near one hundred guests in the whole a most elegant entertainment a sentiment was given may the sword of the parent never be stained

to mr cary of charlestown from her as a faithful servant of the lord no genius no orator  0  in the afternoon i went to the baptist church and heard a transalleghanian a preacher from the back parts of virginia behind the alleghany mountains he preached an hour and a half—no learning no grace of action or utterance but an honest zeal he told us several good stories one was that he was once preaching in virginia and said that those ministers who taught the people that salvation was to be obtained by good works or obedience were leading them to ruin next day he was apprehended by a warrant from a magistrate for reviling the clergy of the church of england he asked for a prayerbook and had it turned to the eighteenth or twentieth article where the same sentiment is strongly expressed he read it to the magistrate the magistrate as soon as he heard it dashed the warrant out of his hand and said sir you are discharged in the evening i went to the methodist meeting and heard mr webb the old soldier who first came to america in the character of quartermaster under general braddock he is one of the most fluent eloquent men i ever heard he reaches the imagination and touches the passions very well and expresses himself with great propriety the singing here is very sweet and soft indeed the first music i have heard in any society except the moravians and once at church with the organ supped and spent the remainder of the evening at mr jo reeds with colonel lee dr shippen mr cary dr loring c    monday in congress nibbling and quibbling as usual there is no greater mortification than to sit with half a dozen wits deliberating upon a petition address or memorial these great wits these subtle critics these refined geniuses these learned lawyers these wise

rei militari et vitæ laboriosæ  we walked to meeting above two miles at noon we walked a quarter of a mile and staid at one quintains an old irishman and a friendly cordial reception we had the old man was so rejoiced to see us he could hardly speak more glad to see us he said than he should to see gage and all his train i saw a gun the young man said that gun marched eight miles towards boston on the late alarm almost the whole parish marched off and the people seemed really disappointed when the news was contradicted   monday dined at rices of brookfield major foster came to see us and

young ladies come in and sing us the new liberty song lodged at colonel buckminsters of framingham   wednesday breakfasted at reeves of sudbury  0  upon our return to massachusetts i found myself elected by the town of braintree into the provincial congress and attended that service as long as it sat  about this time drapers paper in boston swarmed with writers and among an immense quantity of meaner productions appeared a writer under the signature of massachusettensis suspected but never that i knew ascertained to be written by two of my old friends jonathan sewall and daniel leonard  these papers were well written abounded with wit discovered good information and were conducted with a subtlety of art and address wonderfully calculated to keep up the spirits of their party to depress ours to spread intimidation and to make proselytes among those whose principles and judgment give way to their fears and these compose at least one third of mankind week after week passed away and these papers made a very visible impression on many minds no answer appeared and indeed some who were capable were too busy and others too timorous i began at length to think seriously of the consequences and began to write under the signature of novanglus and continued every week in the boston gazette till the   th of april       the last number was prevented from impression by the commencement of hostilities and mr gill gave it to judge william cushing who now has it in manuscript an abridgment of the printed numbers was made by some one in england unknown to me and published in almons remembrancer for the year      and afterwards reprinted in a pamphlet in      under the title of history of the dispute with america in new england they had the effect of an antidote to the poison of massachusettensis and the battle of lexington on the   th of april changed the instruments of warfare from the pen to the sword a few days after this event i rode to cambridge where i  0  saw general ward general heath general joseph warren and the new england army there was great confusion and much distress artillery arms clothing were wanting and a sufficient supply of provisions not easily obtained neither the officers nor men however wanted spirits or resolution i rode from thence to lexington and along the scene of action for many miles and inquired of the inhabitants the circumstances these were not calculated to diminish my ardor in the cause they on the contrary convinced me that the die was cast the rubicon passed and as lord mansfield expressed it in parliament if we did not defend ourselves they would kill us on my return home i was seized with a fever attended with alarming symptoms but the time was come to repair to philadelphia to congress which was to meet on the fifth of may i was determined to go as far as i could and instead of venturing on horseback as i had intended i got into a sulky attended by a servant on horseback and proceeded on the journey this year mr hancock was added to our number i overtook my colleagues before they reached new york  at kingsbridge we were met by a great number of gentlemen in carriages and on horseback and all the way their numbers increased till i thought the whole city was come out to meet us the same ardor was continued all the way to philadelphia  congress assembled and proceeded to business and the members appeared to me to be of one mind and that mind after my own heart i dreaded the danger of disunion and divisions among us and much more among the people it appeared to me that all petitions remonstrances and negotiations for the future would be fruitless and only occasion a loss of time and give opportunity to the enemy to sow divisions among the states and the people my heart bled for the poor people of boston imprisoned within the walls of their city by a british army and we knew not to what plunders or massacres or cruelties they might be exposed i thought the first step ought to be to recommend to the people of every state in the union  0  to seize on all the crown officers and hold them with civility humanity and generosity as hostages for the security of the people of boston and to be exchanged for them as soon as the british army would release them that we ought to recommend to the people of all the states to institute governments for themselves under their own authority and that without loss of time that we ought to declare the colonies free sovereign and independent states and then to inform great britain we were willing to enter into negotiations with them for the redress of all grievances and a restoration of harmony between the two countries upon permanent principles all this i thought might be done before we entered into any connections alliances or negotiations with foreign powers i was also for informing great britain very frankly that hitherto we were free but if the war should be continued we were determined to seek alliances with france spain and any other power of europe that would contract with us that we ought immediately to adopt the army in cambridge as a continental army to appoint a general and all other officers take upon ourselves the pay subsistence clothing armor and munitions of the troops this is a concise sketch of the plan which i thought the only reasonable one and from conversation with the members of congress i was then convinced and have been ever since convinced that it was the general sense at least of a considerable majority of that body this system of measures i publicly and privately avowed without reserve the gentlemen in pennsylvania who had been attached to the proprietary interest and owed their wealth and honors to it and the great body of the quakers had hitherto acquiesced in the measures of the colonies or at least had made no professed opposition to them many of both descriptions had declared themselves with us and had been as explicit and as ardent as we were but now these people began to see that independence was approaching they started back in some of my public harangues in which i had freely and explicitly laid open my thoughts on looking round the assembly i have seen horror terror and detestation strongly marked on the countenances of some of the members whose names i could readily recollect but as some of them have been good citizens since and others went over afterwards to the english i think it unnecessary to  0  record them here there is one gentleman however whom i must mention in selfdefence i mean john dickinson then of philadelphia now of delaware this gentleman had been appointed a member of congress by the legislature of pennsylvania about a week before the close of the congress of      and now in      made his appearance again at the opening of the congress of      in some of the earlier deliberations in may after i had reasoned at some length on my own plan mr john rutledge in more than one public speech approved of my sentiments and the other delegates from that state mr lynch mr gadsden and mr edward rutledge appeared to me to be of the same mind mr dickinson himself told me afterwards that when we first came together the balance lay with south carolina accordingly all their efforts were employed to convert the delegates from that state mr charles thomson who was then rather inclined to our side of the question told me that the quakers had intimidated mr dickinsons mother and his wife who were continually distressing him with their remonstrances his mother said to him johnny you will be hanged your estate will be forfeited and confiscated you will leave your excellent wife a widow and your charming children orphans beggars and infamous from my soul i pitied mr dickinson i made his case my own if my mother and my wife had expressed such sentiments to me i was certain that if they did not wholly unman me and make me an apostate they would make me the most miserable man alive i was very happy that my mother and my wife and my brothers my wifes father and mother and grandfather colonel john quincy and his lady mr norton quincy dr tufts mr cranch and all her near relations as well as mine had uniformly been of my mind so that i always enjoyed perfect peace at home the proprietary gentlemen israel pemberton and other principal quakers now united with mr dickinson addressed themselves with great art and assiduity to all the members of congress whom they could influence even to some of the delegates of massachusetts but most of all to the delegates from south carolina mr lynch had been an old acquaintance of the penn family particularly of the governor mr edward rutledge had brought his lady with him a daughter of our former president  0  middleton mr arthur middleton her brother was now a delegate in place of his father the lady and the gentlemen were invited to all parties and were visited perpetually by the party and we soon began to find that mr lynch mr arthur middleton and even the two rutledges began to waver and to clamor about independence mr gadsden was either from despair of success never attempted or if he was he received no impression from them i became the dread and terror and abhorrence of the party but all this i held in great contempt arthur middleton became the hero of quaker and proprietary politics in congress he had little information and less argument in rudeness and sarcasm his forte lay and he played off his artillery without reserve i made it a rule to return him a roland for every oliver so that he never got and i never lost any thing from these rencounters we soon parted never to see each other more—i believe without a spark of malice on either side for he was an honest and generous fellow with all his zeal in this cause the party made me as unpopular as they could among all their connections but i regarded none of those things i knew and lamented that many of these gentlemen of great property high in office and of good accomplishments were laying the foundation not of any injury to me but of their own ruin and it was not in my power to prevent it when the party had prepared the members of congress for their purpose and indeed had made no small impression on three of my own colleagues mr dickinson made or procured to be made a motion for a second petition to the king to be sent by mr richard penn who was then bound on a voyage to england the motion was introduced and supported by long speeches i was opposed to it of course and made an opposition to it in as long a speech as i commonly made not having ever been remarkable for very long harangues in answer to all the arguments which had been urged when i sat down mr john sullivan arose and began to argue on the same side with me in a strain of wit reasoning and fluency which although he was always fluent exceeded every thing i had ever heard from him before i was much delighted and mr dickinson very much terrified at what he said began to tremble for his cause at this moment i was called out to the state house yard very much to my regret to some one who   0 had business with me i took my hat and went out of the door of congress hall mr dickinson observed me and darted out after me he broke out upon me in a most abrupt and extraordinary manner in as violent a passion as he was capable of feeling and with an air countenance and gestures as rough and haughty as if i had been a schoolboy and he the master he vociferated what is the reason mr adams that you newenglandmen oppose our measures of reconciliation there now is sullivan in a long harangue following you in a determined opposition to our petition to the king look ye if you dont concur with us in our pacific system i and a number of us will break off from you in new england and we will carry on the opposition by ourselves in our own way  i own i was shocked with this magisterial salutation i knew of no pretensions mr dickinson had to dictate to me more than i had to catechize him i was however as it happened at that moment in a very happy temper and i answered him very coolly mr dickinson there are many things that i can very cheerfully sacrifice to harmony and even to unanimity but i am not to be threatened into an express adoption or approbation of measures which my judgment reprobates congress must judge and if they pronounce against me i must submit as if they determine against you you ought to acquiesce these were the last words which ever passed between mr dickinson and me in private we continued to debate in congress upon all questions publicly with all our usual candor and good humor but the friendship and acquaintance was lost forever by an unfortunate accident which must now be explained the more i reflected on mr dickinsons rude lecture in the state house yard the more i was vexed with it and the determination of congress in favor of the petition did not allay the irritation a young gentleman from boston mr hichborn whom i had known as a clerk in mr fitchs office but with whom i had no particular connection or acquaintance had been for some days soliciting me to give him letters to my friends in the massachusetts i was so much engaged in the business of     congress in the daytime and in consultations with the members on evenings and mornings that i could not find time to write a line he came to me at last and said he was immediately to set off on his journey home and begged i would give him some letters i told him i had not been able to write any he prayed i would write if it were only a line to my family for he said as he had served his clerkship with mr fitch he was suspected and represented as a tory and this reputation would be his ruin if it could not be corrected for nobody would employ him at the bar if i would only give him the slightest letters to any of my friends it would give him the appearance of having my confidence and would assist him in acquiring what he truly deserved the character of a whig to get rid of his importunity i took my pen and wrote a very few lines to my wife and about an equal number to general james warren irritated with the unpoliteness of mr dickinson and more mortified with his success in congress i wrote something like what has been published but not exactly the british printers made it worse than it was in the original  mr hichborn was intercepted     in crossing hudsons river by the boats from a british manofwar and my letters instead of being destroyed fell into the hands of the enemy and were immediately printed with a little garbling they thought them a great prize the ideas of independence to be sure were glaring enough and they thought they should produce quarrels among the members of congress and a division of the colonies me they expected utterly to ruin because as they represented i had explicitly avowed my designs of independence i cared nothing for this i had made no secret in or out of congress of my opinion that independence was become indispensable and i was perfectly sure that in a little time the whole continent would be of my mind i rather rejoiced in this as a fortunate circumstance that the idea was held up to the whole world and that the people could not avoid contemplating it and reasoning about it accordingly from this time at least if not earlier and not from the publication of common sense did the people in all parts of the continent turn their attention to this subject it was i know considered in the same light by others i met colonel     reed soon afterwards who was then general washingtons secretary who mentioned those letters to me and said that providence seemed to have thrown those letters before the public for our good for independence was certainly inevitable and it was happy that the whole country had been compelled to turn their thoughts upon it that it might not come upon them presently by surprise  there were a few expressions which hurt me when i found the enemy either misunderstood them or wilfully misrepresented them the expressions were will your judiciary whip and hang without scruple this they construed to mean to excite cruelty against the tories and get some of them punished with severity nothing was further from my thoughts i had no reference to tories in this but as the exercise of judicial power without authority from the crown would be probably the most offensive act of government to great britain and the least willingly pardoned my question meant no more than—will your judges have fortitude enough to inflict the severe punishments when necessary as death upon murderers and other capital criminals and flagellation upon such as deserve it nothing could be more false and injurious to me than the imputation of any sanguinary zeal against the tories for i can truly declare that through the whole revolution and from that time to this i never committed one act of severity against the tories on the contrary i was a constant advocate for all the mercy and indulgence consistent with our safety some acts of treachery as well as hostility were combined together in so atrocious a manner that pardon could not be indulged but as it happened in none of these had i any particular concern in a very short time after the publication of these letters i received one from general charles lee then in the army in the neighborhood of boston in which after expressing the most obliging sentiments of my character he said some gentlemen had hinted to him that i might possibly apprehend that he would take offence at them but he assured me he was highly pleased with what was said of him in them the acknowledgment from me that he was a soldier and a scholar he esteemed as an honor done to him and as to his attachment to his dogs     when he should discover in men as much fidelity honesty and gratitude as he daily experienced in his dogs he promised to love men as well as dogs accordingly the cordiality between him and me continued till his death      this measure of imbecility the second petition to the king embarrassed every exertion of congress it occasioned motions and debates without end for appointing committees to draw up a declaration of the causes motives and objects of taking arms with a view to obtain decisive declarations against independence c in the mean time the new england army investing boston the new england legislatures congresses and conventions and the whole body of the people were left without munitions of war without arms clothing pay or even countenance and encouragement every post brought me letters from my friends dr winthrop dr cooper general james warren and sometimes from general ward and his aids and general heath and many others urging in pathetic terms the impossibility of keeping their men together without the assistance of congress i was daily urging all these things but we were embarrassed with more than one difficulty not only with the party in favor of the petition to the king and the party who were jealous of independence but a third party which was a southern party against a northern and a jealousy against a new england army under the command of a new england general whether this jealousy was sincere or whether it was mere pride and a haughty ambition of furnishing a southern general to command the northern army i cannot say but the intention was very visible to me that colonel washington was their object and so many of our staunchest men were in the plan that we could carry nothing without conceding to it another embarrassment which was never publicly known and which was carefully concealed by those who knew it the massachusetts and other new england delegates were divided mr hancock and mr cushing hung back mr paine did not come forward and even mr samuel adams was irresolute mr hancock himself had an     ambition to be appointed commanderinchief  whether he thought an election a compliment due to him and intended to have the honor of declining it or whether he would have accepted i know not to the compliment he had some pretensions for at that time his exertions sacrifices and general merits in the cause of his country had been incomparably greater than those of colonel washington but the delicacy of his health and his entire want of experience in actual service though an excellent militia officer were decisive objections to him in my mind in canvassing this subject out of doors i found too that even among the delegates of virginia there were difficulties the apostolical reasonings among themselves which should be greatest were not less energetic among the saints of the ancient dominion than they were among us of new england in several conversations i found more than one very cool about the appointment of washington and particularly mr pendleton was very clear and full against it full of anxieties concerning these confusions and apprehending daily that we should hear very distressing news from boston i walked with mr samuel adams in the state house yard for a little exercise and fresh air before the hour of congress and there represented to him the various dangers that surrounded us he agreed to them all but said what shall we do i answered him that he knew i had taken great pains to get our colleagues to agree upon some plan that we might be unanimous but he knew that they would pledge themselves to nothing but i was determined to take a step which should compel them and all the other members of congress to declare themselves for or against something i am determined this morning to make a direct motion that congress should adopt the army before boston and appoint colonel washington commander of it mr adams seemed to think very seriously of it but said nothing accordingly when congress had assembled i rose in my place and in as short a speech as the subject would admit     represented the state of the colonies the uncertainty in the minds of the people their great expectation and anxiety the distresses of the army the danger of its dissolution the difficulty of collecting another and the probability that the british army would take advantage of our delays march out of boston and spread desolation as far as they could go i concluded with a motion in form that congress would adopt the army at cambridge and appoint a general that though this was not the proper time to nominate a general yet as i had reason to believe this was a point of the greatest difficulty i had no hesitation to declare that i had but one gentleman in my mind for that important command and that was a gentleman from virginia who was among us and very well known to all of us a gentleman whose skill and experience as an officer whose independent fortune great talents and excellent universal character would command the approbation of all america and unite the cordial exertions of all the colonies better than any other person in the union mr washington who happened to sit near the door as soon as he heard me allude to him from his usual modesty darted into the libraryroom mr hancock—who was our president which gave me an opportunity to observe his countenance while i was speaking on the state of the colonies the army at cambridge and the enemy—heard me with visible pleasure but when i came to describe washington for the commander i never remarked a more sudden and striking change of countenance mortification and resentment were expressed as forcibly as his face could exhibit them mr samuel adams seconded the motion and that did not soften the presidents physiognomy at all  the subject came under debate and several gentlemen declared themselves against the appointment of mr washington not on account of any personal objection against him but because the army were all from new england had a general of their own appeared to be satisfied with him and had proved themselves able to imprison the british army in boston which was all they expected or desired at that time     mr pendleton of virginia mr sherman of connecticut were very explicit in declaring this opinion mr cushing and several others more faintly expressed their opposition and their fears of discontents in the army and in new england mr paine expressed a great opinion of general ward and a strong friendship for him having been his classmate at college or at least his contemporary but gave no opinion upon the question the subject was postponed to a future day in the mean time pains were taken out of doors to obtain a unanimity and the voices were generally so clearly in favor of washington that the dissentient members were persuaded to withdraw their opposition and mr washington was nominated i believe by mr thomas johnson of maryland unanimously elected and the army adopted the next question was who should be the second officer general lee was nominated and most strenuously urged by many particularly mr mifflin who said that general lee would serve cheerfully under washington but considering his rank character and experience could not be expected to serve under any other that lee must be aut secundus aut nullus to this i as strenuously objected that it would be a great deal to expect of general ward that he should serve under any man but that under a stranger he ought not to serve that though i had as high an opinion of general lees learning general information and especially of his science and experience in war i could not advise general ward to humiliate himself and his country so far as to serve under him general ward was elected the second and lee the third  gates and mifflin i believe had some appointments and general washington took with him mr reed of philadelphia a lawyer of some eminence for his private secretary and the gentlemen all set off for the camp they had not proceeded twenty miles from philadelphia before they met a courier with the news of the battle of bunkers hill the death of general warren the slaughter among the british officers and men as well as among ours and the burning of charlestown     i have always imputed the loss of charlestown and of the brave officers and men who fell there and the loss of a hero of more worth than all the town i mean general warren to mr dickinsons petition to the king and the loss of quebec and montgomery to his subsequent unceasing though finally unavailing efforts against independence these impeded and paralyzed all our enterprises had our army been acknowledged in season which acknowledgment ought to have been our first step and the measures taken to comfort and encourage it which ought to have been taken by congress we should not have lost charlestown and if every measure for the service in canada from the first projection of it to the final loss of the province had not been opposed and obstinately disputed by the same party so that we could finally carry no measure but by a bare majority—  and every measure was delayed till it became ineffectual in the fall of the year congress was much fatigued with the incessant labors debates intrigues and heats of the summer and agreed on a short adjournment the delegates from massachusetts returned home and as the two houses of the legislature had chosen us all into the council we went to watertown and took our seats for such times as we could spare before our return to congress i had been chosen before two years successively that is in      and      and had been negatived by the governor the first time by hutchinson and the second by gage my friend dr cooper attempted to console me under the first negative which he called a check but i told him i considered it not as a check but as a boost a word of john bunyan which the doctor understood these negatives were indeed no mortification to me for knowing that neither honor nor profit was to be obtained nor good to be done in that body in those times i had not a wish to sit there when a person came running to my office to tell me of the first of them i cried out laughing now i believe in my soul i am a clever fellow since i have the attestation of the three branches of the legislature this vulgar familiar little sally was caught as if it had been a prize and immediately scattered all over the province i went to headquarters and had much conversation with   0 generals washington ward lee putnam gates mifflin and others and went with general lee to visit the outposts and the sentinels nearest the enemy at charlestown here lee found his dogs inconvenient for they were so attached to him that they insisted on keeping close about him and he expected he should be known by them to the british officers in the fort and he expected every moment a discharge of balls grape or langrage about our ears after visiting my friends and the general court the army and the country i returned to philadelphia but not till i had followed my youngest brother to the grave he had commanded a company of militia all summer at cambridge and there taken a fatal dysentery then epidemic in the camp of which he died leaving a young widow and three young children who are all still living my brother died greatly lamented by all who knew him and by none more than by me who knew the excellence of his heart and the purity of his principles and conduct he died as mr taft his minister informed me exulting as his father had done in the exalted hopes of a christian an event of the most trifling nature in appearance and fit only to excite laughter in other times struck me into a profound reverie if not a fit of melancholy i met a man who had sometimes been my client and sometimes i had been against him he though a common horsejockey was sometimes in the right and i had commonly been successful in his favor in our courts of law he was always in the law and had been sued in many actions at almost every court as soon as he saw me he came up to me and his first salutation to me was oh mr adams what great things have you and your colleagues done for us we can never be grateful enough to you there are no courts of justice now in this province and i hope there never will be another is this the object for which i have been contending said i to myself for i rode along without any answer to this wretch are these the sentiments of such people and how many of them are there in the country half the nation for what i know for half the nation are debtors if not more and these have been in all countries the sentiments of debtors if the power of the country should get into such hands and there is great danger that it will to what purpose have we sacrificed our time health and every thing else surely we must guard     against this spirit and these principles or we shall repent of all our conduct however the good sense and integrity of the majority of the great body of the people came into my thoughts for my relief and the last resource was after all in a good providence single entry in account book september   at woodstock  heard mr

effect though little profit langdon and bartlett came in this evening from portsmouth four hundred men are building a fort on pierces island to defend the town against ships of war upon recollecting the debates of this day in congress there appears to me a remarkable want of judgment in some of our members chase is violent and boisterous asking his pardon he is tedious upon frivolous points so is e rutledge much precious time is indiscreetly expended points of little consequence are started and debated with warmth rutledge is a very uncouth and ungraceful speaker he shrugs his shoulders distorts his body nods and wriggles with his head and looks about with his eyes from side to side and speaks through his nose as the yankees sing his brother john dodges his head too rather disagreeably and both of them spout out their language in a rough and rapid torrent but without much force or effect  dyer is longwinded and     roundabout obscure and cloudy very talkative and very tedious yet an honest worthy man means and judges well shermans air is the reverse of grace there cannot be a more striking contrast to beautiful action than the motions of his hands generally he stands upright with his hands before him the fingers of his left hand clenched into a fist and the wrist of it grasped with his right but he has a clear head and sound judgment but when he moves a hand in any thing like action hogarths genius could not have invented a motion more opposite to grace—it is stiffness and awkwardness itself rigid as starched linen or buckram awkward as a junior bachelor or a sophomore mr dickinsons air gait and action are not much more elegant    saturday walking to the state house this morning i met mr dickinson on foot in chesnut street we met and passed near enough to touch elbows he passed without moving his hat or head or hand i bowed and pulled off my hat he passed haughtily by the cause of his offence is the letter no doubt which gage has printed in drapers paper  i shall for the future pass him in the same manner but i was determined to make my bow that i might know his temper we are not to be upon speaking terms nor bowing terms for the time to come this evening had conversation with mr bullock of georgia i asked him whether georgia had a charter what was the extent of the province what was their constitution how justice was administered who was chancellor who ordinary and who judges he says they have county courts for the trial of civil causes under eight pounds and a chief justice appointed from home and three other judges appointed by the governor for the decision of all other causes civil and criminal at savannah that the governor alone is both chancellor and ordinary parson gordon of roxbury  spent the evening     here i fear his indiscreet prate will do harm in this city he is an eternal talker and somewhat vain and not accurate nor judicious very zealous in the cause and a wellmeaning man but incautious and not sufficiently tender of the character of our province upon which at this time much depends fond of being thought a man of influence at headquarters and with our council and house and with the general officers of the army and also with gentlemen in this city and other colonies he is a good man but wants a guide    sunday mr smith mr imlay and mr hanson breakfasted with us smith is an englishman

sergeant of princeton made a visit to the secretary and me he says he is no idolater of his namesake that he was disappointed when he first saw him fame had given him an exalted idea but he came to

boys was intrenched half way between st johns and montreal and had cut off all communication with carlton and was kindly treated by the french a council of war had been held and it was their opinion that it was practicable to take boston and charlestown but as it would cost many lives and expose the inhabitants of boston to destruction it was thought best to postpone it for the present major

sanguine that the two de witts one of windham the other of norwich will make saltpetre in large quantities he produces a sample which is very good harrison is confident that virginia alone will do great things     from tobacco houses but my faith is not strong as yet lord north is at his old work again sending over his anodynes to america deceiving one credulous american after another into a belief that he means conciliation when in truth he means nothing but revenge he rocks the cradle and sings lullaby and the innocent children go to sleep while he prepares the birch to whip the poor babes one letter after another comes that the people are uneasy and the ministry are sick of their systems but nothing can be more fallacious next spring we shall be jockied by negotiation or have hot

ingenious body a sprightly pretty fellow he is a republican he has been much in london acquainted with sawbridge macaulay burgh and others of that stamp dilly sends him books and pamphlets and sawbridge and macaulay correspond with him he complains of d says the committee of safety are not the representatives of the people and therefore not their legislators yet they have been making laws a whole code for a navy this committee was chosen by the house but half of them are not members and therefore not the choice of the people all this is just he mentions many particular instances in which dickinson has blundered he thinks him warped by the quaker interest and the church interest too thinks his reputation past the meridian     and that avarice is growing upon him says that henry and

came into our room and smoked and chatted the whole evening houston and adams disputed the whole time in good humor they are both dabs at disputation i think houston a lawyer by trade is one of course and adams is not a whit less addicted to it than the lawyers the question was whether all america was not in a state of war and whether we ought to confine ourselves to act upon the defensive only he was for acting offensively next spring or this fall if the petition was rejected or neglected if it was not answered and favorably answered he would be for acting against britain and britons as in open war against french and frenchmen fit privateers and take their ships anywhere these gentlemen give a melancholy account of the state of georgia and south carolina they say that if one thousand regular troops should land in georgia and their commander be provided with arms and clothes enough and proclaim freedom to all the negroes who would join his camp twenty thousand negroes would join it from the two provinces in a fortnight the negroes have a wonderful art of communicating intelligence among themselves it will run several hundreds of miles in a week or fortnight they say their only security is this that all the kings friends and tools of government have large plantations and property in negroes so that the slaves of the tories would be lost as well as those of the whigs i had

to fells point the place where the ships lie a kind of peninsula which runs out into the basin which lies before baltimore town this basin thirty years ago was deep enough for large tobacco ships but since then has filled up ten feet between the town and the point we pass a bridge over a little brook which is the only stream which runs into the basin and the only flux of water which is to clear away the dirt which flows into the basin from the foul streets of the town and the neighboring hills and fields there is a breastwork thrown up upon the point with a number of embrasures for cannon

yesterday heard dr witherspoon upon redeeming     time an excellent sermon i find that i understand the doctor better since i have heard him so much in conversation and in the senate but i perceive that his attention to civil affairs has slackened his memory it cost him more pains than heretofore to recollect his discourse mr hancock told c w yesterday that he had determined to go to boston in april mrs hancock was not willing to go till may but mr hancock was determined upon april perhaps the choice of a governor may come on in may what aspiring little creatures we are how subtle sagacious

member of congress dr lyon mr merriman mr gerry a son of mr smith and two other gentlemen made the company the conversation turned among other things upon removing the obstructions and opening the navigation of susquehannah river the company thought it might easily be done and would open an amazing scene of business philadelphia will oppose it but it will be the interest of a majority of pennsylvania to effect it this mr smith is a grave solid gentleman a presbyterian by profession a very different man from the most of those we have heretofore had from maryland the manners of maryland are somewhat peculiar they have but few merchants they are chiefly planters and farmers the planters are those who raise tobacco and the farmers such as raise wheat c the lands are cultivated and all sorts of trades are exercised by negroes or by transported convicts which has occasioned the planters and farmers to assume the title of gentlemen and they hold their negroes and convicts that is all laboring people and tradesmen in such contempt that they think themselves a distinct order of beings hence they never will suffer their sons to labor or learn any trade but they bring them up in idleness or what is worse in horseracing cockfighting and cardplaying    friday last evening had a good deal of free conversation with mr r purviance he seems to me to have a perfect understanding of the affairs of this state men and things are very well known to him the object of the men of property here the planters c is universally wealth every way in the world is sought to get and save money

schuylkill a few miles from him i saw this morning an excellent chart of the schuylkill chester river the brandywine and this whole country among the pennsylvania files this city is the stake for which the game is played i think there is a chance for saving it although the probability is against us mr howe i conjecture is waiting for his ships to come into the delaware will washington attack him i hope so and god grant him success    tuesday no newspaper this morning mr dunlap has moved or packed up his types a note from general dickinson that the enemy in new jersey are four thousand strong howe is about fifteen miles from us the other way the city seems to be asleep or dead and the whole state scarce alive maryland and delaware the same the prospect is chilling on every side gloomy dark melancholy and dispiriting when and where will the light spring up shall we have good news from europe shall we hear of a blow struck by gates is there a possibility that washington should beat howe is there a prospect that mcdougall and dickinson should destroy the detachment in the jerseys from whence is our deliverance to come or is it not to come is philadelphia to be lost if lost is the cause lost no the cause is not lost but it may be hurt i seldom regard reports but it is said that howe has marked his course from elk with depredation his troops have plundered henroosts dairyrooms the furniture of houses and all the cattle in the country the inhabitants most of whom are quakers are angry and disappointed because they were promised the security of their property it is reported too that mr howe lost great numbers in the battle of the brandywine    thursday the violent northeast storm which began the day before yesterday continues we are yet in philadelphia that mass

majorgeneral he was drowned in the schuylkill in a strange manner he rode into the ferryboat and rode out at the other end into the river and was drowned his horse took fright he was reputed the most learned and promising officer in france he was carried into the romish chapel and buried in the yard of that church this dispensation will save us much altercation     friday at three this morning was

enemies that if the two opposite armies were to come here alternately ten times she would stand by her property until she should be killed if she must be a beggar it should be where she was known c this kind of conversation shows plainly enough how well she is pleased with the state of things    sunday it was a false alarm which occasioned our flight from philadelphia not a soldier of howes has crossed the schuylkill washington has again crossed it which i think is a very injudicious manœuvre i think his army would have been best disposed on the west side of the schuylkill if he had sent one brigade of his regular troops to have headed the militia it would have been enough with such a disposition he might have cut to pieces howes army in attempting to cross any of the fords howe will not attempt it he will wait for his fleet in delaware river he will keep open his line of communication with brunswick and at last by some deception or other will slip unhurt into the city burgoyne has crossed hudsons river by which general gates thinks he is determined at all hazards to push for albany which general gates says he will do all in his power to prevent him from reaching but i confess i am anxious for the event for i fear he will deceive gates who seems to be acting the same timorous defensive part which has involved us in so many disasters o heaven grant us one great soul one leading mind would extricate the best cause from that ruin which seems to await it for the want of it we have as good a cause as ever was fought for we have great resources the people are well

of the articles of confederation fragmentary as it is will not be without its value to those who desire to understand the true history of the revolution     the following resolution appears upon the journal of congress for the   d of september     — resolved that a committee be appointed to purchase a quantity of woollen goods for the use of the army to the amount of five thousand pounds sterling that the said goods when bought be placed in the hands of the quartermastersgeneral of the continental armies and that the same be by them sold out to the private soldiers of said armies at prime cost and charges including a commission of five per centum to the said quartermastersgeneral for their trouble that the committee consist of five the ballot being taken and examined the following members were chosen mr lewis mr alsop mr willing mr deane mr langdon thomas mifflin had just been appointed by general washington quartermastergeneral of the army at cambridge the debate which follows took place upon an application of his but to whom does not clearly appear and it terminated in the foregoing resolution      september    saturday samuel adams moved upon mifflins letter that a sum be advanced from the treasury for mifflin and barrell mr e rutledge wished the money might be advanced upon the credit of the quartermastergeneral wished that an inquiry might be made whether goods had been advanced if so it was against the association lynch wished the letter read s adams read it jay seconded the motion of e rutledge that a committee be appointed to inquire if goods are raised against the association gadsden wished the motion put off we had other matters of more importance willing thought that goods might be purchased upon four months credit we should not intermix our accounts paine we have not agreed to clothe the soldiers and the quartermastergeneral has no right to keep a slopshop any     more than anybody else it is a private matter very indigested applications are made here for money deane the army must be clothed or perish no preaching against a snowstorm we ought to look out that they be kept warm and that the means of doing it be secured lynch we must see that the army be provided with clothing i intended to have moved this very day that a committee be appointed to purchase woollen goods in this city and new york for the use of the army e rutledge i have no objection to the committee i meant only that the poor soldiers should be supplied with goods and clothing as cheap as possible lewis brown of boston bought goods at new york and sent them up the north river to be conveyed by land to cambridge dyer wanted to know whether the soldiers would be obliged to take these goods goods cheaper in new york than here sherman the sutlers last war sold to the soldiers who were not obliged to take any thing many will be supplied by families with their own manufacture the quartermastergeneral did not apply to congress but to his own private correspondents deane the soldiers were imposed on by sutlers last war the soldiers had no pay to receive lynch a soldier without clothing is not fit for service but he ought to be clothed as well as armed and we ought to provide as well as it can be done that he may be clothed nelson moved that five thousand pounds sterling be advanced to the quartermastergeneral to be laid out in clothing for the army langdon hoped a committee would be appointed sherman liked nelsons motion with an addition that every soldier should be at liberty to supply himself in any other way read understood that massachusetts committee of supplies had a large store that was very full sherman for a committee to inquire what goods would be wanted for the army and at what prices they may be had and report gadsden liked that best johnson moved that the sum might be limited to five thousand pounds sterling we dont know what has been supplied by massachusetts what from rhode island what from new york and what from connecticut s adams liked nelsons motion ward objected to it and preferred the motion for     a committee nelson the quartermaster is ordered by the general to supply the soldiers c paine it is the duty of this congress to see that the army be supplied with clothing at a reasonable rate i am for a committee quartermaster has his hands full zubly would it not be best to publish proposals in the papers for any man who was willing to supply the army with clothing to make his offers harrison the money ought to be advanced in all events content with a committee r r livingston    willing proposed that we should desire the committee of this city to inquire after these goods and this will lead them to an inquiry that will be beneficial to america chase the city of philadelphia has broken the association by raising the price of goods fifty per cent it would not be proper to purchase goods here the breach of the association here is general in the price of goods as it is in new york with respect to tea if we lay out five thousand pounds here we shall give a sanction to the breaches of the association the breach is too general to be punished willing if the association is broken in this city dont let us put the burden of examining into it upon a few but the whole committee new york have broken it entirely ninetynine in a hundred drink tea i am not for screening the people of philadelphia sherman i am not an importer but have bought of new york merchants for twenty years at a certain advance on the sterling cost r r livingston thought we ought to buy the goods where they were dearest because if we bought them at new york where they were cheapest new york would soon be obliged to purchase in philadelphia where they are dearest and then the loss would fall upon new york whereas in the other way the loss would be general jay we had best desire the committee of this city to purchase the quantity of goods at the price stated by the association and see if they were to be had here at that price this debate terminated in a manner that i did not foresee a committee was appointed to purchase five thousand pounds sterlings worth of goods to be sent to the quartermastergeneral and by him to be sold to the soldiers at first cost and     charges quartermaster to be allowed five per cent for his trouble mr lynch and colonel harrison and colonel nelson indulged their complaisance and private friendship for mifflin and washington so far as to carry this it is almost impossible to move any thing but you instantly see private friendships and enmities and provincial views and prejudices intermingle in the consultation  these are degrees of corruption they are deviations from the public interest and from rectitude by this vote however perhaps the poor soldiers may be benefited which was all i wished the interest of mr mifflin being nothing to me    monday an uneasiness among some of the members concerning a contract with willing and morris for powder by which the house without any risk at all will make a clear profit of twelve thousand pounds at least  dyer and deane spoke in public lewis to me in private about it all think it exorbitant s adams desired that the resolve of congress upon which the contract was founded might be read he did not recollect it de hart one of the contractors willing declared to this congress that he looked upon the contract to be that the first cost should be insured to them not the fourteen pounds a barrel for the powder r r livingston i never will vote to ratify the contract in the sense that morris understands it willing i am as a member of the house a party to that contract but was not privy to the bargain i never saw the contract until i saw it in dr franklins hand i think it     insures only the first cost my partner thinks it insures the whole he says that mr rutledge said at the time that congress should have nothing to do with sea risk the committee of this city offered nineteen pounds i would wish to have nothing to do with the contract but to leave it to my partner who is a man of reason and generosity to explain the contract with the gentlemen who made it with him j rutledge congress was to run no risk only against menofwar and customhouse officers i was surprised this morning to hear that mr morris understood it otherwise if he wont execute a bond such as we shall draw i shall not be at a loss what to do johnson a hundred tons of powder was wanted ross in case of its arrival congress was to pay fourteen pounds if menofwar or customhouse officers should get it congress was to pay first cost only as i understood it zubly we are highly favored fourteen pounds we are to give if we get the powder and fourteen pounds if we dont get it i understand persons enough will contract to supply powder at fifteen pounds and run all risks willing sorry any gentleman should be severe mr morriss character is such that he cannot deserve it lynch if morris will execute the bond well if not the committee will report deane it is very well that this matter has been moved and that so much has been said upon it dyer there are not ten men in the colony i came from who are worth so much money as will be made clear by this contract ross what has this matter to do with the present debate whether connecticut men are worth much or no it proves there are no men there whose capital or credit is equal to such contracts that is all harrison the contract is made and the money paid how can we get it back johnson let us consider the prudence of this contract if it had not been made morris would have got nineteen pounds and not have set forward a second adventure gadsden understands the contract as morris does and yet thinks it a prudent one because morris would have got nineteen pounds j adams c c c   0 cushing i move that we take into consideration a method of keeping up an army in the winter gadsden seconds the motion and desires that a motion made in writing some days ago and postponed may be read as it was as also passages of g washingtons letter s adams the general has promised another letter in which we shall have his sentiments we shall have it tomorrow perhaps lynch if we have we shall only lose the writing of a letter j adams moved that the generals advice should be asked concerning barracks c and that a committee be appointed to draught a letter lynch seconded the motion a committee was appointed lynch j adams and colonel lee the men sherman moved that a committee be appointed of one member from each colony to receive and examine all accounts  s adams seconded the motion harrison asked is this the way of giving thanks s adams was decent to the committee for riflemens accounts meant no reflections upon them was sorry that the worthy gentleman from virginia conceived that any was intended he was sure there was no foundation for it paine thought that justice and honor required that we should carefully examine all accounts and see to the expenditure of all public moneys that the minister would find out our weakness and would foment divisions among our people he was sorry that gentlemen could not hear methods proposed to settle and pay accounts in a manner that would give satisfaction to the people without seeming to resent them harrison now the gentlemen have explained themselves he had no objection but when it was proposed to appoint a new committee in the place of the former one it implied a reflection willing these     accounts are for tents arms clothing c as well as expenses of the riflemen c nelson moved that twenty thousand dollars be voted into the hands of the other committee to settle the accounts s adams seconded the motion but still hoped that some time or other a committee would be appointed of one member from each colony to examine all accounts because he thought it reasonable  september    wednesday willing in favor of mr purviances petition  harrison against it willing thinks the nonexportation sufficiently hard upon the farmer the merchant and the tradesman but will not arraign the propriety of the measure nelson if we give these indulgences i know not where they will end sees not why the merchant should be indulged more than the farmer harrison it is the merchant in england that is to suffer lynch they meant gain and they ought to bear the loss sherman another reason the cargo is provisions and will probably fall into the hands of the enemy r r livingston there is no resolve of congress against exporting to foreign ports we shall not give license to deceit by clearing out for england lynch moves that the committee of this city be desired to inquire whether deans vessel taken at block island and another at cape cod were not sent on purpose to supply the enemy read the committee of this city have inquired of the owners of one vessel the owners produced their letter books and were ready to swear the conduct of the captain is yet suspicious thinks the other inquiry very proper     lee thinks lynchs motion proper thinks the conduct detestable parricide to supply those who have arms in their hands to deprive us of the best rights of human nature the honest seamen ought to be examined and they may give evidence against the guilty hancock dean belongs to boston he came from west indies and was seized here and released loaded with flour and went out extract from the journals of congress wednesday   october      agreeable to the order of the day the congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole to take into consideration the state of the trade of the thirteen united colonies      october   johnson i should be for the resolutions about imports and exports standing till further order i should be against giving up the carriage the grower the farmer gets the same let who will be the exporter but the community does not the shipwright ropemaker hempgrower all shipbuilders the profits of the merchant are all lost if foreigners are our sole carriers as well as seamen c i am for the report standing  the association standing j rutledge the question is whether we shall shut our ports entirely or adhere to the association the resolutions we come to ought to be final lee north carolina is absent they are expected every hour we had better suspend a final determination i fear our determination to stop trade will not be effectual willing north carolina promised to put themselves in the same situation with other colonies new york have done the same our gold is locked up at present we ought to be decisive interest is near and dear to men the committee of secrecy find difficulties merchants dare not trade deane sumptuary laws or a nonimportation were necessary if we had not been oppressed a nonexport was attended with difficulty my colony could do as well as others we     should have acquiesced in an immediate nonexport or a partial one many voted for it as an object in terrorem merchants mechanics farmers all call for an establishment whether we are to trade with all nations except britain ireland and west indies or with one or two particular nations we cannot get ammunition without allowing some exports for the merchant has neither money nor bills and our bills will not pass abroad r r livingston we should go into a full discussion of the subject every gentleman ought to express his sentiments the first question is how far we shall adhere to our association what advantages we gain what disadvantages we suffer by it an immediate stoppage last year would have had a great effect but at that time the country could not bear it we are now out of debt nearly the high price of grain in boston will be an advantage to the farmer the price of labor is nearly equal in europe the trade will be continued and great britain will learn to look upon america as insignificant if we export to britain and dont import they must pay us in money of great importance that we should import we employ our ships and seamen we have nothing to fear but disunion among ourselves what will disunite us more than the decay of all business the people will feel and will say that congress tax them and oppress them worse than parliament ammunition cannot be had unless we open our ports i am for doing away our nonexportation agreement entirely i see many advantages in leaving open the ports none in shutting them up i should think the best way would be to open all our ports let us declare all those bonds illegal and void what is to become of our merchants farmers seamen tradesmen what an accession of strength should we throw into the hands of our enemies if we drive all our seamen to them lee is it proper the nonexportation agreement should continue for the interest of americans to open our ports to foreign nations that they should become our carriers and protect their own vessels johnson never had an idea that we should shut our export agreement closer than it is at present if we leave it as it is we shall get powder by way of new york the lower counties and north carolina in winter our merchants will venture out     to foreign nations if parliament should order our ships to be seized we may begin a force in part to protect our own vessels and invite foreigners to come here and protect their own trade j rutledge we ought to postpone it rather than not come to a decisive resolution lee we shall be prevented from exporting if british power can do it we ought to stop our own exports and invite foreign nations to come and export our goods for us i am for opening our exportations to foreigners further than we have willing the gentlemans favorite plan is to induce foreigners to come here shall we act like the dog in the manger not suffer new york and the lower counties and north carolina to export because we cant we may get salt and ammunition by those ports cant be for inviting foreigners to become our carriers carriage is an amazing revenue holland and england have derived their maritime power from their carriage the circulation of our paper will stop and lose its credit without trade seven millions of dollars have been struck by the continent and by the separate colonies lee the end of administration will be answered by the gentlemans plan jealousies and dissensions will arise and disunion and division we shall become a rope of sand zubly the question should be whether the export should be kept or not chase i am for adhering to the association and think that we ought not to determine these questions this day differ from r livingston that our exports are to be relaxed except as to tobacco and lumber this will produce a disunion of the colonies the advantage of cultivating tobacco is very great the planters would complain their negro females would be useless without raising tobacco the country must grow rich that exports more than they import there ought not to be a partial export to great britain we affect the revenue and the remittance by stopping our exports we have given a deadly blow to britain and ireland by our nonexport their people must murmur must starve the nation must have become bankrupt before this day if we had ceased exports at first i look upon britain ireland and west indies as our enemies and would not trade with them while at war we cant support the war and our taxes without trade emissions of paper cannot continue i dread an emission for another campaign we cant stand it without trade     i cant agree that new york the lower counties and north carolina should carry on trade upon giving a bond and making oath they may export i am against these colonies trading according to the restraining act it will produce division a few weeks will put us all on a footing new york c are now all in rebellion as the ministry call it as much as massachusetts bay we must trade with foreign nations at the risk indeed but we may export our tobacco to france spain or any other foreign nation if we treat with foreign nations we should send to them as well as they to us what nation or countries shall we trade with shall we go to their ports and pay duties and let them come here and pay none to say you will trade with all the world deserves consideration i have not absolutely discarded every glimpse of a hope of a reconciliation our prospect is gloomy i cant agree that we shall not export our own produce we must treat with foreign nations upon trade they must protect and support us with their fleets when you once offer your trade to foreign nations away with all hopes of reconciliation e rutledge differs with all who think the nonexportation should be broke or that any trade at all should be carried on when a commodity is out of port the master may carry it where he pleases my colony will receive your determination upon a general nonexportation the people will not be restless proposes a general nonexportation until next congress our people will go into manufactures which is a source of riches to a country we can take our men from agriculture and employ them in manufactures agriculture and manufactures cannot be lost trade is precarious r r livingston not convinced by any argument thinks the exception of tobacco and lumber would not produce disunion the colonies affected can see the principles and their virtue is such that they would not be disunited the americans are their own carriers now chiefly a few british ships will be out of employ i am against exporting lumber i grant that if we trade with other nations some of our vessels will be seized and some taken carolina is cultivated by rich planters not so in the northern colonies the planters can bear a loss and see the reason of it the northern colonies cant bear it not in our     power to draw people from the plough to manufactures we cant make contracts for powder without opening our ports i am for exporting where britain will allow us to britain itself if we shut up our ports we drive our sailors to britain the army will be supplied in all events lee makes a motion for two resolutions the trade of virginia and maryland may be stopped by a very small naval force north carolina is badly off the northern colonies are more fortunate the force of great britain on the water being exceedingly great that of america almost nothing they may prevent almost all our trade in our own bottoms great britain may exert every nerve next year to send fifteen twenty or even thirty thousand men to come here the provisions of america are become necessary to several nations france is in distress for them—tumults and attempts to destroy the grain in the ear england has turned arable into grass france into vines grain cannot be be got from poland nor across the mediterranean the dissensions in poland continue spain is at war with the algerines and must have provisions it would be much safer for them to carry our provisions than for us we shall get necessary manufactures and money and powder this is only a temporary expedient at the present time and for a short duration to end when the war ends i agree we must sell our produce foreigners must come in three or four months the risk we must pay in the price of our produce the insurance must be deducted insurance would not be high to foreigners on account of the novelty it is no new thing the british cruisers will be the danger the same debate continued october   thursday gadsden i wish we may confine ourselves to one point let the point be whether we shall shut up all our ports and be all on a footing the ministry will answer their end if we let the customhouses be open in new york north carolina and the lower counties and georgia they will divide us one colony will envy another and be jealous mankind act by their feelings rice sold for three pounds it wont sell now for thirty shillings we have rich and poor there     as well as in other colonies we know that the excepted colonies dont want to take advantage of the others zubly q whether the customhouses be stopped and the trade opened to all the world the object is so great that i would not discuss it on horseback riding post haste it requires the debate of a week we are lifting up a rod if you dont repeal the acts we will open our ports nations as well as individuals are sometimes intoxicated it is fair to give them notice if we give them warning they will take warning they will send ships out whether they can stop our trade is the question new england i leave out of the question new york is stopped by one ship philadelphia says her trade is in the power of the fleet virginia and maryland are within the capes of virginia north carolina is accessible only one good harbor cape fear in georgia we have several harbors but a small naval force may oppose or destroy all the naval force of georgia the navy can stop our harbors and distress our trade therefore it is impracticable to open our ports the question is whether we must have trade or not we cant do without trade we must have trade it is prudent not to put virtue to too serious a test i would use american virtue as sparingly as possible lest we wear it out are we sure one canoe will come to trade has any merchant received a letter from abroad that they will come very doubtful and precarious whether any french or spanish vessel would be cleared out to america it is a breach of the treaty of peace the spaniards may be too lazy to come to america they may be supplied from sicily it is precarious and dilatory extremely dangerous and pernicious i am clearly against any proposition to open our ports to all the world it is not prudent to threaten the people of england will take it we design to break off to separate we have friends in england who have taken this up upon virtuous principles lee i will follow mr gadsden and simplify the proposition and confine it to the question whether the customhouses shall be shut if they are open the excepted colonies may trade others not which will be unequal the consequence jealousy division and ruin i would have all suffer equally but we should have some offices set up where bonds should be given that supplies shall not go to our enemies     extract from the journals friday october  th resolved that it be recommended to the several provincial assemblies or conventions and councils or committees of safety to arrest and secure every person in their respective colonies whose going at large may in their opinion endanger the safety of the colony or the liberties of america chase i dont think the resolution goes far enough lord dunmore has been many months committing hostilities against virginia and has extended his piracies to maryland i wish he had been seized by the colony months ago they would have received the thanks of all north america is it practicable now have the committee any naval force this order will be a mere piece of paper is there a power in the committee to raise and pay a naval force is it to be done at the expense of the continent have they ships or men lee i wish congress would advise virginia and maryland to raise a force by sea to destroy lord dunmores power he is fond of his bottle and may be taken by land but ought to be taken at all events zubly i am sorry to see the very threatening condition that virginia is likely to be in i look on the plan we heard of yesterday to be vile abominable and infernal but i am afraid it is practicable  will these mischiefs be prevented by seizing dunmore seizing the kings representatives will make a great impression in england and probably things will be carried on afterwards with greater rage i came here with two views one to secure the rights of america second a reconciliation with great britain dyer they cant be more irritated at home than they are they are bent upon our destruction therefore that is no argument against seizing them dunmore can do no mischief in virginia his connections in england are such that he may be exchanged to advantage wentworth is gone to boston franklin is not dangerous penn is not eden is not     johnson dunmore a very bad man a defensive conduct was determined on in the convention of virginia i am for leaving it to virginia we ought not to lay down a rule in a passion i see less and less prospect of a reconciliation every day but i would not render it impossible if we should render it impossible our colony would take it into their own hands and make concessions inconsistent with the rights of america north carolina virginia pennsylvania new york at least have strong parties in each of them of that mind this would make a disunion five or six weeks will give us the final determination of the people of great britain not a governor on the continent has the real power but some have the shadow of it a renunciation of all connection with great britain will be understood by a step of this kind thirteen colonies connected with great britain in sixteen months have been brought to an armed opposition to the claims of great britain the line we have pursued has been the line we ought to have pursued if what we have done had been proposed two years ago four colonies would not have been for it suppose we had a dozen crown officers in our possession have we determined what to do with them shall we hang them lee those who apply general reasons to this particular case will draw improper conclusions those crown officers who have advised his lordship against his violent measures have been quarrelled with by him virginia is pierced in all parts with navigable waters his lordship knows all these waters and the plantations on them shuldham is coming to assist him in destroying these plantations we see his influence with an abandoned administration is sufficient to obtain what he pleases if six weeks may furnish decisive information the same time may produce decisive destruction to maryland and virginia did we go fast enough when we suffered the troops at boston to fortify zubly this is a sudden motion the motion was yesterday to apprehend governor tryon we have not yet conquered the army or navy of great britain a navy consisting of a cutter rides triumphant in virginia there are persons in america who wish to break off with great britain a proposal has been made to apply to france and spain before i agree to it i will inform my constituents i apprehend the man who should propose it would be torn to pieces like de witt   0 wythe it was from a reverence for this congress that the convention of virginia neglected to arrest lord dunmore it was not intended suddenly to form a precedent for governor tryon if maryland have a desire to have a share in the glory of seizing this nobleman let them have it the first objection is the impracticability of it i dont say that it is practicable but the attempt can do no harm from seizing clothing in delaware seizing the transports c the battles of lexington charlestown c every man in great britain will be convinced by ministry and parliament that we are aiming at an independency on great britain therefore we need not fear from this step disaffecting our friends in england as to a defection in the colonies i cant answer for maryland pennsylvania c but i can for virginia johnson i am not against allowing liberty to arrest lord dunmore there is evidence that the scheme he is executing was recommended by himself maryland does not regard the connection with great britain as the first good stone if we signify to virginia that it will not be disagreeable to us if they secure lord dunmore that will be sufficient lewis moves an amendment that it be recommended to the council of virginia that they take such measures to secure themselves from the practices of lord dunmore either by seizing his person or otherwise as they think proper hall a material distinction between a peremptory order to the council of virginia to seize his lordship and a recommendation to take such measures as they shall judge necessary to defend themselves against his measures extract from the journals resolved that the committee appointed for the importation of powder be directed to export agreeable to the continental association as much provisions or other produce of these colonies as they shall judge expedient for the purchase of arms and ammunition motion to export produce for powder sherman i think we must have powder and we may send out produce for powder but upon some gentlemens principles we must have a general exportation     paine from the observations some gentlemen have made i think this proposition of more importance than it appeared at first in theory i could carry it further even to exportation and importation to great britain a large continent cant act upon speculative principles but must be governed by rules medicines we must have some clothing c i wish we could enter upon the question at large and agree upon some system chase by that resolution we may send to great britain ireland and west indies lee suppose provisions should be sold in spain for money and cash sent to england for powder duane we must have powder i would send for powder to london or anywhere we are undone if we have not powder deane i hope the words agreeable to the association will be inserted but i would import from great britain powder r r livingston we are between hawk and buzzard we puzzle ourselves between the commercial and warlike opposition rutledge if ammunition was to be had from england only there would be weight in the gentlemans argument the captain reed told us yesterday that he might have brought one thousand barrels of powder why because he was not searched but if he had attempted to bring powder he would have been searched i would let the association stand as it is and order the committee to export our provisions consistent with it lee when a vessel comes to england against our association she must be observed and watched they would keep the provisions but not let us have the powder deane i have not the most distant idea of infringing the association duane the resolution with the amendment amounts to nothing the committee may import now consistent with the association i apprehend that by breaking the association we may import powder without it not we must have powder we must fight our battles in two or three months in every colony j rutledge they may export to any other place and thence send money to england     extract from the journals the congress taking into consideration the letter from new york respecting the fortifications ordered to be erected on hudsons river— resolved that a committee of three be appointed to report tomorrow morning an answer to the convention of new york the following members were chosen by ballot namely mr morton mr deane and mr r livingston new york letter concerning a fortification on the highlands considered dyer cant say how far it would have been proper to have gone upon romains plan in the spring but thinks it too late now there are places upon that river that might be thrown up in a few days that would do we must go upon some plan that will be expeditious lee romain says a less or more imperfect plan would only be beginning a stronghold for an enemy deane an order went to new york they have employed an engineer the people and he agree in the spot and the plan unless we rescind the whole we should go on it ought to be done john adams saturday october   saturday october   no trace of the next debate appears upon the journals as originally printed but much light is shed upon it in the extract from the autobiography which follows these reports on the third of october is this entry on the journals one of the delegates for rhode island laid before the congress a part of the instructions given them by their two houses of legislature august         resolved that the congress will on friday next take the above into consideration from these words it is clear that the instructions were themselves to be inserted as a part of the record which they are not but in the republication by mr force in the american archives  th series vol iv c       they are found in full the purport of them was to recommend to the congress the building a fleet at the continental expense in the journals as originally printed it would appear as if when the subject came up on the appointed day friday the consideration of it had been put off until monday the   th which would make this debate seem entirely out of place mr force has here again rectified the first edition of the journals by showing that the vote on friday was to postpone to saturday so that it then came up the first thing in the order of business and was again postponed until monday the   th     from the report of the debate it would seem as if notwithstanding this reference a motion was then made to refer the matter to a committee chase it is the maddest idea in the world to think of building an american fleet its latitude is wonderful we should mortgage the whole continent recollect the intelligence on your table—defend new york—fortify upon hudsons river we should provide for gaining intelligence two swift sailing vessels dyer the affair of powder from new york should be referred to the committee hopkins no objection to putting off the instruction from rhode island provided it is to a future day paine seconds chases motion that it be put off to a future day sine die chase the gentleman from maryland never made such a motion i never used the copulative the gentleman is very sarcastic and thinks himself very sensible zubly if the plans of some gentlemen are to take place an american fleet must be a part of it extravagant as it is randolph moves that all the orders of the day should be read every morning deane i wish it may be seriously debated i dont think it romantic at all j rutledge moves that some gentlemen be appointed to prepare a plan and estimate of an american fleet zubly seconds the motion gadsden i am against the extensiveness of the rhode island plan but it is absolutely necessary that some plan of defence by sea should be adopted j rutledge i shall not form a conclusive opinion till i hear the arguments i want to know how many ships are to be built and what they will cost s adams the committee cant make an estimate until they know how many ships are to be built zubly rhode island has taken the lead i move that the delegates of rhode island prepare a plan give us their opinion j adams the motion is entirely out of order the subject is put off for a week and now a motion is to appoint a committee to consider the whole subject     zubly rutledge paine gadsden—lightly skirmishing deane it is like the man that was appointed to tell the dream and the interpretation of it the expense is to be estimated without knowing what fleet there shall be or whether any at all gadsden the design is to throw it into ridicule it should be considered out of respect to the colony of rhode island who desired it determined against the appointment of a committee report of the committee for fortifying upon hudsons river considered  j rutledge i think we should add to the report that they take the most effectual measures to obstruct the navigation of hudsons river by booms or otherwise gadsden seconds the motion deane doubts the practicability of obstructing it with booms it is so wide the committee said four or five booms chained together and ready to be drawn across would stop the passage the congress of new york is to consult the assembly of connecticut and the congress of new jersey on the best method of taking posts and making signals and assembling forces for the defence of the river gadsden moves that all the letters laid before us from england should be sent to the convention

printed moves that general wooster with his troops may be ordered down to new york duane moves that woosters men may be employed in building the fortifications dyer seconds the motion allowing the men what is usual sherman would have the order conditional if schuyler dont want them understands that new york has the best militia upon the continent r livingston they will be necessary at the highlands dyer thinks they ought to have the usual allowance for work     s adams understands that the works at cambridge were done without any allowance but that general washington has ordered that for future works they be allowed half a pistareen a day langdon would not have the order to wooster  but to schuyler for he would not run any risk of the northern expedition rutledge thinks schuyler cant want them he waited only for boats to send five hundred men more sherman would it not be well to inform schuyler of our endeavors to take the transports and desire him to acquaint colonel arnold of it rutledge he may cooperate with arnold in taking the transports i hope he is in possession of montreal before now deane i wish that whatever money is collected may be sent along to schuyler e rutledge we have been represented as beggarly fellows and the first impressions are the strongest if we eat their provisions and dont pay it will make a bad impression ross produces a resolve of the assembly of pennsylvania that their delegates lay the connecticut intrusion  before congress that something may be done to quiet the minds j rutledge moves that the papers be referred to the delegates of the two colonies willing thinks them parties and that they must have an umpire sherman thinks they may agree on a temporary line debate on the report for fortifying upon hudsons river resumed lee  moves that parliamentary or ministerial posts may be     stopped as a constitutional post is now established from new hampshire to georgia langdon seconds the motion willing thinks it is interfering with that line of conduct which we have hitherto prescribed to ourselves it is going back beyond the year      lee when the ministry are mutilating our correspondence in england and our enemies here are corresponding for our ruin shall we not stop the ministerial post willing looks upon this to be one of the offensive measures which are improper at this time it will be time enough to throw this aside when the time comes that we shall throw every thing aside at present we dont know but there may be a negotiation dyer we have already superseded the act of parliament effectually deane is for a recommendation to the people to write by the constitutional post not forbid a man to ride s adams thinks it a defensive measure and advising people not to write by it looks too cunning for me i am for stopping the correspondence of our enemies langdon administration are taking every method to come at our intentions why should not we prevent it duane i shall vote against it it may be true that we are come to the time when we are to lay aside all i think there should be a full representation of the colonies north carolina should be here deane seconds the motion for postponing it zubly the necessity of this measure does not appear to me if we have gone beyond the line of      and of defence without apparent necessity it was wrong if with necessity right i look upon the invasion of canada as a very different thing i have a right to defend myself against persons who come against me let them come from whence they will we in georgia have gained intelligence by the kings post that we could not have got any other way some gentlemen think all merit lies in violent and unnecessary measures s adams the gentlemans argument would prove that we     should let the post go into boston morton would not this stop the packet would it not be ordered to boston does the packet bring any intelligence to us that is of use lee no intelligence comes to us but constant intelligence to our enemies stone thinks it an innocent motion but is for postponing it because he is not at present clear he thinks that the setting up a new post has already put down the old one paine my opinion was that the ministerial post will die a natural death it has been under a languishment a great while it would be cowardice to issue a decree to kill that which is dying it brought but one letter last time and was obliged to retail newspapers to bear its expenses i am very loth to say that this post shall not pass lee is there not a doctor lord north who can keep this creature alive r r livingston i dont think that tory letters are sent by the royal post i consider it rather as a convenience than otherwise we hear five times a week from new york the letters upon our table advise us to adopt every conciliatory measure that we may secure the affections of the people of england october  0 on the preceding day the congress had adopted a resolution in the following words— that it be recommended to the convention of new jersey that they immediately raise at the expense of the continent two battalions consisting of eight companies each and each company of sixtyeight privates officered with one captain one lieutenant one ensign four sergeants and four corporals who shall have the appointment of the officers in the two battalions to be raised in new jersey sherman best to leave it to the provincial conventions ward seconds the motion chase this is persisting in error in spite of experience we have found by experience that giving the choice of officers to the people is attended with bad consequences the french officers are allowed to exceed any in europe because a gentleman is hardly entitled to the smiles of the ladies without serving a campaign in my province we want officers gentlemen have recommended persons from personal friendships who were not suitable such friendships will have more weight in the     colonies dyer we must derive all our knowledge from the delegates of that colony the representatives at large are as good judges and would give more satisfaction you cant raise an army if you put officers over the men whom they dont know it requires time to bring people off from ancient usage e rutledge we dont mean to break in upon what has been done in our province we have raised our complement of men in the neighboring colonies i am for it that we may have power to reward merit ward the motion is intended for a precedent in the expedition to carthagena and canada the crown only appointed a lieutenant in my colony the men will not enlist when the militia bill was before us i was against giving the choice to the men i dont know any man in the jerseys duane a subject of importance a matter of delicacy we ought to be all upon a footing we are to form the grand outlines of an american army a general regulation will such a regulation be salutary the public good alone will govern me if we were to set out anew would the same plan be pursued it has not been unprecedented in this congress mr campbell allen warner were promoted here we ought to insist upon it we shall be able to regulate an army better schuyler and montgomery would govern my judgment i would rather take the opinion of general washington than of any convention we can turn out the unworthy and reward merit the usage is for it governors used to make officers except in connecticut and rhode island but we cant raise an army we are then in a deplorable condition indeed we pay—cant we appoint with the advice of our generals langdon looks upon this as a very extraordinary motion and big with many mischiefs deane it is the peoples money not ours it will be fatal we cant set up a sale for offices like lord barrington e rutledge the appointment hitherto has been as if the money belonged to particular provinces not to the continent we cant reward merit the governor appointed officers with us ross my sentiments coincide with those of the gentlemen from new york and carolina and would go further and appoint every officer even an ensign we have no command of the army they have different rules and articles jay am of     opinion with the gentleman who spoke last the union depends much upon breaking down provincial conventions the whole army refused to be mustered by your mustermaster debate on the state of trade continued from page     october    report on trade considered in a committee of the whole lee it has been moved to bring the debate to one point by putting the question whether the customhouses shall be shut up and the officers discharged from their several functions this would put new york north carolina the lower counties and georgia upon the same footing with the other colonies i therefore move you that the customhouses be shut and the officers discharged this will remove jealousies and divisions zubly the measure we are now to consider is extremely interesting i shall offer my thoughts if we decide properly i hope we shall establish our cause if improperly we shall overthrow it altogether  st proposition trade is important   we must have a reconciliation with great britain or the means of carrying on the war an unhappy day when we shall    a republican government is little better than government of devils i have been acquainted with it from six years old we must regulate our trade so as that a reconciliation be obtained or we enabled to carry on the war cant say but i do hope for a reconciliation and that this winter may bring it i may enjoy my hopes for reconciliation others may enjoy theirs that none will take place a vessel will not go without sails or oars wisdom is better than weapons of war we dont mean to oppose great britain merely for diversion if it is necessary that we make war and that we have the means of it this continent ought to know what it is about the nation dont we ought to know what they mean to be about we ought to have intelligence of the designs king of prussia and count daun marched and countermarched until they could not impose upon each other any more every thing we want for the war is powder and shot second thing necessary that we have arms and ammunition third we must have money the continental credit must be supported we must keep up a notion that this paper is good   0 for something it has not yet a general circulation the mississippi scheme in france and the south sea scheme in england were written for our learning a hundred millions fell in one day twenty menofwar may block up the harbor of new york delaware river chesapeake bay the carolinas and georgia whether we can raise a navy is an important question we may have a navy and to carry on the war we must have a navy can we do this without trade can we gain intelligence without trade can we get powder without trade every vessel you send out is thrown away new england where the war is may live without trade the money circulates there they may live without trade our people must starve we cannot live we cannot feed or clothe our people my resolution was that i would do and suffer any thing rather than not be free but i am resolved not to do impossible things if we must trade we must trade with somebody and with somebody that will trade with us either with foreigners or great britain if with foreigners we must either go to them or they must come to us we cant go to them if our harbors are shut up i look upon the trade with foreigners as impracticable st lawrence being open is a supposition new england people last war went to cape françois spaniards are too lazy to come to us if we cant trade with foreigners we must trade with great britain is it practicable will it quit cost will it do more hurt than good this is breaking our association our people will think we are giving way and giving all up they will say one mischievous man has overset the whole navigation i speak from principle it has been said here that the association was made in terrorem gadsden seconds lees motion and affirms that we can carry on trade from one end of the continent to the other deane customhouse officers discharged were they ever in our pay in our service let them stand where they are let this congress establish what offices they please let the others die i think that all the colonies ought to be upon a footing we must have trade i think we ought to apply abroad we must have powder and goods we cant keep our people easy without lee the gentleman agrees that all ought to be upon a footing let him show how this can be done without shutting the customhouses     jay this should be the last business we undertake it is like cutting the foot to the shoe not making a shoe for the foot let us establish a system first i think we ought to consider the whole before we come to any resolutions now gentlemen have their doubts whether the nonexportation was a good measure i was last year clear against it because the enemy have burned charlestown would gentlemen have us burn new york let us lay every burden as equal on all the shoulders as we can if providence or ministry inflict misfortunes on one shall we inflict the same on all i have one arm sore why should not the other arm be made sore too but jealousies will arise are these reasonable is it politic we are to consult the general good of all america are we to do hurt to remove unreasonable jealousies because ministry have imposed hardships on one shall we impose the same on all it is not from affection to new york that i speak if a man has lost his teeth on one side of his jaws shall he pull out the teeth from the other that both sides may be upon a footing is it not realizing the quarrel of the belly and the members the other colonies may avail themselves of the customhouses in the exempted colonies lee all must bear a proportional share of the continental expense will the exempted colonies take upon themselves the whole expense virginia pays a sixth part the lower counties an eightieth yet the lower counties may trade virginia not the gentleman exercised an abundance of wit to show the unreasonableness of jealousies if this ministerial bait is swallowed by america another will be thrown out jay why should not new york make money and new jersey not one colony can clothe them mckean i have four reasons for putting the favored colonies upon a footing with the rest   to disappoint the ministry their design was insidious   i would not have it believed by ministry or other colonies that those colonies had less virtue than others   i have a reconciliation in view it would be in the power of those colonies it might become their interest to prolong the war   i believe parliament has done or will do it for us that is put us on the same footing i would choose that the exempted colonies should have the honor of it not clear that this is the best way of putting them upon a footing     if we should be successful in canada i would be for opening our trade to some places in great britain jamaica c j rutledge wonders that a subject so clear has taken up so much time i was for a general nonexportation is it not surprising that there should so soon be a motion for breaking the association we have been reproached for our breach of faith in breaking the nonimportation i have the best authority to say that if we had abided by a former nonimportation we should have had redress we may be obliged hereafter to break the association but why should we break it before we feel it i expected the delegates from the exempted colonies would have moved to be put upon the same footing dont like shutting the customhouses and discharging the officers but moves that the resolve be that people in new york north carolina and lower counties dont apply to the customhouse zubly georgia is settled along savannah river two hundred miles in extent and one hundred miles the other way i look upon it the association altogether will be the ruin of the cause we have ten thousand fighting indians near us carolina has already smuggled goods from georgia chase i will undertake to prove that if the reverend gentlemans positions are true and his advice followed we shall all be made slaves if he speaks the opinion of georgia i sincerely lament that they ever appeared in congress they cannot they will not comply why did they come here sir we are deceived sir we are abused why do they come here i want to know why their provincial congress came to such resolutions did they come here to ruin america the gentlemans advice will bring destruction upon all north america i am for the resolution upon the table there will be jealousies if new york and the other exempted colonies are not put upon a footing it is not any great advantage to the exempted colonies what can they export that will not be serviceable to great britain and the west indies the exports of north carolina are of vast importance to great britain if these colonies are in rebellion will not their effects be confiscated and seized even upon the ocean arms and ammunition must be obtained by what is called smuggling i doubt not we shall have the supply leaving open new york c will prevent our getting arms and ammunition     houston where the protection of this room did not extend i would not sit very tamely chase i think the gentleman ought to take offence at his brother delegate wythe agrees with the gentleman from new york that we dont proceed regularly the safety of america depends essentially on a union of the people in it can we think that union will be preserved if four colonies are exempted when new york assembly did not approve the proceedings of the congress it was not only murmured at but lamented as a defection from the public cause when attica was invaded by the lacedemonians pericles ordered an estate to be ravaged and laid waste because he thought it would be exempted by the spartan king nothing was ever more unhappily applied than the fable of the stomach and the limbs sherman another argument for putting    on trade continued october    r livingston hopes the whole matter will be put off is willing as it seems the general sense that all should be put upon a footing gadsden hopes it will not be put off south carolina will be in the utmost confusion if this matter is not decided let the continent determine stone can see no particular inconvenience to carolina seconds the motion of mr livingston for postponing the question and gives his reasons the powder committee must take clearances if they are allowed to take clearances and no other then whenever they take a clearance it will be known that it is for powder and the vessel will be watched lee i see very clearly that the best time for putting a question is when it is best understood that time is the present as to powder time may be allowed for the committee to clear vessels j rutledge thinks this motion extraordinary this subject has been under consideration three weeks it is really trifling the committee may have time allowed to clear vessels for powder but i had rather the continent should run the risk of sending vessels without clearances what confusion would     ensue if congress should break up without any resolution of this sort the motion seems intended to defeat the resolution entirely those who are against it are for postponing jay we have complied with the restraining act the question is whether we shall have trade or not and this is to introduce a most destructive scheme a scheme which will drive away all your sailors and lay up all your ships to rot at the wharves debate continued deane october  0 their plunder only afforded one meal of fresh meat for the privates all the rest was reserved for the officers and their friends among the inhabitants i would have traders prohibited from importing unnecessary articles and from exporting live stock except horses gadsden if we give one leave when there are one hundred who have an equal right it will occasion jealousy let each colony export to the amount of so many thousand pounds and no more chase we have letters from guadaloupe martinique and the havana that they will supply us with powder for tobacco gadsden france and spain would be glad to see great britain despotic in america our being in a better state than their colonies occasions complaints among them insurrections and rebellions but these powers would be glad we were an independent state chase the proposition is for exporting for a special purpose—importing powder i would not permit our cash to go for rum live stock is an inconsiderable part of our cargoes i dont wish to intermix any thing in this debate i would restrain the merchant from importing any thing but powder c molasses was an article of importance in the trade of the northern colonies but now they cant carry on the african trade and the rum is pernicious if you give a latitude for any thing but arms and ammunition we shant agree what articles are necessary and what unnecessary each colony should carry on this trade not individuals i would not limit the quantity of ammunition to be imported by each colony a hundred tons a colony would supply the west indies mediately all the army and     navy twenty tons would be a considerable adventure for a colony debts are due from the british west india islands to the inhabitants of these colonies i am not for permitting vessels to go in ballast and fetch cash i wish to import cash from every place as much as possible deane it cannot be done with secrecy or despatch i rather think it would be as well to leave it to traders zubly it is of great weight that there be no favorites dyer there will be such continual applications to the assemblies by their friends among the traders it will open a complete exportation it would completely supply the west indies jay we have more to expect from the enterprise activity and industry of private adventurers than from the lukewarmness of assemblies we want french woollens dutch worsteds duck for tents german steel c public virtue is not so active as private love of gain shall we shut the door against private enterprise lee the gentleman may move for those things as exceptions to the general rule randolph we are making laws contradictory in terms we say nobody shall export and yet somebody shall against all rule lee it is a common rule in making laws to make a rule and then make a proviso for special cases dyer the rule and the proviso are passed at once in the same act though if i give my voice for an unconditional proposition what security have i that the condition or proviso will be added afterwards the greatest impropriety in the world chase both sides are right and it arises from this that one proposition is to be made public and the other kept secret we have very little confidence in each other zubly if half the law is to be public and the other half secret will not half the people be governed by one half and the other half by the other will they not clash jay lest your produce fall into the hands of your enemies you publish a law that none go from the continent yet to get powder we keep a secret law that produce may be exported then come the wrangles among the people a vessel is seen loading—a fellow runs to the committee     lee the inconvenience may arise in some measure but will not the people be quieted by the authority of the conventions if we give public notice our enemies will be more active to intercept us on the contrary the people may be quieted by the committees of safety wythe the only persons who can be affected by this resolution are those who on the other side of the water will be called smugglers consider the danger these smugglers will run liable to seizure by customhouse officers by men of war at sea and by customhouse officers in the port they go to what can they bring cash powder or foreign manufactures cant see the least reason for restraining our trade as little can be carried on my opinion is we had better open our trade altogether it has long been my opinion and i have heard no arguments against it zubly we cant do without trade to be or not to be is too trifling a question for many gentlemen all that wise men can do among many difficulties is to choose the least stone cannot agree to the propositions made by the gentleman from maryland—not for binding the people closer than they are bound already—the proposition is the same with that which was made that our vessels should be stopped and foreigners invited to come here for our produce and protect their own trade this appears to be a destructive system it was a laborious task to get america into a general nonexportation to great britain ireland and west indies—shall we now combine with britain to distress our people in their trade more than by the association people have looked up to this and are unwilling to go further the restraining bill a most cruel unjust unconstitutional act yet we are going to greater cruelties than they we are all to be in the same circumstances of poverty and distress will the west indies be supplied by a circuitous trade i think not how can the west indies get supplies from holland france or spain the whole produce will not be carried it is said the men of war will take their produce this argument will operate against exporting for powder the army will be supplied it is impossible to prevent their getting supplies at least of bread it appears to me this is not a temporary expedient but will have a perpetual influence it is a destructive ruinous expedient and our people never will     bear it under the faith that your ports would be kept open to foreigners people have made contracts with foreigners you are giving a sanction to the act of parliament and going further under such a regulation we never can exist i would export produce to foreign west indies or anywhere for powder but the mode of doing it will defeat it the assemblies never will turn merchants successfully i would have private adventurers give bond to return powder or the produce itself chase differs from his colleague a different proposition from that for restraining our people and inviting foreigners this proposition invites your people if you carry on your exports without the protection of a foreign power you destroy america if you stop provisions and not other produce you create a jealousy if you export provisions and not other produce you create a jealousy dont think the risk will prevent supplies to the west india islands we must prevent them lumber as well as provisions great quantities will be exported notwithstanding the risk all the fleet of britain cannot stop our trade we can carry it all on we must starve the west india islands and prevent them exporting their produce to great britain there will be great quantities of provisions and lumber exported it will enhance the expense to carry them to spain or france first and thence to the west indies but the price will be such that the west indies will get them i hold it clearly we can do without trade this country produces all the necessaries many of the conveniences and some of the superfluities of life we cant grow rich our provisions will be cheap we can maintain our army and our poor we shant lose our sailors the fishermen will serve in another capacity we must defend the lakes and cities merchants will not grow rich there is the rub i have too good an opinion of the virtue of our people to suppose they will grumble if we drop our commercial system of opposition we are undone we must fail we must give up the profits of trade or lose our liberties let the door of reconciliation be once shut i would trade with foreign powers and apply to them for protection leave your ports open and every man that can will adventure the risk will not prevent it it was strongly contended at the first congress that trade should be stopped to all the world that all remittances should     cease you would have saved a civil war if you had but it could not be carried the gentlemen from south carolina could not prevail to stop our exports to britain ireland and west indies our vessels will all be liable to seizure our trade must be a smuggling trade yet we can trade considerably and many vessels will escape no vessel can take a clearance many vessels will go out unless you restrain them all america is in suspense the common sense of the people has pointed out this measure they have stopped their vessels lee we possess a fine climate and a fertile soil wood iron sheep c we make eleven or twelve hundred thousand pounds worth of provisions more than is necessary for our own consumption dont think it necessary to combat the opinion of some gentlemen that we cannot live without trade money has debauched states as well as individuals but i hope its influence will not prevail over america against her rights and dearest interests we shall distress the west indies so as immediately to quit coin for corn four millions go yearly from the west indies to britain and a million at least returns if our provisions go from these shores then they will go where the best price is to be had west indies and our enemies will get them if it was not proper a year ago it may be now this proposition is not perpetual when we get powder we may make ourselves strong by sea and carry on trade j rutledge a question of the greatest magnitude that has come before this congress if it is necessary to do without trade our constituents will submit to it the army will be supplied with flour from england where it is now cheaper than here but they would be supplied here if they were to demand it upon pain of destroying our towns west indies are supplied and have laid up stores and some of them have been raising provisions on their own lands it will bear hard upon the farmer as well as the merchant dont think the reasons the same now as last year it would then have destroyed the linen manufactory and the west indies but now they have had notice of it they are prepared against it     same subject continuea october    zubly we cant do without powder intelligence drugs georgia must have an indian war if they cant supply the indians the creeks and cherokees are in our province we must have indian trade four millions have been spent in six months we have been successful but we have gained little all the power of great britain it is true has gained very little new england has been at great expense so has new york pennsylvania has spent a hundred thousand pounds of their money to fortify their river virginia as much north carolina a great deal south carolina have issued a million eighteen millions of dollars is an enormous sum of money whenever your money fails you fail too we are to pay six millions now twelve millions more presently and have no trade i would bear the character of a madman or that of an emissary of lord north rather than believe it possible to pay eighteen millions of dollars without trade can we make bricks without straw we can live upon acorns but will we wythe the rule that the question should be put upon the last motion that is made and seconded is productive of great confusion in our debates six or seven motions at once commerce whether we consider it in an economical a moral or political light appears to be a great good civility and charity as well as knowledge are promoted by it the auri sacra fames is a fine subject for philosophers and orators to display themselves upon but the abuse of a thing is not an argument against it if the gentleman was possessed of the philosophers stone or fortunatuss cap would he not oblige the continent with the use of it why should not america have a navy no maritime power near the seacoast can be safe without it it is no chimera the romans suddenly built one in their carthaginian war why may not we lay a foundation for it we abound with firs iron ore tar pitch turpentine we have all the materials for construction of a navy no country exceeds us in felicity of climate or fertility of soil america is one of the wings upon which the british eagle has soared to the skies i am sanguine and enthusiastical enough to wish and to hope that it will be sung that america inter nubila condit   0 british navy will never be able to effect our destruction before the days of minos nations round the archipelago carried on piratical wars the moors carry on such wars now but the pillars of hercules are their ne plus ultra we are too far off for britain to carry on a piratical war we shall sometime or other rise superior to all the difficulties they may throw in our way i wont say there is none that doeth good in britain no not one but i will say she has not righteous persons enough to save their state they hold those things honorable which please them and those for just which profit them i know of no instance where a colony has revolted and a foreign nation has interposed to subdue them but many of the contrary if france and spain should furnish ships and soldiers england must pay them where are her finances why should we divert our people from commerce and banish our seamen our petition may be declared to be received graciously and promised to be laid before parliament but we can expect no success from it have they ever condescended to take notice of you rapine depopulation burning murder turn your eyes to concord lexington charlestown bristol new york there you see the character of ministry and parliament we shall distress our enemies by stopping trade granted but how will the small quantities we shall be able to export supply our enemies tricks may be practised if desire of gain prevails with merchants so does caution against risks gadsden i wish we could keep to a point i have heard the two gentlemen with a great deal of pleasure i have argued for opening our ports but am for shutting them until we hear the event of our petition to the king and longer until the congress shall determine otherwise i am for a navy too and i think that shutting our ports for a time will help us to a navy if we leave our ports open warm men will have their ships seized and moderate ones will be favored lee when you hoist out a glimmering of hope that the people are to be furnished from abroad you give a check to our own manufactures people are now everywhere attending to corn and sheep and cotton and linen chase a glove has been offered by the gentleman from georgia and i beg leave to discharge my promise to that gentleman to answer his arguments my position was this that     the gentlemans system would end in the total destruction of american liberty i never shall dispute selfevident propositions the present state of things requires reconciliation or means to carry on war intelligence we must have we must have powder and shot we must support the credit of our money you must have a navy to carry on the war you cant have a navy says the gentleman what is the consequence i say that we must submit great britain with twenty ships can destroy all our trade and ravage our seacoast can block up all your harbors prevent your getting powder what is the consequence that we should submit you cant trade with nobody you must trade with somebody you cant trade with anybody but great britain therefore i say we must submit we cant trade with foreigners the gentleman said the whole train of his reasoning proved that we must break our whole association as to exports and imports if we trade with great britain will she furnish us with powder and arms our exports are about three millions would britain permit us to export to her and receive cash in return it would impoverish and ruin great britain they will never permit a trade on our side without a trade on theirs gentlemen from new york would not permit tobacco and naval stores to be sent to great britain nothing that will support their naval power or revenue but will not this break the union would three colonies stop their staple when the other colonies exported theirs fifteen hundred seamen are employed by the tobacco colonies—one hundred and twentyfive sail of british ships but you may drop your staple your tobacco but it is difficult to alter old habits we have a great number of female slaves that are best employed about tobacco north carolina cannot will not give up their staple the gentleman from georgia was for trading with great britain and all the world he says we cant trade with any nation but britain therefore we must trade with britain alone what trade shall we have if we exclude britain ireland west indies british and foreign eastern provinces might carry it on with a small fleet if their harbors were fortified southern colonies cannot eastern colonies cant carry on their trade to that extent without a naval power to protect them not only on the coast but on the ocean and to the port of their destination     the same force that would assist the eastern colonies would be of little service to us in summer time it must be a small narrow and limited trade the best instrument we have is our opposition by commerce if we take into consideration great britain in all her glory commons voted eighteen twenty millions last war eighty thousand seamen from her trade alone her strength is all artificial from her trade alone imports from great britain to the united colonies are three millions per annum fifteen millions to all the world one fifth three quarters is british manufactures a thousand british vessels are employed in american trade twelve thousand sailors all out of employ what a stroke i dont take into view ireland or west indies colonies generally indebted about one years importation the revenue of tobacco alone half a million if paid north britain enter less than the quantity and dont pay what they ought it employs a great number of manufacturers reëxported abroad is a million it is more eighty thousand hogsheads are reëxported and it pays british debts the reëxport employs ships sailors freight commissions insurance ireland the flax seed forty thousand pounds sterling linen brought two million one hundred and fifty thousand pounds from ireland to england yards two hundred thousand ireland can raise some flax seed but not much west indies glover burke and other authors they depend for indian corn and provisions and lumber and they depend upon us for a great part of the consumption of their produce indian corn and fish are not to be had but from the colonies except pilchards and herrings jamaica can best provide for her wants but not entirely ireland can send them beef and butter but no grain britain can send them wheat oats not corn without which they cannot do stop rum and sugar how do you affect the revenue and the trade they must relax the navigation act to enable foreign nations to supply the west indies this is dangerous as it would force open a trade between foreigners and them britain can never support a war with us at the loss of such a valuable trade african trade dependent upon the west india trade seven hundred thousand pounds     twentyfive thousand hogsheads of sugar are imported directly into these colonies and as much more from britain manufactured jamaica alone takes one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling of our produce national debt one hundred and forty millions ten millions the peace establishment twenty millions the whole current cash of the nation blackstone i never read anybody that better understood the subject for the state of the revenue he calculates the taxes of ireland and england taxes of britain perpetual and annual funds three the aggregate general and south sea taxes upon every article of luxuries and necessaries these funds are mortgaged for the civil list eight hundred thousand pounds as well as the interest of the debt debate continued october    r r livingston clothing will rise though provisions will fall laborers will be discharged one quarter part of rhode island new york and pennsylvania depend upon trade as merchants shopkeepers shipwrights blockmakers riggers smiths c c the six northern colonies must raise nine millions of dollars to support the poor this vote will stop our trade for fourteen months although it professes to do it only to the  0th of march for the winter when the men of war cannot cruise upon the coast is the only time that we can trade wealthy merchants and moneyed men cannot get the interest of money more virtue is expected from our people than any people ever had the low countries did not reason as we do about speculative opinions but they felt the oppression for a long course of years rich and poor zubly concludes that the sense and bent of the people are against stopping trade by the eagerness with which they exported before the  0th of september we cant get intelligence without trade all that are supported by trade must be out of business every argument which shews that our association will materially affect the trade of great britain will shew that we must be affected too by a stoppage of our trade great britain has many resources i have bought two barrels of rice in carolina for fifteen shillings and negro cloth was three shillings instead of eighteen pence     the west indies will get supplies to keep soul and body together the ingenious dutchmen will smuggle some indian corn from america is it right to starve one man because i have quarrelled with another i have a great scruple whether it is just or prudent in december      we shall owe between twenty and thirty millions of money j rutledge am for adhering to the association and going no further the non export in terrorem and generally agreed the consequences will be dreadful if we ruin the merchants will not the army be supplied if vessels go from one province to another we may pass a resolution that no live stock shall be exported october  0 monday ross  we cant get seamen to man four vessels we could not get seamen to man our boats our galleys wythe nelson and lee for fitting out four ships     extract from the journals      february    friday agreeable to the order of the day the congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole to take into consideration the propriety of opening the ports and the restrictions and regulations of the trade of these colonies after the first of march next this discussion was continued from time to time until the sixth of april when the congress came in to sundry resolutions taking off the restrictions on trade in committee of the whole cant we oblige britain to keep a navy on foot the expense of which will be double to what they will take from us i have heard of bullion spanish flotas being stopped lest they should be taken but perishable commodities never were stopped open your ports to foreigners your trade will become of so much consequence that foreigners will protect you wilson a gentleman from massachusetts thinks that a middle way should be taken that trade should be opened for some articles and to some places but not for all things and to all places i think the merchants ought to judge for themselves of the danger and risk we should be blamed if we did not leave it to them i differ from the gentleman of massachusetts trade ought in war to be carried on with greater vigor by what means did britain carry on their triumphs last war the united provinces their war against spain if we determine that our ports shall not be opened our vessels abroad will not return our seamen are all abroad will not return unless we open our trade i am afraid it will be necessary to invite foreigners to trade with us although we lose a great advantage that of trading in our own bottoms sherman i fear we shall maintain the armies of our enemies at our own expense with provisions we cant carry on a beneficial trade as our enemies will take our ships a treaty     with a foreign power is necessary before we open our trade to protect it harrison we have hobbled on under a fatal attachment to great britain i felt it as much as any man but i feel a stronger to my country wythe the ports will be open the  st march the question is whether we shall shut them up fæce romuli non republicâ platonis americans will hardly live without trade it is said our trade will be of no advantage to us because our vessels will be taken our enemies will be supplied the west indies will be supplied at our expense this is too true unless we can provide a remedy our virginia convention have resolved that our ports be opened to all nations that will trade with us except great britain ireland and west indies if the inclination of the people should become universal to trade we must open our ports merchants will not export our produce unless they get a profit we might get some of our produce to market by authorizing adventurers to arm themselves and giving letters of marque make reprisals  d by inviting foreign powers to make treaties of commerce with us but other things are to be considered before such a measure is adopted in what character shall we treat—as subjects of great britain—as rebels why should we be so fond of calling ourselves dutiful subjects if we should offer our trade to the court of france would they take notice of it any more than if bristol or liverpool should offer theirs while we profess to be subjects no we must declare ourselves a free people if we were to tell them that after a season we would return to our subjection to great britain would not a foreign court wish to have something permanent we should encourage our fleet i am convinced that our fleet may become as formidable as we wish to make it moves a resolution resolved that the committee of secret correspondence be directed to lay their letters before this congress resolved that be a committee to prepare a draught of firm confederation to be reported as soon as may be to this congress to be considered and digested and recommended to     the several assemblies and conventions of these united colonies to be by them adopted ratified and confirmed resolved that it be recommended to the several assemblies conventions councils of safety and committees of correspondence and inspection that they use their utmost endeavors by all reasonable means to promote the culture of flax hemp and cotton and the growth of wool in these united colonies  resolved that it be recommended to the assemblies conventions and councils of safety that they take the earliest measures for erecting in each and every colony a society for the encouragement of agriculture arts manufactures and commerce and that a correspondence be maintained between such societies that the numerous natural advantages of this country for supporting its inhabitants may not be neglected resolved that it be recommended to the said assemblies conventions and councils of safety that they consider of ways and means of introducing the manufactures of duck and sailcloth  into such colonies where they are not now understood and of increasing and promoting them where they are resolved that be a committee to receive all plans and proposals for encouraging and improving the agriculture arts manufactures and commerce both foreign and domestic of america to correspond with the several assemblies conventions councils and committees of safety committees of correspondence and of observation in these united colonies upon these interesting subjects that these be published      march    how is the interest of france and spain affected by the dispute between britain and the colonies     is it the interest of france to stand neuter to join with britain or to join with the colonies is it not her interest to dismember the british empire will her dominions be safe if britain and america remain connected can she preserve her possessions in the west indies she has in the west indies martinico guadaloupe and one half of hispaniola in case a reconciliation should take place between britain and america and a war should break out between britain and france would not all her islands be taken from her in six months the colonies are now much more warlike and powerful than they were during the last war a martial spirit has seized all the colonies they are much improved in skill and discipline they have now a large standing army they have many good officers they abound in provisions they are in the neighborhood of the west indies a british fleet and army united with an american fleet and army and supplied with provisions and other necessaries from america might conquer all the french islands in the west indies in six months and a little more time than that would be required to destroy all their marine and commerce   monday resentment is a passion implanted by nature for the preservation of the individual injury is the object which excites it injustice wrong injury excite the feeling of resentment as naturally and necessarily as frost and ice excite the feeling of cold as fire excites heat and as both excite pain a man may have the faculty of concealing his resentment or suppressing it but he must and ought to feel it nay he ought to indulge it to cultivate it it is a duty his person his property his liberty his reputation are not safe without it he ought for his own security and honor and for the public good to punish those who injure him unless they repent and then he should forgive having satisfaction and compensation revenge is unlawful it is the same with communities they ought to resent and to punish is any assistance attainable from france what connection may we safely form with her   no political connection submit to none of her authority receive no governors or officers from her   no military connection receive no troops from her   only a commercial connection that is make a treaty to receive her ships into our     ports let her engage to receive our ships into her ports furnish us with arms cannon saltpetre powder duck steel whereas the present state of america and the cruel efforts of our enemies render the most perfect and cordial union of the colonies and the utmost exertions of their strength necessary for the preservation and establishment of their liberties therefore resolved that it be recommended to the several assemblies and conventions of these united colonies who have limited the powers of their delegates in this congress by any express instructions that they repeal or suspend those instructions for a certain time that this congress may have power without any unnecessary obstruction or embarrassment to concert direct and order such further measures as may seem to them necessary for the defence and preservation support and establishment of right and liberty in these colonies  extract from the journals of congress for friday  0 may      congress resumed the consideration of the resolution reported from the committee of the whole and the same was agreed to as follows— resolved that it be recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of the united colonies where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs hath been hitherto established to adopt such government as shall in the opinion of the representatives of the people best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular and america in general resolved that a committee of three be appointed to prepare a preamble to the foregoing resolution the members chosen mr j adams mr rutledge and mr r h lee a significant form of preamble was accordingly reported on wednesday the   th of may debated and adopted the following remarks were made in the course of the discussion— mr duane moves that the delegation from new york might be read when we were invited by massachusetts bay to the first congress an objection was made to binding ourselves by votes of congress congress ought not to determine a point of this   0 sort about instituting government what is it to congress how justice is administered you have no right to pass the resolution any more than parliament has how does it appear that no favorable answer is likely to be given to our petitions every account of foreign aid is accompanied with an account of commissioners why all this haste why this urging why this driving disputes about independence are in all the colonies what is this owing to but our indiscretion i shall take the liberty of informing my constituents that i have not been guilty of a breach of trust i do protest against this piece of mechanism this preamble if the facts in this preamble should prove to be true there will not be one voice against independence i suppose the votes have been numbered and there is to be a majority mckean construes the instructions from new york as mr sherman does and thinks this measure the best to procure harmony with great britain there are now two governments in direct opposition to each other dont doubt that foreign mercenaries are coming to destroy us i do think we shall lose our liberties properties and lives too if we do not take this step s adams we have been favored with a reading of the instructions from new york i am glad of it the first object of that colony is no doubt the establishment of their rights our petitions have not been heard yet answered with fleets and armies and are to be answered with myrmidons from abroad the gentleman from new york mr duane has not objected to the preamble but this that he has not a right to vote for it we cannot go upon stronger reasons than that the king has thrown us out of his protection why should we support governments under his authority i wonder that people have conducted so well as they have mr wilson was not present in congress when the resolution passed to which this preamble is proposed i was present and one of the committee who reported the advice to massachusetts bay new hampshire carolina and virginia had the same advice and with my hearty concurrence the claim of parliament will meet with resistance to the last extremity those colonies were royal governments they could not subsist without some government a maxim that all government originates from the people we are the servants of     the people sent here to act under a delegated authority if we exceed it voluntarily we deserve neither excuse nor justification some have been put under restraints by their constituents they cannot vote without transgressing this line suppose they should hereafter be called to an account for it this province has not by any public act authorized us to vote upon this question this province has done much and asked little from this congress the assembly largely increased will not meet till next monday will the cause suffer much if this preamble is not published at this time if the resolve is published without the preamble the preamble contains a reflection upon the conduct of some people in america it was equally irreconcilable to good conscience nine months ago to take the oaths of allegiance as it is now two respectable members last february took the oath of allegiance in our assembly why should we expose any gentlemen to such an invidious reflection in magna charta there is a clause which authorizes the people to seize the kings castles and oppose his arms when he exceeds his duty in this province if that preamble passes there will be an immediate dissolution of every kind of authority the people will be instantly in a state of nature why then precipitate this measure before we are prepared to build the new house why should we pull down the old one and expose ourselves to all the inclemencies of the season r h lee most of the arguments apply to the resolve not to the preamble     confederation on the eleventh of june      congress voted that a committee should be appointed to prepare and report a plan of confederation for the colonies the next day it was decided that the committee should consist of one member from each colony the following persons were appointed—mr bartlett mr s adams mr hopkins mr sherman mr r r livingston mr dickinson mr mckean mr stone mr nelson mr hewes mr e rutledge and mr gwinnett to whom mr hopkinson was added on the   th this committee reported on friday the   th of july a draught consisting of twenty articles on monday the   d the congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole to take the report into consideration which continued from day to day to debate it until tuesday the  0th of august when the amended form was reported back to the house it was laid aside until the  th of april      when the articles were again taken up and discussed until the   th of november at which time having been reduced to thirteen they were finally adopted the following discussions all took place in committee of the whole upon the original draught of twenty articles they embrace the main points upon which there was a marked difference of opinion the western territories the indians representation and taxation in committee of the whole      july    article    of the confederation  terms in this article equivocal and indefinite jefferson the limits of the southern colonies are fixed moves an amendment that all purchases of lands not within the boundaries of any colony shall be made by congress of the indians in a great council sherman seconds the motion     chase the intention of this article is very obvious and plain the article appears to me to be right and the amendment wrong it is the intention of some gentlemen to limit the boundaries of particular states no colony has a right to go to the south sea they never had they cant have it would not be safe to the rest it would be destructive to her sisters and to herself  jefferson article     what are reasonable limits what security have we that the congress will not curtail the present settlements of the states i have no doubt that the colonies will limit themselves wilson every gentleman has heard much of claims to the south sea they are extravagant the grants were made upon mistakes they were ignorant of the geography they thought the south sea within one hundred miles of the atlantic ocean it was not conceived that they extended three thousand miles lord camden considers the claims to the south sea as what never can be reduced to practice pennsylvania has no right to interfere in those claims but she has a right to say that she will not confederate unless those claims are cut off i wish the colonies themselves would cut off those claims  article     chase moves for the word deputies instead of delegates because the members of the maryland convention are called delegates and he would have a distinction answer in other colonies the reverse is true the members of the house are called deputies      jefferson objects to the first of november der hall moves for may for the time to meet jefferson thinks that congress will have a short meeting in the fall and another in the spring heyward thinks the spring the best time wilson thinks the fall and november better than october because september is a busy month everywhere dr hall september and october the most sickly and mortal months in the year the season is more forward in georgia in april than here in may  hopkinson moves that the power of recalling delegates be reserved to the state not to the assembly because that may be changed  article    each colony shall have one vote  july     rutledge and lynch oppose giving the power of regulating the trade and managing all affairs of the indians to congress the trade is profitable they say gwinnett is in favor of congress having such power braxton is for excepting such indians as are tributary to any state several nations are tributary to virginia jefferson explains it to mean the indians who live in the colony these are subject to the laws in some degree wilson we have no right over the indians whether within or without the real or pretended limits of any colony they will not allow themselves to be classed according to the bounds of colonies grants made three thousand miles to the eastward have no validity with the indians the trade of pennsylvania has been more considerable with the indians than that of the neighboring colonies walton the indian trade is of no essential service to any colony it must be a monopoly if it is free it produces jealousies and animosities and wars carolina very passionately     considers this trade as contributing to her grandeur and dignity deerskins are a great part of the trade a great difference between south carolina and georgia carolina is in no danger from the indians at present georgia is a frontier and barrier to carolina georgia must be overrun and extirpated before carolina can be hurt georgia is not equal to the expense of giving the donations to the indians which will be necessary to keep them at peace the emoluments of the trade are not a compensation for the expense of donations rutledge differs from walton in a variety of points we must look forward with extensive views carolina has been run to an amazing expense to defend themselves against indians in    0 c fifty thousand guineas were spent we have now as many men on the frontiers as in charleston we have forts in the indian countries we are connected with them by treaties lynch congress may regulate the trade if they will indemnify carolina against the expense of keeping peace with the indians or defending us against them witherspoon here are two adjacent provinces situated alike with respect to the indians differing totally in their sentiments of their interests chase south carolina claims to the south sea so does north virginia and massachusetts bay south carolina says they have a right to regulate the trade with the indians if so four colonies have all the power of regulating trade with the indians south carolina could not stand alone against the indian nations sherman moves that congress may have a superintending power to prevent injustice to the indians or colonies wilson no lasting peace will be with the indians unless made by some one body no such language as this ought to be held to the indians we are stronger we are better we treat you better than another colony no power ought to treat with the indians but the united states indians know the striking benefits of confederation they have an example of it in the union of the six nations the idea of the union of the colonies struck them forcibly last year none should trade with indians without a license from congress a perpetual war would be unavoidable if everybody was allowed to trade with them     stone this expedient is worse than either of the alternatives what is the meaning of this superintendency colonies will claim the right first congress cant interpose until the evil has happened disputes will arise when congress shall interpose  july  0 article    in determining questions each colony shall have one vote dr franklin let the smaller colonies give equal money and men and then have an equal vote but if they have an equal vote without bearing equal burthens a confederation upon such iniquitous principles will never last long dr witherspoon we all agree that there must and shall be a confederation for this war it will diminish the glory of our object and depreciate our hope it will damp the ardor of the people the greatest danger we have is of disunion among ourselves is it not plausible that the small states will be oppressed by the great ones the spartans and helotes the romans and their dependents every colony is a distinct person states of holland clark we must apply for pardons if we dont confederate wilson we should settle upon some plan of representation  chase   moves that the word white should be inserted in the eleventh article the negroes are wealth numbers are not a certain rule of wealth it is the best rule we can lay down negroes a species of property personal estate if negroes are taken into the computation of numbers to ascertain wealth they ought to be in settling the representation     the massachusetts fisheries and navigation ought to be taken into consideration the young and old negroes are a burthen to their owners the eastern colonies have a great advantage in trade this will give them a superiority we shall be governed by our interests and ought to be if i am satisfied in the rule of levying and appropriating money i am willing the small colonies should have a vote  wilson if the war continues two years each soul will have forty dollars to pay of the public debt it will be the greatest     encouragement to continue slavekeeping and to increase it that can be to exempt them from the numbers which are to vote and pay slaves are taxables in the southern colonies it will be partial and unequal some colonies have as many black as white these will not pay more than half what they ought slaves prevent freemen from cultivating a country it is attended with many inconveniences lynch if it is debated whether their slaves are their property there is an end of the confederation our slaves being our property why should they be taxed more than the land sheep cattle horses c freemen cannot be got to work in our colonies it is not in the ability or inclination of freemen to do the work that the negroes do carolina has taxed their negroes so have other colonies their lands dr franklin slaves rather weaken than strengthen the state and there is therefore some difference between them and sheep sheep will never make any insurrections rutledge i shall be happy to get rid of the idea of slavery the slaves do not signify property the old and young cannot work the property of some colonies is to be taxed in others not the eastern colonies will become the carriers for the southern they will obtain wealth for which they will not be taxed august   hooper north carolina is a striking exception to the general rule that was laid down yesterday that the riches of a country are in proportion to the numbers of inhabitants a gentleman of three or four hundred negroes dont raise more corn than feeds them a laborer cant be hired for less than twentyfour pounds a year in massachusetts bay the net profit of a negro is not more than five or six pounds per annum i wish to see the day that slaves are not necessary whites and negroes cannot work together negroes are goods and chattels are property a negro works under the impulse of fear has no care of his masters interest      the consideration of the seventeenth article resumed  article    dr franklin moves that votes should be in proportion to numbers mr middleton moves that the vote should be according to what they pay sherman thinks we ought not to vote according to numbers we are representatives of states not individuals states of holland the consent of every one is necessary three colonies would govern the whole but would not have a majority of strength to carry those votes into execution the vote should be taken two ways call the colonies and call the individuals and have a majority of both dr rush  abbé raynal has attributed the ruin of the united provinces to three causes the principal one is that the consent of every state is necessary the other that the members are obliged to consult their constituents upon all occasions we lose an equal representation we represent the people it will tend to keep up colonial distinctions we are now a new nation  00 our trade language customs manners dont differ more than they do in great britain the more a man aims at serving america the more he serves his colony it will promote factions in congress and in the states it will prevent the growth of freedom in america we shall be loth to admit new colonies into the confederation if we vote by numbers liberty will be always safe massachusetts is contiguous to two small colonies rhode island and new hampshire pennsylvania is near new jersey and delaware virginia is between maryland and north carolina we have been too free with the word independence we are dependent on each other not totally independent states montesquieu pronounces the confederation of lycia the best that ever was made the cities had different weights in the scale china is not larger than one of our colonies how populous it is said that the small colonies deposit their all this is deceiving us with a word i would not have it understood that i am pleading the cause of pennsylvania when i entered that door i considered myself a citizen of america dr witherspoon representation in england is unequal must i have three votes in a county because i have three  0  times as much money as my neighbor congress are to determine the limits of colonies g hopkins a momentous question many difficulties on each side four larger five lesser four stand indifferent virginia massachusetts pennsylvania maryland make more than half the people connecticut new york two carolinas not concerned at all the disinterested coolness of these colonies ought to determine i can easily feel the reasoning of the larger colonies pleasing theories always gave way to the prejudices passions and interests of mankind the germanic confederation the king of prussia has an equal vote the helvetic confederacy it cant be expected that nine colonies will give way to be governed by four the safety of the whole depends upon the distinctions of colonies dr franklin i hear many ingenious arguments to persuade us that an unequal representation is a very good thing if we had been born and bred under an unequal representation we might bear it but to set out with an unequal representation is unreasonable it is said the great colonies will swallow up the less scotland said the same thing at the union dr witherspoon rises to explain a few circumstances relating to scotland that was an incorporating union not a federal the nobility and gentry resort to england in determining all questions each state shall have a weight in proportion to what it contributes to the public expenses of the united states  august    limiting the bounds of states which by charter c extend to the south sea sherman thinks the bounds ought to be settled a majority of states have no claim to the south sea moves this amendment  0  to be substituted in place of this clause and also instead of the fifteenth article—no lands to be separated from any state which are already settled or become private property chase denies that any colony has a right to go to the south sea harrison how came maryland by its land but by its charter by its charter virginia owns to the south sea gentlemen shall not pare away the colony of virginia rhode island has more generosity than to wish the massachusetts pared away delaware does not wish to pare away pennsylvania huntington admit there is danger from virginia does it follow that congress has a right to limit her bounds the consequence is not to enter into confederation but as to the question of right we all unite against mutilating charters i cant agree to the principle we are a spectacle to all europe i am not so much alarmed at the danger from virginia as some are my fears are not alarmed they have acted as noble a part as any i doubt not the wisdom of virginia will limit themselves a mans right does not cease to be a right because it is large the question of right must be determined by the principles of the common law stone this argument is taken up upon very wrong ground it is considered as if we were voting away the territory of particular colonies and gentlemen work themselves up into warmth upon that supposition suppose virginia should the small colonies have a right to happiness and security they would have no safety if the great colonies were not limited we shall grant lands in small quantities without rent or tribute or purchasemoney it is said that virginia is attacked on every side is it meant that virginia shall sell the lands for their own emolument all the colonies have defended these lands against the king of britain and at the expense of all does virginia intend to establish quit rents i dont mean that the united states shall sell them to get money by them jefferson i protest against the right of congress to decide upon the right of virginia virginia has released all claims to the land settled by maryland c   0  autobiography      september at the appointed time we returned to philadelphia and congress were reassembled mr richard penn had sailed for england and carried the petition from which mr dickinson and his party expected relief i expected none and was wholly occupied in measures to support the army and the expedition into canada every important step was opposed and carried by bare majorities which obliged me to be almost constantly engaged in debate but i was not content with all that was done and almost every day i had something to say about advising the states to institute governments to express my total despair of any good from the petition or any of those things which were called conciliatory measures i constantly insisted that all such measures instead of having any tendency to produce a reconciliation would only be considered as proofs of our timidity and want of confidence in the ground we stood on and would only encourage our enemies to greater exertions against us that we should be driven to the necessity of declaring ourselves independent states and that we ought now to be employed in preparing a plan of confederation for the colonies and treaties to be proposed to foreign powers particularly to france and spain that all these measures ought to be maturely considered and carefully prepared together with a declaration of independence that these three measures independence confederation and negotiations with foreign powers particularly france ought to go hand in hand and be adopted all together that foreign powers could not be expected to acknowledge us till we had acknowledged ourselves and taken our station among them as a sovereign power and independent nation  that now  0  we were distressed for want of artillery arms ammunition clothing and even for flints that the people had no markets for their produce wanted clothing and many other things which foreign commerce alone could fully supply and we could not expect commerce till we were independent that the people were wonderfully well united and extremely ardent there was no danger of our wanting support from them if we did not discourage them by checking and quenching their zeal that there was no doubt of our ability to defend the country to support the war and maintain our independence we had men enough our people were brave and every day improving in all the exercises and discipline of war that we ought immediately to give permission to our merchants to fit out privateers and make reprisals on the enemy that congress ought to arm ships and commission officers and lay the foundation of a navy that immense advantages might be derived from this resource that not only west india articles in great abundance and british manufactures of all kinds might be obtained but artillery ammunitions and all kinds of supplies for the army that a system of measures taken with unanimity and pursued with resolution would insure us the friendship and assistance of france some gentlemen doubted of the sentiments of france thought she would frown upon us as rebels and be afraid to countenance the example i replied to those gentlemen that i apprehended they had not attended to the relative situation of france and england that it was the unquestionable interest of france that the british continental colonies should be independent that britain by the conquest of canada and her naval triumphs during the last war and by her vast possessions in america and the east indies was exalted to a height of power and preëminence that france must envy and could not endure but there was much more than pride and jealousy in the case her rank  0  her consideration in europe and even her safety and independence were at stake the navy of great britain was now mistress of the seas all over the globe the navy of france almost annihilated its inferiority was so great and obvious that all the dominions of france in the west indies and in the east indies lay at the mercy of great britain and must remain so as long as north america belonged to great britain and afforded them so many harbors abounding with naval stores and resources of all kinds and so many men and seamen ready to assist them and man their ships that interest could not lie that the interest of france was so obvious and her motives so cogent that nothing but a judicial infatuation of her councils could restrain her from embracing us that our negotiations with france ought however to be conducted with great caution and with all the foresight we could possibly obtain that we ought not to enter into any alliance with her which should entangle us in any future wars in europe that we ought to lay it down as a first principle and a maxim never to be forgotten to maintain an entire neutrality in all future european wars that it never could be our interest to unite with france in the destruction of england or in any measures to break her spirit or reduce her to a situation in which she could not support her independence on the other hand it could never be our duty to unite with britain in too great a humiliation of france that our real if not our nominal independence would consist in our neutrality if we united with either nation in any future war we must become too subordinate and dependent on that nation and should be involved in all european wars as we had been hitherto that foreign powers would find means to corrupt our people to influence our councils and in fine we should be little better than puppets danced on the wires of the cabinets of europe we should be the sport of european intrigues and politics that therefore in preparing treaties to be proposed to foreign powers and in the instructions to be given to our ministers we ought to confine ourselves strictly to a treaty of commerce that such a treaty would be an ample compensation to france for all the aid we should want from her the opening of american trade to her would be a vast resource for her commerce and naval power and a great assistance to her in protecting her east and west india possessions as well as her fisheries but that the bare dismemberment  0  of the british empire would be to her an incalculable security and benefit worth more than all the exertions we should require of her even if it should draw her into another eight or ten years war when i first made these observations in congress i never saw a greater impression made upon that assembly or any other attention and approbation were marked upon every countenance several gentlemen came to me afterwards to thank me for that speech particularly mr cæsar rodney of delaware and mr duane of new york i remember these two gentlemen in particular because both of them said that i had considered the subject of foreign connections more maturely than any man they had ever heard in america that i had perfectly digested the subject and had removed mr rodney said all and mr duane said the greatest part of his objections to foreign negotiations even mr dickinson said to gentlemen out of doors that i had thrown great light on the subject these and such as these were my constant and daily topics sometimes of reasoning and no doubt often of declamation from the meeting of congress in the autumn of      through the whole winter and spring of      many motions were made and after tedious discussions lost i received little assistance from my colleagues in all these contests three of them were either inclined to lean towards mr dickinsons system or at least chose to be silent and the fourth spoke but rarely in congress and never entered into any extensive arguments though when he did speak his sentiments were clear and pertinent and neatly expressed mr richard henry lee of virginia mr sherman of connecticut and mr gadsden of south carolina were always on my side and mr chase of maryland when he did speak at all was always powerful and generally with us mr johnson of maryland was the most frequent speaker from that state and while he remained with us was inclined to mr dickinson for some time but ere long he and all his state came cordially into our system in the fall of      his state appointed him general of militia and he marched to the relief of general washington in the jerseys he was afterwards chosen governor of maryland and he came no more to congress in the course of this winter appeared a phenomenon in philadelphia  0  a disastrous meteor i mean thomas paine he came from england and got into such company as would converse with him and ran about picking up what information he could concerning our affairs and finding the great question was concerning independence he gleaned from those he saw the commonplace arguments such as the necessity of independence at some time or other the peculiar fitness at this time the justice of it the provocation to it our ability to maintain it c c dr rush put him upon writing on the subject furnished him with the arguments which had been urged in congress a hundred times and gave him his title of common sense in the latter part of winter or early in the spring he came out with his pamphlet the arguments in favor of independence i liked very well but one third part of the book was filled with arguments from the old testament to prove the unlawfulness of monarchy and another third in planning a form of government for the separate states in one assembly and for the united states in a congress his arguments from the old testament were ridiculous but whether they proceeded from honest ignorance or foolish superstition on one hand or from wilful sophistry and knavish hypocrisy on the other i know not the other third part relative to a form of government i considered as flowing from simple ignorance and a mere desire to please the democratic party in philadelphia at whose head were mr matlack mr cannon and dr young i regretted however to see so foolish a plan recommended to the people of the united states who were all waiting only for the countenance of congress to institute their state governments i dreaded the effect so popular a pamphlet might have among the people and determined to do all in my power to counteract the effect of it my continual occupations in congress allowed me no time to write any thing of any length but i found moments to write a small pamphlet which mr richard henry lee to whom i showed it liked so well that he insisted on my permitting him to publish it he accordingly got mr dunlap to print it under the title of thoughts on government in a letter from a gentleman to his friend common sense was published without a name and i thought it best to suppress my name too but as common sense when it first appeared was generally by the public ascribed to me or mr samuel adams i soon regretted  0  that my name did not appear afterwards i had a new edition of it printed with my name and the name of mr wythe of virginia to whom the letter was at first intended to be addressed  the gentlemen of new york availed themselves of the ideas in this morsel in the formation of the constitution of that state and mr lee sent it to the convention of virginia when they met to form their government and it went to north carolina new jersey and other states matlack cannon young and paine had influence enough however to get their plan adopted in substance in georgia and vermont as well as pennsylvania these three states have since found them such systems of anarchy if that expression is not a contradiction in terms that they have altered them and made them more conformable to my plan paine soon after the appearance of my pamphlet hurried away to my lodgings and spent an evening with me his business was to reprehend me for publishing my pamphlet said he was afraid it would do hurt and that it was repugnant to the plan he had proposed in his common sense i told him it was true it was repugnant and for that reason i had written it and consented to the publication of it for i was as much afraid of his work as he was of mine his plan was so democratical  without any restraints or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counterpoise that it must produce confusion and every evil work i told him further that his reasoning from the old testament was ridiculous and i could hardly think him sincere at this he laughed and said he had taken his ideas in that part from milton and then expressed a contempt of the old testament and indeed of the bible at large which surprised me he saw that i did not relish this and soon checked himself with these words however i have some thoughts of publishing my thoughts on religion but i believe it will be best to postpone it to the latter part of life this conversation passed in good humor without any harshness on either side but i perceived in him a conceit of himself and a daring impudence which have been developed more and more to this day the third part of common sense which relates wholly to the question of independence was clearly written and contained a  0  tolerable summary of the arguments which i had been repeating again and again in congress for nine months but i am bold to say there is not a fact nor a reason stated in it which had not been frequently urged in congress the temper and wishes of the people supplied every thing at that time and the phrases suitable for an emigrant from newgate or one who had chiefly associated with such company such as the royal brute of england the blood upon his soul and a few others of equal delicacy had as much weight with the people as his arguments it has been a general opinion that this pamphlet was of great importance in the revolution i doubted it at the time and have doubted it to this day it probably converted some to the doctrine of independence and gave others an excuse for declaring in favor of it but these would all have followed congress with zeal and on the other hand it excited many writers against it particularly plain truth who contributed very largely to fortify and inflame the party against independence and finally lost us the allens penns and many other persons of weight in the community notwithstanding these doubts i felt myself obliged to paine for the pains he had taken and for his good intentions to serve us which i then had no doubt of i saw he had a capacity and a ready pen and understanding he was poor and destitute i thought we might put him into some employment where he might be useful and earn a living congress appointed a committee of foreign affairs not long after and they wanted a clerk i nominated thomas paine supposing him a ready writer and an industrious man dr witherspoon the president of new jersey college and then a delegate from that state rose and objected to it with an earnestness that surprised me the doctor said he would give his reasons he knew the man and his communication when he first came over he was on the other side and had written pieces against the american cause that he had afterwards been employed by his friend robert aitkin and finding the tide of popularity run rapidly he had turned about that he was very intemperate and could not write until he had quickened his thoughts with large draughts of rum and water that he was in short a bad character and not fit to be placed in such a situation general roberdeau spoke in his favor no one confirmed witherspoons account though the   0 truth of it has since been sufficiently established congress appointed him but he was soon obnoxious by his manners and dismissed there was one circumstance in his conversation with me about the pamphlets which i could not account for he was extremely earnest to convince me that common sense was his first born declared again and again that he had never written a line nor a word that had been printed before common sense i cared nothing for this and said nothing but dr witherspoons account of his writing against us brought doubts into my mind of his veracity which the subsequent histories of his writings and publications in england when he was in the customhouse did not remove at this day it would be ridiculous to ask any questions about tom paines veracity integrity or any other virtue i was incessantly employed through the whole fall winter and spring of      and      in congress during their sittings and on committees on mornings and evenings and unquestionably did more business than any other member of that house in the beginning of may i procured the appointment of a committee to prepare a resolution recommending to the people of the states to institute governments the committee of whom i was one requested me to draught a resolve which i did and by their direction reported it  opposition was made to it and mr duane called it a machine to fabricate independence but on the   th of may      it passed it was indeed on all hands considered by men of understanding as equivalent to a declaration of independence though a formal declaration of it was still opposed by mr dickinson and his party not long after this the three greatest measures of all were carried three committees were appointed one for preparing a declaration of independence another for reporting a plan of a treaty to be proposed to france and a third to digest a system of articles of confederation to be proposed to the states i was appointed on the committee of independence and on that for preparing the form of a treaty with france on the committee of confederation mr samuel adams was appointed the committee of independence were thomas jefferson john     adams benjamin franklin roger sherman and robert r livingston mr jefferson had been now about a year a member of congress but had attended his duty in the house a very small part of the time and when there had never spoken in public during the whole time i sat with him in congress i never heard him utter three sentences together it will naturally be inquired how it happened that he was appointed on a committee of such importance there were more reasons than one mr jefferson had the reputation of a masterly pen he had been chosen a delegate in virginia in consequence of a very handsome public paper which he had written for the house of burgesses which had given him the character of a fine writer  another reason was that mr richard henry lee was not beloved by the most of his colleagues from virginia and mr jefferson was set up to rival and supplant him this could be done only by the pen for mr jefferson could stand no competition with him or any one else in elocution and public debate here i will interrupt the narration for a moment to observe that from all i have read of the history of greece and rome england and france and all i have observed at home and abroad eloquence in public assemblies is not the surest road to fame or preferment at least unless it be used with caution very rarely and with great reserve the examples of washington franklin and jefferson are enough to show that silence and reserve in public are more efficacious than argumentation or oratory a public speaker who inserts himself or is urged by others into the conduct of affairs by daily exertions to justify his measures and answer the objections of opponents makes himself too familiar with the public and unavoidably makes himself enemies few persons can bear to be outdone in reasoning or declamation or wit or sarcasm or repartee or satire and all these things are very apt to grow out of public debate in this way in a course of years a nation becomes full of a mans enemies or at least of such as have been galled in some controversy and take a secret pleasure in assisting to humble and mortify him so much for this digression we will now return to our memoirs     the committee had several meetings in which were proposed the articles of which the declaration was to consist and minutes made of them the committee then appointed mr jefferson and me to draw them up in form and clothe them in a proper dress  the subcommittee met and considered the minutes     making such observations on them as then occurred when mr jefferson desired me to take them to my lodgings and     make the draught this i declined and gave several reasons for declining   that he was a virginian and i a massachusettensian       that he was a southern man and i a northern one   that i had been so obnoxious for my early and constant zeal in promoting the measure that any draught of mine would undergo a more severe scrutiny and criticism in congress than one of his composition   and lastly and that would be reason enough if there were no other i had a great opinion of the elegance of his pen and none at all of my own i therefore insisted that no hesitation should be made on his part he accordingly took the minutes and in a day or two produced to me his draught whether i made or suggested any correction i remember not the report was made to the committee of five by them examined but whether altered or corrected in any thing i cannot recollect but in substance at least it was reported to congress where after a severe criticism and striking out several of the most oratorical paragraphs it was adopted on the fourth of july      and published to the world     the committee for preparing the model of a treaty to be proposed to france consisted of mr dickinson mr franklin mr john adams mr harrison and mr robert morris when we met to deliberate on the subject i contended for the same principles which i had before avowed and defended in congress namely that we should avoid all alliance which might embarrass us in after times and involve us in future european wars that a treaty of commerce which would operate as a repeal of the british acts of navigation so far as respected us and admit france into an equal participation of the benefits of our commerce would encourage her manufactures increase her exports of the produce of her soil and agriculture extend her navigation and trade augment her resources of naval power raise her from her present deep humiliation distress and decay and place her on a more equal footing with england for the protection of her foreign possessions and maintaining her independence at sea would be an ample compensation to france for acknowledging our independence and for furnishing us for our money or upon credit for a time with such supplies of necessaries as we should want even if this conduct should involve her in a war if a war should ensue which did not necessarily follow for a bare acknowledgment of our independence after we had asserted it was not by the law of nations an act of hostility which would be a legitimate cause of war franklin although he was commonly as silent on committees as in congress upon this occasion ventured so far as to intimate his concurrence with me in these sentiments though as will be seen hereafter he shifted them as easily as the wind ever shifted and assumed a dogmatical tone in favor of an opposite system the committee after as much deliberation upon the subject as they chose to employ appointed me to draw up a plan and report franklin had made some marks with a pencil against some articles in a printed volume of treaties which he put into my hand some of these were judiciously selected and i took them with others which i found necessary into the draught and made my report to the committee at large who after a reasonable examination of it agreed to report it when it came before congress it occupied the attention of that body for several days many motions were made to insert in it articles of entangling alliance of exclusive privileges and of warranties of     possessions and it was argued that the present plan reported by the committee held out no sufficient temptation to france who would despise it and refuse to receive our ambassador it was chiefly left to me to defend my report though i had some able assistance and we did defend it with so much success that the treaty passed without one particle of alliance exclusive privilege or warranty          appendix   0     a the following abstract of the argument in the cause of writs of assistants or assistance is the one alluded to in the note to page     of this volume gridley the constables distraining for rates more inconsistent with english rights and liberties than writs of assistance and necessity authorizes both thacher i have searched in all the ancient repertories of precedents in fitzherberts natura brevium and in the register q what the register is and have found no such writ of assistance as this petition prays i have found two writs of assistance in the register but they are very different from the writ prayed for in a book intituled the modern practice of the court of exchequer there is indeed one such writ and but one by the act of parliament any other private person may as well as a customhouse officer take an officer a sheriff or constable c and go into any shop store c and seize any person authorized by such a writ under the seal of the court of exchequer may not customhouse officers only strange only a temporary thing the most material question is whether the practice of the exchequer will warrant this court in granting the same the act empowers all the officers of the revenue to enter and seize in the plantations as well as in england      william iii c    s   gives the same as        charles ii gives in england the ground of mr gridleys argument is this that this court has the power of the court of exchequer but this court has renounced the chancery jurisdiction which the exchequer has in cases where either party is the kings debtor q into that case in england all informations of uncustomed or prohibited importations are in the exchequer so that the customhouse officers are the officers of that court under the eye and direction of the barons the writ of assistance is not returnable if such seizure were brought before your honors you would often find a wanton exercise of their power at home the officers seize at their peril even with probable cause otis this writ is against the fundamental principles of law the privilege of house a man who is quiet is as secure in his house as a prince in his castle—notwithstanding all his debts and civil processes of any kind but— for flagrant crimes and in cases of great public necessity the privilege may be infringed on for felonies an officer may break upon process and oath     that is by a special warrant to search such a house sworn to be suspected and good grounds of suspicion appearing make oath coram lord treasurer or exchequer in england or a magistrate here and get a special warrant for the public good to infringe the privilege of house general warrant to search for felonies hawkins pleas of the crown every petty officer from the highest to the lowest and if some of them are common others are uncommon government justices used to issue such perpetual edicts q with what particular reference but one precedent and that in the reign of charles ii when star chamber powers and all powers but lawful and useful powers were pushed to extremity the authority of this modern practice of the court of exchequer it has an imprimatur but what may not have it may be owing to some ignorant clerk of the exchequer but all precedents and this among the rest are under the control of the principles of law lord talbot better to observe the known principles of law than any one precedent though in the house of lords as to acts of parliament an act against the constitution is void an act against natural equity is void and if an act of parliament should be made in the very words of this petition it would be void the executive courts must pass such acts into disuse   rep     from viner reason of the common law to control an act of parliament iron manufacture noble lords proposal that we should send our horses to england to be shod if an officer will justify under a writ he must return it    mod     perpetual writ statute charles ii we have all as good right to inform as customhouse officers and every man may have a general irreturnable commission to break houses by    of charles on oath before lord treasurer barons of exchequer or chief magistrate to break with an officer    c to issue a warrant requiring sheriffs c to assist the officers to search for goods not entered or prohibited      w  m gives officers in plantations same powers with officers in england continuance of writs and processes proves no more nor so much as i grant a special writ of assistance on special oath for special purpose pew indorsed warrant to ware justice walley searched house province law p     bill in chancery this court confined their chancery power to revenue c gridley by the      wm c    s   this authority of breaking and entering ships warehouses cellars c given to the customhouse officers in england by the statutes of the        of charles ii it is extended to the customhouse officers in the plantations and by the statute of   anne writs of assistance are continued in company with all other legal processes used for six months after the demise of the crown now what this writ of assistance is we can know only by books of precedents and we have produced in a book intituled the modern practice of the court of exchequer a form of such a writ of assistance to the officers of the customs the book has the imprimatur of wright c j of the k b which is as great a sanction as any books of precedents ever have although books of reports are usually approved by all the     judges and i take brown the author of this book to have been a very good collector of precedents i have two volumes of precedents of his collection which i look upon as good as any except coke and rastall and the power given in this writ is no greater infringement of our liberty than the method of collecting taxes in this province everybody knows that the subject has the privilege of house only against his fellow subjects not versus the king either in matters of crime or fine  the report of a part of mr otiss speech as given in minots history must have been written out by mr adams at a later moment in his own copy of that work he has underlined the passages in it which he says were interpolated by the person who furnished it for publication it is no more than just to all parties the speaker as well as the reporter that the correct version should be given— may it please your honors i was desired by one of the court to look into the books and consider the question now before them concerning writs of assistance i have accordingly considered it and now appear not only in obedience to your order but likewise in behalf of the inhabitants of this town who have presented another petition and out of regard to the liberties of the subject and i take this opportunity to declare that whether under a fee or not for in such a cause as this i despise a fee i will to my dying day oppose with all the powers and faculties god has given me all such instruments of slavery on the one hand and villany on the other as this writ of assistance is it appears to me the worst instrument of arbitrary power the most destructive of english liberty and the fundamental principles of law that ever was found in an english lawbook i must therefore beg your honors patience and attention to the whole range of an argument that may perhaps appear uncommon in many things as well as to points of learning that are more remote and unusual that the whole tendency of my design may the more easily be perceived the conclusions better discerned and the force of them be better felt i shall not think much of my pains in this cause as i engaged in it from principle i was solicited to argue this cause as advocategeneral and because i would not i have been charged with desertion from my office to this charge i can give a very sufficient answer i renounced that office and i argue this cause from the same principle and i argue it with the greater pleasure as it is in favor of british liberty at a time when we hear the greatest monarch upon earth declaring from his throne that he glories in the name of briton and that the privileges of his people are dearer to him than the most valuable prerogatives of his crown and as it is in opposition to a kind of power the exercise of which in former periods of english history cost one king of england his head and another his throne i have taken more pains in this cause than i ever will take again although my engaging in this and another popular cause has raised much resentment but i think i can sincerely declare that i cheerfully submit myself to every odious name for conscience sake and from my soul i despise all those whose guilt malice or folly has made them     my foes let the consequences be what they will i am determined to proceed the only principles of public conduct that are worthy of a gentleman or a man are to sacrifice estate ease health and applause and even life to the sacred calls of his country these manly sentiments in private life make the good citizen in public life the patriot and the hero i do not say that when brought to the test i shall be invincible i pray god i may never be brought to the melancholy trial but if ever i should it will be then known how far i can reduce to practice principles which i know to be founded in truth in the mean time i will proceed to the subject of this writ in the first place may it please your honors i will admit that writs of one kind may be legal that is special writs directed to special officers and to search certain houses c specially set forth in the writ may be granted by the court of exchequer at home upon oath made before the lord treasurer by the person who asks it that he suspects such goods to be concealed in those very places he desires to search the act of    charles ii which mr gridley mentions proves this and in this light the writ appears like a warrant from a justice of the peace to search for stolen goods your honors will find in the old books concerning the office of a justice of the peace precedents of general warrants to search suspected houses but in more modern books you will find only special warrants to search such and such houses specially named in which the complainant has before sworn that he suspects his goods are concealed and you will find it adjudged that special warrants only are legal in the same manner i rely on it that the writ prayed for in this petition being general is illegal it is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer i say i admit that special writs of assistance to search special places may be granted to certain persons on oath but i deny that the writ now prayed for can be granted for i beg leave to make some observations on the writ itself before i proceed to other acts of parliament in the first place the writ is universal being directed to all and singular justices sheriffs constables and all other officers and subjects so that in short it is directed to every subject in the kings dominions every one with this writ may be a tyrant if this commission be legal a tyrant in a legal manner also may control imprison or murder any one within the realm in the next place it is perpetual there is no return a man is accountable to no person for his doings every man may reign secure in his petty tyranny and spread terror and desolation around him in the third place a person with this writ in the daytime may enter all houses shops c at will and command all to assist him fourthly by this writ not only deputies c but even their menial servants are allowed to lord it over us now one of the most essential branches of english liberty is the freedom of ones house a mans house is his castle and whilst he is quiet he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle this writ if it should be declared legal would totally annihilate this privilege customhouse officers may enter our houses when they please we are commanded to permit their entry their menial servants may enter may break locks bars and every thing in their way and whether they break through malice or revenge no man no court can inquire bare suspicion without oath is sufficient this wanton exercise of this power is not a chimerical suggestion of a heated brain i will mention some facts mr pew had one of these writs and     when mr ware succeeded him he endorsed this writ over to mr ware so that these writs are negotiable from one officer to another and so your honors have no opportunity of judging the persons to whom this vast power is delegated another instance is this mr justice walley had called this same mr ware before him by a constable to answer for a breach of sabbathday acts or that of profane swearing as soon as he had finished mr ware asked him if he had done he replied yes well then said mr ware i will show you a little of my power i command you to permit me to search your house for uncustomed goods and went on to search his house from the garret to the cellar and then served the constable in the same manner but to show another absurdity in this writ if it should be established i insist upon it every person by the    charles ii has this power as well as customhouse officers the words are it shall be lawful for any person or persons authorized c what a scene does this open every man prompted by revenge ill humor or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbors house may get a writ of assistance others will ask it from selfdefence one arbitrary exertion will provoke another until society be involved in tumult and in blood again these writs are not returned writs in their nature are temporary things when the purposes for which they are issued are answered they exist no more but these live forever no one can be called to account thus reason and the constitution are both against this writ let us see what authority there is for it not more than one instance can be found of it in all our lawbooks and that was in the zenith of arbitrary power namely in the reign of charles ii when starchamber powers were pushed to extremity by some ignorant clerk of the exchequer but had this writ been in any book whatever it would have been illegal all precedents are under the control of the principles of law lord talbot says it is better to observe these than any precedents though in the house of lords the last resort of the subject no acts of parliament can establish such a writ though it should be made in the very words of the petition it would be void an act against the constitution is void vid viner but these prove no more than what i before observed that special writs may be granted on oath and probable suspicion the act of      william iii that the officers of the plantations shall have the same powers c is confined to this sense that an officer should show probable ground should take his oath of it should do this before a magistrate and that such magistrate if he think proper should issue a special warrant to a constable to search the places that of   anne can prove no more     b page     the following abstract taken from one of mr adamss note books in addition to the interest attaching to the cause itself may serve as a specimen of his manner of getting up his cases for argument— case of michael corbet and others charged with the murder of lieutenant panton on the high seas    hen viii c    for pirates where traitors pirates thieves robbers murderers and confederates upon the sea many times escaped unpunished because the trial of their offences hath heretofore been ordered judged and determined before the admiral or his lieutenant or commissary after the course of the civil laws the nature whereof is that before any judgment of death can be given against the offenders either they must plainly confess their offences which they will never do without torture or pains or else their offences be so plainly and directly proved by witness indifferent such as saw their offences committed c for reformation whereof be it enacted that all treasons felonies robberies murders and confederacies hereafter to be committed in or upon the sea or in any other haven river creek or place where the admiral or admirals have or pretend to have the jurisdiction authority or power shall be inquired tried heard determined and judged in such shires and places in the realm as shall be limited by the kings commission c as if the offence had been done upon the land c after the common course of the laws of this realm sect   to inquire by the oaths of twelve good and lawful men c in the shire limited in the commission        william iii c   an act for the more effectual suppression of piracy all piracies felonies and robberies committed in or upon the sea or in any haven river creek or place where the admiral or admirals have power authority or jurisdiction may be examined inquired of tried heard determined and adjudged in any place at sea or upon the land in any of his majestys islands plantations colonies dominions forts or factories to be appointed for that purpose by the kings commission c under the great seal of england or the seal of the admiralty of england directed to all or any of the admirals viceadmirals rearadmirals judges of viceadmiralties or commanders of any of his majestys ships of war and also to all or any such person or persons as his majesty shall please to appoint c which said commissioners shall have full power jointly or severally by warrant under the hand and seal of them or any one of them to commit to safe custody any person c against whom information of piracy robbery or felony upon the sea shall be given upon oath c and to call and assemble a court of admiralty on shipboard or upon the land c and such persons so assembled shall have full authority according to the course of the admiralty to issue warrants for bringing     any persons accused of piracy or robbery before them to be tried c to summon and examine witnesses c and to do all things necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy robbery and felony and to give sentence and judgment of death and to award execution according to the civil law and the methods and rules of the admiralty this statute is the foundation of the special commission and of the present proceedings and upon it a question has been made by mr otis whether the prisoners have not a right to a jury he says that magna charta in a case of life at least must be expressly repealed not by implication or construction only and that in england a jury is summoned every day for the trial of such offences committed at sea but i think that the statute of    henry viii before cited explains this difficulty and this case seems to be but one instance among many others of the partial distinctions made between british subjects at home and abroad the civil law the course of the admiralty and the methods and rules of the admiralty will be construed to take away the benefit of a jury   mr otis from his first retainer in the cause has been very sanguine to move for a jury he has mentioned his resolution in all companies and last week at plymouth he mentioned it to the lieutenantgovernor and the rest of the judges mr fitch happening to hear of our design to move for a jury went to rummaging up acts of parliament to satisfy himself and found the   of george c    an act for the further preventing of robbery c and for declaring the law upon some points relating to pirates in the seventh section of this statute it is hereby declared that all and every person and persons who have committed or shall commit any offence or offences for which they ought to be adjudged deemed and taken to be pirates felons or robbers by an act made in the parliament holden in the        years of william iii intituled an act for the more effectual suppression of piracy may be tried and judged for every such offence in such manner and form as in and by an act    henry viii is directed and appointed for the trial of pirates this statute fitch discovered to sewall and sewall showed it to the governor and lieutenantgovernor and the rest of the court the first morning of the courts sitting in the council chamber they were all struck and surprized and the lieutenantgovernor observed that this statute cleared up what had always to him appeared a mystery in the state trials vol       the trial of stede bonnet before judge trott at carolina        george i it being the next year after the statute bonnet had a grand and petit jury in the council chamber the court however agreed that they would go into the court house and take the oaths c and then the court would publicly propose a jury this was done and the statutes    henry viii        william iii and   george i were read and then the commission c and then the governor proposed to adjourn the court to thursday and to hear counsel this afternoon in the council chamber upon the subject of a jury in the afternoon we accordingly attended and a difficulty was started by the lieutenantgovernor about the venires whether they should be directed to the sheriff to summon a jury as in england or whether the venires should issue in any manner analogous to the laws of this province relative to this subject in     the afternoon we had the argument and the whole court seemed convinced that a jury must be had the governor indeed talked that they might be sent to england for trial c but the next morning when mr otis was to have prepared and produced a venire facias to the sheriff to return a jury we found all aback the whole court advocategeneral mr sewall and mr fitch all of opinion that we had been all wrong and that a jury could not be had the lieutenantgovernor had in the course of his lucubrations discovered this great secret that by law two ways of trial are pointed out and provided one by    henry viii the other by        of william iii and that his majesty may grant a commission in pursuance of either that this commission was expressly limited to        william iii and therefore could not proceed according to    henry viii but the first question that is to be made according to my opinion is whether impresses in any cases are legal for if impresses are always illegal and lieutenant panton acted as an impress officer michael corbet and his associates had a right to resist him and if they could not otherwise preserve their liberty to take away his life his blood must lie at his own door and they be held guiltless nay i think that impresses may be allowed to be legal and yet corbet might have a right to resist to be more particular when i say impresses may be legal i mean that the lieutenant or other officer who impresses may not be liable to any action of false imprisonment at the suit of the party or to any indictment at the suit of the crown for an assault or riot the custom may be admitted to extend so far and yet it will not follow that the seaman has not a right to resist and keep himself out of the officers power if he can and whatever may be said of the antiquity of the custom c it is very remarkable that no statute has ever been made to establish or even to approve it and no single judgment of any court of law can be found in favor of it it is found in the commissions of the admiralty and in warrants from the admiralty but nowhere else however the general question concerning the legality of impresses may be determined i humbly conceive it clear that in america they are illegal and that by a particular statute i mean   anne c    s   no mariner or other person who shall serve on board or be retained to serve on board any privateer or trading ship or vessel that shall be employed in any part of america nor any mariner or other person being on shore in any part thereof shall be liable to be impressed or taken away or shall be impressed or taken away by any officer or officers of or belonging to any of her majestys ships of war empowered by the lordhighadmiral or any other person whatsoever unless such mariner shall have deserted c upon pain that any officer or officers so impressing or taking away or causing to be impressed or taken away any mariner or other person contrary to the tenor and true meaning of this act shall forfeit to the master or owner or owners of any such ship or vessel twenty pounds for every man he or they shall so impress or take to be recovered with full costs of suit in any court within any part of her majestys dominions this statute is clear and decisive and if it is now in force it places the illegality of all impresses in america beyond controversy no mariner on board any trading vessel in any part of america shall be liable to be impressed or shall be impressed by any officer empowered by the lordadmiral or any other person if therefore this statute is now in force all that lieutenant panton     did on board the vessel was tortious and illegal he was a trespasser from the beginning a trespasser in coming on board and in every act that he did until he received the mortal fatal wound he was a trespasser in going down below but especially in firing a pistol among the men in the fore peak it is said that the lieutenant with his own hand discharged this pistol directly at michael corbet but the ball missed him and wounded the man who was next him in the arm this therefore was a direct commencement of hostilities it was an open act of piracy and corbet and his associates had a right and it was their duty to defend themselves it was a direct attempt upon their lives and surely these unhappy persons had a right to defend their lives no customhouse officer no impressofficer has a right to attempt life but it seems that a second pistol was discharged and wounded corbet in his cheek with powder before the fatal blow was struck what could corbet expect should he stand still and be shot or should he have surrendered to a pirate should he have surrendered to the impress but it has been made a question whether this statute of   anne is now in force it has been reported as the opinion of sir dudley rider and sir john strange that this statute expired with the war of queen anne these are venerable names but their opinions are opinions only of private men and there has been no judicial decision to this purpose in any court of law and i trust never will be their opinions were expressed so very concisely that there is great room to question whether they were given upon the whole act or only on some particular clause in it supposing these opinions to extend to the whole act i have taken pains to discover what reasons can be produced in support of them and i confess i can think of none there is not the least color for such an opinion on the contrary there is every argument for supposing the act perpetual   it is a good rule to consider the title of an act in order to ascertain its construction and operation in all respects the title of this is an act for the encouragement of the trade to america encouragement of the trade to america is the professed object end and design of this law is this trade only valuable in time of war if the trade to america existed and was carried on only in time of war the act made for the encouragement of it must expire when the trade expired at the end of the war but the trade did not expire with the war but continued after it and therefore the encouragement given it by this act continued and survived too this is of equal importance in peace as in war and there is stronger reason why it should be encouraged by exempting seamen from impresses in peace than in war because there is not the same necessity for impressing seamen in peace as there is in war   the preamble furnishes another argument to prove the act perpetual for advancement of the trade of her majestys kingdom of great britain to and in the several parts of america this is one end of this law is not this end as beneficial and important in peace as in war has there been a year a day an hour since   0  when this act was made when the trade of great britain to and in the several parts of america was of less consequence to the nation than it was at that time surely the advancement of the british american trade is a perpetual object it is no temporary object or expedient it has lasted these sixty years and i hope will last a thousand longer   for the increase of shipping and of seamen for the purposes mentioned   0 before in the preamble is another end of this law now shipping and seamen are useful and necessary to a commercial nation in times of peace as well as war   some clauses in this statute are in their nature temporary and limited to the duration of the war sections               c others are expressly limited to the continuance of war as s    during the continuance of the present war and s    during the continuance thereof and s    but s   and s  0 are not by the nature of them limited to war they are not expressly and in terms limited to years or to war   if it be not now in force why is it bound up in the statute book and why was not the whole act limited to years or to war if it be once established as a fact that lieutenant panton acted in the character of an impressofficer not in that of an officer of the customs and if it be also established as law that no officer has a legal right to impress a seaman our next inquiry must be what the rules of the civil law are relative to homicide in cases of selfdefence selfpreservation is the first law of nature selflove is the strongest principle in our breasts and selfpreservation not only our inalienable right but our clearest duty by the law of nature this right and duty are both confirmed by the municipal laws of every civilized society   domat     s   he who is attacked by robbers or by other persons that are armed in such a manner as to put him in danger of his life in case he does not defend himself may kill the robber or the aggressor without any fear of being punished as a murderer woods inst civil law   0 necessary homicide is when one for the defence of his own life kills the aggressor this may be done without expecting the first blow for that may make him incapable to defend himself at all but this ought not to exceed the bounds of selfdefence the manner of selfdefence directs that you should not kill if you can by any means escape c cod lib   tit      de eo qui salutem suam defendit is qui aggressorem vel quemcunque alium in

distinction between homicide with deliberation and without deliberation according to the civil law which is analogous to that of the common law between murder and manslaughter but the case of these prisoners does not require this distinction i am not contending for the sentence of manslaughter against my clients i think they are entitled to an honorable acquittal they have committed no crime whatever but they have behaved with all that prudence and moderation and at the same time with that fortitude and firmness that the law requires and approves     mr panton and his associates and attendants had no authority for what they did they were trespassers and rioters the evidence must be carefully recapitulated their arms swords pistols c their threats and menaces pantons orders for more men his orders to break down the bulkhead their execution of these orders their fetching the adze and the crow but above all their discharge of a pistol right in the face of corbet which though loaded only with powder wounded him so badly in his lip—these circumstances are abundantly sufficient to show who was the first aggressor and to show that the lives of the present prisoners were in danger what could corbet think when a pistol had been presented at his mouth and discharged loaded he knew not with what it had wounded him he knew not how badly he saw a desperate gang of armed sailors before him other pistols cocked and presented at him and his companions their heads and breasts drawn swords in the hands of some continued threats to blow their brains out could he expect any thing but death in these circumstances what could he do but defend himself as he did in these circumstances what was his duty he had an undoubted right not merely to make a push at lieutenant panton but to have darted an harpoon a dagger through the heart of every man in the whole gang if mr panton came as a customhouse officer and it may be true that he came in part to search the ship for uncustomed goods he had a fair opportunity to do it he asked and was told that the hatchways were open he ordered the lazaretto open and it was done and after this instead of searching for uncustomed goods he proceeds directly to search for seamen the killing of lieutenant panton was justifiable homicide homicide se defendendo   hawkins    s   middle the killing of dangerous rioters by any private

manslaughter also     a question has been started by sir francis barnard whether as there is no distinction between murder and manslaughter in the civil law the court can allow clergy if they find the prisoners guilty of manslaughter that is whether the court can do any thing but pass sentence of death and respite execution and recommend them to mercy he said he had formerly attended at the admiralty sessions in england and had heard it said by the court that clergy was expressly taken away by these statutes from manslaughter and the court could not grant it but see a paragraph in foster to the contrary     in this case i shall not make a question whether corbet and others are guilty of murder or of manslaughter i am clear they are guilty of neither all that they did was justifiable selfdefence or to use the expressions of most writers upon crown law it was justifiable and necessary homicide se defendendo this will be fully shown by a particular examination of the law and of the evidence but it may not be amiss to consider the observation of sir francis in order to remove the clouds from his brain   it is total ignorance to say there is no distinction between murder and manslaughter in civil law as appears abundantly already    i say that clergy is not expressly taken away by the statutes from manslaughter by the    henry viii all felonies are to be tried according to the common course of the laws of this land what is the common course of the laws of the land relative to manslaughter which is a felony it has its clergy it is true the word manslaughter is once mentioned in the statutes of henry viii c    s   every indictment found c of treasons felonies robberies murders manslaughters or such other offences c that then such order c judgment and execution shall be had as against such offences upon land what is the judgment versus manslaughter upon land they have their clergy s   for treasons robberies felonies murders and confederacies done at sea the offenders shall not have clergy here manslaughter is dropped so that clergy is not taken from manslaughter by this act by        william iii piracies felonies and robberies are mentioned but manslaughter is not the word is not in the whole statute it was needful to mention it in that of henry viii because the trial was to be by the law of the land and it clearly has its clergy but by this statute the trial and judgment and sentence were to be all by the civil law where the offence that is called     manslaughter by the common law is never punished with death but it is observable that clergy is not taken away by this statute from any crime by   george c    s   any pirate felon or robber within the        william may be tried in the manner and form of    henry viii and shall be excluded clergy we see that whenever the trial is to be by a jury and the common law clergy is excluded from such crimes as were not entitled to it upon land and the reason was because it is a known rule of law that when the legislature creates any new felony it shall be entitled to clergy if not expressly taken away doubts might arise whether making crimes at sea felonies was not creating new felonies and so they would be entitled to clergy to avoid this the clause was inserted lord raymond      from these cases it appears that though the law of england is so far peculiarly favorable i use the word peculiarly because i know no other law that makes such a distinction between murder and manslaughter as to permit the excess of anger and passion which a man ought to keep under and govern in some instances to extenuate the greatest of private injuries as the taking away a mans life is yet in those cases it must be such a passion as for the time deprived him of his reasoning faculties foster     if taking general verdicts of acquittal in plain cases of death per infortunium c deserveth the name of a deviation it is far short of what is constantly practised at an admiralty sessions under    henry viii with regard to offences not ousted of clergy by particular statutes which had they been committed at land would have been entitled to clergy in these cases the jury is constantly directed to acquit the prisoner because the marine law doth not allow of clergy in any case and therefore in an indictment for murder on the high seas if the fact cometh out upon evidence to be no more than manslaughter supposing it to have been committed at land the prisoner is constantly acquitted observations on the statutes     note z i have before observed that by the civil law as well as the law of scotland there is no such offence as what is with us termed manslaughter the scots therefore might have apprehended that if not convicted of murder they should have been acquitted     c page     the following is the draught of the articles referred to in connection with the declaration of rights and grievances made by the congress of      one of the most important papers of the revolutionary history in order to facilitate the comparison of the two they are here placed in parallel columns the verbal alterations are marked in italics heads of grievances and rights draught whereas since the accession of the present king parliament has claimed a power of right to bind the people of the colonies in north america by statutes in all cases whatsoever and for carrying the said power into execution has by some statutes expressly taxed the people of the said colonies and by divers other statutes under various pretences but in fact for the purpose of raising a revenue has imposed rates and duties payable in the said colonies established a board of commissioners and extended the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty therein for the collection of such rates and duties and whereas some of the said statutes are also intended to render all judges in the said colonies dependent upon the crown only and whereas since the said accession statutes have been made for quartering and supplying troops to be kept in the said colonies and whereas since the conclusion of the last war orders have been issued by the king that the authority of the commanderinchief and under him of the brigadiergeneral in the northern and southern departments in all military affairs shall be supreme and must be obeyed by the troops as such in all the civil governments in america and whereas a statute was made in the seventh year of this reign for suspending the proceedings of the assembly of new york c and assemblies in these colonies have of late years been very frequently dissolved and whereas during the present reign dutiful and reasonable petitions to the crown from the representatives of the people in these colonies have been repeatedly treated with contempt and whereas it has been lately resolved in parliament that by force of a statute made in the thirtyfifth year of henry viii colonists may be carried to england and tried there on accusations for offences committed in those colonies and by a statute made in the twelfth year of this reign such trials are directed in the cases therein mentioned and whereas in the last session of parliament three statutes were made and declared to have force within the province of massachusetts bay one of them for discontinuing c the landing c goods wares and merchandises at the town and within the harbor of boston c another for the better regulating the government c and the third for the impartial administration of justice c and whereas in the same session another statute was made for making more effectual provision for the government of the province of quebec c and whereas the good people of these colonies justly alarmed by the proceedings of parliament and administration have duly appointed and directed delegates to meet and sit in general congress at philadelphia in this month of september      in order to such establishment as that their religion laws and liberties may not be subverted upon which appointment and direction the said delegates being now assembled in a full and free representative of these colonies taking into their most serious consideration the best means for attaining the ends aforesaid do in the first place as their ancestors in like case have usually done for vindicating and asserting their rights and liberties declare—   that the power of making laws for ordering or regulating the internal polity of these colonies is within the limits of each colony respectively and exclusively vested in the provincial legislature of such colony and that all statutes for ordering or regulating the internal polity of the said colonies or any of them in any manner or in any case whatsoever are illegal and void   that all statutes for taxing the people of the said colonies are illegal and void   that all the statutes before mentioned for the purpose of raising a revenue by imposing rates and duties payable in these colonies establishing a board of commissioners and extending the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty for the collection of such rates and duties are illegal and void   that judges within these colonies ought not to be dependent on the crown only and that their commissions ought to be during good behavior   that the raising or keeping a standing army within these colonies in time of peace unless it be with the consent of the provincial legislatures is illegal pernicious and dangerous and that every statute for quartering or supplying troops within the said colonies is illegal and void   that the orders aforesaid for rendering the authority of the commanderinchief and under him of the brigadiersgeneral supreme are illegal and void   that for redress of all grievances and for the amending strengthening and preserving of the laws assemblies ought to be held in each of these colonies frequently and at least once in every year that such assemblies ought not to be prorogued or dissolved before they have had sufficient time to deliberate determine and bring to conclusion their counsels on public affairs that any statute for suspending the proceedings of any such assembly is illegal and void and that every dissolution of an assembly within these colonies during the present reign on pretence of misbehavior in the representatives of the people has been arbitrary and oppressive   that it is the right of the subjects to petition the king and that a contemptuous treatment of such petitions has a most pernicious tendency   that the resolution in parliament on the statute made in the thirtyfifth year of henry viii was arbitrary and erroneous and that any statute directing the trials of colonists to be had in england or elsewhere on accusation for offences committed in the colonies is illegal and void  0 that the three statutes made in the last session of parliament and declared to have force within the province of massachusetts bay are oppressive to the people of that province dangerous to the liberties of these colonies illegal and void    that the statute made in the same session for making more effectual provision for the government of the province of quebec c is not only unjust to the people in that province but dangerous to the interests of the protestant religion and of these colonies and ought to be repealed    and they do claim demand and insist on all and singular the rights and liberties before mentioned as indubitably belonging to them and no declarations judgments doings proceedings or statutes to the prejudice of the people in any of the premises ought in any wise to be drawn hereafter into consequence or example and these their undoubted rights and liberties with the blessing of divine providence which they humbly and ardently implore in favor of their just exertions to preserve the freedom of rendering to their creator the worship they judge most acceptable to him and of promoting the happiness of his creatures they are resolved to the utmost of their power to maintain and defend declaration as adopted whereas since the close of the last war the british parliament claiming a power of right to bind the people of america by statutes in all cases whatsoever hath in some acts expressly imposed taxes on them and in others under various pretences but in fact for the purpose of raising a revenue hath imposed rates and duties payable in these colonies established a board of commissioners with unconstitutional powers and extended the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty not only for collecting the said duties but for the trial of causes merely arising within the body of a county and whereas in consequence of other statutes judges who before held only estates at will in their offices have been made dependent on the crown alone for their salaries and standing armies kept in times of peace     and whereas it has lately been resolved in parliament that by force of a statute made in the thirtyfifth year of the reign of king henry viii colonists may be transported to england and tried there upon accusations for treasons and misprisions or concealment of treasons committed in the colonies and by a late statute such trials have been directed in cases therein mentioned and whereas in the last session of parliament three statutes were made one entitled an act to discontinue in such manner and for such time as are therein mentioned the landing and discharging lading or shipping of goods wares and merchandise at the town and within the harbor of boston in the province of massachusetts bay in north america another entitled an act for the better regulating the government of the province of massachusetts bay in new england and another entitled an act for the impartial administration of justice in the cases of persons questioned for any act done by them in the execution of the law or for the suppression of riots and tumults in the province of the massachusetts bay in new england and     another statute was then made for making more effectual provision for the government of the province of quebec c all which statutes are impolitic unjust and cruel as well as unconstitutional and most dangerous and destructive of american rights and whereas assemblies have been frequently dissolved contrary to the rights of the people when they attempted to deliberate on grievances and their dutiful humble loyal and reasonable petitions to the crown for redress have been repeatedly treated with contempt by his majestys ministers of state the good people of the several colonies of new hampshire massachusetts bay rhode island and providence plantations connecticut new york new jersey pennsylvania newcastle kent and sussex on delaware maryland virginia north carolina and south carolina justly alarmed at these arbitrary proceedings of parliament and administration have severally elected constituted and appointed deputies to meet and sit in general congress in the city of philadelphia in order to obtain such establishment as that their religion laws and liberties may not be subverted whereupon the deputies so appointed being now assembled in a full and free representation of these colonies taking into their most serious consideration the best means of attaining the ends aforesaid do in the first place as englishmen their ancestors in like cases have usually done for asserting and vindicating their rights and liberties declare— that the inhabitants of the english colonies in north america by the immutable laws of nature the principles of the english constitution and the several charters or compacts have the following rights—     resolved n c d   that they are entitled to life liberty and property and they have never ceded to any sovereign power whatever a right to dispose of either without their consent   that our ancestors who first settled these colonies were at the time of their emigration from the mother country entitled to all the rights liberties and immunities of free and natural born subjects within the realm of england   that by such emigration they by no means forfeited surrendered or lost any of those rights but that they were and their descendants now are entitled to the exercise and enjoyment of all such of them as their local and other circumstances enable them to exercise and enjoy   that the foundation of english liberty and of all free government is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council and as the english colonists are not represented and from their local and other circumstances cannot be properly represented in the british parliament they are entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures where their right of representation can alone be preserved in all cases of taxation and internal polity subject only to the negative of their sovereign in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed but from the necessity of the case and a regard to the mutual interest of both countries we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the british     parliament as are bonâ fide restrained to the regulation of our external commerce for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country and the commercial benefits of its respective members excluding every idea of taxation internal or external for raising a revenue on the subjects in america without their consent   that the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of england and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage according to the course of that law   that they are entitled to the benefit of such of the english statutes as existed at the time of their colonization and which they have by experience respectively found to be applicable to their several local and other circumstances   that these his majestys colonies are likewise entitled to all the immunities and privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters or secured by their several codes of provincial laws   that they have a right peaceably to assemble consider of their grievances and petition the king and that all prosecutions prohibitory proclamations   0 and commitments for the same are illegal   that the keeping a standing army in these colonies in times of peace without the consent of the legislature of that colony in which such army is kept is against law  0 it is indispensably necessary to good government and rendered essential by the english constitution that the constituent branches of the legislature be independent of each other that therefore the exercise of legislative power in several colonies by a council appointed during pleasure by the crown is unconstitutional dangerous and destructive to the freedom of american legislation all and each of which the aforesaid deputies in behalf of themselves and their constituents do claim demand and insist on as their indubitable rights and liberties which cannot be legally taken from them altered or abridged by any power whatever without their own consent by their representatives in their several provincial legislatures in the course of our inquiry we find many infringements and violations of the foregoing rights which from an ardent desire that harmony and mutual intercourse of affection and interest may be restored we pass over for the present and proceed to state such acts and measures as have been adopted since the last war which demonstrate a system formed to enslave america resolved n c d that the following acts of parliament are infringements and violations of the rights of the colonists and that the repeal of them is essentially necessary in order to restore harmony between great     britain and the american colonies namely— the several acts of   george iii c    and c      george iii c      george iii c      george iii c    and c      george iii c    which impose duties for the purpose of raising a revenue in america extend the power of the admiralty courts beyond their ancient limits deprive the american subject of trial by jury authorize the judges certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages that he might otherwise be liable to requiring oppressive security from a claimant of ships and goods seized before he shall be allowed to defend his property and are subversive of american rights also    george iii c    intituled an act for the better securing his majestys dockyards magazines ships ammunition and stores which declares a new offence in america and deprives the american subject of a constitutional trial by jury of the vicinage by authorizing the trial of any person charged with the committing any offence described in the said act out of the realm to be indicted and tried for the same in any shire or county within the realm also the three acts passed in the last session of parliament for stopping the port and blocking up the harbor of boston for altering the charter and government of massachusetts bay and that which is intituled an act for the better administration of justice c also the act passed in the same session for establishing the roman catholic religion in the province of quebec abolishing the equitable system of english laws and erecting a tyranny there to the great danger from so total a dissimilarity of religion law and government of the neighboring british colonies by the assistance of whose     blood and treasure the said country was conquered from france also the act passed in the same session for the better providing suitable quarters for officers and soldiers in his majestys service in north america also that the keeping a standing army in several of these colonies in time of peace without the consent of the legislature of that colony in which such army is kept is against law to these grievous acts and measures americans cannot submit but in hopes their fellow subjects in great britain will on a revision of them restore us to that state in which both countries found happiness and prosperity we have for the present only resolved to pursue the following peaceable measures   to enter into a nonimportation nonconsumption and nonexportation agreement or association   to prepare an address to the people of great britain and a memorial to the inhabitants of british america and   to prepare a loyal address to his majesty agreeable to resolutions already entered into end of volume ii   this is the first entry and is printed because it seems to have originated the plan of a diary it refers to one of the most memorable events of the kind which ever took place the destruction of the city of lisbon occurred on the first day of this month although less severe in its effects on this side of the atlantic it is yet remembered as the worst ever known in english america it seems to have been greater in massachusetts than any other colony in boston many chimneys and walls of houses were much shattered but no house thrown down the government noticed it by appointing a day of fasting and prayer  in the public exercises at commencement i was somewhat remarked as a respondent and mr maccarty of worcester who was empowered by the selectmen of that town to procure them a latin master for the grammar school engaged me to undertake it about three weeks after commencement in      when i was not yet twenty years of age a horse was sent me from worcester and a man to attend me we made the journey about sixty miles in one day and i entered on my office for three months i boarded with one greene at the expense of the town and by the arrangement of the selectmen here i found morgans moral philosopher which i was informed had circulated with some freedom in that town and

i asked them whether some measures might not be agreed upon at the bar and sanctioned by the court which might remedy the evil they thought it not only practicable but highly expedient and proposed meetings of the bar to deliberate upon it a meeting was called and a great number of regulations proposed not only for confining the practice of law to those who were educated to it and sworn to fidelity in it but to introduce more regularity urbanity candor and politeness as well as honor equity and humanity among the regular professors many of these meetings were the most delightful entertainments i ever enjoyed the spirit that reigned was that of solid sense generosity honor and integrity and the consequences were most happy for the courts and the bar instead of scenes of wrangling chicanery quibbling and ill manners were soon converted to order decency truth and candor mr pratt was so delighted with these meetings and their effects that when we all waited on him to

with success failed in his case from the want of both requisites jonathan sewall john adams jonathan sewall to john adams it gives me the most sensible pleasure to find in my friend so becoming a resolution to persevere in the sublime study of the law maugre all the difficulties and perplexing intricacies with which it seems embarrassed i call it a sublime study and what more sublime what more worthy the indefatigable labors and pursuit of a reasonable man than that science by which mankind raise themselves from the forlorn helpless state in which nature leaves them to the full enjoyment of all the inestimable blessings of social union and by which they if you will allow the expression triumph over the frailties and imperfections of humanity though in my last i mentioned the greatness of the task we have voluntarily set ourselves and the shortness of the time to which by the present constitution of things we are confined as an apology for my attempting to assist you in your progress and to justify you in making use of means so vastly disproportionate to the end i say though i hinted these things to these purposes yet i would not have you conclude from hence that i am discouraged from the pursuit no my friend i thank god i am at present far from a state of despondency the difficulties t is true are great but the motives to resolution and diligence are superior the obstacles are surmounted by the industrious are insurmountable only to the perversely indolent and effeminately irresolute for my own part i am determined as i have to return you a scripture metaphorical phrase put my hand to the plough not to look back and it is not the smallest encouragement that i have found in you a fellow traveller who if at any time through inattention inability or ignorance i should stop short or deviate can and i doubt not will kindly lend a helping hand and set me right your account of mr blackstones lectures is entirely new to me but i am greatly pleased with it the embellishments of historical and critical learning as well as the alluring ornaments of language too much neglected by law writers would undoubtedly render much more agreeable the study of the laws of england in their present system too abstracted and dry i could wish mr blackstone or some other friend to this invaluable branch of knowledge would undertake to abridge the reports that we might not be forced to throw away so much of our time upon needless repetitions   among the papers of mr adams is found an original letter of dr franklin addressed to the same mr quincy in the following year

interesting at this day it is here appended in its fragmentary state john adams  0 december      london edmund quincy to edmund quincy london  0 december      sir— i should sooner have answered your obliging letter of january   but that i hoped from time to time i might be able to obtain some satisfactory answer to your queries as yet i have done little that kind of information being looked upon as a part of the mysteries of trade which the professors are very shy of communicating but i think i am now in a train of obtaining more of which i hope soon to give you a good account in the mean time i may inform you that great quantities of wine are made both here and at bristol from raisins not by private families only for their particular use but in the great way by large dealers for the country consumption as new england trades to spain with their fish it would i imagine be easy for you to furnish yourself at the best hand with plenty of raisins and from thence produce a genuine wine of real worth that might be sold with you for good profit being lately at a friends house where i drank some old raisin wine that i found to be very good i requested the               sound and good it is thought here that by far the greatest part of the wine drank in england is made in england fine cider or perry is said to be the basis sloes afford roughness elder berries color and brandy a little more strength but of this i have no certain account the porter now so universally drank here is i am assured fined down with isinglass or fishglue for which sixty thousand pounds sterling per annum is paid to russia of late it has been discovered that this fishglue is nothing more than the sounds of cod or other fish extended and dried in the sun without any other preparation so you may make what quantity you please of it and cheap fish being with you so plenty i heartily wish you success in your attempts to make wine from american grapes none has yet been imported here for the premium with great esteem i am sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin p s the negotiations for a peace in which canada was to be forever ceded to england are at present broken off but whenever they are resumed i am persuaded that will be made a point     n b one ezekiel hatch near greenwoods mastyard tells me that the cod sounds or other may be saved by slinging up and drying that under this circumstance they will not dissolve in any liquor hot nor cold but that taken and wrapped up in clean linen cloth or other cloths and covered up in embers so as to roast them they will then dissolve and that they will answer the end of glue but not so well of cod as the sounds of hake which is caught in or near the fall those many joiners at distant places use as glue for their cabinet work roasted first in order to dissolve as glue   this question worked out by algebra is omitted   the rev zabdiel adams already once alluded to was a cousin of the author afterwards pastor of the

argument made three days later in one of the trifling and vexatious suits which seem to have been commonly indulged in at this period by persons offended with each other in the country towns   a practice to which the author adhered ever after as the volumes in his library abundantly show   of colonel gooch one of the singular characters of this period mr adams long afterwards in a letter addressed to jonathan mason a gentleman once his law pupil gave the following curious account— joseph gooch a native i believe of boston he had considerable property and was reported and reputed to be very rich he had been educated at the temple in england and returned to boston to practise law he had very little success he had been a man of pleasure and bore the indelible marks of it on his face to the grave he was extremely ambitious and the rev mr niles of the second parish in braintree who was well acquainted with him told me he was the most passionate man he ever knew not succeeding much at the bar in boston he had recourse to religion to assist him joined the old south church to avail himself of the influence of the sisterhood and set up for representative for the town of boston but failed and disappointed of his hopes in law and politics he renounced the city came up to quincy hired a house turned churchman and set himself to intriguing for promotion both in the military and civil departments he interceded with the favorites of governor shirley in this place to procure him the commission of colonel in the regiment of militia and an election for representative of the town in the general court he promised to build a steeple to their church at his own expense assiduous importunity was employed with governor shirley to procure him the command of the regiment but this could not be obtained without cashiering the colonel then in possession and who had long been in possession of that office and given universal satisfaction in it colonel john quincy had been in public life from his early youth he had been near twenty years speaker of the house of representatives and many years a member of his majestys council and was as much esteemed and respected as any man in the province he was not only an experienced and venerated statesman but a man of letters taste and sense shirley was with great difficulty prevailed on to perform the operation of dismissing so faithful a servant of the public and adopting one of so equivocal a character and he said some years afterwards that nothing he had ever done in his administration had given him so much pain as removing so venerable a magistrate and officer as colonel quincy but the church party had insisted upon it so peremptorily that he could not avoid it probably he dreaded their remonstrances to the archbishop of canterbury these facts were currently reported and universally believed and never contradicted gooch was appointed colonel and quincy dismissed the next thing to be done was to newmodel the subordinate officers in the regiment application was made to all the captains lieutenants and ensigns in that part of the regiment which lies within three parishes of the ancient town of braintree to see if they would accept commissions under colonel gooch and agree to vote for him as representative for the town the then present officers were men among the most respectable of the inhabitants in point of property understanding and character they rejected the proposition with scorn my father was among them he was offered a captains commission he spurned the offer with disdain would serve in the militia under no colonel but quincy almost or quite an entire set of new officers were appointed through the whole town these were of a very different character from those who were dismissed men of little property or no property at all men of frivolous characters in understanding and morals it was at this time the corrupt practice of treating as they called it at trainings and at elections was introduced which so long prevailed in the town of braintree all this corruption young as i was i attributed to the king of great britain and his governor and their bigoted episcopal party and young as i was i was thoroughly disgusted before i was ten years of age gooch under the influence of all this machinery obtained an election as representative but the next year all the substantial people of the town aroused themselves and turned him out which so enraged him that he swore he would no longer live in braintree renounced the church refused to build their steeple built him a house on milton hill and there passed the remainder of his days   here follows a legal opinion of mr gridley which is omitted   that is a sketch of what he intended to say   this appears to be the rough draft of an article designed for publication in the newspapers it is retained on account of its bearing upon the question of the appointment to fill the vacancy in the post of chief justice a question

judicial life of sir john willes appears to have escaped the attention of the same author who shows clearly enough in other ways the feeble interest he takes in this part of his work an account of it seems necessary to explain the allusion in the text even though it have no immediate connection with the purpose of the present volumes this conversation held in    0 in which instances of the assertion of the supremacy of the law over arbitrary power in the hands of the monarch are so carefully recounted is not without its influence upon what comes afterwards a lieutenant of marines by the name of frye whilst serving in the west indies in      was accused of some offences for which he was tried by a court martial condemned and sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen years besides the loss of his commission being remanded home with the proceedings in the case for ratification by the admiralty the sentence so far from proving satisfactory was annulled and frye fully and honorably reinstated not content with this tardy reparation for the sufferings which he had been compelled to endure in the course of his trial frye immediately brought an action for false imprisonment against sir chaloner ogle the presiding officer the cause came up before chief justice willes and such was the nature of the evidence that the jury at once brought in a verdict for the plaintiff with damages of a thousand pounds sterling taking advantage of an intimation thrown out by the court frye followed up this verdict with suits against two more of his unjust judges one of them admiral mayne was arrested at the moment when he was presiding over another court martial assembled at deptford to decide upon the mutual grievances of admirals matthews and lestock which had destroyed the efficiency of the mediterranean squadron when in presence of the enemy the year before the officers sitting on this trial took fire at what they deemed a gross insult to their head and rashly adopted some resolutions which they sent to the secretary of the admiralty together with a letter containing formal charges of misconduct against chief justice willes and his court the judge was not a man to suffer the dignity of his court to be thus infringed and his authority called in question no sooner did he hear of the resolutions that had been sent to the king than he caused warrants to be issued to take each individual of the twentyeight constituting the court martial into custody the king and the ministry sympathized with the officers the former went so far in his answer as to express great displeasure at the insult offered to the court martial by which the military discipline of the navy was so much affected and to promise that he would consider what steps it might be advisable to take on the occasion in spite of this royal language the officers soon felt their situation uncomfortable yet they could extricate themselves only by signing a most humble recantation of all their offensive language this was publicly presented in form to the chief justice who thereupon sealed his triumph with the following remarks the intimation thrown out in the first sentence will at this day be considered not the least singular portion of the whole affair although the injury i have received might have required a private satisfaction yet as the offence was of a public nature and offered to the whole court of common pleas as well as myself i thought it more consistent with my character and the dignity of the post i have the honor to fill to have satisfaction in this public manner and

in school for i knew nothing of the business but since they had chosen me at a venture i would accept it in the same manner and find out my duty as i could accordingly i went to ploughing and ditching and blowing rocks upon penns hill and building an entire new bridge of stone below dr millers and above mr wibirds the best workmen in town were employed in laying the foundation and placing the bridge but the next spring brought down a flood that threw my bridge all into ruins the materials remained and were afterwards relaid in a more durable manner and the blame fell upon the workmen not upon me for all agreed that i had executed my office with impartiality diligence and spirit  there had been a controversy in town for many years concerning the mode of repairing the roads a party had long struggled to obtain a vote that the highways should be repaired by a tax but never had been able to carry their point the roads were very bad and much neglected and i thought a tax a more equitable method and more likely to be effectual and therefore joined this party in a public speech carried a vote by a large majority and was appointed to prepare a bylaw to be enacted at the next meeting upon inquiry i found that roxbury and after them weymouth had adopted this course i procured a copy of their law and prepared a plan for braintree as nearly as possible conformable to their model reported it to the town and it was adopted by a great majority under this law the roads have been repaired to this day and the effects of it are visible to every eye   another article written for the newspapers   this draught consists of a rough plan of the principal roads in the town with the position of every licensed house marked upon it and certain remarks made upon each it has a local interest at this day for more reasons than one the following note is all that is worth inserting here— n b place one foot of your dividers at eb thayers house and extend the other about one mile and a half and then sweep a circle you will surround eight public houses besides one in the centre there is vastly more travelling and little less business in milton dorchester and roxbury where public houses are thinly scattered than there is in braintree and why poor braintree men who have no virtue to boast of should be solicited with more temptations than others i cant imagine this i will say that whoever is in fault or whatever was the design taverns and dramshops have been systematically and scandalously multiplied in this town and like so many boxes of pandora they are hourly scattering plagues of every kind natural moral and political through the whole town   here is the only allusion in the diary to this incident which according to the writers own account had so great an influence over his subsequent career the autobiography speaks of it more fully as follows— the king sent instructions to his custom house officers to carry the acts of trade and navigation into strict execution an inferior officer of the customs in salem whose name was cockle petitioned the justices of the superior court at their session in november    0 for the county of essex to grant him writs of assistants according to some provision in one of the acts of trade which had not been executed to authorize him to break open ships shops cellars houses c to search for prohibited goods and merchandises on which duties had not been paid some objection was made to this motion and mr stephen sewall who was then chief justice of that court and a zealous friend of liberty expressed some doubts of the legality and constitutionality of the writ and of the power of the court to grant it the court ordered the question to be argued at boston in february term      in the mean time mr sewall died and mr hutchinson then lieutenantgovernor a counsellor and judge of probate for the county of suffolk c was appointed in his stead chief justice the first vacancy on that bench had been promised in two former administrations to colonel james otis of barnstable this event produced a dissension between hutchinson and otis which had consequences of great moment in february mr james otis junior a lawyer of boston and a son of colonel otis of barnstable appeared at the request of the merchants in boston in opposition to the writ this gentlemans reputation as a scholar a lawyer a reasoner and a man of spirit was then very high mr putnam while i was with him had often said to me that otis was by far the most able manly and commanding character of his age at the bar and this appeared to me in boston to be the unanimous opinion of judges lawyers and the public mr oxenbridge thacher whose amiable manners and pure principles united to a very easy and musical eloquence made him very popular was united with otis and mr gridley alone appeared for cockle the petitioner in support of the writ the argument continued several days in the council chamber and the question was analyzed with great acuteness and all the learning which could be connected with the subject i took a few minutes in a very careless manner which by some means fell into the hands of mr minot who has inserted them in his history i was much more attentive to the information and the eloquence of the speaker than to my minutes and too much alarmed at the prospect that was opened before me to care much about writing a report of the controversy the views of the english government towards the colonies and the views of the colonies towards the english government from the first of our history to that time appeared to me to have been directly in opposition to each other and were now by the imprudence of administration brought to a collision england proud of its power and holding us in contempt would never give up its pretensions the americans devoutly attached to their liberties would never submit at least without an entire devastation of the country and a general destruction of their lives a contest appeared to me to be opened to which i could foresee no end and which would render my life a burden and property industry and every thing insecure there was no alternative left but to take the side which appeared to be just to march intrepidly forward in the right path to trust in providence for the protection of truth and right and to die with a good conscience and a decent grace if that trial should become indispensable among the papers of mr adams some notes remain of the argument in the case of the writs of assistance which seem to be the foundation of the sketch published by minot as the smallest particular relating to this commencement of the revolutionary struggle is interesting they are placed in the appendix a to this volume   this is the latter part of a long paper upon licensed houses which seems to have been intended for publication at the time   boston this alludes to a very sharp controversy carried on in the gazette upon the subject of feasts at ordinations in that paper of the  d march of this year there appeared a long account of the ceremonies at the ordination of the rev mr cuming as colleague of dr sewall in the old south church the public solemnity being over this account goes on to say—there was a very sumptuous and elegant entertainment for the elders and messengers that assisted to which his excellency the governor who honored the ceremonial of the instalment with his presence was also invited together with a considerable number of the principal gentlemen of the town and some of the country one house though capacious not being sufficient to accommodate so large a number of honorable and reverend guests on such an occasion two or more were provided for the occasion the principal entertainment however which is said to have been very grand and consequently the greatest concourse of people was at the rev dr sewalls own house such being the newspaper notice of the  d there appeared in the next weeks paper some well written but severe strictures upon the proceedings as not consistent with the character and pledges of the actors such an attack directed against the most powerful class of the day naturally excited resentment which showed itself in harsh and violent rejoinder this led to retort and to a warm controversy in no particular are opinions and customs more changed than in this the decline of ecclesiastical influence may have diminished the interest taken in similar ceremonies but the doing away with convivial entertainments upon such occasions has a deeper and more creditable cause a calm reader of the controversy at this day would not hesitate on which side to give his verdict   at a town meeting held in braintree on the   th may      the following article appears in the warrant— secondly to consider and determine upon some effectual method whereby to reduce the number of licensed houses in this town as it is thought the present number are unnecessary the record further states— after a full debate upon the second article it was by a great majority of the members present voted that although licensed houses so far as they are conveniently situated well accommodated and under due regulation for the relief and entertainment of travellers and strangers may be a useful institution yet there is reason to apprehend that the present prevailing depravity of manners through the land in general and in this town in particular and the shameful neglect of religious and civil duties so highly offensive in the sight of god and injurious to the peace and welfare of society are in a great measure owing to the unnecessary increase of licensed houses voted that for the future there be no persons in this town licensed for retailing spirituous liquors and that there be three persons only approbated by the selectmen as innholders suitably situated in each precinct it is not unreasonable to infer that the decision of the town was the result of the efforts of mr adams even if as is altogether probable the votes were not drawn up by him  on the   th of may in this year my venerable father died in his seventyfirst year beloved esteemed and revered by all who knew him nothing that i can say or do can sufficiently express my gratitude for his parental kindness to me or the exalted opinion i have of his wisdom and virtue it was a melancholy house my father and mother were seized at the same time with the violent fever a kind of influenza or an epidemic which carried off seventeen aged people in our neighborhood my mother remained ill in bed at my fathers funeral but being younger than my father and possessed of a stronger constitution she happily recovered and lived to my inexpressible comfort till the year      when she died at almost ninety years of age  in pursuance of my plan of reforming the practice of sheriffs and pettifoggers in the country i procured of all the justices in braintree—john quincy edmund quincy josiah quincy and joseph crosby—a recommendation of my brother to stephen greenleaf sheriff of the county and a certificate of his character upon receiving which mr greenleaf readily gave him a deputation he was young loved riding and discharged his duties with skill and fidelity but his disposition was so tender that he often assisted his debtors with his own purse and credit and upon the whole to say the least was nothing the richer for his office   ovids heroids—phyllis to demophoon l      in the original is the following direction turn back five leaves the entry is made in the paper book which begins with the letter to jonathan sewall

place it seems proper to introduce the following note on account of its characteristic postscript it is the first occasion upon which any allusion occurs to the person who afterwards became mrs adams

of him that when raised to the supreme bench his was a very popular appointment though he had not that knowledge of the law which others had who were of the profession and looked up to the place his political sentiments are visible enough in the conversation here reported like so many others of those mentioned in the early portion of this diary he became a refugee and an exile and died in england in        this was the favorite charge made by the government partisans against the younger otis it is of course repeated by hutchinson and it has found its way even into the moderate pages of gordon and of eliot the subject is well treated in the biography by tudor page    that otis was impulsive and not uniform or steady in advocating his principles must be admitted but nobody can think of the fiery furnace through which he was compelled to pass without comprehending the extent of his mental trials and appreciating the heroism with which they were endured   james otis the elder   the american nettle tree one of these is still to be seen growing out of the top of the rock at this place   this is the mansion afterwards purchased by the writer in which he lived from the date of his last return from europe until his death in        a secluded and beautiful spot almost surrounded by water in which deacon afterwards called general palmer well known at this time as well as subsequently as a member of the committee of safety in the revolution had established himself among a colony of glassblowers from germany come to undertake the manufacture of that article in america hence the name germantown which has remained whilst the persons have either removed or been merged in the general population a pretty full and interesting account of the life and singular misfortunes

ezekiel goldthwait was the register of deeds for the county of suffolk although at first inclining to the opposition his reverence for hutchinson carried the day in the end his name appears attached to the servile address presented to that officer on his final departure in        the two families referred to were those of general palmer and of judge cranch whose sister the former had married they had emigrated from england together in      judge cranch was just married to one of the daughters of the rev w smith of weymouth   there had been a good deal of management on all sides in the general court of the last year in the selection of an agent for the colony mr bollan who had acted in this capacity was set aside by a union of opposite interests against him finding difficulty in choosing a successor a majority as is not uncommon in such cases combined upon jasper mauduit esteemed more for his private worth than for his competency for the post but soon discovering the mistake israel mauduit his brother of far more capacity and the author of the celebrated pamphlet referred to would probably have been substituted had it not been for governor bernard whose influence was at its height and whose views it suited that no change should then be made probably he kept the post in his eye for mr jackson as stated hereafter in this diary hutchinson was again so popular as to be soon afterwards elected almost unanimously by the general court as a special agent it was the hour of james otiss weakness and of compromise and reaction ultimately stopped only by the energy of oxenbridge thacher minot ii p     hutchinson iii p  0  note tudors life of otis p   0   it is a curious fact that of eight persons here named as actively engaged at the bar at this period only one the writer himself lived through the revolution as an advocate of american independence five adhered to great britain mr thacher died in      mr otis became incapacitated for action in        this remarkable scene and extraordinary harshness will scarcely detract much from the character of james otis it illustrates the extent to which the esprit de corps will sometimes carry the most sensible men and nothing more few at this day will be disposed to doubt that mr otis was more nearly right than his opponents and his action in this instance consistent with his general principles if not with his first impulse   these two lampoons seem to have been the offspring of the passions of the moment and copied on the spot it is not clear by whom they were made   it is scarcely necessary to say that each of these points has a direct reference to some event in the life of otis the question raised as to the governors authority to fit out the province sloop is spoken of by tudor as one of the preparatory causes of the revolution life of otis p       gordon assigns a very early date for this practice he says more than fifty years ago from      mr samuel adamss father and twenty others one or two from the north end of the town where all the ship business is carried on used to meet make a caucus and lay their plan for introducing certain persons into places of trust and power when they had settled it they separated and used each their particular influence within his own circle he and his friends would furnish themselves with ballots including the names of the parties fixed upon

more appropriate place there   mr oliver was hung in effigy upon liberty tree before night the image was taken down and carried through the townhouse in the chamber whereof the governor and council were sitting forty or fifty tradesmen decently dressed preceded and some thousands of the mob followed down king street to olivers dock near which mr oliver had lately erected a building which it was conjectured he designed for a stamp office this was laid flat to the ground in a few minutes from thence the mob proceeded for fort hill but mr olivers house being in the way they endeavored to force themselves into it and being opposed broke the windows beat down the doors entered and destroyed part of his furniture and continued in riot until midnight before they separated hutchinson vol iii p

with richard dana esq a justice of peace and a lawyer of note who administered an oath to the secretary to this purpose—that he had never taken any measures in consequence of his deputation to act in his office as distributer of stamps and that he never would directly or indirectly by himself or any under him make use of his deputation or take any measures for enforcing the stamp act in america after three huzzas he was at liberty to return home hutchinsons history iii p   0   the original of this is preserved   john rowe a merchant active on the side of liberty gordon says that many influential persons at this time were thinking of him as a representative from boston to the general court but mr samuel adams artfully nominated a different one by asking with his eyes looking to mr hancocks house is there not another john that may do better  with so little preparation and with no time to look into any books for analogous cases i went and introduced the argument but made a very poor figure mr gridley and mr otis more than supplied all my defects but the governor and council would do nothing among the papers of mr adams the following abstract remains of the authorities on

to keep in mind that a commission as a justice of peace was of far more value at this time than it now is mr adams is said to have been at a loss which side to take mr sewall who was with the government would have persuaded him to be on the same side and promised him to desire governor bernard to make him a justice of peace the governor took time to consider of it and having as mr adams conceived not taken proper notice of him or given him offence on some former occasion he no longer deliberated and ever after joined in opposition hutchinson iii       this convention was proposed in

towns proposing the   d as the day of meeting for the convention in this paper the error was committed of assigning among the really good reasons for the call the obviously false one of an apprehension of an approaching war with france the consequence was that an advantage was given to the loyalists of which they availed themselves effectively to weaken the moral force of the measure although more than a hundred towns were represented under only a weeks notice gordon speaks of the convention as having been a failure whilst hutchinson on the other hand affirms that it made a greater advance towards a revolution in government than any preceding measures in any of the colonies there can be no doubt that the apprehension of it was the main reason for general gages change of

remains among the papers of mr adams the most interesting point of the defence is here subjoined the prosecution was based on the statute   geo   ch    s    to which allusion is made in the beginning but among the group of hardships which attend this statute the first that ought always to be mentioned and that ought never to be forgotten is—   that it was made without our consent my client mr hancock never consented to it he never voted for it himself and he never voted for any man to make such a law for him in this respect therefore the greatest consolation of an englishman suffering under any law is torn from him i mean the reflection that it is a law of his own making a law that he sees the necessity of for the public indeed the consent of the subject to all laws is so clearly necessary that no man has yet been found hardy enough to deny it the patrons of these acts allow that consent is necessary they only contend for a consent by construction by interpretation a virtual consent but this is only deluding men with shadows instead of substances construction has made treasons where the law has made none constructions and arbitrary distinctions made in short only for so many bywords so many cries to deceive a mob have always been the instruments of arbitrary power the means of lulling and ensnaring men into their own servitude for whenever we leave principles and clear positive laws and wander after constructions one construction or consequence is piled upon another until we get at an immense distance from fact and truth and nature lost in the wild regions of imagination and possibility where arbitrary power sits upon her brazen throne and governs with an iron sceptre it is a hardship therefore scarcely to be endured that such a penal statute should be made to govern a man and his property without his actual consent and only upon such a wild chimera as a virtual and constructive consent see hutchinsons account of this case of the liberty and the

cases occurred of an extraordinary character in which i was engaged and which cost me no small portion of anxiety that of the four sailors who killed lieutenant panton of the rose frigate these were both before special courts of admiralty held in consequence of the statute the four sailors were acquitted as their conduct was adjudged to be in selfdefence and the action justifiable homicide the other was the trial of ansell nickerson for the murder of three or four men on board a vessel this was and remains still a mysterious transaction i know not to this day what judgment to form of his guilt or innocence and this doubt i presume was the principle of acquittal he requested my assistance and it was given these cases are both of them mentioned by hutchinson the first in pages         the other in pages       0 of his third volume it may not be without its value to the curious to have the opportunity to contrast with his version of corbets case the following account written at a late period in the life of the author and without any knowledge of what had been said in the history it is contained in a letter addressed to judge william tudor dated  0 december      i cannot say whether i ought to laugh or cry or scold in reporting the trial of michael corbet and his three comrades you must remember it a volume would be necessary to relate this cause as it ought to be but never will be related the trial was before a special court of viceadmiralty instituted by a special act of parliament for the trial of piracy and murder on the high seas the court consisted of governors bernard and wentworth lieutenantgovernor and chief justice hutchinson judge of admiralty auchmuty commodore hood and certain counsellors from massachusetts bay new hampshire and rhode island to the number of fifteen mr otis had been engaged with me in behalf of the prisoners but his unhappy distemper was then in one of its unlucid intervals and i could hardly persuade him to converse with me a few minutes on the subject and he constantly and finally refused to appear publicly in the cause the whole burden of responsibility was thus cast upon me you may easily believe i was anxious the lives of four honest men in my hands and a sympathizing world looking to me for exertions to preserve them i determined to plead to the jurisdiction of the court and if that should be overruled demand a trial by jury as each of my clients must plead for himself i was obliged to write four pleas one for each and each consisting of sheets of paper setting forth charters acts of parliament common law and ancient usages which compelled me to sit up more than one night to transcribe the court met prisoners ordered to the bar i presented and read my pleas no counsel for the crown ordered to answer these pleas not a word said at the bar or on the bench for them or against them when hutchinson not slowrising but starting up moved that the court should adjourn to the council chamber every vote was ready and away went their excellencies honors and learned judges to secret conclave they sat late and it was propagated through the town that they had determined to summon a jury jonathan sewall himself the advocategeneral said he believed they would grant a jury the next morning however the judgment was pronounced by the president governor bernard that the court had overruled the plea to the jurisdiction no reason was given not another word was said by the president or any other member of the court in justification or explication of the decree the cause was opened and stated by the advocategeneral in a very honorable manner the witnesses called examined and crossexamined and here i ought to observe in honor of the morals of seamen there was no contradiction or variation in the testimonies british and american sailors all agreed in every circumstance it then became my turn to speak in defence of the prisoners i had taken more pains in that case than in any other before or since i had appealed to heaven and earth i had investigated all laws human and divine i had searched all the authorities in the civil law the law of nature and nations the common law history practice and every thing that could have any relation to the subject all my books were on the table before me and i vainly felt as if i could shake the town and the world a crowded audience attending still as midnight in eager expectation i had scarcely risen and said— may it please your excellencies and your honors my defence of the prisoners is that the melancholy action for which they stand accused is justifiable homicide and therefore no crime at all and produced one authority very plump to that purpose—when hutchinson again darted up and moved that the court should adjourn to the council chamber no reason was given not a word was said the popes bull was implicitly and unanimously obeyed and away marched their excellencies and honors to the council chamber dismal was the anxiety of the town dreading a sentence of death the next morning alas for me my glass bubble was burst my boule de saron was dissolved all the inflammable gas was escaped from my balloon and down i dropt like pilâtre des rosiers never was a more gloomy assembly of countenances painted with terror and horror than appeared in the audience next morning the court appeared the prisoners were ordered to the bar the president arose and pronounced the unanimous sentence of the court—that the killing lieutenant panton was justifiable homicide in necessary selfdefence auchmuty squealed out the judgment of the court is unanimous and not another word was said now sir was the conduct of hutchinson that of a good judicial character you may say i write romance and satire i say that true history in this case is the most surprising romance and the keenest satire but i have not yet explained the secret first and last it was fear hutchinson dreaded and the apprehension of hutchinson was the apprehension of all the public investigation before the people of the law applicable to that case they dared not pronounce judgment in favor of impressment in any possible case such a judgment would at that time have been condemned reprobated and execrated not only in new england and all the other colonies but throughout the three kingdoms it would have accelerated the revolution more than even the impeachment of the judges or hutchinsons foolish controversy about the omniscience and omnipotence and infinite goodness of parliament did afterwards it would have spread a wider flame than otiss ever did or could have done but there is a secret behind that has never been hinted in public and that hutchinson dreaded should be produced before the public you know mr tudor that i had imported from london and then possessed the only complete set of the british statutes at large that then existed in boston and as i believe in all the colonies in that work is a statute which expressly prohibits impressments in america almost the only statute in which the word or idea of impressment is admitted the volume which contains that statute doubled down in dogs ears i had before me on the table with a heap of other books i was determined that if the law of god of nature of nations of the common law of england and our american prescriptions and charters could not preserve the lives of my clients that statute should if it could the conclave dreaded the publication of that statute which they intended to get repealed and which they and their successors have since procured to be repealed in the book of admiralty cases kept by mr adams is an abstract of all the authorities collected by him in his preparation for this case as well as a minute account of lieutenantgovernor hutchinsons action in the cause as very few law proceedings prior to the revolution have been preserved in massachusetts and as they may be interesting to the profession at this day the notes just as they stand in the original have been placed in the appendix to this volume b   miss ruth cunningham sympathized with the loyalists and married her daughter to a british officer of course this was a root of bitterness to james otis and aggravated his tendencies see tudors life p  0   in the mob collected before the house of one of the shopkeepers who had determined to violate the nonimportation agreement hutchinsons version of the affair is as follows— one of the neighbors ebenezer richardson found fault with the proceedings which provoked the mob to drive him into his house for shelter having been a landwaiter or inferior customhouse officer and before that an informer against illicit traders he was peculiarly obnoxious to the people the mob surrounded his house threw stones and brickbats through the windows and as it appeared upon trial were forcing their way in when he fired upon them and killed a boy of eleven or twelve years of age he was soon seized and another person with him who happened to be in the house they were in danger of being sacrificed to the rage of the people being dragged through the streets and a halter having been prepared but some more temperate than the rest advised to carry them before a justice of peace who committed them to prison the boy that was killed was the son of a poor german a grand funeral was however judged very proper for him young and old some of all ranks and orders attended in a solemn procession from liberty tree to the townhouse and then to the common buryingground this account should be compared with that of gordon i     and bradford i  0    hutchinson who in his third volume has done much to embody in a permanent form these floating insinuations of the day against the leading men of the patriotic party alludes to this affair in the following insidious manner captain preston had been well advised to retain two gentlemen of the law who were strongly attached to the cause of liberty and to stick at no reasonable fees for that purpose and this measure proved of great service to him   a remarkable proof of the extent to which these were carried and the effect which they had even upon the nearest relatives of the parties engaged for captain preston is to be found in a letter addressed to josiah quincy jr by his father    march    0 see memoir of josiah quincy jr by his son p      a brief recital of the political movements of this session will show not only the active part taken in them by the writer but also the extent of the influence exerted by the boston seat which from small beginnings had grown to a great height it had been customary for years to rely upon some one person as a guide in the legal and constitutional questions that might come up in the controversies with the executive thus although samuel adams was now the master mover john adams seems to have this year succeeded to the post of legal adviser which had been filled by oxenbridge thacher and james otis the following abstract taken from the journal of the house for the year will serve to show the share which he took in the proceedings—    0 june   john adams esq returned a member from boston in the room of the honorable james bowdoin esq now a member of the council board making his appearance in the house ordered that mr hancock attend mr adams to the gentlemen appointed to administer the oaths who reported that he had taken the oaths and subscribed the declaration required by act of parliament and then mr adams took his seat in the house june   a committee appointed to state the reasons for adhering to the resolution that it is not expedient to proceed to business while the general court is held out of the townhouse in boston the members were— major hawley mr samuel adams john adams esq mr pickering mr leonard capt mitchel capt sumner mr hobson and capt denny june    a committee to prepare a message to his honor the lieutenantgovernor setting forth that the house cannot recede from its resolution and praying his honor if determined not to remove the assembly to boston that he would give the members leave to go home the members were— mr speaker cushing major hawley samuel adams capt sheaffe and john adams of this committee three of the five persons belonged to the boston seat june    a committee to present the draft of the message reported by the preceding committee the members mr hancock mr samuel adams capt brown john adams and david ingersoll three out of five from boston after the recess july    a committee to wait on his honor the lieutenantgovernor and to solicit him to remove the general assembly to the townhouse in boston the members mr hancock mr adams capt keene mr hall and mr john adams three out of five from boston july    a committee to prepare an answer to the speech of his honor the lieutenantgovernor the members mr speaker mr hancock mr leonard mr s adams mr john adams capt dennie and major gallison this includes all four of the boston seat the house prorogued until september    a committee to consider what is proper to be done respecting the speech of the lieutenantgovernor the members mr speaker mr samuel adams major foster mr dennie mr john adams mr hancock major godfrey colonel warren and mr hobson all the boston seat october   a committee to prepare a message to his honor the lieutenantgovernor the members mr hancock mr john adams mr david ingersol mr samuel adams and capt fuller three of the boston seat october   a committee to consider the message of his honor of the fourth instant the members colonel murray colonel gerrish mr john adams brigadier preble and mr samuel adams two from the boston seat this was in the morning after dinner colonel murray reported from this committee its unanimous opinion that his honors message was not satisfactory read and accepted and ordered that mr john adams mr s adams mr hancock mr david ingersol and mr bullen be a committee to prepare an address yet immediately after this vote a change of feeling manifests itself which the journal does not explain neither is it quite clear what the form was upon which the decision was made the language of the journal is— the house took into further consideration the report of the committee on his honors speech and the question being put it passed in the negative but whatever may have been the precise shape of the question there can be little doubt that it involved the alternative of an utter and absolute refusal to legislate or of a surrender to the lieutenantgovernor the writer of the diary elsewhere says that throughout this session the parties in the general court were almost equal and it is very certain that the majority was not prepared at this moment to go a step further towards disorganization apart from this however a change of policy on the part of the opposition had grown out of the fact that they now learnt that the lieutenantgovernor was involved by the government at home in a difficulty of a still more important character orders had come that the fort at castle william should be occupied by the kings troops and the provincial garrison dismissed a suspension of the legislative functions at such a moment would have been a relief to the executive who had assumed the responsibility of the transfer all these considerations united to recommend procrastination so the majority by a vote of fiftynine to twentynine contented themselves with entering a protest and proceeding to business in the minority however are found the names of most of the leading men of the patriotic party john adamss is not in the lists the omission is explained in the record of the next day by which it seems that an unusual privilege of explanation was accorded to him october    a committee to consider the state of the province the members were mr s adams major hawley mr j adams mr hancock colonel worthington mr pickering colonel warren and colonel whitcomb three boston members colonel warren moved to the house that the members who were absent when the resolution passed to proceed to business out of the townhouse in boston might have leave to declare their opinion thereon in the house and the question being put it passed in the affirmative whereupon colonel warren and mr john adams who had been absent declared their opinions against the resolution the house was moved that his honor be addressed praying that he would appoint a day of solemn prayer and humiliation ordered that mr john adams mr danielson and colonel warren be a committee to prepare an address accordingly october    his honors message of this forenoon was read again according to order and thereupon ordered that mr samuel adams mr john adams colonel warren mr hancock and colonel prescott be a committee to prepare another message to request a more explicit answer to the message of the   th the committee of the   th reported report read and recommitted mr adams was excused from serving and dr holten appointed in his place november

public importance although a person wholly new to legislation and at the time very much engaged in his professional duties including the defence of captain preston and the soldiers it appears that john adams was placed upon as many committees as his more experienced associate and kinsman the great preponderance of the boston members in the construction of all of them is also remarkable considering the low ratio which the population of the town then bore to that of the province the questions involved in the controversies of this session cannot be explained here they will be found

the december following with much force in the introduction of the argument in defence of captain preston and the soldiers his son john quincy adams said of it— the writer has often heard from individuals who had been present among the crowd of spectators at the trial the electrical effect produced upon the jury and upon the immense and excited auditory by the first sentence with which he opened his defence which was the following citation from the then recently published work of beccaria national portrait gallery article john adams   my fathers eldest brother joseph adams minister of

societys collections the name is one of the oldest and most respectable in the state but in the male line it has long since run out it may be as well however to correct a slight error of fact in the

does the remark made by him seem to merit so harsh a comment as it receives there can be no doubt that the state of mr adamss health and the extensive professional practice to which he had after long labor arrived combined to make him averse to political life hutchinson assigns the same reasons vol iii p       this is that particular portion of the diary which commences with the copy of a letter

of ansell nickerson alluded to page     hutchinsons account of it is quite full vol iii p       see page       this was a special commission issued from the crown hutchinson derives the authority for such an act from the power to order the royal navy to any colony and considers this paramount to any charter whatever yet he says such a commission became an additional article of grievance as if this were a matter of surprise vol iii p     note the proceeding came to nothing as might very naturally have been expected the substitution of a novel and foreign tribunal with no additional powers of

mr cushings letter of acknowledgment bears date the   th of march and begins thus i have just received your favor of the  d december last with the several papers enclosed for which i am much obliged to you it would seem from this entry in the diary of two days earlier that no time had been lost in making them known to the confidential circle those who are disposed to place reliance upon hutchinsons account of any thing appertaining to the action of the leading patriots will do well to contrast his narrative of this proceeding vol iii pp        including the garbled letter in the note with the correspondence published in the fourth volume of mr sparkss edition of franklins writings   in the letter to dr hosack already mentioned mr adams distinctly states that sir john temple told him in holland that he had furnished these letters to dr franklin he adds however his belief that they were delivered through the hands of a third person a member of parliament this precisely corresponds with the impression of governor hutchinson himself soon after the time derived from sources wholly distinct but only known to the world since the publication of his third volume in      two years after mr adamss death if in addition to this evidence any credence at all be given to the rumor mentioned in the text scarcely a doubt can remain that sir john temple was the man who procured them although the way he did it remains hidden as ever   the words should leak erased in the original and none substituted   this alludes to the nomination of him by the friends of liberty as a member of the council two days afterwards he was chosen by the house of representatives and on the next the governor sent down a message interposing his negative in his history he assigns as a reason for this negative the very conspicuous part mr adams had taken in opposition vol iii p       the father and brother of james otis   the day of election hancocks allusion was probably to the

give the names of the mohawks who were concerned in the noyade of the tea in boston harbor i now tell you in truth and upon honor that i know not and never knew the name of any one of them during the week of that transaction i was employed in the discharge of my duty as a barrister of law in the court of judicature in the town and county of plymouth when i returned to boston the deed was done i never inquired who did it whenever any person discovered an inclination to give me a history of it as many did i constantly stopped him short and said say not a word to me on that subject name not to me one person concerned in it my reason for this caution was that i expected every day an indictment against the authors of it and that i should be called upon to defend them in a court of justice and i was determined that no judge or juror attorneygeneral or solicitorgeneral should have it in his power to compel me to testify as a witness to any fact relative to the transaction and to this day i know not the name of one man concerned in it within two years past a gentleman an entire stranger to me on a visit he was pleased to make blurted out the name of one gentleman who he said told him that he was one of the mohawks but this name i will not commit to writing you may depend upon it they were no ordinary mohawks the profound secrecy in which they have held their names and the total abstinence from plunder are proofs of the characters of the men i believe they would have tarred and feathered any one of their number who should have been detected in pocketing a pound of hyson   hutchinson betrays his sense of this insult by the affected contempt with which he treats it and quotes tacitus to prove that such things when left without notice are forgotten at the very moment when

influence upon its members here on the   th of june the last act of the body done whilst the secretary was standing on the outside of the locked doors with a proclamation dissolving it in his hand was to appoint the five gentlemen named in the text a committee as it was called to meet committees from the other colonies at philadelphia on the first day of september following the resolution authorizing this appointment was adopted with twelve dissenting voices out of a hundred and twentynine then present on the same day what is described as a legal and very full adjourned meeting of the citizens of boston was held at faneuil hall at which the author of the diary presided as moderator the object was to consult upon the measures made necessary by the boston port bill of this meeting it is said that it was as full and respectable as ever was known—their unanimity and firmness was never exceeded not one though often called upon had any thing to offer in favor of paying for the tea in compliance with the boston port bill all appeared disposed to stand the utmost efforts of tyranny rather than make a free surrender of the rights of america the speeches made on the state of american

this town and county a laodiceanism that i have not found in any other place i find more persons here who call the destruction of the tea mischief and wickedness than anywhere else more persons who say that the duty upon tea is not a tax nor an imposition because we are at liberty to use it or not than anywhere else i am told that the deacon insinuates sentiments and principles into the people

the night of the   th december preceding and the inmates with difficulty escaped   it was remarked by george clymer in a letter addressed to josiah quincy jr in the year      that patriotism then seemed to have taken but shallow root in some places particularly at new york where political principles are truly as unfixed as the wind one year sees the new yorkers champions for liberty and the next hugging their chains this characteristic of instability has remained through all the vicissitudes of subsequent times divided as the population was in sentiment at this period      the conservative and aristocratic interest maintained a preponderance in the province at large and prevented its legislature from acting at all whilst in the city it was waging a more doubtful struggle with the feeling which had for years manifested decided popular tendencies this conflict developed the tendency to political manœuvering for which the people of new york have ever since been noted nowhere perhaps have a greater number of persons shaped their action by the rule of the celebrated bussy rabutin in the days of faction in france je suis autant que je puis du parti le plus fort hence arose the ludicrous embarrassment of its provincial assembly in the next year      upon receiving the news that general washington and governor tryon were both on their way to the city at the same time and hence their order that the militia should stand ready to receive the one or the other as he might first arrive and should wait on both as well as circumstances would allow hence the facts related by gordon in the second volume of his history p   0 see also the life of charles lee sparkss american biography vol xviii pp    0  at the moment alluded to in the text the news of the passage of the boston port bill had given a force to the popular side in the city which threatened to carry every thing before it sensible of the hazard attending open resistance the conservative interest adopted the more prudent policy of falling in with the public sentiment so far as to secure the control of all action this was the origin of the plan to reorganize the committee of correspondence and to place upon it in conjunction with some of the popular leaders a large number of lukewarm if not hostile persons the history of this committee of fiftyone is the record of a struggle between opposite forces between skilful management on the part of a few and blind power on the part of the many thus it happened that whilst at one moment the former met with a complete defeat in the rejection of a series of temporizing resolutions characterized as void of vigor sense and integrity at another the latter secured the more substantial advantage of preventing the choice of john morin scott through whose energy they had been worsted as stated in the text and of alexander mcdougall as delegates to the congress of      there can be no disputing that throughout the revolution a large proportion of the population including most of the propertyholders of new york sympathized with the mother country neither did the effect of this cease with the establishment of the national

the subsequent conduct of mr duché did not prove him worthy of the commendation here awarded in his letter to general washington he most pointedly sneers at the new england delegates to whom he was

      this is more fully spoken of by the writer in a private letter to his wife dated the   th instant of which the following is the substance— when the congress first met mr cushing made a motion that it should be opened with prayer it was opposed by mr jay of new york and mr rutledge of south carolina because we were so divided in religious sentiments some episcopalians some quakers some anabaptists some presbyterians and some congregationalists that we could not join in the same act of worship mr samuel adams arose and said he was no bigot and could hear a prayer from a gentleman of piety and virtue who was at the same time a friend to his country he was a stranger in philadelphia but had heard that mr duché dushay they pronounce it deserved that character and therefore he moved that mr duché an episcopal clergyman might be desired to read prayers to the congress tomorrow morning the motion was seconded and passed in the affirmative mr randolph our president waited on mr duché and received for answer that if his health would permit he certainly would accordingly next morning he appeared with his clerk and in his pontificals and read several prayers in the established form and then read the collect for the seventh day of september which was the thirtyfifth psalm you must remember this was the next morning after we heard the horrible rumor of the cannonade of boston i never saw a greater effect upon an audience it seemed as if heaven had ordained that psalm to be read on that morning after this mr duché unexpectedly to every body struck out into an extemporary prayer which filled the bosom of every man present i must confess i never heard a better prayer or one so well pronounced episcopalian as he is dr cooper himself never prayed with such fervor such ardor such earnestness and pathos and in language so elegant and sublime for america for the congress for the province of massachusetts bay and especially the town of boston it has had an excellent effect upon every body here i must beg you to read that psalm if there was any faith in the sortes virgilianæ or sortes homericæ or especially the sortes biblicæ it would be thought providential it will amuse your friends to read this letter and the thirtyfifth psalm to them read it to your father and mr wibird i wonder what our braintree churchmen would think of this mr duché is one of the most ingenious men and best characters and greatest orators in the episcopal order upon this continent yet a zealous friend of liberty and his country   from this declaration it is clear that the delegation from virginia was not unanimous in the policy imputed to them by mr rutledge and the carolinians see the next note   this account written in   0  evidently from recollection only and without consulting the record appears by comparison though substantially corresponding with it not to be precisely accurate in the details and inasmuch as every step in this commencement of the federative union of which so little is now known is of some interest it may not be deemed out of place to subjoin here what it has been found possible to gather together concerning the formation and objects of these first committees the journal of      for tuesday september   has the following entry resolved unanimously that a committee be appointed to state the rights of the colonies in general the several instances in which these rights are violated or infringed and the means most proper to be pursued for obtaining a restoration of them resolved that a committee be appointed to examine and report the several statutes which affect the trade and manufactures of the colonies on the next day wednesday  th the journal says— the congress taking into consideration the appointment of the committees a vote was taken on the number of which the first committee should consist and by a great majority agreed that it consist of two from each of the colonies as the delegates from north carolina did not come in until a week later it follows that this committee was at first composed of twentytwo members of whom those selected from massachusetts were samuel and john adams but on the   th instant the two delegates of north carolina were added making up the number of twentyfour the journal proceeds— agreed that the second committee consist of one chosen from each colony hence it follows that the second committee was only half as large as the first major john sullivan of new hampshire is the first named person in both he governor hopkins of rhode island and latterly william hooper of north carolina are the only persons who served in both committees the small number delegated from those colonies making this step unavoidable it further appears that the second of these committees was first ready to report for the journal of saturday   th september has the following entry— the committee appointed to examine and report the several statutes which affect the trade and manufactures of the colonies brought in their report which was ordered to lie on the table on monday    september— the report brought in on saturday being read as follows—            ordered that the same be referred to the committee appointed to state the rights of the colonies c to which committee the honorable thomas cushing patrick henry and thomas mifflin esquires were added the report does not seem to have been inserted in the journal although space was left for it it is not difficult however to identify it in the final draught of the resolutions as will presently appear on the   th there was then only one committee left to which the whole of the subject which had originally been distributed between two was now referred this committee consisted of twentyseven members or about one half of the whole assembly every colony having two representatives with the exception of virginia massachusetts and pennsylvania to each of which another had been conceded thus framing a species of compromise between the two principles of federation and population presented in the first days debate the abstract of the discussion which took place in this committee on the eighth and ninth instant is inserted in its place it will be examined with more interest from the light shed upon it by the preceding extract from the autobiography the subject seems to have been elaborately discussed by mr adams himself as well as by the other gentlemen though whilst taking notes of their remarks he neglected to make any record of his own on the tenth twelfth and thirteenth of september his diary shows him to have been acting on the subcommittee which sat whilst the congress and the full committee did nothing in order to give it room on the last named day it agreed upon a report to the larger body but it was not until nine days afterwards to wit thursday the   d that the grand committee itself was ready to report and then it did so only in part as follows— the committee appointed to state the rights of the colonies c having brought in a report of the rights the same was read and the consideration of it referred till saturday next ordered that a copy of this report be made out for each colony on saturday    september the record says— the congress entered upon the consideration of the report referred to this day and after some debate upon motion— resolved that the congress do confine themselves at present to the consideration of such rights only as have been infringed by acts of the british parliament since the year      postponing the further consideration of the general state of american rights to a future day this decision was not arrived at without much difference of opinion from the report of the south carolina delegates it appears that the limitation was fixed by the influence of virginia combining with the least resolute party desirous of avoiding abstract principles on which a difference would admit of no reconciliation and keeping the issue exclusively upon the temporary action of the existing ministry at home this point being definitively settled in favor of the narrow construction the committee appointed to state the rights c brought in the other part of their report upon the infringements and violations of american rights which being read upon motion— resolved that the consideration of this report be referred till monday and that the congress in the meanwhile deliberate on the means most proper to be pursued for a restoration of our rights  committees were then appointed to state american rights and grievances and the various acts of the british parliament which affect the trade and manufactures of these colonies on these subjects the committees spent several days when the congress judged it necessary previous to completing and resolving on these subjects to take under consideration that of ways and means for redress letter of connecticut delegates to governor trumbull  0 october      this second report of the large committee is the one which from its being made separately mr adams in his later recollection appears to have blended with the action of the second committee on monday and tuesday the   th and   th of september the congress proceeded to deliberate on the question as stated above and the result was the adoption of a nonimportation agreement as it stands upon the journals the notes taken by mr adams of this discussion will be found appended to the record of the   th on the   th mr galloway of pennsylvania made his celebrated motion and proposed his plan of union which he prefaced with a speech the notes of that speech and of a part of the debate which is known to have been the critical one in the career of this assembly are appended to the record of that day the plan is said to have been defeated only by a majority of one state the congress did not resume the consideration of the subject of rights and grievances until wednesday october    and on friday the   th they adopted the resolutions as they are found in the journals of that day among the papers of mr adams there is in handwriting somewhat resembling that of major sullivan a draught of the articles as they were doubtless first submitted to the committee so little is known of the proceedings of this congress that it may not be deemed superfluous in the appendix c to this volume to place this draught in contrast with the resolutions as they were ultimately passed from this comparison it will appear that the critical article alluded to by mr adams as finally drawn up by himself is the fourth in the series it was this article against which mr galloway afterwards in his pamphlet directed his main attack on the ground that it aimed at independence it will likewise be seen that all after the tenth resolution constitutes that portion of the report which had its origin in the labors of the second committee before it was merged in the larger one and which was reported afterwards to wit on the   th of september   richard peters long celebrated in philadelphia for his wit as well as for other and higher qualities he served as secretary of the board of war until      and as judge of the district court of the united states until his death in      at an advanced age   on this day the celebrated resolutions of suffolk county in massachusetts had been laid before congress and resolutions were adopted by the congress expressive of sympathy and support see the journals the proceedings of the congress are all a profound secret as yet except two votes which were passed yesterday and ordered to be printed you will see them from every quarter these votes were passed in full congress with perfect unanimity the esteem the affection the admiration for the people of boston and the massachusetts which were expressed yesterday and the fixed determination that they should be supported were enough to melt a heart of stone i saw the tears gush into the eyes of the old grave pacific quakers of pennsylvania j a to his wife    sept compare the letter of s adams to dr chauncy quincys life of quincy p   0   the following extract from the writers letter of this date to the late judge tudor is of importance to elucidate the motives of action at this time we have had numberless prejudices to remove here we have been obliged to act with great delicacy and caution we have been obliged to keep ourselves out of sight and to feel pulses and sound the depths to insinuate our sentiments designs and desires by means of other persons sometimes of one province and sometimes of another   resolved unanimously that from and after the first day of december next there be no importation into british america from great britain or ireland of any goods wares or merchandises whatsoever or from any other place of any such goods wares or merchandises as shall have been exported from great britain or ireland and that no such goods wares or merchandises imported after the said first day of december next be used or purchased a nonexportation rule was also adopted on friday the  0th   this was a common impression of the times the whole action of this congress was predicated upon the error yet the commercial position of china could not have been entirely unknown even at that period   in the account given by judge drayton of the report made by the south carolina delegates of the proceedings of this congress there is a little obscurity which appears to grow out of a confounding of two separate positions taken by the virginia delegates the one related to the limitation of the statement of grievances to the period of the present reign the other to the hesitation to come into a measure of nonexportation on the ground of insufficient powers the first case however decided would scarcely present sufficient cause for serious division the second seems at one time to have threatened seriously to impair the harmony of the union the language of judge drayton if applied to this receives some illustration from the remarks attributed in the text to messrs gadsden and chase it runs thus— it was then pressed in congress that the other colonies should in this measure act independently of virginia but maryland and north carolina represented that as their exports were similar to those of virginia so they could not with any advantage to the common cause act independently of her for their own commodities would be carried to the virginia ports which would run away with all their trade memoirs of the american revolution vol i p     the delegates from virginia finally signed the agreement in its fullest extent   this article of rice proved another great stumblingblock in the way of union which was at last removed only by consenting to except it from the agreement of nonexportation to europe in the first instance the bare proposition of excepting that and indigo is stated by mr gadsden who disagreed with the rest of his colleagues to have occasioned a cessation from business for several days in order to give the refractory deputies time to recollect themselves although it is difficult now to tell exactly when this cessation could have taken place he further says that even when the association was completing without any exception and the memberswere signing it all the deputies from south carolina but himself withdrew and that state was on the point of being excluded when a compromise was proposed by which indigo being surrendered on the one side the exception was admitted of rice on the other this compromise was not however altogether relished by their constituents in carolina and especially by the cultivators of indigo who considered their interests sacrificed for the benefit of the rice planters an account of the violent struggle between these two parties in the provincial legislature is given by judge drayton in his interesting memoirs vol i pp        ramsay says nothing of it but leaves a directly contrary impression on the mind of the reader history vol i p      this meeting and the motives which induced it are alluded to by general washington in a letter to captain mackensie of the  th of october following see sparkss washington vol ii p  0    patience forbearance long suffering are the lessons taught here for our province and at the same time absolute and open resistance to the new government i wish i could convince gentlemen of the danger or impracticability of this as fully as i believe it myself the art and address of ambassadors from a dozen belligerent powers of europe nay of a conclave of cardinals at the election of a pope or of the princes in germany at the choice of an emperor would not exceed the specimens we have seen yet the congress all profess the same political principles they all profess to consider our province as suffering in the common cause and indeed they seem to feel for us as if for themselves we have had as great questions to discuss as ever engaged the attention of men and an infinite multitude of them j a to his wife    september   among the papers of mr adams is the draught of the following resolutions on which in the handwriting of another person is indorsed j adamss motion september  0th no such motion is recorded in the journal although some of the language is found incorporated into the resolution adopted on the seventh of october instructing a committee to prepare a letter to general gage the probability is that the congress was not at the moment ready to pledge all the colonies quite so deeply as these resolutions would have done although some of the measures recommended were ultimately adopted resolved that the province of the massachusetts bay and the town of boston are now suffering and struggling in the common cause of american freedom and therefore that it is the indispensable duty of all the colonies to support them by every necessary means and to the last extremity whereas hostilities have been already commenced against the province of massachusetts bay and through them against all the colonies and whereas this congress have already advised the people of that province by no means to submit to the late act of parliament for altering their government— resolved that in case hostilities should be further pursued against that province and submission be attempted to be compelled by force of arms as soon as intelligence of this shall be communicated to the several colonies they ought immediately to cease all exportations of goods wares and merchandise to great britain ireland and the west indies resolved that in case any person or persons should be arrested in the massachusetts bay or any other colony by general gage or any other person in order to be sent to great britain to be there tried for any crime whatsoever committed in america under pretence of authority of the statute of henry viii or that of the present reign this ought to be considered as a declaration of war and a commencement of hostilities against all the colonies and reprisals ought to be made in all the colonies and held as hostages for the security of the person or persons so arrested and all exportations of merchandise to great britain ireland and the west indies ought immediately to cease   it is worthy of notice that this is more than a fortnight before the resolution directing such a memorial to be prepared passed in congress and further that it is in the hands of general lee the committee afterwards appointed consisted of mr cushing r h lee and j dickinson they reported on the   th and their report was recommitted they again reported on the   th the paper which was adopted   there is a great spirit in the congress but our people must be peaceable let them exercise every day in the week if they will the more the better let them furnish themselves with artillery arms and ammunition let them follow the maxim which you say they have adopted in times of peace prepare for war but let them avoid war if possible—if possible i say j a to his wife   october   this opinion is in marked opposition to that ascribed by mr wirt to mr henry which is the more singular as a few paragraphs below the same gentleman betrays any thing but enthusiasm for or admiration of the rutledges the truth must be told of mr wirts volume it is little to be relied on excepting for the information directly obtained from witnesses of facts how narrowly he escaped lauding mr henry as a deep classical scholar is shown in mr jeffersons letter lately published in kennedys biography vol i p  0  his own frank and playful admissions of his unfitness to write mere facts redeem a world of error what the deuce has a lawyer to do with truth see his letter in the same work vol i page       on the first day of the month r h lee j adams t johnson patrick henry and mr j rutledge were appointed a committee to prepare an address to his majesty the history of the action of this committee is little known the fact seems well established that the first report was drawn up by mr lee that it did not satisfy the assembly who recommitted it on the   st october at the same time adding mr dickinson who had taken his seat on the   th to the committee they reported three days later the paper which has ever since been ascribed to mr dickinson it is included in the collection of his writings made during his lifetime and published at wilmington in delaware   in the appendix b to mr duanes publication of passages from the remembrancer of christopher marshall is a somewhat curious account of dr chovet and his lectures   no direction to perform this duty appears on the journal undoubtedly it refers to the declaration of rights as explained in the close of the extract from the autobiography in page       this judgment was not without foundation the provincial legislature refused to sanction the proceedings of the congress declined to send any delegates to the next and adopted a half way policy of its own intended to satisfy the popular feeling without irritating the government at home this led to a reaction in the city where after a trial of physical strength between the parties the old committee of fiftyone was dissolved and a new one created consisting of sixty members through whom the patriots finally succeeded in effecting an independent organization in the colony   this gentleman died at this place in the following year   colonel worthington was a moderate adherent of the government   this is a caption given to that ode of horace in some editions   wednesday    november      resolved that john

moment on both sides of the atlantic they were thought by the timid and hesitating in america to justify the suspicions that had been entertained of the designs of the newenglandmen to make the breach

now in the state paper office in london the following copies were found among mr adamss papers but they are not in his handwriting there is also a long letter of apology from mr hichborn for suffering

   dear sir— i am determined to write freely to you this time a certain great fortune and piddling genius whose fame has been trumpeted so loudly has given a silly cast to our whole doings we are between hawk and buzzard we ought to have had in our hands a month ago the whole legislative executive and judicial of the whole continent and have completely modelled a constitution to have raised a naval power and opened all our ports wide to have arrested every friend of government on the continent and held them as hostages for the poor victims in boston and then opened the door as wide as possible for peace and reconciliation after this they might have petitioned negotiated addressed c if they would is all this extravagant is it wild is it not the soundest policy one piece of news seven thousand pounds of powder arrived last night we shall send you some of it as soon as we can but you must be patient and frugal we are lost in the extensiveness of our field of business we have a continental treasury to establish a paymaster to choose and a committee of correspondence or safety or accounts or something i know not what that has confounded us all this day shall i hail you speaker of the house or counsellor or what what kind of an election had you what sort of magistrates do you intend to make will your new legislative or executive feel bold or irresolute will your judicial hang and whip and fine and imprison without scruple i want to see our distressed country once more yet i dread the sight of devastation you observe in your letter the oddity of a great man he is a queer creature but you must love his dogs if you love him and forgive a thousand whims for the sake of the soldier and the scholar john adams mrs adams to mrs adams my dear— it is now almost three months since i left you in every part of which my anxiety about you and the children as well as our country has been extreme the business i have had upon my mind has been as great and important as can be entrusted to man and the difficulty and intricacy of it prodigious when fifty or sixty men have a constitution to form for a great empire at the same time that they have a country of fifteen hundred miles extent to fortify millions to arm and train a naval power to begin an extensive commerce to regulate numerous tribes of indians to negotiate with a standing army of twentyseven thousand men to raise pay victual and officer i really shall pity those fifty or sixty men i must see you ere long rice has written me a very good letter so has thaxter for which i thank them both love to the children j a p s i wish i had given you a complete history from the beginning to the end of the journey of the behavior of my compatriots no mortal tale can equal it i will tell you in future but you shall keep it secret the fidgets the whims the caprice the vanity the superstition the irritability of some of us is enough to— yours   the same sentiment is expressed in mr reeds letter to thomas bradford dated    august and published in the life written by his grandson vol i p       the writer does not seem to have relied upon any thing but his own recollection in this sketch as general lees letter remains and is highly characteristic it is here given in full considering the course which mr adams took in opposing his nomination as the second majorgeneral it is creditable to him although he was really under obligations to him for his final appointment as the third see mr adamss letter to j quincy—quincys memoir of quincy p     charles lee   october      john adams camp   october      my dear sir— as you may possibly harbor some suspicions that a certain passage in your intercepted letters may have made some disagreeable impressions on my mind i think it necessary to assure you that it is quite the reverse until the bulk of mankind is much altered i consider the reputation of being whimsical and eccentric rather as a panegyric than sarcasm and my love of dogs passes with me as a still higher compliment i have thank heaven a heart susceptible of friendship and affection i must have some object to embrace consequently when once i can be convinced that men are as worthy objects as dogs i shall transfer my benevolence and become as staunch a philanthropist as the canting addison affected to be but you must not conclude from hence that i give in to general misanthropy on the contrary when i meet with a biped endowed with generosity valor good sense patriotism and zeal for the rights of humanity i contract a friendship and passion for him amounting to bigotry or dotage and let me assure you without compliments that you yourself appear to me possessed of these qualities i give you my word and honor that i am serious and i should be unhappy to the greatest degree if i thought you would doubt of my sincerity your opinion therefore of my attainments as a soldier and scholar is extremely flattering long may you continue in this to me gratissimus error but something too much of this before this reaches you the astonishing and terrifying accusation or rather detection of dr church will be reported to the congress i call it astonishing for admitting his intentions not to be criminal so gross a piece of stupidity in so sensible a man is quite a portent and supposing him guilty it is terrifying to the last degree as such a revolt must naturally infect with jealousy all political affiance it will spread an universal diffidence and suspicion than which nothing can be more pernicious to men embarked in a cause like ours the corner stone of which is laid not only on honor virtue and disinterestedness but on the persuasion that the whole are actuated by the same divine principles i devoutly wish that such may not be the effects we long here to receive some news from the congress now is the time to show your firmness if the least timidity is displayed we and all posterity are ruined on the contrary at this crisis courage and steadiness must infuse the blessings of liberty not only to great britain but perhaps to all mankind do not go hobbling on like the prince of lilliput with one highheeled shoe one low one for you will undoubtedly fall upon your noses every step you take it is my humble opinion that you ought to begin by confiscating or at least laying under heavy contributions the estates of all the notorious enemies to american liberty through the continent this would lighten the burthen which must otherwise fall heavy on the shoulders of the community that afterwards you should invite all the maritime towns of the world into your ports if they are so dull as not to accept the invitation wean yourselves from all ideas of foreign commerce and become entirely a nation of ploughmen and soldiers a little habit and i am persuaded you will bless yourselves for the resolution but i am running into an essay shall therefore to prevent pedantry and impertinence stop short with once more assuring you that i am most truly and affectionately yours c lee my respects to your namesake and let me hear from you spada sends his love to you and declares in very intelligible language that he has fared much better since your allusion to him for he is caressed now by all ranks sexes and ages   this will scarcely surprise those who know that mr hancocks prevailing foible was a fondness for official distinction but the writer never was among those disposed on this account to depreciate the merit of this gentlemans services in the revolution in the general correspondence will be found a letter addressed to judge william tudor particularly on this subject the biography of hancock in sandersons collection is a curious specimen of unfavorable judgment in the guise of eulogy   the emotion was smothered enough by

accidental omission to carry out the sense with some such words as these we should not have lost canada   on his way to the congress at philadelphia after the recess the fashion of travelling is now

confirmation from the report of the rule which he is said to have adopted in speaking in sandersons collection of lives of the signers is the following account— mr rutledge often remarked that in the early period of his career he had been more than once in the awkward predicament of being oppressed with his own incoherency but—reflecting that few of a large audience could immediately perceive what was sense or the reverse that those who were capable of thus discriminating were probably the most generous and indulgent to youthful orators and that it was necessary at all events to succeed in his profession—he made it a positive rule never to sit down or to hesitate or halt but to talk on and brave it out with the best countenance he could assume   the intercepted letter in which allusion is

from the autobiography that follows these debates   in the resolutions as adopted the words and steel are here inserted   the three entries which follow seem to be notes of speeches made by the writer at this period in congress although it is not easy to decide precisely upon the form of the question proposed   this is perhaps the first draught of the well known motion made in committee of the whole on the sixth of may which was reported to the house on the tenth in the shape in which it appears extracted from the journal of that day   this in the first draught reads as follows no purchases of lands hereafter to be made of the indians by colonies or private persons before the limits of the colonies are ascertained to be valid all purchases of lands not included within those limits where ascertained to be made by contracts between the united states assembled or by persons for that purpose authorized by them and the great councils of the indians for the general benefit of all the united colonies   this article was stricken out   when the boundaries of any colony shall be ascertained by agreement or in the manner hereinafter directed all the other colonies shall guarantee to such colony the full and peaceable possession of and the free and entire jurisdiction in and over the territory included within such boundaries   the article was stricken out   for the more convenient management of the general interests of the united states delegates should be annually appointed in such manner as the legislature of each colony shall direct to meet at the city of philadelphia in the colony of pennsylvania until otherwise ordered by the united states assembled which meeting shall be on the first monday of november in every year with a power reserved to those who appointed the said delegates respectively to recall them or any of them at any time within the year and to send new delegates in their stead for the remainder of the year each colony shall support its own delegates in a meeting of the states and while they act as members of the council of state hereinafter mentioned   this motion did not succeed   the motion did not succeed   this amendment prevailed in committee the words those who appointed the said delegates respectively were stricken out and the words each state inserted the word colony was also stricken out where it occurs and state inserted it should be recollected that the first draught was reported by john dickinson the article was again amended in the house by cutting off the last clause and striking out the city of philadelphia as the place of meeting in this last shape it was transferred to and made the first part of the fifth article where it stands in the paper as finally adopted   probably passed over for the moment   the eighteenth article of the first draught enumerates the rights and powers of the united states among these is that of regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the indians   the clause was retained in committee with the addition of the following words not members of any of the states and makes a part of the ninth article as adopted   probably passed over for the moment   the original draught of the eleventh article of the confederation upon which this debate took place was in these words all charges of wars and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare and allowed by the united states assembled shall be defrayed out of a common treasury which shall be supplied by the several colonies in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age sex and quality except indians not paying taxes in each colony a true account of which distinguishing the white inhabitants shall be triennially taken and transmitted to the assembly of the united states taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and directions of the legislature of the several colonies within the time agreed upon by the united states assembled   notes of this speech of mr chase and of a portion of the debate were also taken by mr jefferson and they are found in the first volume of his papers published by his grandson mr randolph a comparison of the two reports as far as they go shows a substantial agreement between them but mr jeffersons contains an abstract of two speeches by mr adams which are not found elsewhere the first of them is inserted as having been made immediately after that of mr chase mr john adams observed that the numbers of people were taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the state and not as subjects of taxation that as to this matter it was of no consequence by what name you called your people whether by that of freemen or slaves that in some countries the laboring poor were called freemen in others they were called slaves but that the difference as to the state was imaginary only what matters it whether a landlord employing ten laborers on his farm gives them annually as much money as will buy them the necessaries of life or gives them such necessaries at short hand the ten laborers add as much wealth annually to the state increase its exports as much in the one case as the other certainly five hundred freemen produce no more profits no greater surplus for the payment of taxes than five hundred slaves therefore the state in which the laborers are called freemen should be taxed no more than that in which are those called slaves suppose by an extraordinary operation of nature or of law one half the laborers of a state could in the course of one night be transformed into slaves would the state be made the poorer or the less able to pay taxes that the condition of the laboring poor in most countries that of the fishermen particularly of the northern states is as abject as that of slaves it is the number of laborers which produces the surplus for taxation and numbers therefore indiscriminately are the fair index of wealth that it is the use of the word property here and its application to some of the people of the state which produces the fallacy how does the southern farmer procure slaves either by importation or by purchase from his neighbor if he imports a slave he adds one to the number of laborers in his country and proportionably to its profits and ability to pay taxes if he buys from his neighbor it is only a transfer of a laborer from one farm to another which does not change the annual produce of the state and therefore should not change its tax that if a northern farmer works ten laborers on his farm he can it is true invest the surplus of ten mens labor in cattle but so may the southern farmer working ten slaves that a state of one hundred thousand freemen can maintain no more cattle than one of one hundred thousand slaves therefore they have no more of that kind of property that a slave may indeed from the custom of speech be more properly called the wealth of his master than the free laborer might be called the wealth of his employer but as to the state both were equally its wealth and should therefore equally add to the quota of its tax   mr chases amendment was lost seven states new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york new jersey and pennsylvania voting against it delaware maryland virginia north and south carolina voting for it georgia divided the article amended only by substituting the word states for colonies was reported to the house as the ninth of the new draught it was again taken up on the  th of october      and discussed until the   th when the following important amendment was adopted— new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut voting unanimously in the negative new jersey maryland virginia north and south carolina unanimously in the affirmative new york and pennsylvania equally divided that the proportion of the public expense incurred by the united states for their common defence and general welfare to be paid by each state into the treasury be ascertained by the value of all land within each state granted to or surveyed for any person as such land the buildings and improvements thereon shall be estimated according to such mode as congress shall from time to time direct or appoint on the   d   d   th and   th of june      the various states proposed by their delegates amendments maryland massachusetts rhode island connecticut new jersey and south carolina each offered some form of modification of this article but they were all rejected see the history of the confederation at the end of the first volume of the secret journals vol i pp          from page       the order of the speakers in this debate does not correspond with the report made by mr jefferson but immediately before this speech of dr rush there is inserted by him a speech of mr adams which may properly find its place in this note john adams advocated the voting in proportion to numbers he said that we stand here as the representatives of the people that in some states the people are many in others they are few that therefore their vote here should be proportioned to the numbers from which it comes reason justice and equity never had weight enough on the face of the earth to govern the councils of men it is interest alone which does it and it is interest alone which can be trusted that therefore the interests within doors should be the mathematical representations of the interests without doors that the individuality of the colonies is a mere sound does the individuality of a colony increase its wealth or numbers if it does pay equally if it does not add weight in the scale of the confederacy it cannot add to their rights nor weigh in argument a has fifty pounds b five hundred pounds c one thousand pounds in partnership is it just they should equally dispose of the moneys of the partnership it has been said we are independent individuals making a bargain together the question is not what we are now but what we ought to be when our bargain shall be made the confederacy is to make us one individual only it is to form us like separate parcels of metal into one common mass we shall no longer retain our separate individuality but become a single individual as to all questions submitted to the confederacy therefore all those reasons which prove the justice and expediency of equal representation in other assemblies hold good here it has been objected that a proportional vote will endanger the smaller states we answer that an equal vote will endanger the larger virginia pennsylvania and massachusetts are the three greater colonies consider their distance their difference of produce of interests and of manners and it is apparent they can never have an interest or inclination to combine for the oppression of the smaller that the smaller will naturally divide on all questions with the larger rhode island from its relation similarity and intercourse will generally pursue the same objects with massachusetts jersey delaware and maryland with pennsylvania   the seventeenth article was reported to the house with only the change of the word colony for state as article thirteen of the new draught the struggle was renewed on the  th of october but without effect mr adamss vote stands recorded alone north of virginia in favor of an amendment basing representation upon population every state to have one delegate for every thirty thousand of its inhabitants and every delegate to have one vote the vote by states was finally incorporated into the fifth article as at last adopted   this makes in the first draught a part of the eighteenth article defining the rights and power of the united states limiting the bounds of those colonies which by charter or proclamation or under any pretence are said to extend to the south sea   this clause was stricken out in committee the subsequent history of the struggle is well known terminating in the acts of cession of claims to the western territory   the following memorandum gives in brief the system probably dilated upon in the speeches of the writer at this time— mem the confederation to be taken up in paragraphs an alliance to be formed with france and spain ambassadors to be sent to both courts government to be assumed in every colony coin and currencies to be regulated forces to be raised and maintained in canada and new york st lawrence and hudson rivers to be secured hemp to be encouraged and the manufacture of duck powdermills to be built in every colony and fresh efforts to make saltpetre an address to the inhabitants of the colonies the committee for lead and salt to be filled up and sulphur added to their commission money to be sent to the paymaster to pay our debts and fulfil our engagements taxes to be laid and levied funds established new notes to be given on interest for bills borrowed treaties of commerce with france spain holland denmark c   this essay will be found in another portion of this work   this was the very objection made in the state of virginia to his own as will appear hereafter in a remarkable letter of patrick henry to the author   see page       afterwards published in great britain under the title of a summary view of the rights of british america mr jeffersons account of it is given in the first volume of his grandsons publication of his papers p     it is due to mr jefferson here to say that his recollection of the event here described materially differs from this account in the month of august      colonel timothy pickering addressed to mr adams a letter of inquiry respecting the origin of the declaration of independence his reply contains so many other interesting particulars besides those which relate to the single purpose of the letter that it appears peculiarly suitable for insertion in this place in full william cooper john adams december   th      boston john adams to timothy pickering   august      sir— your favor of the  d instant has prescribed a dismal plan which i was never very well calculated to execute but i am now utterly incapable i can write nothing which will not be suspected of personal vanity local prejudice or provincial and state partiality however as i hold myself responsible at this age to one only tribunal in the universe i will give you a few hints at all hazards as mr hancock was sick and confined mr bowdoin was chosen at the head of the massachusetts delegation to congress his relations thought his great fortune ought not to be hazarded cushing two adamses and paine all destitute of fortune four poor pilgrims proceeded in one coach were escorted through massachusetts connecticut new york and new jersey into pennsylvania we were met at frankfort by dr rush mr mifflin mr bayard and several other of the most active sons of liberty in philadelphia who desired a conference with us we invited them to take tea with us in a private apartment they asked leave to give us some information and advice which we thankfully granted they represented to us that the friends of government in boston and in the eastern states in their correspondence with their friends in pennsylvania and all the southern states had represented us as four desperate adventurers mr cushing was a harmless kind of man but poor and wholly dependent on his popularity for his subsistence mr samuel adams was a very artful designing man but desperately poor and wholly dependent on his popularity with the lowest vulgar for his living john adams and mr paine were two young lawyers of no great talents reputation or weight who had no other means of raising themselves into consequence than by courting popularity we were all suspected of having independence in view now said they you must not utter the word independence nor give the least hint or insinuation of the idea either in congress or any private conversation if you do you are undone for the idea of independence is as unpopular in pennsylvania and in all the middle and southern states as the stamp act itself no man dares to speak of it moreover you are the representatives of the suffering state boston and massachusetts are under a rod of iron british fleets and armies are tyrannizing over you you yourselves are personally obnoxious to them and all the friends of government you have been long persecuted by them all your feelings have been hurt your passions excited you are thought to be too warm too zealous too sanguine you must be therefore very cautious you must not come forward with any bold measures you must not pretend to take the lead you know virginia is the most populous state in the union they are very proud of their ancient dominion as they call it they think they have a right to take the lead and the southern states and middle states too are too much disposed to yield it to them this was plain dealing mr pickering and i must confess that there appeared so much wisdom and good sense in it that it made a deep impression on my mind and it had an equal effect on all my colleagues this conversation and the principles facts and motives suggested in it have given a color complexion and character to the whole policy of the united states from that day to this without it mr washington would never have commanded our armies nor mr jefferson have been the author of the declaration of independence nor mr richard henry lee the mover of it nor mr chase the mover of foreign connections if i have ever had cause to repent of any part of this policy that repentance ever has been and ever will be unavailing i had forgot to say nor had mr johnson ever been the nominator of washington for general although this advice dwelt on my mind i had not in my nature prudence and caution enough always to observe it when i found the members of congress virginians and all so perfectly convinced that they should be able to persuade or terrify great britain into a relinquishment of her policy and a restoration of us to the state of      i was astonished and could not help muttering in congress and sometimes out of doors that they would find the proud domineering spirit of britain their vain conceit of their own omnipotence their total contempt of us and the incessant representation of their friends and instruments in america would drive us to extremities and finally conquer us transport us to england for trial there to be hanged drawn and quartered for treason or to the necessity of declaring independence however hazardous and uncertain such a measure might be it soon became rumored about the city that john adams was for independence the quakers and proprietary gentlemen took the alarm represented me as the worst of men the trueblue sons of liberty pitied me all put me under a kind of coventry i was avoided like a man infected with the leprosy i walked the streets of philadelphia in solitude borne down by the weight of care and unpopularity but every ship for the ensuing year brought us fresh proof of the truth of my prophecies and one after another became convinced of the necessity of independence i did not sink under my discouragements i had before experienced enough of the wantonness of popularity in the trial of preston and the soldiers in boston you inquire why so young a man as mr jefferson was placed at the head of the committee for preparing a declaration of independence i answer it was the frankfort advice to place virginia at the head of every thing mr richard henry lee might be gone to virginia to his sick family for aught i know but that was not the reason of mr jeffersons appointment there were three committees appointed at the same time one for the declaration of independence another for preparing articles of confederation and another for preparing a treaty to be proposed to france mr lee was chosen for the committee of confederation and it was not thought convenient that the same person should be upon both mr jefferson came into congress in june      and brought with him a reputation for literature science and a happy talent of composition writings of his were handed about remarkable for the peculiar felicity of expression though a silent member in congress he was so prompt frank explicit and decisive upon committees and in conversation not even samuel adams was more so that he soon seized upon my heart and upon this occasion i gave him my vote and did all in my power to procure the votes of others i think he had one more vote than any other and that placed him at the head of the committee i had the next highest number and that placed me the second the committee met discussed the subject and then appointed mr jefferson and me to make the draught i suppose because we were the two first on the list the subcommittee met jefferson proposed to me to make the draught i said i will not you should do it oh no why will you not you ought to do it i will not why reasons enough what can be your reasons reason first—you are a virginian and a virginian ought to appear at the head of this business reason second—i am obnoxious suspected and unpopular you are very much otherwise reason third—you can write ten times better than i can well said jefferson if you are decided i will do as well as i can very well when you have drawn it up we will have a meeting a meeting we accordingly had and conned the paper over i was delighted with its high tone and the flights of oratory with which it abounded especially that concerning negro slavery which though i knew his southern brethren would never suffer to pass in congress i certainly never would oppose there were other expressions which i would not have inserted if i had drawn it up particularly that which called the king tyrant i thought this too personal for i never believed george to be a tyrant in disposition and in nature i always believed him to be deceived by his courtiers on both sides of the atlantic and in his official capacity only cruel i thought the expression too passionate and too much like scolding for so grave and solemn a document but as franklin and sherman were to inspect it afterwards i thought it would not become me to strike it out i consented to report it and do not now remember that i made or suggested a single alteration we reported it to the committee of five it was read and i do not remember that franklin or sherman criticized any thing we were all in haste congress was impatient and the instrument was reported as i believe in jeffersons handwriting as he first drew it congress cut off about a quarter of it as i expected they would but they obliterated some of the best of it and left all that was exceptionable if any thing in it was i have long wondered that the original draught has not been published i suppose the reason is the vehement philippic against negro slavery as you justly observe there is not an idea in it but what had been hackneyed in congress for two years before the substance of it is contained in the declaration of rights and the violation of those rights in the journals of congress in      indeed the essence of it is contained in a pamphlet voted and printed by the town of boston before the first congress met composed by james otis as i suppose in one of his lucid intervals and pruned and polished by samuel adams your friend and humble servant on the national anniversary succeeding the date of this letter colonel pickering quoted the latter part of it in the course of some remarks made by him at a celebration of the day in salem this drew forth a letter from mr jefferson to mr madison denying its accuracy particularly in the matter of the subcommittee and attributing the error to the failing memory of eightyeight the assumed age of mr adams at the time mr jefferson did not then know what the present publication of the autobiography shows not to speak of mr pickerings letter of inquiry that almost the identical statement had been made not only in conversation long before but also in this record by mr adams nearly twenty years earlier so that if it be an error it cannot be attributed merely to age perceiving also the awkward nature of the charge made by one—himself—having at the moment nearly attained fourscore mr jefferson disclaims all reliance upon his recollection and appeals to the unequivocal authority of his notes made at the time this seemed conclusive testimony sufficient to set the matter at rest forever but if by those notes is to be understood no more than what has since been published under that name in the first volume of his correspondence it is clear on examination that they present no evidence excepting that which may be implied by their affirming nothing in corroboration the question in itself does not rise beyond the character of a curiosity of literature as the substantial facts in both accounts are the same the case having been stated the reader must be left to form his opinions from the materials before him among the papers left by mr adams is a transcript by his own hand of the declaration of independence very nearly as it appears in mr jeffersons first draught this must have been made by him before the paper had been subjected to any change in committee as none of the alterations which appear on the original as made at the instance of dr franklin and but one of the two suggested by himself are found there several variations occur however in the phraseology and one or two passages are wholly omitted the most natural inference is that he had modified it to suit his own notions of excellence without deeming the alterations worth pressing in committee as mr jefferson says that his draught was submitted separately first to mr adams and afterwards to dr franklin the presence of this copy does not affect the question of the correctness of either version of the proceedings  compare this with the language of the rev jacob duché in his letter to general washington bankrupts attorneys and men of desperate fortunes are the colleagues of mr hancock graydons memors of his own time littells edition appendix p      dr benjamin rush says of the author in a manuscript in the editors hands—i saw this gentleman walk the streets
