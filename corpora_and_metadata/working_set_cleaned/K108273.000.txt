the law of passive obedience or christian submission to personal injuries  wherein is shown that the several texts of scripture which command the entire submission of servants or slaves to their masters cannot authorize the latter to exact an involuntary servitude nor in the least degree justify the claims of modern slaveholders  by granville sharp  servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god etc coloss iii    the law of passive obedience or christian submission to personal injuries the illegality of slavery among christians is a point which i have long labored to demonstrate as being destructive of morality and consequently dangerous both to body and soul there are nevertheless some particular texts in the new testament which in the opinion even of several well meaning and disinterested persons seem to afford some proof of the toleration of slavery among the primitive christians and from thence they are induced to conceive that christianity does not oblige its professors to renounce the practice of slaveholding  a learned and reverend correspondent of mine seems to have adopted this notion and has signified his opinion nearly to the same effect in a private letter to me on this subject to which i have not yet ventured to send him a reply though it is a considerable time since i received his letter but to say the truth the question in which i had never before apprehended any difficulty was rendered very serious and important upon my hands by my friends declaration and i thought myself bound to give it the strictest examination because i conceived as i do still that the honor of the holy scriptures which of all other things i have most at heart was concerned in the determination of the point in question and yet i know that my friend is full as zealous for the honor of the scriptures as myself and much more learned in them being very eminent in that most essential branch of knowledge  i believe also that he is perfectly disinterested and of undoubted christian benevolence the objection has therefore acquired an accumulated weight from the authority and worth of the person who made it and consequently it demanded more circumspection and reading to answer it in any reasonable time than my short broken intervals of leisure the only time that i was then master of would permit me to bestow upon it and as so much time has already elapsed the answer which i originally intended for my friends private perusal shall now be addressed to all well meaning persons in general who may have had the same motives for admitting in any degree the legality of slavery and that there are many such even among those that are concerned in the practice of slaveholding the example of my disinterested friends opinion and common charity oblige me to suppose i shall therefore consider my friends opinion as the common excuse of our american and west indian brethren for tolerating slavery aamong them  i do not think says he that christianity released slaves from the obligation they were under according to the custom and law of the countries where it was propagated this objection to my general doctrine is expressed in the most guarded terms  so guarded that it obliges me to acknowledge that the observation is in some respects strictly true my present attempt is not to confute but rather to demonstrate wherein this truth consists which will afterward enable me to point out such a due limitation of the doctrine as will render it entirely consistent with the hypothesis which i have so long labored to maintain viz the absolute illegality of slavery among christians  in conformity to my worthy friends declaration i must first observe that the disciples of christ whose kingdom he himself declared  is not of this world john xviii    had no express commission to alter the temporal condition of men but only to prepare them for a better world by the general doctrines of faith hope charity peace and goodwill or universal love and benevolence to all mankind submission to injuries dependence upon god etc etc etc which though general doctrines are amply and sufficiently efficacious indeed for the particular reformation of all conditions of men when sincerity is not wanting in the application of them but the principal intention of the whole system is evidently to draw men from the the cares and anxieties of this present life to a better hope in the life to come which is christs proper kingdom christian servants therefore were of course instructed to be patient to be humble and submissive to their masters not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward so that even ill usage does not justify perverseness of behavior in christian slaves  the apostle paul also frequently insists upon the absolute necessity of an unfeigned obedience in the behavior of christian servants to their masters let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called art thou called being a servant care not for it etc   cor vii    and again servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ not with eye service as men pleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free ephesians vi    again servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not which eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god and whatever you do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men colos iii       the same apostle instructs timothy to recommend obedience to servants let as many servants says the apostle as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof comes envy strife railings evilfurmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content   timothy vi   to    and again he insists on the same doctrine exhort servants says he to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not purloining but showing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things titus ii    0  these texts are amply sufficient to prove the truth of my learned friends assertion so far as it relates to the duty of the slaves themselves but this absolute submission required of christian servants by no means implies the legality of slaveholding on the part of their masters which he seems to apprehend  the slave violates no precepts of the gospel by his abject condition provided that the same is involuntary for if he can be made free he is expressly commanded by the apostle to use it rather art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou may be made free use it rather for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman etc ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men   cor vii       but how the master who enforces that involuntary servitude can be said to act consistently with the christian profession is a question of a very different nature which i propose to examine with all possible care and impartiality being no otherwise interested in it than as a christian who esteems both masters and slaves as brethren and consequently while he pities the unhappy temporal condition of the latter is extremely nxious for the eternal welfare of the former  i have already admitted that christianity does not release slaves from the obligation they were under according to the custom and law of the countries where it was propagated agreeable to my learned friends assertion in favor of which i have produced a variety of texts but as the reason of the law according to a maxim of the english law is the life of the law we cannot with justice draw any conclusion from thence in favor of the masters claim till we have examined the principles on which the doctrine of submission in these several texts is founded and we shall find upon a general view of the whole that the principal reason of enforcing the doctrine was not so much because the persons to whom it was addressed were slaves as because they were christians and were to overcome evil with good to the glory of god and religion  these principles are clearly expressed in several of these very texts and implied in all of them viz  that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed   timothy vi   and again that they may adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things titus ii  0 so that a zeal for the glory of god and of his religion the principles of the first great commandment is the apparent ground and sole purpose of the christian slaves submission which was therefore to be with singleness of heart as unto christ not with eye service as men pleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free ephesians vi    and again the same apostle charges the servants among the colossians to obey not as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god and whatsoever they do to do it heartil as to the lord and not unto men coloss iii    thus it is plain that the service was to be performed as to the lord and not to men and therefore it cannot be construed as an acknowledgement of any right or property really vested in the master this will clearly appear upon a closer examination of some of these texts in the first for instance though the apostle peter enforces the necessity of the servants submission to their masters in the strongest manner commanding them to be subject not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward etc   pet ii    yet he adds in the very next verse  for this is thank worthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully   so that it is manifest the apostle did not mean to justify the claim of the masters because he enjoined the same submission to the servants that suffered wrongfully as to those who had good and gentle masters and it would be highly injurious to the gospel of peace to suppose it capable of authorizing wrongful sufferings or of establishing a right or power in any rank of men whatever to oppress others unjustly or  and though the apostle paul also so strongly exhorts servants to submit to their masters and to abide in the same calling wherein they were called and  not to care for it   corinthians vii  0    yet at the same time he clearly instructs them that it is their duty to prefer a state of freedom whenever they can fairly and honestly obtain it but if thou may be made free says he use it rather v   and the reason which he assigns for this command is as plainly delivered viz the equality of servants with their masters in the fight of the almighty for he that is called in the lord being a servant says he is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs servant verse    christ having purchased all men to be his peculiar servants or rather freemen ye are bought with a price says the apostle in the   d verse be not ye the servants of men which plainly implies that it is inconsistent with the dignity of a christian who is the servant or freeman of god to be held in an unlimited subjection as the bond servant or slave of a man and consequently that a toleration of slavery in places where christianity is established by law is entirely illegal for though the slave commits no crime by submitting to the involuntary service which has been already demonstrated yet the christian master is guilty of a sort of sacrilege by appropriating to himself as an absolute property that body which peculiarly belongs to god by an inestimable purchase for if god said of the jews even under the old law levit xxv    they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen my learned friend mentioned in the beginning of this tract has remarked that though god expressed himself concerning the jews under the law in this manner they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen etc yet this did not signify says he that they were not to be slaves at all they might be slaves for seven years as is well known notwithstanding they were gods redeemed servants nay they might remain slaves till the jubilee with their own consent at the expiration of that short term of involuntary servitude these words indeed contained a declaration that none of the israelites were to be slaves for ever like the heathen but what a slippery proof says he of this exemption with regard to christians how dangerous continued he is it to build doctrines upon such parallels and comparisons but my worthy friend seems to forget that the kind of slavery which i oppose is not that limited temporary servitude which he describes as consistent with the law for that differs very little from the condition of hired servants in which light the hebrew masters were bound by the law to look upon their brethren even though bought with their money as bond servants or slaves if thy brother that dwells by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shatl not compel him to serve as a bond servant but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him etc for they are my servants said the almighty they shall not be sold as bondmen thou shall not rule over him with rigor but shall fear thy god levit xxv       here is the very text with it is context which i had quoted to show the illegality of holding a brother israelite in absolute slavery and as i have elsewere fully demonstrated that men of all nations are to be considered as brethren under the gospel dispensation so my learned friend surely does great injustice to the argument when he calls it a slippery proof of this exemption with regard to christians and asserts that the text in question does not signify that they the israelites were not to be slaves at all it clearly signifies however that whatsoever right a master might have acquired even by an absolute purchase over his hebrew brother yet that he was still required to treat him as an hired servant and to discharge him and his at a limited time and when we compare it with the parallel text in deuterenomy xv       we find the master is there strictly enjoined to reward the bondman liberally for his past services viz and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shall furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy wine press etc surely when the true nature of such limited servitude is duly considered it affords but  a slippery proof if i may use my friends expression that they were to be slaves at all at least  at all in the sense contended for by our american and west india slaveholders which is the only matter in dispute at present especially as the condition of a hired servant is expressly mentioned as the rank in which such bondmen were to be esteemed and therefore i trust i may fairly retort the observation of my learned friend   how dangerous is it to build doctrines that is in favor of absolute slavery upon such parallels and comparisons how much more ought christians to esteem their brethren as the peculiar servants of god on account of their being freed from the more severe bondage of our spiritual enemy of which the egyptian bondage was only a type by the inestimable price of christs blood and surely we may therefore say they are gods servants whom christ has redeemed with his own blood as much as the jews of old who were on that account expressly enfranchised from worldly bondage they are my servants they shall not be sold as bondmen for this application of the text is entirely to the same effect as the apostles expression to the corinthians  ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men   cor vii    dr whithy indeed supposes that the words  ye are bought with a price refer only to a pecuniary price given by the primitive christians to buy their brethren out of slavery but the authority of justin martyr and tertullian which he cites by no means proves his interpretation of the text though it may sufficiently prove the primitive practice of redeeming slaves which also furnishes a new argument against the legality of slavery among christians so far as the example of the primitive christians is concerned but scripture is best interpreted by scripture and therefore the most certain means of ascertaining the true meaning of the words  ye are bought with a price is to have recourse to the very same expression  the words being only transposed in the preceding chapter  0th verse where we shall find that it can refer to nothing less than the inestimable price of christs redemption what know ye not says the apostle that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods   cor vi     0 and consequently it is the duty of a christian legislature to vindicate the lords freemen from slavery as all mankind are included in the same inestimable purchase for it is not only their souls but even their bodies which are gods and therefore it is an abominable sacrilege that those bodies which are capable of being the temple of the holy ghost should be esteemed the mere chattels and private property of mercenary planters and merchants merely for the sake of a little worldly gain  but slaveholders may perhaps allege that believing masters are mentioned as  faithful and beloved in one of the texts which i have cited and are also expressly accounted as  partakers of the benefit see   timothy vi   so that from thence they may perhaps infer that slavekeeping is not inconsistent with their christian profession  but these expressions are included in that part of the apostles charge to timothy which relates merely to the instruction of servants so that there is no room to suppose that any reference was intended to the practice of the masters by way of justification the meaning therefore can amount to no more than this viz that as it is the duty of servants to  count their own masters even those that are unbelievers  worthy of all honor apparently meaning  all honor which is not inconsistent with their duty to god  that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed so the same reason obliges them more especially to count their believing masters worthy of all lawful honor because of their christian profession which renders them accepted of god for common charity obliges us as christians to suppose that all men who believe and hold the same profession as ourselves are  faithful and beloved as well as partakers of the benefit of christs redemption christs redemption does not seem to be  the benefit spoken of in the text though i have admitted this implication to avoid controversy dr whitby supposes that the benefit of the service is meant and he construes the sentence accordingly because they who partakesof the benefit of the service are faithful and beloved and dr george benson also renders it in the same sense viz because they who partake of the benefit of their service are christians and beloved of god and then he adds in a note this says he i take to have been spoken of the masters who received the benefit of the service of their slaves so the author of the syriae version seems to have understood the words the ms called pet   read  labor and pet   and borner read  piety for which he refers us to kusters edition of dr mill  and finally says he i would observe that  is never used throughout the new testament for the privilege of having the gospel or the unspeakable benefit of eternal life because belief is the true means of leading and disposing men to acquire such happiness and though many other necessary christian qualities may seem wanting in our believing brethren yet we must not presume to condemn them god alone being their judge and for this reason also christian servants must not condemn and despise their believing masters though they know themselves equalin dignity as brethren and that it is consequently their masters duty to treat them as brethren but must render them service the more willingly on this account having brotherly love as an additional motive to faithful service it is manifest therefore that this text was intended to regulate the conduct of christian servants and not that of christian masters for with regard to the former the doctrine is perfectly consistent with the other texts that i have quoted which is not the case when it is applied to justify the mere temporal claims of masters or slaveholders because there are many clear and incontrovertible precepts throughout the new testament for regulating the conduct of christian masters which exclude the justification of any such claims among christians and consequently forbid any application or interpretation of these particular texts in favor of them and besides we must always remember that it is not lawful to maintain an hypothesis upon the testimony of any one single text of doubtful interpretation especially when the same does not clearly correspond with the rest of the scriptures and cannot bear the test of the royal law of which more shall be said in my tract on the law of liberty  i mention this text of st paul as one of doubtful interpretation because commentators are divided concerning the application of the very words on which the imaginary justification of the slaveholder is supposed to be founded many learned men and dr hammond among the rest have construed the words     timothy vi   these words are translated by dr hammond as follows  because they who help to do good are faithful and beloved and he uses several arguments to show that these epithets refer to the servants rather than to the masters in a very different manner from the common version and applied them to the servants which entirely destroys the presumption in favor of the slaveholder  nevertheless i have contented myself with the common rendering being convinced that no conclusions can fairly be drawn from this text in favor of slavery even when the epithets faithful and beloved etc are applied to the masters because the signification of them must necessarily be restrained within the bounds of gospel doctrine and therefore we cannot conceive that the apostle intended by the application of these epithets to justify any practices which are inconsistent with the benevolence enjoined in other parts of the new testament for this would be liable to produce a contrary effect from that which the apostle expressly intended by his injunction viz that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed  thus it appears i hope that the principles on which the doctrine of the servants submission is founded are clearly expressed so that slaveholders can have no right to avail themselves of any of these texts to enforce an absolute submission for though these several texts clearly justify the slave yet they cannot justify the master unless he can show that the same principles or reason of the law on which they are founded hold good also on his side of the question   this is apparently the case in the other different relations of life mentioned in these contexts as in the relation between husbands and their wives parents and their children but is far otherwise in the relation between masters and their servants unless free hired servants are to be understood and therefore the objection of my learned friend drawn from thence cannot be just he says if the connection of persons in the two former respects be lawful so that husbands had a right to the subjection of their wives and wives a right to the love of their husbands parents had a right to the honor and obedience of their children and children a right to maintenance and instruction by their parents unnatural says he is it to imagine the connection between masters and slaves was looked upon by him as absolutely unlawful so that the former had no right to rule the latter indeed he very clearly signifies says he that the right of dominion remained when be opposes doing wrong to obeying in all things their masters according to the flesh etc as he does coloss iii       but my learned friend has entirely misunderstood the purport and intention of my arguments on these several texts relating to obedience and submission i have not attempted to prove by these particular expressions of the apostle that the connection between masters and slaves was looked upon by him as absolutely unlawful so that the former had no right to rule the latter for this i have demonstrated i trust by other authorities of scripture equally authentic and much less liable to be misunderstood my attempt to explain the texts in question extends no farther than to show that they do not really justify the uncharitable claims of the modern slaveholders though they are frequently cited for that purpose  an attempt to show that any particular doctrine is not necessarily implied in a certain text or texts of scripture is a very different thing from an attempt to prove or authenticate an opposite doctrine by the same text of scripture for instance when my learned friend asserts as above that the apostle to the colossians iii    very clearly signifies that the right of dominion remained when he opposes doing wrong to obeying in all things their masters etc i do not pretend to build an opposite doctrine upon the very same words but shall only endeavor to show that this supposed right of dominion is not necessarily implied in the text which my friend has cited in support of it  the servants are indeed expressly and plainly exhorted to obedience and submission as well in this as in all the other texts before recited so that a contrary behavior in them might certainly be esteemed a doing wrong on their part yet this by no means implies a right of dominion vested in the master for that would prove too much because the like submission is elsewhere equally enjoined to those who are expressly said to endure grief suffering wrongfully  and we cannot suppose as i have before observed that the submission enjoined implies a right in the master to exercise such a dominion as that of oppressing others unjustly or  for that could not possibly tend to promote the declared purposes of the apostles exhortations viz that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed   timothy vi and again that they may adorn the doctrine of god in all things titus ii   these purposes however are fully answered in the advice given by the same apostle to all the other different relations of life mentioned by my worthy friend wives may adorn the doctrine of god by submission to their own husbands as it is fit in the lord see coloss iii    and husbands by love to their wives for they are expressly charged in the following verse not to be bitter against them that is they must by love and sincere affection moderate and soften that supreme authority with which husbands are entrusted by the laws of god and man that they may rule rather by the gentle influence of an inviolable love and fidelity as so good an example will seldom fail to produce due respect and will certainly adorn the doctrine or profession of the christian children may adorn the doctrine of god by obedience to their parents in all things for this is wellpleasing says the text unto the lord v  0 and again the reciprocal duty of fathers is plainly pointed out to be a prudent moderation of that paternal authority with which they are entrusted for they are carefully warned against an arbitrary severity provoke not says the apostle your children to anger lest they be discouraged servants are in the very next verse v    commanded to obey in all things their masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god so that the submission of the servants was also to adorn the doctrine of god it being manifestly enjoined only for gods sake and not on account of any supposed right of dominion invested in the masters which the following verses v    and    when applied to the servants sufficiently demonstrate  and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ and to the same eternal and unerring dispenser of rewards and not to temporal masters is attributed the power of punishing the doing wrong mentioned in the very next verse which according to my learned friends notion is opposed to obeying in all things the masters  he that does wrong says the text shall receive for the wrong which he has done and there is no respect of persons v     such strict impartiality in the administration of justice cannot always be attributed with certainty even to the bestregulated human tribunal and much less is it applicable to the decisions of uncontrouled will and pleasure in punishing wrong doing under the absolute dominion of slaveholders no earthly dominion whatever is conducted with such an equal distribution of rewards and punishments as that it may always with truth be said there is no respect of persons for this is the proper characteristic of the judgments and dominion of god and christ alone for the lord is judge and with him is no respect of persons ecclesiasticus xxxv     for there is no respect of persons with god romans ii    and therefore we may fairly conclude that the punishment not only of slaves but that also of masters that do wrong is to be understood in the text which my friend has cited to support his notion of a right of dominion vested in the masters so that the said supposed right has indeed but a very slippery foundation agreeable to my last remark on this text coloss iii    the learned dr whitby has commented upon it as if he thought it exactly parallel to another declaration of the same apostle viz ephesians vi   and   wherein not only both masters and servants are unquestionably included but also the dominion or judgment in which there is no respect of persons is expressly attributed to our master in heaven  christ in judging men at the last day says the doctor will have no respect to the quality or external condition of any mans person but whether he be bond or free he shall receive recompense for the good that he has done in obedience to him whether he be master or servant he shall be punished for the wrong that he does in those relations  if all these circumstances be duly considered it will manifestly appear i trust that the masters supposed right of dominion which certainly is not expressed in the text cannot even be implied in these contexts nor in any of the parallel passages already recited can the master adorn the doctrine of god our savior as in the other indissoluble relations of life by continuing the unnatural connection of master and slave and by exacting involuntary labor from his brethren without wages or reward agreeable to my friends notions of the supposed implied right of dominion the reciprocal duty of the master is mentioned indeed in the next chapter col iv   but it is of such a nature as must necessarily lead christian masters to abhor any such supposed right of dominion as that which is tolerated in the british colonies and which my friend seems desirous to defend the masters are not directed by the apostle to claim as their own by right of dominion the labor of their servants without wages but on the contrary are expressly commanded to give unto their servants that which is just and equal which comprehends as i have fully shown in the preceding tract such a measure of generosity recompense and benevolence on the part of the master as is totally inconsistent with the claims and views of modern slaveholders and if put in practice would necessarily effect the entire abolition of slavery  the masters are likewise carefully reminded in the last mentioned text that they also have a master in heaven col iv    a master by whose example they are bound to regulate their conduct so that this consideration alone is a sufficient antidote against slavery for the principal doctrine of that heavenly master was love which cannot subsist with the contrary exaction of involuntary servitude this is my commandment said that glorious and gracious master  that ye love one another as i have loved you the nature of his love which we are to imitate that is to love as he has loved us is then immediately described as exceeding all bounds of comparison  greater love said he has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants here is an express enfranchisement of his servants for our example the universal lord and master of all men delights in promoting the dignity of human nature which cannot be said of the temporal slaveholder who enforces an imaginary right of dominion by exacting an involuntary service and that for no other purpose than for the sake of a little pecuniary gain by depriving the labourer of his hire which savours of no other love but selflove whereas our disinterested lord and master has even laid down his life through love and compassion to his servants and has declared us free as before recited  henceforth i call you not servants for the servant said he knows not what his lord does but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you john xv      and in the   th verse he again enforces his doctrine of love  these things i command you said he that ye love one another the measure of this indispensible love is expressly declared in the scriptures thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself love works no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law romans xiii   and  0  such love therefore is clearly incompatible with the arbitrary claims of the slaveholder who can neither be said to love his neighbor as himself nor to cherish that love which works no ill to his neighbor whilst he strenuously contends for such a right of dominion as may enable him to exact not only the involuntary service of his neighbors and brethren contrary to the law of nature but also to rob them of the fruits of their own labors giving them not for their work against which practices a severe denunciation of woe is expressly declared in the scriptures as i have fully demonstrated in my tract on the law of retribution as well as in the preceding tract and therefore as it is necessary to construe difficult or dubious passages of scripture consisttently with the general tenor of scripture evidence it would be highly improper to admit this opposite doctrine of a supposed right of dominion especially as the same is not expressed in the text which my learned friend has cited for it but is merely drawn forth by an imaginary implication   can the slaveholders and african traders allege for instance that they shall adorn the doctrine of god our savior titus ii  0 by persisting in their unnatural pretensions to an absolute property in their poor brethren or that they do the will of god from the heart ephesians vi   etc when they retain their neighbor in an involuntary unrewarded servitude for life if they can do this i shall have reason to be silent but if on the contrary it should evidently appear that a very different behavior is required of christian masters that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed   timothy vi   they must be obliged to allow that the reason or life of the law is against them and consequently that none of these texts relating to christian servants are capable of affording them the least excuse for their selfish pretensions they will find also upon a more careful examination of the scriptures that they themselves are as much bound by the gospel to bear personal injuries with patience and humility as their slaves because the benevolent principles of the gospel of peace require all men freemen as well as slaves to return good for evil  bless them that curse you said our lord and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smites thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that takes away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also etc luke vi       but though submission and placability are thus unquestionably enjoined to the sufferers in all the cases above recited in the text yet surely no reasonable man will pretend to allege from thence that tyrants and oppressors have thereby obtained a legal right under the gospel to curse others and use them despitefully or that the unjust oppression of strikers and robbers is thereby authorized or justified in the same light exactly must we view the slaveholders claim of private property in the persons of men whenever an attempt is made to support it on the foundation of any such texts as i have quoted wherein servants or slaves are exhorted to submit with passive obedience etc to their masters because the right as it is improperly called or pretension of the master may with the greatest propriety be compared to the pretended right or authority of oppressing or robbing others which is too often exercised by imperial tyrants and despotic princes as well as by their brethren in iniquity of a lower class viz pirates highwaymen and extortioners of every degree the gospel of peace cannot authorize the oppression of these lawless men though it clearly enjoins patience submission and acquiescence to the individuals that are enjured whether freemen or slaves the placability and absolute submission commanded by the lastcited text to christians in general are manifestly founded on the very same principles with that particular submission which the gospel requires of christian slaves and is farther parallel to the latter by being equally passive so that the oppression of the slaveholder can no more be justified by any text of the new testament that i am able to find than the oppression of the striker and robber  unhappily for the christian world the duties of patience submission and placability enjoined by the gospel to persons injured are too commonly either misunderstood or rejected though the temporal as well as the eternal happiness of mankind greatly depends upon a conscientious and proper observation of these duties for even the most rigid obedience to the letter of the command would be far from being productive either of the real evils to which the pernicious doctrine of a national passive obedience apparently tends or of the imaginary inconveniences apprehended by the advocates for duelling because the same benevolent principles viz universal love and charity founded on the great commandment thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself which oblige the true christian most disinterestedly to forgive all injuries and pass over every affront offered to his own person will necessarily engage him on the other hand as disinterestedly to oppose every degree of oppression and injustice which affects his brethren and neighbors when he has a fair opportunity of assisting them and from hence arises the zeal of good men for just and equitable laws as being the most effectual means of preserving the peace and happiness of the community by curbing the insolence and violence of wicked men we have an eminent example of this loyal zeal in the behavior of the apostle paul who could not brook an infringement of the roman liberty from any persons whatever in the administration of government though he could endure personal injuries from men unconnected therewith and the persecutions of the multitude with all the christian patience and meekness which the gospel requires the scripturehistory of this great apostle affords many proofs of his extraordinary humility and patience under sufferings so that his spirited opposition to the illegal proceedings of magistrates cannot be attributed to private resentment on his own account but merely to his zeal for the public good founded upon the great christian principle of loving his neighbor as himself since the maintaining of good laws is certainly the most effectual means of promoting the welfare and happiness of society his resolute and free censure of the magistrates at philippi in the message which he sent by their own sergeants   and when it was day the magistrates sent the sergeants saying let those men go and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out and the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city acts xvi    to    his spirited remonstrance to the chief captain at jerusalem   the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against him and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou do for this man is a roman then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman he said yea and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom and paul said but i was free born then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain was also afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them acts xxii    to  0 and his severe rebuke to the high priest himself even on the seat of judgment   and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth then paul said unto him god shall smite thee thou white wall for sit thou to judge me after the law and command me to be smitten contrary to the law and they that stood by said revilest thou gods high priest then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shall not speak evil of the ruler of thy people acts xxiii   to   are remarkable instances of this observation  in the lastmentioned instance indeed the apostle was charged by those that stood by with reviling gods high priest which would have been a notorious breach of the law had there not been circumstances of justification sufficient to vindicate the severity of the apostles censure these however were not urged by the apostle himself who best knew how to behave toward those with whom he had to do he readily allowed the principle however on which the censure of his accusers was founded but he by no means retracted what he had so justly applied to the person of the unworthy magistrate who sat to judge him neither did he even acknowledge him to be the high priest though he was expressly questioned for a supposed misbehaviour to that dignitary his answer was cautiously worded  he did not say  i knew not that this person whom i have censured was the high priest but   etc i knew not brethren that there is a high priest   the learned hugh broughton has construed the text as follows  i knew not brethren that there was a high priest but the words  are more literally rendered above castalio reads it  nesciebam fratres esse pontificem  and heinsius  summum esse sacerdotem ignorabam which answer though on the first hearsay it seems to bear some affinity to an excuse or apology for what had past yet in reality includes a still farther rebuke for it plainly implies that the high priest in whose presence the apostle then stood was in some respect or other deficient or blameable in his deportment as chief magistrate either that he did not duly support the dignity of that sacred and distinguishing public character so that he did not seem to be high priest and of course could not be known and honored as such or else that his behavior had been so unjust and illegal that he did not deserve to be considered as a lawful magistrate who had publicly demeaned himself as a tyrant by commanding a prisoner to be beaten contrary to law without hearing his defense and that this latter sense is most probable we may learn by the following circumstance viz that the apostle chose to decline the dispute and to wave the accusation about reviling the high priest by acknowledging the principle of law on which it was manifestly founded viz thou shall not speak evil of the ruler of thy people but be pleased to observe he neither acknowledged that he himself had broken the said precept by so severely censuring the unjust ruler nor did he acknowledge the presence of a high priest in the person of ananias neither did he allow the bystanders time enough to criticize upon the true literal meaning of his reply whereby they would probably have been led to demand some express recantation of the personal censure which he had so amply bestowed upon the high priest but he prudently changed the subject in debate from the person of the high priest who was a zealous overbearing sadducee    etc but the younger ananus who as we have said obtained the pontificate was of a bold and daring disposition and followed the sect of the sadducees who with respect to judgments are more cruel than all the rest of the jews as we have already demonstrated therefore ananias being of this stamp etc to an avowed censure of his whole sect charging the sadducees in particular with the unjust persecution then before the assembly and openly appealing to the opposite party the pharisees in order to divide his united enemies i am a pharisee said he the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question such a manifest reflection against the whole body of sadducees cannot by any means favor the supposition of an intended apology or recantation in the preceding sentence to soothe the enraged leader of that very party whom he had publicly branded as a hypocrite with the significant appellation of whited wall let it be also remembered that the supposed breach of the precept thou shall not speak evil of the ruler of thy people could not rest entirely on the circumstance of knowing ananias to be the high priest for whether the apostle did know or did not know that ananias was high priest yet he certainly knew before he censured him that he was a ruler of the people and that he then sat in the quality of a judge for this is declared in the very censure itself  sit thou to judge me after the law and command me to be smitten contrary to law so that whether ananias was really high priest or not yet he was manifestly censured in his official capacity as a ruler or magistrate and not as a private individual through any inadvertency or mistake of the apostle as some commentators have conceived and even when the apostle was informed by those that stood by that the magistrate whom he had censured was the high priest revilest thou gods high priest yet his reply i knew not brethren that there is a high priest when fairly compared with the preceding censure of ananias as an unjust dispenser of gods law sit thou to judge me according to law etc proves as i before remarked that the apostle neither acknowledged the dignity of a high priest nor that of a legal ruler in the person of ananias though he knew him at the same time to be a ruler and had censured him as such for having notoriously prostituted the power and authority of a ruler and violated the law by commanding him to be stricken contrary to law notwithstanding that he sat to judge as the apostle remarked according to the law in which case no epithet whatever could be so apt and expressive to mark the true character of the dignified hypocrite in power as whited wall this proves that the apostle knew well enough with whom he had to do the censure was too just and his prophecy in the accomplishment too true  god shall smite thee thou whited wall   this denunciation of gods vengeance against ananias was fully justified by the event for josephus as the learned monsieur martin remarks reports that he was killed in jerusalem with his brother ezechias josephe rapporte live   de la guerre des juifs quil fut massacre dans jerusalem avec son friar ezechias to be esteemed a mere unguarded sally of resentment the latter supposition is indeed inconsistent with the remarkable sagacity prudence and readiness of mind which always distinguished this apostle in bearing his testimony to the truth on the most dangerous emergences the apostles known character as a chosen vessel for christs service and as an exemplary preacher of righteousness will by no means permit us to conceive that he was either guilty of any mistake or inadvertency with respect to the person of the high priest on this occasion or of any illegal or misbecoming behavior to him as a ruler or judge of the people when these several circumstances are compared with the general bad character of ananias   this malicious sadducee very soon afterward gave so flagrant a proof of his injustice and cruelty toward the christians that even the jewish historian josephus has recorded it as an event which gave offense to all good and loyal men at that time in jerusalem i mean the murder of the apostle james bishop of jerusalem whom josephus styles the brother of jesus who was called christ the jewish historian therein bears a remarkable testimony in favor of christianity   for he is described in the preceding quotation from josephus as a bold daring man of the most cruel sect  which is translated by mr whiston as follows  when therefore ananus was of this disposition he thought he had now a proper opportunity to exercise his authority festus was dead and albinus was but upon the road so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges and brought before them the brother of jesus who was called christ whose name was james and some others or some of his companions and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law he delivered them to be sioned the most equitable of the citizens and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws disliked what was done they also sent to the king agrippa desiring him to send to ananus that he should act so no more for that what he had already done was not to be justified as a persecuting zealot of the most virulent and intolerant sect among the jews it must appear that the apostle accounted that person unworthy of any esteem as a magistrate whom he had so publicly convicted of abusing and perverting the legal authority with which he had been entrusted and indeed a notorious breach of the law by any man in the capacity of a ruler may reasonably be esteemed a temporary disqualification for such an honorable trust for a judge without justice and righteousness who openly perverts judgment does thereby unquestionably degrade himself from the dignity of his station and render himself unworthy for the time being of that respect which is otherwise due to his rank in office the same apostle indeed upon another occasion commands us to give honor to whom honor is due but what honor can be due to a convicted hypocrite  a whited wall  a wolf in sheeps clothing  to an ananias on the seat of judgment such characters must expect such treatment as ananias met with from all sensible and discerning men if the latter are also equally loyal with the apostle i mean in the strict and proper sense of the word loyal which is so frequently misapplied and perverted by sycophants that is if they are equally zealous with that apostle for law justice and righteousness for the general good of mankind so that if we approve of the apostles advice in the beginning of the same sentence viz render therefore unto all their dues  tribute unto whom tribute  custom to whom custom  fear to whom fear  honor to whom honor we must needs also allow that the apostles practice even in his behavior to ananias was strictly consistent with his own declared precepts and that he most justly rendered to ananias his due when he so severely reprimanded his conduct as a judge when all these circumstances are duly considered the meaning of the apostles reply may fairly enough be paraphrased in the words of lorinus   nesciebam eum esse pontificem quia ex modo loquendi furioso non videtur esse pontifex sed tyrannus many of the most learned and celebrated commentators have considered the apostles censure nearly in the same light in the learned commentary commonly called assemblys annotations the same sense is applied to the apostles reply to the charge of having reviled gods high priest viz i knew him not to be a lawful high priest who thus violateth the law and indeed says the commentary  he was but an usurper  for proof of which they refer us to josephus ant l  0 c    chr helvic theat hist anno christi     the learned mathias flacius francowitz remarks that the famous augustine bishop of hippo thought this reply of the apostle ironical ironiam esse putat augustinus est sane quiddam vicinum ironiae cum enim videret cum sedere inter sacerdotes loco praecipuo et secundum legem judicare necessario scivit eum esse pontificem tametsi et aloqui etiam minimi pueri necessario id illic vel ex sola ejus pompa et asseclis vulgoque jactatis vocibus sciverunt nedum paulus homo tam vigilans et diligens sensus ergo est ego non agnosco in hoc homine pontificem dei  sed hypocritam seduilorem et veritatis persecutorem alioqui been scio principi maledicendum non esse and truly says he it borders upon irony for when he saw him ananias sit in the chief place among the priests to judge according to the law he necessarily knew him to be the high priest for even the little children knew that by his mere pomp and attendants and much less could a man so watchful and diligent as paul be ignorant of it the sense therefore is says the learned francowitz i do not acknowledge in this man the high priest of god but a hypocrite a deceiver and a persecutor of the truth otherwise i well know that a ruler is not to be spoken against or reviled to the same effect also the learned monsieur martin  as st paul says he comme st paul nignoreit pas et ne pouvoit pas meme ignorer que ce ne fut le souverain sacrificateur puis quil le voyoit a la tete du sanhedrin il vaut mieux traduire le term de loriginal par je ne pensois pas comme marc ix   et prendre ainsi cette repartie de st paul comme une grave et forte ironie par laquelle il vouloit fair sentir a ceux qui lavoient repris de manquer de respect pour le souverain sacrificateur que cetoit un homme indigne de ce caractere et quil ne croyoit pas quun vicieux et un impie comme etoit anani qui avoit usurp le pontifient en lachetant des romans meritat detre regard comme le souverain sacrificateur de dieu  was not ignorant nor could be ignorant that this was the high priest especially as he saw him at the head of the sanhedrim it is better to translate the term of the original by i did not think etc as in mark ix   and so to understand this reply of st paul as a grave and strong irony by which he would make those understand by whom he was accused of the want of respect for the high priest that this person was a man unworthy of that character and that he did not believe that a vicious and wicked man such as ananias who had usurped the pontificate by purchasing it of the romans could deserve to be esteemed as the high priest of god  it would be tedious to quote all the authorities that may be found to this purpose the evidence however of the learned dr whitby as it includes more authorities than his own is worthy the readers notice  dr lightfoot and grotius says he think as i do that st paul does not go about to excuse his mistake but rather says i know well enough that gods high priest is not to be reviled but that this ananias is a high priest i know not i e i do not own him as such who has procured this title by bribery our celebrated rabbis having declared that such an one is neither a judge nor to be honored as such etc   as i find him quoted by cornelius a lapide viz i knew not that he was the high priest because from his furious manner of speaking he did not seem to be a high priest but a tyrant this sense is strictly consonant to reason and natural right  justice and righteousness are so inseparably connected with the proper character of a chief magistrate or ruler that any notorious perversion of those necessary principles in the actual exercise of that official power with which a magistrate is entrusted for legal and not for illegal purposes must unavoidably distinguish the contemptible hypocrite the whited wall from the honorable magistrate and deprive the former of the respect which is due only to the latter sit thou to judge me according to the law and command me to be smitten contrary to law thus the apostle clearly explained the fitness and propriety of the reproachful figure of speech whited wall by which he had expressed the true character of the unworthy judge  an appellation similar to this was given even by our lord himself to the scribes and pharisees who were the teachers and magistrates of the people woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness matthew xxiii     and in the context he calls them blind guides v     hypocrites v     full of hypocrisy and iniquity v     partakers in the blood of the prophets v  0  serpents  generation of vipers  how can ye escape the damnation of hell etc v    nay herod himself the tetrarch of galilee was not exempted from the severity of our lords censure when there was a proper occasion to declare it for though our lord lived for the most part under herods temporal jurisdiction that is in galilee yet he openly characterised the crafty base and selfinterested disposition of the tetrarch by expressly calling him a fox   0 the message our lord here sends to herod says a sensible and learned commentator the rev mr francis fox in his edition of the new testament with references set under the text in words at length is no breach of that command which forbids the speaking evil of the ruler of the people and consequently is no blemish says he in our lords example for our lord here acts as a prophet as one who had received an extraordinary commission from god and those who were truly prophets were in the execution of their commission above the greatest men and most powerful princes whom they were not to spare when god sent them to reprove for sin all this is certainly true with respect to the real authority of christ to censure herod and that his applying so harsh and severe an expression to the tetrarch is no blemish in our lords example but yet this is not i apprehend the proper method of reconciling the seeming difficulty which arises from this example of our lords applying a severe and reproachful epithet to a chief ruler in calling herod a fox when it is compared with that precept of the law which forbids the speaking evil of the ruler of the people for though our lord had ample superiority and authority to reprove whomsoever he pleased even the greatest ruler upon earth yet with respect to his own personal behavior as a man among men he claimed no authority to dispense with the positive precepts of the mosaic law on account of his own real dignity or superiority over the rest of mankind but strictly obeyed the law in all things and publicly declared his strict conformity thereto think not said he that i come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill matthew v      by the law and the prophets says the same ingenious commentator above cited are meant the great rules of life delivered in the writings of moses and the prophets or in the old testament more especially the duties of the moral or natural law from whence those respecting our behavior to rulers cannot with propriety be excluded these our lord assures us he did not come to destroy or dissolve it was not his design to free men from the obligation they were under to practice the moral laws of god but to fulfill and perfect them this our lord did by living up to those laws himself which totally excludes the idea of his dispensing on account of his own real superiority with that moral law respecting behavior to rulers and becoming thereby an example to us by freeing them from the corrupt glosses which the teachers among the jews put upon them and by expounding them in their fullest sense and according to their just latitude showing that they command not only an outward obedience but the obedience even of the mind and thoughts as appears in what our lord delivers in the following verses  these laws have their foundation in the reason and nature of things and therefore their obligation will never cease   go ye and tell that fox etc luke xiii    and though our lord endured the most provoking indignities from the licentious soldiery and reviling multitude in silence answering not a word agreeable to that striking character of a suffering messiah so minutely described many ages before by the prophet isaiah    he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken isaiah liii     yet he made an apparent distinction between the violence and injustice of these as individuals and the injustice of a man in a public character as a chief magistrate for even in our lords state of extreme humiliation when his hour of sufferings was come he did not fail to rebuke the injustice of the high priest in his judicial capacity because instead of proceeding against him by the legal method of examination by witnesses he had attempted to draw out matter of accusation from his own mouth against himself by interrogatories according to the baneful method of arbitrary courts  but our lord soon put a stop to his impertinent questions by referring him to the legal method of finding evidence by witnesses  why ask thou me ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said john xviii    upon which a timeserving officer who probably had not accustomed himself to distinguish the different degrees of respect that are due to good and bad magistrates gave jesus a blow or rap with a rod  saying answerest thou the high priest so v    which open injustice to a person uncondemned even while he stood in the presence of the magistrate who ought to have protected him drew a farther remonstrance even from the meekest and humblest man that ever was on earth though the same divine person afterward suffered much greater indignities in silence for jesus answered him  if i have spoken evil said he bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me v     this shows that the reprehension of magistrates and their officers for injustice and abuse of power is not inconsistent with the strictest rules of christian passive obedience and though the apostle paul in a similar case used much harsher language yet his censure was undoubtedly just and true and the severity of his expressions was plainly justified as i have already shown by the event i e by the fatal catastrophe of ananias the law therefore which forbids the speaking evil of the ruler of the people is certainly to be understood with proper exceptions so as not to exclude any just censure of rulers when their abuse of office and the cause of truth and justice may render such censure expedient and seasonable that the apostle paul thus understood the text in question is manifest from his manner of quoting it when he was charged with reviling gods high priest if the severity of his censure be compared with the indifference which he showed immediately afterward toward the offended sadducee by openly professing himself to be of an opposite party and by throwing an oblique charge against the whole body of sadducees as the principal authors of the unjust persecution against himself  i am a pharisee said he the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead am i called in question acts xxiii   thus he manifestly threw the whole blame upon the sadducees and thereby showed no inclination to apologize for the severity of his speech to their dignified chief  i must farther remark that the apostles behavior in openly opposing the high priest who as such was also a chief magistrate and judge is by no means inconsistent with that excellent advice which the same apostle has laid down in the thirteenth chapter of his epistle to the romans though it is frequently cited by the advocates for arbitrary power in order to justify their false notions concerning the necessity of absolute submission and entire passive obedience  to an inattentive reader indeed the apostles expression may seem too much to favor such doctrines if the sense and connection of the whole context are not carefully weighed together but though he said  let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation yet he immediately afterward signifies what kind of rulers he spoke of that were not to be resisted  for rulers says he in the very next verse are not a terror to good works but to the evil will thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shall have praise of the same for he is the minister of god to thee for good but ananias as a ruler was certainly the very reverse of this description so that the practice of the apostle with respect to him was by no means opposite to this doctrine but says he if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he bears not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are gods ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor    see pages       and    concerning the kind of magistrates to whom honor is or is not due to whom honor romans xiii   to   now be pleased to remark that the apostle has expressly and repeatedly assigned the reason why so much respect and obedience is due to the higher powers or to the ruler or magistrate for he is says the apostle the minister of god to thee for good etc and again  for he is the minister of god a revenger to wrath upon him that does evil and again  for they are gods ministers  that is they are gods ministers while they maintain justice and righteousness in the execution of their public charge howsoever deficient their characters may be in other respects as private individuals but on the other hand such an unjust ruler as ananias for instance who sat to judge according to law and yet commanded a person to be beaten contrary to law such a ruler i say cannot be esteemed a minister of god to us for good or a minister of god in any respect whatsoever a man who is notoriously guilty of perverting the laws and of abusing the delegated power with which he is entrusted by acts of violence and injustice is so far from being the minister of god that he is manifestly the minister of the devil which is the express doctrine of the common law of this kingdom according to the most approved and most ancient authorities wherein we find it applied not merely to inferior rulers but to the supreme preme magistrate even to the king himself    the celebrated and learned henry de bracton says  that a king can do nothing else upon earth as he is the minister and vicar of god but that only which by law he may do etc and a little farther he adds  his power therefore says he is of right or law and not of wrong or injury etc  that a king ought therefore to exercise the power of right or law as the vicar and minister of god on earth because that power is of god alone but the power of wrong or injury is of the devil and not of god and the work of which so ever of these the king shall do of him he is the minister this is perfectly agreeable to the doctrine of holy scripture  whosoever commits sin said our lord himself is the servant or minister of sin john viii    here is no exception or exclusive privilege allowed on account of temporal dignity or offices of worldly power all men that wilfully do evil be they high or low are not only servants of sin but also sons as well as servants of the devil as our lord himself declared  ye do the deeds of your father etc ibid ver    and when those men to whom he addressed himself still contended notwithstanding their wicked deeds that they were the sons and servants of god christ replied why do ye not understand my speech etc  ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie be speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it ibid ver    and    and in like manner the devil is cortainly the father or promoter of every other immorality among men as much as he is of murder lying and deceit howsoever dignified the visible agents therein may be by the investiture of temporal honors titles and power or royal commissions  know ye not said the apostle paul that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants or ministers ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness romans vi   whose work he shall do while therefore he does justice he is the vicar or minister of the eternal king but he is the minister of the devil while he turns aside to injustice for he is called king rex from wedl ruling and not from reigning because he is king while he rules well but a tyrant while he oppresses the people committed to his charge with violent or oppressive government nihil enim aliud potest rex in terris cum sit dei minister et vicarius nisi id solum quod de jure potest etc potestas itaque sua juris est et non injuriae etc exercere igitur debet rex potestatem juris sicut dei vicarius et minister in terra quia illa potestas solius dei est potestas autem injuriae diaboli non dei et cujus horum opera fecerit rex ejus minister erit cujus opera fecerit igitur dum facit justitiam vicarius est regis aeterni minister autem diaboli dum declinet ad injuriam dicitur enim rex a been regendo et non a regnando quia rex est dum been regit tyrannus dum populum sibi creditum violenta opprimit dominatione henrici de bracton de legibus et consuetudinibus angliae lib iii c ix and nearly the same doctrine in substance is laid down in fleta lib i c    if he rules contrary to law by violating corrupting or perverting in any respect the powers of government and that excellent constitutional lawyer lord summers informs us that st edwards law even goes farther    the judgment of whole kingdoms and nations concerning the rights power and prerogative of kings and the rights privileges and properties of the people etc see the   st paragraph viz that unless the king performs his duty and answers the end for which he was constituted not so much as the name of a king shall remain in him now when these constitutional principles of the english law are collated and duly compared with the precepts before cited from the apostle paul they are so far from being contradictory that the full and clear meaning of them all may be maintained together without the least inconsistency or discrepance of doctrine for we may surely say with the apostle render to all their dues etc without seeming to favor the pernicious and dangerous doctrine of an unlimited passive obedience render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor  for though custom tribute fear and honor are certainly due to him who is the minister of god to us for good yet surely no honor is due or ought to be rendered to the minister of the devil to the perjured violater of a public trust who in the eye of the english law is not even worthy of so much as the name of a king  fear indeed may too often be said to be due to such men when in power but it is a very different sort of fear from that reverential fear which is due to him who is the minister of god to us for good it is such a fear only as that which men have of a wild beast that devours the flock he is fierce and strong say they and therefore each individual through fear of personal inconvenience to himself is induced to wink at the ruinous depredations made upon his neighbors and brethren so that for want of a prudent and timely opposition the voracious animal which in a state is a manyheaded monster becomes stronger and more dangerous to the community at large till the unwary timeservers themselves perceive when it is too late that by their own selfish connivance respectively as individuals they have been accessaries to the general ruin and as such must one day be answerable to god for their shameful breach of that law of liberty    see my tract on the law of liberty  thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself in which we are assured all the law is fulfilled    for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself galatians v    and by which we are also assured we shall be judged    so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty james ii      this heavenly principle is the true and proper ground for patriotism and undoubtedly has always been the predominant motive of great and good men such as the disinterested and loyal apostle paul following his lords example in their opposition to the injustice of rulers and magistrates though they passively submit to personal injuries from other hands for in this as i have already remarked consists the due distinction between the necessary christian submission to personal injuries and the doctrine of an unlimited passive obedience  the subjection and obedience to magistrates enjoined by the same apostle in his epistle to titus c iii   must certainly be understood with the same necessary limitations  put them in mind says the apostle to be subject to principalities and powers toobey magistrates  says he but then he immediately subjoins to be ready to every good work  and no man can be esteemed ready to every good work if he is obedient to magistrates when their commands exceed the due limits of the law or if contrary to the example of the apostle himself he neglects a fair opportunity of publicly discountenancing and censuring any notorious perversion of justice and right by a magistrate  the same necessary limitation of the doctrine of obedience must also be understood when we read the exhortation of another apostle on this head viz submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of god that with welldoing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of god   peter ii      governors are here declared to be sent for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of them that do well to such therefore as answer this description the submission and honor enjoined in the context are undoubtedly due but whenever the governors themselves become the evil doers and like ananias instead of praising and encouraging them that do well do notoriously abuse oppress and murder them as he did    the apostle paul was so far from retracting any part of his severe censure and remonstrance against ananias that he afterward before felix defied ananias and the rest of his accusers to show that he had been guilty of any the least misdemeanour ever since his last arrival at jerusalem and more particularly while he stood before the council meaning the time when he foretold that god should smite that whited wall ananias or else said he to felix let these same here say meaning the high priest ananias the elders and their orator tertullus mentioned in the first verse of the chapter if they have found any evil doing the word in the original is  signifying rather injustice or unrighteousness than evildoing and as the former may be essected by words as well as by deeds this public challenge from the mouth of the apostle includes a complete justification of all that he either said or did on that day before the council in me while i stood before the council except it be for this one voice now he once more provokes the malicious sadducee that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day acts xxiv  0 this is a manifest declaration that there was nothing reprehensible either in his behavior or words on that day before the council because his declaration concerning the resurrection of the dead was the only one voice or expression which he supposed these sadducees could call in question and lay to his charge it would be a manifest perversion of the text to suppose that we are required thereby to submit ourselves to every ordinance of man    the apostles and disciples of christ were so far from submitting themselves to every ordinance of man that they boldly rejected the unjust commands even of the high priest and the whole national council of the jewish state the great council called sanhedrim i e  the commands of which they rejected included at that time all persons of their nation that bore any public authority or dignity among them for the text expressly informs us that their rulers and elders and scribes and annas the high priest and the high priests since the time of the maccabees were generally considered as a sort of princes and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem  no power therefore amongst the jews could be more respectable in regard to temporal authority than this great national council and the apostle peter accordingly acknowledged their legal authority at first by respectfully addressing them saying  ye rulers of the people and elders of israel etc  yet notwithstanding the temporal authority of this awful assembly of rulers and elders or senators they were publicly disregarded and contradicted by the apostles even in their presence upon the very first proposal of an unreasonable and unlawful ordinance for they called them the apostles and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus  but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye for we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard acts iv    and  0 and afterward when they were brought a second time before the said great council to answer for their breach of this ordinance of man the high priest asked them saying did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us then peter and the other apostle answered and said  we ought to obey god rather than men etc this sentence in effect holds good with respect also to the rejection of every public ordinance that is contrary to reason justice or natural equity as well as those that are contrary to the written word of god this i have shown more at large in my declaration of the peoples right   without admitting such just and necessary exceptions to the doctrine as i have already cited from the example of the apostle paul and even from that of our lord himself  and therefore though the apostle peter adds  honor all men love the brotherhood fear god honor the king yet he must necessarily be understood to mean with the apostle paul that we must render honor to whom honor is due and not to honor such men and such kings as are unworthy of honor  0 to the example of the patriotic apostle paul upon this point i must now add that of another chosen vessel of christ the protomartyr stephen this excellent man full of the holy ghost and wisdom acts vi   full of faith and power v   and whose wisdom and spirit none were able to resist v  0  this excellent man i say has left us by his own example an unquestionable precedent on record to demonstrate that honor is not due to the highest temporal authority on earth not even to a great national council of rulers and elders while they exercise their authority in unjust prosecutions and abuse their power by enacting unreasonable and tyrannical ordinances the great council of the jewish state had straightly commanded the aposties and disciples of christ as i have already remarked in a preceding note not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus which command it seems was given lest their preaching should bring this mans blood said the high priest meaning the blood of our lord jesus upon us but stephen paid so little regard either to the unlawful command itself or to the reason of it that he afterward publicly upbraided the whole council with the high priest at the head of it in the most stimulating and unreserved terms as the betrayers and murderers of that just one  ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears said he to their faces in the public assembly ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers etc acts vii    and    words could not well be sharper than these which is manifest from their effect for the text testifies that when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth v    thus it clearly appears that the holy innocent and meek stephen did not think himself bound like our undistinguishing passiveobedience men to submit to every ordinance of man etc nor to honor all men without making reasonable and due exceptions nay so far from honoring men merely on account of their temporal dignity it is manifest that he treated the whole body of rulers with the utmost severity and contempt while he thought them unworthy of honor and yet there is no doubt but that he most conscientiously on every occasion rendered honor to whom honor was due   but what men it will be said are to be esteemed the proper judges of desert in such cases so as to determine with propriety when honor is or is not to be rendered to which i answer  every man is a judge of it if he be not an idiot or mad man every man of common sense can distinguish justice from injustice right from wrong honorable from dishonorable    see my tract on the law of nature and the principles of action in man wherein i hope this point is fully demonstrated whenever he happens to be an eye or ear witness of the proper circumstances of evidence for such a judgment every man except as above be he ever so poor and mean with respect to his rank in this life inherits the knowledge of good and evil or reason from the common parents of mankind and is thereby rendered answerable to god for all his actions and answerable to man for many of them  in this hereditary knowledge and in the proper use of it according to the different stations of life in which men subsist in this world consists the equality of all mankind in the sight of god and also in the eye of the law i mean the common law and rules of natural justice which are formed upon the selfevident conclusions of human reason and are the necessary result of the abovementioned hereditary knowledge in man every man knows by what we call conscience which is only an effect of human reason upon the mind whether his own actions deserve the censure of the magistrate who bears not the sword in vain and the same principle of hereditary knowledge enables him to judge also concerning the outward actions of other men whether they be just or unjust whether they be praiseworthy or censurable  but if a man abuses his own natural reason and suffers himself to be blinded by private interest by passion or unreasonable resentment or by pride envy or personal partiality and is thereby led to misconstrue the actions of his superiors to behave unseemly toward them and to censure them publicly without a just cause the conscience of such an offender against reason will speedily inform him that he has cause to fear the magistrate and that he is liable to suffer for his misbehaviour as an evil doer but when the like faults are discoverable on the other side that is on the side of the superior or magistrate as it happened in the case of ananias a just censure of the unjust magistrate even though it comes from the poorest and meanest man that happens to be present will have its due weight in the opinion of all unprejudiced and disinterested persons and may occasion a considerable check to the progress of injustice and therefore if any man neglects such an opportunity when he has it in his power of making a personal protest as paul did against the public injustice of a wicked magistrate he strengthens the hand of iniquity by his timidity and remissness and becomes accessory to the public disgrace by refusing his endeavors according to his abilities howsoever small to vindicate the laws of god and maintain the common rights of his neighbors and brethren such an one unhappily demonstrates that he has more fear of man than of god and much more love for himself than he has for his neighbor and country and consequently in that awful day when he shall be judged by the law of liberty    james ii    see also my tract on the law of liberty must be liable unless a timely repentance should have previously restored him to a better use of that hereditary knowledge for which all men are accountable must be liable i say to be cast with the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth matthew xxv  0  all men therefore be they ever so rich or ever so poor and mean are required to vindicate the cause of truth justice and righteousness whenever they have a favorable opportunity of doing so they are required i say because they are enabled by their natural knowledge of good and evil to discern and judge concerning the fitness or unfitness of human actions and of the justice or injustice of all measures and proceedings that happen to fall within the reach of their inspection and consequent observation he who denies this is ignorant of the true dignity of human nature and wants a teacher to point out to him not only the equality of mankind before god but also the universal conditions of mans subsistence in the world  the hereditary knowledge of good and evil may at least be esteemed as the one talent for which all mankind are accountable to the universal lord and therefore if they wilfully abuse or bury this talent they have surely nothing to expect but the condemnation abovementioned of the unprofitable servant  shall we blame the patriotic apostle then for his zeal in vindicating the natural rights of mankind against an unjust judge when he had so fair an opportunity of protesting against his iniquity god forbid let us on the contrary revere his example which in reality affords no opposition to the doctrine laid down in the beginning of this tract concerning the necessity of christian submission to personal injuries if he sometimes freely and courageously expressed his resentment for personal ill usage    in pursuing the examination of this subject concerning resentment for personal ill usage i was gradually led to consider the present unnatural though prevailing practice of duelling and this occasioned my remarks on the opinions of some of the most eminent writers on crown law respecting the due distinction between manslaughter and murder printed in      which remarks were at first intended as a continuation of this tract but finding soon afterward that some publication to correct the common mistaken doctrines concerning manslaughter and duelling was become more immediately necessary i thought it advisable to detach what i had written on that subject from this tract and to print it as soon as possible with some sew alterations and additions rather than to wait for the publication of these other tracts it was always ways in vindication of the law on which next to the providence of god the safety liberty and happiness of the community depend whereas the hasty revenger of his own cause is so far from being a friend to the community or a lover of liberty that he himself is actually a tyrant because he neglects the necessary doctrine of christian submission to personal injuries and on every occasion is ready to revenge his own cause with his own hand and to usurp all the distinct offices of judge jury and executioner he is so far from vindicating the law like the generous and patriotic apostle for the sake of national liberty that he manifestly sets himself up above the law which is the first characteristic of a tyrant and thereby renders himself in fact an open enemy to liberty and consequently a disgrace

the year      by the then attorney general and solicitor general concerning the case of slaves in great britain      this tract contains many examples of the monstrous iniquity and injustice of the plantation laws respecting slaves as also some account of the gradual abolition of the ancient english slavery called villenage which was at length happily effected by the wisdom and perseverance of the english courts of common law iv remarks concerning the encroachments on the river thames near durhamyard      v an appendix to the representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerating slavery see number iii      vi remarks on the opinions of some of the most celebrated writers on crown law respecting the due distinction between manslaughter and murder showing that the indulgence allowed by the courts to voluntary manslaughter in rencounters duels etc is indiscriminate and without foundation in law and is also one of the principal causes of the continuance and present increase of the base and disgraceful practice of duelling      the peculiar case of gentlemen in the army respecting the practice of duelling is carefully examined in this tract as also the depravity and folly of modern men of honor falsely so called vii in two parts   a declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature which is the fundamental principle of the british constitution of state   a declaration or defense of the the same doctrine when applied particularly to the people of ireland       d edition      in these two pieces many examples and proofs are produced concerning the parliamentary rights of the people viz that the assent of the people is absolutely necessary to render laws valid that a free and equal representation of the inhabitants of this kingdom is necessary for the salvation of the state and the security of peace and of property that the representatives of the people have no legal right to give assent in any new device without conference with their countries that it is an ancient and just right of the people to elect a new parliament every year once and more often if need be and that no regulations whatsoever wherein the representatives are made judges of their two elections can be effectual against national corruption examples are likewise here given of several surreptitious statutes that are void through the want of due legal assent and of others that are void by being unjust and repugnant to constitutional principles the danger of keeping standing armies is also demonstrated and the wickedness and impolicy of acting by national corruption etc etc the following tracts by the same author are printed for b white in fleet street and e and c dilly in the poultry viii the just limitation of slavery in the laws

for the gradual enfranchisement of slaves in america reports of determinations in the several courts of law against slavery etc      ix the law of passive obedience or christian submission to personal injuries wherein is shown that the several texts of scripture which command the entire submission of servants or slaves to their masters cannot authorize the latter to exact an involuntary servitude nor in the least degree justify the claims of modern slaveholders and also that the several texts which enjoin submission to rulers magistrates etc do not in any respect authorize the dangerous doctrine of an unlimited passive obedience x the law of liberty or as it is called in scripture by way of eminence the royal law by which all mankind will certainly be judged xi the law of retribution or a serious warning to great britain and her colonies founded on unquestionable examples of gods temporal vengeance against tyrants slaveholders and oppressors      the examples are selected from predictions in the old testament of national judgments which being compared with the actual accomplishment demonstrate the sure word of prophecy as well as the immediate interposition of divine providence to recompense impenitent nations according to their works tracts by the same author now in the press for publication xii a tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man xiii the case of saul being an appendage to the former tract wherein the compound nature and various principles of action in man with the reality of supernatural spiritual influence both good and bad are proved by unquestionable examples from the history of that unfortunate monarch and also from many other parts of scripture
