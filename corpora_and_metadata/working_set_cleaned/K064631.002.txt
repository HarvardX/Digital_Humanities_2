accomplishments a female polemic of the last century in the house of miss million the character of emily had opportunities of unfolding itself not hitherto presented rarely had she quitted the side of a blind parent to enter into a contracted circle and if this circumstance had been detrimental to her sagacity in human nature it proved not unfavourable to the high culture of her elegant accomplishments in the enthusiasm of solitude fine talents are pursued with an intensity not experienced by those whose active circle diversified by the festivities of dissipation or the bustle of business can only enable them to become lovers of art and not artists solitude which so frequently excites the querulousness of genius is a severe mother who forms a lovely progeny what in the great world had only been a momentary amusement there becomes a permanent occupation sweet is the uninterrupted industry of genius magical it is contracted day and delicious that inebriation of taste which becomes an absorbing passion in solitude alone can now be acquired that difficult facility which though it performs its miracles of art instantaneously has been the slow and painful acquisition of great practice and greater meditation emily rose with the fun her prayer was a silent orison of aweful pleasure her crayon was in her hand during her morning walks and if she brought home some romantic figure some tenderer tint from the aspect of nature it was a new enjoyment the clock told the hour of midnight when with regret she relinquished her volume and dissolved the enchantment of her fancy often as she sat by her father her busy spirits were so diffused in her little employments that balsour could only hear her gentlest suspirations and would say afterward i could almost see you emily very busy  emily when she now compared her talents with those of the favorites of fashion including some professional artists felt a new confidence in her powers but she was silent as well as modest for she found that she was inferior to all if that inferiority is to be allowed because she was inexpert in the dull and formal routine of life a person of true genius is soon placed beneath the level of equality among the frivolous because talents give no real superiority among such associates they are applauded rapidly from an old custom but having been applauded without feeling are as rapidly forgotten the permanent interests of such a society consist in every thing that is the reverse of genius so that a certain mark of mediocrity of talent is the pleasure which such a circle affords to emily their conversation was a language of which the rudiments were unknown their amusements passed away too numerous and too rapid to leave any delight and their most important concerns seemed the burlesque of human life while what occasioned the most voluble lamentations excited her interior smile her beauty was likely to occasion some trouble from the men but her extreme docility and unpresuming manners rendered her at first supportable to the women she conciliated their favor by her willingness to be considered as an inoffensive cipher which of itself was of no value unless placed by those who made a figure in the present circle  it is but performing an act of justice to miss million to declare that she was infinitely delighted by the varied powers of her new companion she told all the world so and evinced as much pleasure in exhibiting the performances of emily as if they had been her own emily could not but feel a warm gratitude for such incessant partiality but it often cost her the pang of a deep blush and the disgust of an amplification of which herself was at once the divinity worshipped and the victim immolated there was such a roughness in the gentleness of miss million of her incense she was prodigal but in her zeal she ever threw censer and incense together in the face of her divinity in vain emily entreated the favor of being placed in the shade miss million felt too much not to exhale her admiration in panegyrics this amiable lady it must be acknowledged lost nothing by this excess of kindness the higher the praise she bestowed on emily the stronger it is dazzling reflection fell on her own cherished person was it not evident that the more she talked of the old blind lieutenants daughter her benevolence was amply displayed the more she was enraptured by the brilliant finger of emily on her harp it was clear the nerves of her intendered soul caught the melodious vibrations and no one could say when she overflowed in raptures concerning light and shade as she pointed to her paintings but that miss million must have a very sensible taste for the magic of her canvas emily however received the approbation and esteem of lady belfield whose favor she felt an ambition to enjoy for lady belfield was herself a woman of talents and might have been a woman of genius and therefore knew the real value of her varied and felicitous accomplishments  miss millions circle was by no means confined she was proud of the acquaintance of every person of fashion and besides her passion for masquerades and botany she was a distinguished patroness of literary merit her name was enrolled among the earliest subscriptions she had received the honor of a dedication of a novel which was decorated not only by her name but by the splendor of her engraved arms and besides these literary distinctions it was rumoured that she herself had written one sonnet yet preserved in the virgin modesty of a manuscript she was indeed declared to be a prodigy of genius by several of her friends but particularly by three or four great critics one of whom it was universally whispered wrote in one review if not in all of them and who did her the honor of dining with her regularly three days in the week  an important person in the house of million was mrs bully the housekeeper she was a colossus of vulgarity a demon of religion and a dragon of virtue on one occasion her stars had doomed her to make a slight slip but religion had now so completely varnished over this ancient piece of english china that it was a secret flaw rather than a visible crack nature had been kind to her fellow creatures in exhibiting her character in her appearance but its glaring grossness was frequently subdued by her ingenuity philosophy exults in teaching men to conceal or ameliorate their defects and shrewd vulgarity is not inferior to philosophy the tones of a voice gross as the furred porch from which they issued she could render not displeasing to some by adulation arms that might have wielded the spear of goliath were rendered not repulsive by officiousness and the heavy circumference of her body could on occasion roll with celerity to the service of her patrons she was indeed a mansion house of mortality and to look on her was to admire the solidity of those materials which nature can form when she simply works with mere flesh and blood nature indeed had committed no error in the formation of mrs bully every part was uniformly gross but natures blunder consisted in the whole a being so nervous and athletic should never have been a woman  nor was her mind of an inferior size to her body since her slippery adventure above hinted she had held a most pious abstinence from human flesh her constitutional ideas however occasionally flamed in her expressions but were smothered in her actions of the latter she was fastidiously nice so as to be enabled to discover in those of other people a hundred little peccancies against chastity which escaped their consciousness for it is observable that persons who are themselves not of the cleanest part of the human species are wonderfully alert in discerning the slightest atoms of dirt on a very clean person her mind was as active as it was robust and her strong passions not having any more an opportunity of venting themselves in the mollifications of love made most terrible explosions in obsolete theology and politics she read few books published within this century the period of her researches was those days of fanatical controversy which so long disgraced unenlightened england when neither stationary in her religion or her politics every feverish reformer promulgated a system of his own the national genius therefore had no system at all and branched out into reciprocal persecutions what then was occasioned by the energy of religion and politics may perhaps be renewed in this age on an inverse ratio because we have no religion and no politics  mrs bully had therefore highchurch arbitrary notions and jacobite jure divino principles some of her favorite authors were prynne and sir roger lestrange filmer on the divine right of kings gave her political creed she studied the orthodoxy of that holy buffoon south and was recreated by the merry jests of timothy and philalethes the wickedness of the age she derived from socinianism it is spirit of sedition from the usurpation of the calvinistic william and every loss of the english and their allies she attributed to a judgment of heaven for that cool and tolerant spirit of religion which much to her sorrow she now saw prevailing in the kitchen as well as in the drawing room  when emily made her appearance in this family she gave rise to numerous speculations among the domestics as they could not possibly conceive how miss million could want a companion who lived in one continued series of company some supposed that the life of emily was as precious to mr million as that of his overgorged bob mrs betty the confidential maid of miss million being the mere lookingglass of her mistress reflected her panegyrics but mrs bully their president in high council observing that emily went rarely to church posed mrs betty and alarmed some in the council by enquiring which was her religion this question perhaps is one of the most difficult enquiries that can be made in the present day mrs bully had formed dreadful suspicions of emilys orthodoxy because of her irregular church attendance and yet to dislike a church does not indicate any irreverence for religion for since the church is personated by the parson we conceive it is no impiety to forsake any house of god when we find that the fashionable clerical seems more inclined to pay his respects to his parishioners than his reverence to his god  she one day bounced into her apartment and seating herself began her inquisitorial examination she opened by an high eulogium of reading which she compared to cookery i love said she the old firloin and plain round of beef where it is cut and come again none of your flimflams and french dishes your modern books are like enough proper for their authors wits being very small and thin i like your books big as bibles ay and the bible is the best book novels are the reading of your fine ladies but if we like lovestories there is a mort of um in the bible  i think mrs bully replied emily most of them had better have been omitted  the lord preserve your soul not a tittle must be done away every word there is gods word read st austins city of god and the church has decided let me tell you miss that the church of england is without spot or wrinkle mark that and cursed are all dissenters  i am no dissenter mrs bully but these are matters for different heads than mine  what is your eternal salvation to be obtained by others as the cursed papists say mayharp miss you dont believe in the athanasian creed  i do not understand it  that is an old vile excuse for not believing now a syllable can be done away doesnt it tell you that you must be damned if you dont believe in it take my word for it that saint athanasius knew more about his own creed than that fiend arius and what think you of constantine the great   some say he was a felon  i tell you miss he was a saint dont you know miss the distinctions and the differences between trinunities coessentialities modalities eternal generations eternal processions incarnations and hypostatical unions   what is all this mrs bully are such terms points of faith they seem fitter for a conjurer than a christian  oh that i had lived in those blissful days of controversy where the concerns of a whole city consisted in disputes about the consubstantiality when in quitting the shop of a trader one not only got by ones divinity a great bargain but also the man to change his religion when the dear boys in the street would fight one another for arius and athanasius to be sure arius had the best of it while he lived and constantine wrote to them that they were both fools for disputing about what no one could understand but didnt arius die like the empress of russia foul heretics should die in foul places dark holes for poisoned rats and pray miss what do you think of tim and phil  i am not acquainted with the names of all the servants in the house  servants i am so used to them that i always call them by these familiar names i mean the dialogues of timothy and philalethes there your tom pains and all such sadducees are answered have you got miss all sir rogers works and a good number of the pamphlets of cromwells times i collect and read all  small type large paper and thick volume i love tugging at a book not skimming like a mealy butterfly  really mrs bully all your authors are not even known to me by name i have only two books i think printed by one of cromwells party and those are the paradises of milton  abominable i marvel miss how you can bear a page of such a blind guide as sir roger wittily called him his eyes showed a judgment of heaven no wonder he drew the devil so well for he was only describing his protector oliver he will protect him finely in the eternity of hell torments secretary now to lucifer and pray miss how do you like south for his joking sermons and the elegant stanhope on the epistles who observes that an unbeliever if he were in heaven would find no more pleasure there than a pig in a drawing room and scott and archbishop laud and bishop blackhall whose works are in three folios heavier than i can hold in my hands and which i bought the other day for threepence each a curse on this arian age all weighty books now are selling by weight  my favorite sermons are those of blair  abominable why they contain nothing but morality not a word on the contested points of faith the incarnation the consubstantiality grace and justification little asthmatic periods as if he wanted sense to carry him through a dozen words you have a great deal to learn miss on the score of religion and politics you think i dont read novels but i like much those in folio i am now reading the great cassandra and the noble oroondates that oroondates was a brave fellow he killed above fifty heroes almost as brave as himself and his speeches are ten honest pages in length none of your squeaking heroes who are afraid to speak out like men but i know the reason for their authors have nothing for them to say  i could never read said emily those voluminous romances their heroes and heroines are a distinct order of beings from ourselves and i have my suspicions whether they ever existed but in the prurient fancies of their authors their descriptions are never local one place is depicted like another their style is insufferably languid their incidents without being romantic violate the known customs of every age and their authors seem to have merely despoiled homer of his true heroes to transform them into the disgusting petitmaitres of paris a race that when they existed were only ridiculed and that now are quite obsolete such are their protracted conclusions that we cannot but quite forget what we had read should we ever arrive at the close of the twelfth volume  abominable i forget nothing since miss you dont like bulky books mayhap you have never read the bible through  many parts i have never finished i would neither corrupt my imagination with impurity nor steel my heart by barbarous narratives and sanguinary persecutions  then the lord preserve you from damnation samuel hewed agag alive and he did well he was an arian of his day and the philistines the canaanites the hittites and the jebusites  she rose from her chair gradually noble work in those days oh that i could send this arm like another samson among your arian dogs your socinian wolves and your roaring lions of priestleyites i tell you the church of england is without spot or wrinkle and james the iii not william the iii was our king why does the french rebellion prosper but because people dont go to church on sundays no wonder that the wind blew so boisterously last night that three trees have been blown down in the park and their majestys were obliged to rise from bed  we are all agoing the earth reels like a drunkard as nobly says isaiah manifold are our sins as moore says in his last years almanac we are an abomination before the lord oh that i could eschew this babylon i tell you miss the church of england is without spot or wrinkle  so saying she hurried out of the room and flinging the door hastened to communicate her intelligence to the kitchen horror for emilys arianism and contempt for her taste for novels in folio spread from her through all the lower part of the house  chapter xviii emily meets charles and vaurien the dissentions of two great critics showing the utility of christian names lady belfield contracted with emily a more passionate degree of friendship than a lady of her high rank in general is capable of experiencing but her ladyship is one of those not very rare instances we imagine where we observe an amiable and ingenious female studiously annihilating her virtues and her talents in the giddy and often criminal vortex of dissipation nature will sometimes prevail over fashion  one morning when these two ladies were conversing with miss million charles and vaurien were announced when they entered their eyes were at once directed on emily she recognized vaurien and deeply blushed her confusion was fortunately concealed while miss million introduced these gentlemen lady belfield said dear miss emily allow me to speak a word for one of these men for that great child is as silent as a turkish mute looking on charles and half a word for the other who i am sensible wants no aid of mine to engage the attentions of an accomplished girl vaurien made a very elegant compliment and charles a very silent bow neither of the two ladies suspected that they had ever met before and they themselves did not choose to notice their former rencounter at mrs wilsons for which no doubt each had some peculiar reason and which to discover may serve if the reader thinks proper to exercise his thinking powers as well as his eyes although the latter are generally considered as the only requisites for novel reading  vaurien was the soul of the conversation he flew from topic to topic and poured out to miss million all the little news that he had collected in the course of that mornings perambulation he hinted at a marriage narrated a duel discovered an intrigue and informed them that last night lady bab lost ten thousand pounds at one sitting and was obliged to retire for the unexpected delivery of a son and heir he was a volume of secret memoirs and every trifle was embellished by the graces of his manner to emily he directed a richer vein of conversation he listened to the copious catalogue of her talents as given by miss million and when one of her paintings was pointed out to his observation he gazed on it for some time commended it in a few energetic expressions and at the same time exhibited his accuracy of taste by some slight corrections and his picturesque fancy by describing how from that subject another might be formed more romantic to the imagination emily was more gratified by this discriminating criticism than the general applause of others and formed a high conception of that opulence of fancy which seemed always to enrich what it found lady belfield entreated her to touch her harp she played with her accustomed ease and while she was receiving the thanks of her fair friends vaurien swept his hand carelessly over the instrument and called forth the tenderest air solicited to proceed he said ah no i venture not above a prelude after harmonies like those which have now charmed all my skill is only an effusion of the heart and all my airs are only a few associations of the memory when i wandered in the viny vales of languedoc emily it must be confessed was delighted by the singular versatility of his powers lady belfield rallied vaurien upon this discovery of his harp music what a dangerous man are you vaurien when you can conceal even little accomplishments that they may be reserved to surprise and delight on the most impressive occasion it is to miss emily we owe your performance on the harp but you charles neither say nor do any thing  your ladyship knows replied charles that some are born to embellish life by all that it has of the agreeable while others must restrict themselves to admire and love that merit they dare not rival  emily liked charles for this liberal commendation of a person who was evidently his rival that is a merit she thought superior to the merit itself  vaurien had now come down to the very last morning anecdote and he knew that there was a certain point in conversation when an able and sagacious talker takes his departure it is that point at which what we have said leaves a lively impression on our friends a quarter of an hour more would weary or less would not satisfy it exacts no ordinary judgment to know when to quit a chair the exhausted frenchman was now rising when the two great critics mr acrid and mr antique were announced with indecent haste antique rushed in breathless i have cried he got near a whole page traced accurately on oiled paper i tell you mr acrid it is an original we have had a secret committee but no one can read it except ireland he is inspired he reads it just as if it were his own writing  and have you a page of shakspeare never read before said miss million  antique i heard dr parr say that he must express his conviction in periods more dignified than ireland could roll i saw boswell fall on his knees raise his hands and thank god  mere antiquaries are ever to be duped replied mr acrid with a dictatorial tone without taste to discern penetration to decide or that illuminating sagacity that combines it is unerring calculations with a brainless head and sightless eyes you pore on inscriptions sepulchral monuments and manuscripts that would never have been such had they merited literary honors you only read the dullness of other times and call this erudition the gross jests of our gross forefathers and you conceive you are men of wit you discover some clumsy utensil and you engrave it as a model for modern elegance the dullest writer of a dull age becomes to the mere antiquary the most precious of his own times and yet such bear no other resemblance to midas than by his exterior sign their touch cannot turn lead into gold you have already stifled poor shakspeare by your commentaries the text cannot breathe freely amidst your encumbrances here is a man who writes with an orthography of his own invention and in a style that has no invention at all and every fool of learning is summoned to admire a modern skeleton in an ancient leaden coffin but did not my friend george take the true dimensions of the intellects of the director of your worshipful society a curved corner of an old chimneypiece duly steeped in what shall be nameless till it became variegated with the dark rainbow hues of antiquity and tasted by his sagacious finger smelt of other times was engraved with some saxon characters and the name of hardycknute at length being properly vinegared and verdigreased it excited his antiquarian curiosity he doats on it to madness makes syllables of letters and words of syllables and enriches the archives of your society with a most learned dissertation on the drinkinghorn of hardyknute lay your irelands shakspeare on this curved corner of an old chimneypiece  the laugh went against mr antique who sat down much cooler than he came in muttering vengeance a circumstance occurred to these two great critics which may serve as an exemplary lesson to some greater ones to understand each other when their disputes run loud and swelling as a rusing torrent or quick and fiery as kindled straw mr antique was a virtuoso and a collector more famous for his library than his learning wealthy in medals profound in titlepages an ogler of statues and a great admirer of the works of nature when they appeared in the forms of butterflies pebbles and conchae veneris he therefore was tolerably read in authors who had written on curious subjects but mr acrid held such authors in sovereign contempt and vociferated his raptures for writers of taste in point of understanding or intellectual power he was much on an equality with his brother critic whom he so much contemned not but that his criticisms were extremely just which they could not fail to be as they were with little variation the sentiments of the noblest critics and yet we are informed that his entire library consisted of only two biographical dictionaries so that he traveled on the high roads of literature merely at the public expense and when it happened that he was stopped at a turnpikegate he only discovered his extreme poverty the following dialogue now ensued   antique you will find a very minute detail of that picture in richardson  acrid richardson detail a picture not he he was no petty virtuoso  antique mr richardson no virtuoso give me leave to affirm that he is at the head of our virtuosos he was both a curious collector and a very minute describer  acrid richardson a puny collector sir it is false very false that he was a minute describer i agree  antique i repeat he was a curious collector i retort your charge i know he prolonged his tour and remained above a year at rome it took him three months only to describe one of poussins pictures  acrid he never was out of england his imagination was a true british seacoal fire and borrowed not a spark from a foreign rival  antique not out of england i shall grow mad it is a calumny which only an insidious enemy could propagate his very minute descriptions testify his ocular examination his works give us the very attitudes  acrid so sir you think that a man must travel out of england to catch those correct resemblances which true taste admires truly your taste is singular but his works are immortal  antique immortal why no man of any taste would give them houseroom  acrid not richardsons works houseroom he lifted his hands higher than his head  o for shame mr antique said miss million no one can agree with you there  antique why they are all daubs mere garret furniture  acrid i lose my patience  i am nearly suffocated with rage do you mean mr antique to insult me by insulting richardson  antique mr acrid do you mean to reflect on my connoisseurship by supposing that i could approve of his wretched works where are they now to be found all gone and forgotten  here mr acrid rose in great passion looked with a distortion of countenance on mr antique a mixture of fierceness and contempt then smoothing his face into a sardonic smile that is with a gay countenance and an aching heart he turned to the ladies and appealed to them if richardsons works were not in every bodys hands and in every collection of taste  antique in every bodys hands and in every collection of taste was ever man so provoked and insulted as i am  acrid his fable is protracted but his lively and delicate strokes place every object before the eye  antique what do you mean by his fable but i confess his minuteness is admirable  acrid every character is so prominent it is as in the great original of nature  antique agreed as to the great original but nature is quite a superfluous term  acrid the artless sentiments of pamela the refined delicacy of clarissa the elevation of sir charles grandison  antique what connection have these novels with the works of richardson i could never read them no facts all imagination  acrid with this avowal you yet presume to appreciate the merits of richardson you aspire to dictate as an arbiter of taste  miss million dear mr antique is this possible never read richardson  antique have you all conspired together to make me crazy i shake with indignation do you suppose that i who attend every picture sale in town can read such enormous novels i have enough to do to read through all the sale catalogues of books and pictures and i have an entire collection with their prices marked for these twenty years past an invaluable library of catalogues if jonathan richardson the father not jonathan richardson the silly son the first of whom i have been talking of had seen them what volumes of criticism had come out  acrid  jonathan richardson why man we have been talking of samuel richardson i know nothing of your pair of jonathans  antique then positively my dear acrid we are all in a mistake i mean richardson the painter and you richardson the novelist you know the first has published some very curious dissertations on his art a great critic in painting but the worst of painters i praised his fine descriptions of pictures but could never agree that his own works had any merit how the deuce has all this happened as for the other richardson i know nothing about him a collector never values such writers  acrid with an air of triumph there ladies mr antique has confessed he has never read the great richardson the shakspeare of novelists and yet he will assert and assure you that he can decide on shakspeare in manuscript  antique that my dear friend entirely consists in the foxiness of the ink and the dingy fine yellow brown of the paper with the watermark of the jug all worthy of the divine man let us not part in anger critics should be more cautious in their controversies and christian names are full as useful as surnames  through the intercession of miss million peace was established between this couple of critics but a latent revenge rankled in the breast of antique for acrids contempt of him and irelands shakspeare and when miss million enquired the literary news of the day he took an opportunity to distill his gall on acrids discernment we shall therefore resume our dialogue  antique we have some important intelligence in the republic of letters you have not then heard concerning eliza  all that we understand said miss million is that the amatory effusions of eliza are only known for their delicacy their harmony and their poetic beauty so often admired by mr acrid the fair still is in the shade  acrid here made a very curtailed bow and quickly retired  antique ay ay let him go let him go to insult me with my defective taste for shakspeare now ladies judge what kind of discernment mr acrid is blessed with eliza ha ha ha  eliza exclaimed miss million is certainly a delightful poetess she has two great merits she not only writes finely but copiously and incessantly her last sweet pastoral of  00 lines is excellent but i wish she had divided it into five pastorals but these lines are fanciful beyond poetical fancy they are quite fashionable poetry observe the brilliant concetto of the close the muslind moon mid stars of tissue hung the gauzy airs a silky softness flung bright rose the masquerade of fancys dream a concert seemed the solo of the stream   antique you dont know the news i see you will agree with me that they must be execrable why they are dick distichs  miss million o shocking what is eliza dick distich  antique hear the anecdote dick distich you know wrote verses in all measures but in quantity they were without measure as he was so kind as to reverse his name at the close of his poems it was of use to the incautious ridiculed but not so fortunate as to be neglected he retreated to the country in a nervous fever his name he knew would damn his works so calling himself eliza and getting a female friend to transcribe his poems he sent them to the famous paper all the old cruscans rose to a man odes elegies and sonnets were poured on eliza enough to have made a fine snowshower at drury lane eliza was rather broad and warm in her diction she was a sappho a tenth muse and a fourth grace our poets were enamoured of this most sensitive eliza acrid was as clamorous in his raptures as fifty amorous cats on the pantiles he imagined her to be the old laura so he addressed her with this tender billet amiable eliza i love you can you pardon the avowal but i have made it and i know not to repeat of it my passion is like your genius it terrifies or soothes hope and despair prey on my soul hope alas i do not hope and yet i love the answer of eliza to this amatory note was the most consolatory and bid him hope for every favor but she added what if you knew me would your classical eye approve of my person alas i am short and brown but so was sappho my nose is snubbed but so was the beautiful poppaeas i have a singular custom when i kiss to bite but such were the marks of fondness which flora left on her pompey if my personal defects can thus be forgiven as so many classical imitations are in my verses then will sappho receive you as her phaon but i fear faithless and accomplished as that boy an appointment was made dick invited several friends to witness the lovers first interview we stood behind a screen the great critic arrived when lo to the credit of his critical talents his eliza stood before him in the contemned person of poor dick distich what is the consequence the critics reputation has received the coup de grace while elizas verses are now all condemned in one mass what was sweet fancy in eliza is rank dullness in dick distich the poetical hermaphrodite has gained nothing and the sex are but ill complimented for when dick was supposed to be a woman those verses were applauded which are now condemned because he is a man so ladies i recommend the poor devil to your protection  lord i wish i had known all this before cried miss million here is a confusion in the realms of taste we have been applauding the narcotic infusions of dick distich while we thought them the dissolving effusions of a sappho how can one judge of peoples poetry if they deceive us with names  in these cases observed charles we can never fail if we read poems without regarding names should the reader then blunder he must not blame the author you may now exclaim with juliet what is in a name  and then o distich distich wherefore art thou distich  chapter xix an english woman poised between a briton and a gaul  a clerical buck  a philosophical voluptuary vaurien had become the friend of lady belfield and this word even in the dictionary of fashionable language has not degenerated into a nonentity but the adroitness of vice knows to disguise it is impurities by adorning them with the holy titles that are sacred to virtue it is thus that it is grossness is concealed it is deformity invites and it is horrors are crowned with delights that are not it is own we think at first that we enjoy love when we grasp at lust that we are soothed by friendship when we listen to sycophancy and that we pursue amusement when we are heavily dragged through dissipation to the clear eye of reason the pleasures of vice pay an involuntary tribute of honor to virtue by assuming it is name and it is at least a consolation to some and a conviction to many that vice would lose half of its seduction did it not at first appear in the disguise of some virtue  lady belfield enamoured of the gay and accomplished frenchman was for some time occupied in his enjoyment but it was no soothing alliance of the heart no imperishable union of two kindred virtues it was merely an inflammation of the senses a flame that raged at intervals and often sunk in the dying embers of passion and left behind them the disgusts of criminal pleasure the cold ashes of satiety the modest and reserved charles still agitated her soul with those delicate impressions by which the blushing form of unpolluted man touches and irritates even the bosom of corruption his modesty but inflamed desire and his apathy was a mystery she could not penetrate in vain she planned occasions to surprise him into seduction his principles were firm and could they ever have yielded another passion at this time came to his aid and his heart was filled with the image of emily  charles had frequently entered into conversations with this amiable girl and she had discovered in him a secret value which was more delightful to her feelings when absent than the recollection of vauriens more applauded and dazzling qualities vaurien fascinated in her presence charles enchanted in his absence one was to be looked at and the other was remembered the one was all that imagination could form of the agreeable and the other all that sentiment could form of the tender the voice of vaurien was music that regaled the ear but the voice of charles penetrated the abstract ear of memory vaurien exhibited the most agile graces of form the most delightful amenity of manners and never uniform varied a thousand shapes and charmed in all charles had nothing of this versatility he mused and was rarely gay but there was a sweetness in his seriousness and a dignity in his comportment which by it is very uniformity impressed a heart susceptible of reflection and sentiment with features more prominent and energetic than the softer lineaments of vaurien vaurien never gained on reflection all was seen at once nothing was concealed for the private eye he seduced the public applause but could not fix the individual affection charles exhibited a latent merit his commonest action proceeded from a superior impulse in the silence of meditation in that secret hour when absent from our friends we try without passion their merits their follies and their weaknesses vaurien appeared a common man who seemed to perform uncommon actions and charles an uncommon man whose actions were set off neither by ostentation nor singularity vaurien possessed the mind of emily but charles was the inmate of her heart  emily and charles amidst their brilliant circles seemed only to taste of a fugitive happiness when they could contrive to sit together and indulge their sympathy of sentiment in the eyes of emily might be read her soul she looked her thoughts she had none to disguise but some perplexities some blushes some tremors she experienced in these short interviews with charles he read to her one day the close of the spring of thomson where with peculiar sensibility that poet of lovers raises a little fairy existence of conjugal felicity a fading dream that claims a tear from the eye it has solaced a heaven of love that charms and pains it is trembling it is suffering it is doubtful martyr as he proceeded his eyes wandered from the book to emily he pronounced words while attention wandered he stopped suddenly emily leant on his shoulder to look at the verse she saw a tear glisten on the page you have missed whole lines sir said she i will recommence the passage miss emily i was thinking that the tender thomson loved and was beloved yet knew not the only felicity of love i proceed  what is the world to them who in each other clasp whatever fair high fancy forms and lavish hearts can wish something than beauty dearer should they look or on the mind or mindillumind face  charles raised his eye from the volume the face of emily was covered with blushes she gazed on him and seemed to withdraw her eye with timidity reluctance and alarm when he came to these lines an elegant sufficiency content retirement rural quiet friendship books ease and alternate labor useful life progressive virtue and approving heaven charles uttered an audible sigh emily smiling said sure that sigh was not for thomson  ah no miss emily i wonder why i sigh what lines can have a lessadorned simplicity and yet they penetrate my heart i fear that sigh was nothing but vanity and selfishness it was for myself  it is evident that when thomson is read by two young persons of either sex with this taste and sensibility the seasons threaten to disturb the repose of friendship by the intrusion of love and when love is conducted by poetry his armed hand is wrapped beneath a gay mantle and strikes more deeply a perfidious blow  emilys quiet was attempted to be disturbed by others the reverend ephraim dandelion enlisted among her admirers he was a boyish divine a cassocked huntsman and a clerical buck his visits to miss million were not so uninterrupted as he desired owing to his father an opulent rector residing in the vicinity of salisbury and also to the bishop of that diocese who as he observed was a blockhead of the old school indeed this bishop was by no means a man of fashion he bore a most religious antipathy toward all those young clergymen who were in full possession of a plurality of livings and who escaped from them all to reside in the metropolis and to dress their hair as they thought proper ephraim was the hope of his family because he was the eldest son he had therefore been his fathers favorite in his cradle in which place the sacerdotal infant may be said to have felt a simoniacal propensity for indeed simony was a constitutional vice in that family there by some ingenuity of his pious father the rector he was inducted into two good advowsons so that ere the young gentleman issued from his pupillage he presented himself to his own livings and piously undertook the cure of the souls of several parishes he was a young man of modest dispositions and held in veneration the holy profession and as he at once was a nimrod in the field and a narcissus within doors he decently procured two persons to perform his own duties for this purpose he found two fathers of large families at the marketprice then of forty pounds a year he was also a rigid observer of the utmost solemnity in the performance of all church services and testified an uncommon zeal for ecclesiastical rights the former consisted in the personal appearance of his curates and whenever he heard the slightest complaint of a nasal twang or a guttural digestion of words or of a brownish black coat such a curate was discharged at a weeks notice and his zeal for ecclesiastical rights was evidently exhibited in his seizure of all bands black gloves white favors funeral scarfs and the christening or marriage guinea on the whole he was a most orthodox supporter of the church understanding by this word a certain ancient building encircled by a buryingground and the interior furnished with a certain waterbason vulgarly denominated the baptismal fount burials and christenings therefore producing no inconsiderable income he most zealously supported the aforesaid church  but although a sturdy advocate for church subordination he could not consent to grant this to his bishop too active in field sports during the summer and quite exhausted in town dissipaions during the winter he most justly complained of the incessant and personal attacks of his said bishop who particularly at one of his annual dinners given to his assembled brethren did most indelicately reprimand our fashionable rector vicar and prebendary for all these honors and their appurtenances were united in young ephraim he resolved now to throw off the yoke of ecclesiastical jurisdiction and to the great comfort of our sacerdotal bucks they may enjoy the revenues of an ecclesiastic without the borish performance of the functions ephraim had great interest with the prince for two reasons in a drunken frolic at brighton he had received the honor of being thrown into a gravelpit by which means he broke his leg but as his neck was entire he did not much lament the fracture since it was a kind of claim on princely patronage and the other reason was that the reverend ephraim dandelion was a person of inimitable talent in imitating the bray of an ass and the whine of a pig the ass and the pig with the abovementioned dash into the gravelpit procured him an honorary place in the princes army of chaplains this honor brings with it the useful privilege of enabling the possessor to hold as many livings as he can get while it comfortably relieves him of the tedious duty of residence so the happy ephraim aspiring now to a bishopric never more entered the palace of his bishop  although we know of no facts for of facts should all true histories like the present consist that might tend to accuse him of any venial liberalities to his miserable curates yet he was well enabled to commit such follies for he now held in livings and ceteras above two thousand a year according to his own frequent avowal and little less he expected from the worthy rector his father who was of a most plethoric habit was a gargantua in point of stomach one of the most orthodox venison eaters in his county and had been twice touched by an apoplexy  a character more singular and interesting was the voluptuous sedley a passion for selfenjoyment was the source of his actions his life was a system of refined epicurism his study was an art to irritate desire and to protract enjoyment to throw over the nudities of imagination a thin and brilliant veil woven by the graces he was born with a sensitive heart and a romantic fancy but his natural benevolence was frequently sacrificed to his artificial gratifications yet of his dangerous talent his numerous victims rather murmured than complained their ruin seemed adorned despair was half soothed by the memory of it is past enjoyments and at least the sincerity of their master was evinced in his having become his own victim his fortune and his felicity were alike exhausted in the fatal ravages of his passions a dark vacuity in his heart terrified his solitude with all the fervor of affection he found he could not love with all the curious felicity of enjoyment he found he had never enjoyed enervated by the anguish of disappointment yet stimulated by the fever of hope he wandered in a tumultuous pursuit of that pleasure which if fugitive tormented with desire and if embraced sickened with satiety  there was something grand and romantic in his entire establishment all the luxuries of europe were his domestic enjoyments every sense was flattered and the imagination itself was attempted to be satisfied he held a correspondence with foreign parts to import every novelty of refined sensuality and the same ship often conveyed to him a picture of raphael a hogshead of montepulciano and a female selected for some peculiarity of seature his houses resounded with music and all the arts of amenity crowded to the opulent idler the heats of summer were cooled by the ices of winter and his winter garden was prodigal of the roses of summer every day he religiously gratified his five senses it was this englishman of whom mercier relates that he boasted of having acquired a sixth sense it consisted in the singular fancy of assembling females who resembled by their features the beauties of other times he dispersed throughout europe portraits of his ancient favorites and sometimes prolonged his mornings with the scottish mary and anne bullen and sometimes was seated at supper between cleopatra and poppaea the illusion was still further promoted by preserving their costume and dressing every beauty according to the country and the age she personified  in his country retreat he was charmed by an arcadian taste and realized the romance of the golden age there he would habit himself as a shepherd and walking by the side of a stagedancer his favorite sultana while she played on a little harp he held a crook in his hand a basket at his side and wore a straw hat wreathed with roses in the semblance of peace and enjoyment he wandered through the winding alleys of spring and disported in the rich shrubberies of his ground his companions at distance warbled their tenderest airs and the symphonies of musical instruments responded to the harp of his shepherdess nightingales trained for this purpose issued from their nests and settling some near the fantastical arcadian and some on the harp of his mistress rivalled her provoking melodies fluttered fainted and fell at her feet  to such puerilities can descend the inordinate indulgence of an ungoverned fancy and in vain will the incredulous in his circumscribed experience censure these instances as the ideal pictures of an authors heated fancy since these are facts sanctioned by their truth and others not of an inferior extravagance not long ago amused the tedium of the existence of a noble lord  but in sedley his puerilities were not unaccompanied with taste nor was his voluptuousness inhuman and void of elevation voluptuousness had made him no otherwise to be condemned than in those seducing powers and those brilliant illusions which betrayed the sensibility of the feminine heart the voluptuousness of a woman can never be pardoned chastity is like a seal to a rich casket which while preserved entire we know can never have been pillaged of it is gems sensuality is masculine for it is gross let the crime and the punishment be reserved for man sedley was otherwise the friend of human nature and loved the enjoyments of others because to him it was an enjoyment but when at certain intervals his senses were exhausted recollection obtruded itself on his startled mind it came in the wan form of satiety that spectre of departed pleasure the images of those he had rendered miserable of some the suicides and of others the lives gave to his repentant heart the pains themselves had experienced the gay sedley shed the bitterest tears in silence and he mourned at once the unhappiness of his companions and his own i am a wretch he would say but not from the malice of my heart but from it is pervading softness i perish with those that i have lost and i have not inflicted one pang on others which i would not bear myself  not i but nature is inhuman i listen to her voice the wanderings of my heart are her inspirations and if she betrays those whom she conducts who can wrestle with the divinity of nature she has given too few senses and too numerous desires and nature forms herself the torturing scourge that affrights and afflicts the gentlest of the human race such was the character and such the reflections of sedley  at a morning visit to miss million emily not being present became the subject of their animadversions  she is certainly a d fine girl only too modest said the reverend ephraim dandelion  o exclaimed miss million you cannot conceive what vast pleasure it has given me to have found out the old blind lieutenants daughter when i saw her at exmouth i repeatedly pressed her with invitations to portmansquare but never expected to see the poor thing there she was quite solitary and timid  we shall then beat her hollow cried dandelion for a hare is solitary and timid but yields as fine sport as a fox  she is a delicious creature cried sedley  the most amiable and accomplished said lady belfield  the most fascinating said vaurien  i think gravely observed charles she will be in some danger among us all  what danger sir sharply reprimanded lady belfield i will answer for you positively a young woman is never in danger in the great world among the most polished part of society we do not blazon forth every casual indiscretion an honorable silence protects a woman while in your plebeian circles the slightest gallantries are construed into unpardonable levities the most agreeable fleurettes are supposed to be declarations of love and if an assignation should be discovered the whole family venerable papa the little sister and the tall brother and the whole generation take the alarm a duel and a divorce complete the vulgar farce nothing less will do than an absolute lucretia whose history no one credits more than curtius leaping into the great gulf  indeed lady belfield replied miss million i had forgot to mention to you that half of mr charles merits are lost in his morality what is meant by this same morality i am sure it gives no knowledge of the world for lord chesterfields divine works they say are immoral and the insupportable rambler they say is a very moral work but lord dont let us talk of morality it always brings on my nervous complaint i do not know what to do with myself this whole day the yawned i wish i had some new place to go to  just now said vaurien the lord mayors show is setting off from the mansion house what do you think of a ride to the city  o vulgar cried miss million i never drive into the city but on sundays the streets are so narrow and the carts are so broad but what does your ladyship think of this show  i am quite disengaged miss million said lady belfield  why then well set off directly well but my dear vaurien what shall we do after the show  trust to good fortune there is the waxwork in fleet street  absolutely childish what thinks your ladyship  it would be so great a novelty to me that i am sure i should be pleased  well then well go to the waxwork in fleet street said miss million i dare say it will be in all the papers tomorrow then where can we pass two hours more i cannot think of coming home to dress till five then from five to seven are my two regular desperate hours it is a melancholy interval of time when one is quite dressed for dinner and wishes for it without appetite merely to see company all the nobility are miserable from five to seven  i have many cried vaurien the ventriloquist and the stoneeater the corsican fairy and the polish dwarf there is a collection of chinese curiosities three monsters with throats as large as their bodies a fullgrown elephant and a lapdog which may be put in a snuffbox going to be shipped off for the dutch governor of batavia and above all there is a poupee of madame tallien who now reigns like the queen of france and which is just brought over by a french milliner as a model of the present parisian fashion not three persons in town have seen it the dress is richly fanciful and perfectly in the old roman style the breasts uncovered one side of the robe drawn up which delightfully exhibits the whole leg and a little higher it is the most voluptuous and most brilliant dress  delightful exclaimed miss million let us set off  my dear friend said sedley pray give me the address that i may have a copy of the poupee of madame tallien  emily now entering was invited by miss million to the whole circle of these morning amusements but she pleaded indisposition and the company retired sedley however gave up the poupee of madame tallien for the present moment and returning into the breakfastroom found himself alone with emily it was a moment he had long desired but which had hitherto eluded his attempts what passed between our amiable heroine and our refined voluptuary is perhaps entitled to the honors of a separate chapter  chapter xx a conversation with a philosophical voluptuary i have brought said sedley as he returned a version of my favorite poet here it is miss emily for you was it composed but even you have failed to inspire me with the delicacy and amenity of the voluptuous anacreon of france lart daimer of bernard cannot be translated at least permit me thus to console my own inability could you but catch the seductive graces of the original i should trace in the touching languor of your eye the enchantment of your heart he is the albano of poetry in his amiable miniatures he paints the playful triumphs or the children of love fervid yet chaste true yet flattering it is only nature embellished  bernard was my friend as well as master he was the most amiable man at the most amiable court an arbiter elegantiarum in the most refined circles at paris the art of pleasing in conversation was still more sensibly felt than the art of delighting by his graceful and dissolving verse voltaire considered him as a prodigy of elegant voluptuousness in noticing saint bernard and another bernard celebrated for his wealth he adds le troisieme est lenfant de phoebus gentil bernard dont la muse feconde doit saire encore les delices du monde quand des premiers on ne parlera plus voltaire    his verses respire a continued softness are gay with a thousand pictures and are the enamellings of poetry in his manners what easy yet resistless grace no man had so much of that light flower of taste which blooms but for a rapid moment those brilliant colors that fade while we gaze on them ah that any thing of bernard should be perishable  mr sedley interrupted emily i love all kinds of enthusiam but in this case as you labor with great perplexity to describe your master tell me at once he was an effeminate refined and lively frenchman  for your sex his passion was excessive but he was inconstant and yet miss emily he was beloved not a parisian beauty complained of his infidelities for the charms of his genius they pardoned the wanderings of his heart and he censures his own inconstancies with such gaiety that they seem to be only so many triumphs  i know not how it happened but poor bernard survived himself in my last residence at paris i found the voluptuous poet a mere shadow of existence and he who had charmed by the lightness and the tenderness of his effusions was then a mute idiot i have been at the opera with him when they performed his own admirable castor and pollux he gazed with a vacant eye and we could draw no other conversation from him than incessant enquiries if his majesty was satisfied if madame de pompadour was pleased courtier to the last the royal favor was the solitary sentiment that occupied the insensate idiot ah miss emily it was an humiliation for the man of pleasure and the man of wit to view their gay and amiable chief with eyes that distilled unmeaning tears an exanimate frame that sat motionless and whose voice could not utter an expression but which confirmed his idiotism  the title of his poem observed emily is to me a condemning criticism i should be very sorry i assure you to be taught an art of love i fear it is a misfortune for most in these times to be in love without art but by your account of bernard i am much gratified you know i am delighted by a moral tale and i think yours is extremely moral it is a true and melancholy picture of those foolish wits who abandoned to the fury of their passions are not less pernicious to themselves than to their neighbors since you have printed this dangerous poem have the candor to give this last anecdote of bernards life as a preface or a postscript mr sedley will believe me when i say i am not fastidiously moral i do not consider every deviation from our own accustomed habits to be turpitude or even error i have seen prudes grow outrageous at freedoms with their persons which i should consider as very inoffensive if i were in france where i am told the ladies indulge in many familiarities more harmless than they seem i think i should only consider them as local customs but libertinism mr sedley in whatever form it comes whether it be gay with the spirits of youth or vapid with the tremors of age adorned by the charms of verse or systematized by the philosophy of prose is irreconcilable to my feelings i will not look for the reasons that may have excited its abhorrence it is enough for me that it is inspection raises a disgust so natural and energetic that i lose my patience when i seek for reasons i do not know that i could give any satisfactory reason why i prefer perfumes to ordures but that my organs are so framed as to be attracted by the one and to be repulsed by the other in these cases the best reason will be in not attempting to reason as to return to your poem all my art of love will i hope be to have no art at all  a slight misconception not a difference in opinion amiable miss emily has afforded you this vindictive exultation how justly you observe that there are rapid sensations which are so natural as not to exact the frigid and impotent efforts of an inactive reason do not form such serious such gloomy notions of love look not on it is innocent pleasures with the melancholy eye of reason you have been told that the desires of love are crimes but they are only amusements you consider him as a tyrant or a traitor but he is only an amiable boy he exacts but one gentle concession so well expressed by thomson when he says  thought meeting thought and will preventting will with boundless confidence  it is this submissive sentiment tender and ingenuous prompt yet durable ardent yet continued that diffuses the soul in the senses and fertile and eager in desire lives and increases on the overflowing lap of pleasure sedley is repeating in prose what his friend bernard has sung in verse  ce sentiment soumis tender ingenu prompt mais durable ardent mais soutenu  ce trait de feu gui des yeux pass a lame de lame aux sens qui fecond en desirs dure et saugmente au comble des plaisirs     who more modest and retired than a sensitive lover in shade and in silence are all the surtive caresses of love received love is a secret enjoyment it admits of no participation it is for the applause of his mistress and not for that of the world a lover pants  lament then with me my dear miss emily the prejudices of our age and our country how rarely does love unite two hearts in the sanctioned pleasures of matrimony the conjugal couch we consider as polluted when two congenial spirits meet  but meet too late and should they love as nature dictates to the heart we reproach them we disgrace them we harass them with the iron manacles of law unnatural laws but most natural loves how often have i wished to have been an inmate of those countries which we call barbarous but which i admire as the only regions where nature is not offended by the haughty temerity of man o happy people where the lover composes his fragrant letter with the freshest flowers where the yellow jonquil tells his despair the crimson rose the consenting blushes of his beloved and the chaste lily the consummation of his amatory hopes nor do the canadians with a concise rudeness experience perhaps inferior delight when they send a lighted match to their mistress and if she blows it they are happy but precipitated love loses half it is pleasures sweet and romantic is the varied interval between desire and enjoyment the delight of the chase is not in it is game but it is pursuit let a bashful mistress be capricious be cruel be every thing but let her at length be kind we claim but the reward of industry a holiday in the toiling year of slavery  if we listen to nature can we err to enjoy is to obey declares your own poet of reason and what is the arid uniformity of life but a dull and unmeaning passage unless some transient roses are scattered at our feet our existence is derived from our senses corporeal sensibility is the source of our passions the motive of our thought the magnet of our sociability and in one word it is our misery or our enjoyment nature never relinquishes our heart it is emotions custom may pervert and reason may condemn but to the tremblingly alive how tedious is custom how dismal is reason ah reason miss emily what is reason nothing but a prevailing system of opinions which in time are mutilated and reversed and which directed merely by accidental customs is various in every people reason is compelled to elaborate with terrible pangs system upon system and destroys itself in it is attempts of selfpreservation and when a man is devoid of sensibility he is considered to be the ablest dialectician now if sensibility is but the soft workings of nature mark how unnatural is reason but pleasure that is sensibility gratified is the spontaneous effusion of nature it is language is universal it is actions are uniform the same at the burning line as on the icy alps our senses are the porches of nature ever open to all our pleasures reason magisterially would close them but these veins are the canals of delight and would you freeze them reason may make a conquest but pleasure alone can be loved for she is the enchanting and the native sovereign of the heart  to this subtle and tedious philosophy emily patiently listened and then replied alas sir why do you employ your talents in a cause so feeble and yet so dangerous all that you have beautifully said cannot conceal the disgusting reality it is only spreading the variegated hues of the rainbow on the filthy webs of spiders i answer you however that reason melancholy as you term it is my pleasure i therefore agree with you that i should loath existence did not indulge my pleasure reason is immutable for it is truth i acknowledge that there exists a false as well as a true reason as there is a pleasure that is true and another which is false it is therefore not difficult to describe the one while we are only alluding to the other and perhaps had i not been rather singular in my habits of life and my taste for reading i might have been deluded in listening to you i might have mistaken a false and spurious pleasure for that which alone is true and durable consider therefore the wickedness of propagating maxims which all may listen to with pleasure while few can discriminate with judgment  dear miss emily it is you who form sophisms why will you call reason pleasure and it is variance immutability is that pleasure that commands an abstinence from enjoyment and which is frequently known to communicate an antipathy of existence no not all the propositions of lock can change one organ that inebriates the heart and is this reason immutable which is variable as the heavens and as changeable in a people as in an individual when reason flies to the cloister does pleasure follow when the anchorite shuts up the human heart what remains but the waning spectre of man pure and traceless is the pliability of pleasure pure and traceless as this kiss he took her hand and raised it to his inclining lips it was done with such modesty and gentleness that emily could not be angry she was only confused  mr sedley she said i know these freedoms are considered rather as favors done to us but allow me to indulge my own sensations i have lived in retirement i cannot grant such insidious liberties you would not i am sure be satisfied with that poor gratification of seizing from an unprotected female that which she must not refuse and will not grant  heaven forbid my charming miss emily angel as you are in mind as in form pleasure is no solitary gratification it is a dividual enjoyment if you are miserable i therefore cannot be happy alas you persist in refusing the supreme felicity of a chaste voluptuousness in preferring the spiritless repose of life to that enchantment which gives to one day the existence of an age the deliciousness of mutual possession but recollect that with the indulgence of this chaste voluptuousness no virtue refuses to be united and such amiable women have adorned society and cherished the duties of humanity i must not quit you without repeating saint evremonds charming and philosophical inscription for ninon de lenclos i can give it you almost literally  nature with sage indulgence formed ninons enchanting soul and gazed with epicurus softness warmed and with a catos virtue raised the original is thus  lindulgente et sage nature a form lame de ninon de la volupte depicure et de la virtue de caton       when the philosophic voluptuary quitted emily he placed his poem in a book she had been reading unperceived by her and she now retired to dress mrs bully soon afterward entered and her curious and inquisitorial eye always exercised on the appearance of a volume unfortunately discovered in emilys this art of love a pretty title indeed she exclaimed for a modest young lady yet miss emily cannot read the bible because of some amorous histories which she began but would never finish a curse on such socinianism here she turned over the leaves and then cried out lord save us here is a description of two newlymarried lovers on the morning couch of hymen which i suppose only means a bed what is this  thou sleepst zelida i enjoy alone soft over thy form one living blush is thrown awake to pleasure with the morning beam ah while i view thee thou but viewst some dream he sighed  zelida hears her eyes expand tremulous she sighs and lifts her timid hand nor dares withdraw it hylas gently guides in each warm vein the tenderest tremor glides they joined their lips of flame with fainting bliss their souls divided in the ethereal kiss   abominable it is nt fit to be read by a christian very well miss emily not fit to be read so saying she snatched the poem hurried to her chamber sat down and having quite read it through locked it up in one of her secret drawers  chapter xxi of loving by anticipation a year of patronage love in it is earliest stage has a variety of ways of exhibiting itself there is love at first sight which we observe to be a very fashionable and expeditious manner with some of our living novelists yet i cannot applaud them for any invention in this respect to detect the finest foldings of the human heart is the pleasing skill of us domestic biographers then there is love without love by which we understand the platonic affection but what a ridiculous figure would the amiable boy make if he were to hold in his hand an useless torch without a flame which we are inclined to think is the chimerical flambeau which every platonist waves but the most remarkable and we conceive the most ingenious kind of love is when we are perfectly enamoured of a person whom we have never seen and of whom we have never heard it is a kind of love to which we are extremely partial having ourselves formed a hundred delightful miseries of such deliciousness pleasures of which assuredly only exquisite genius or exquisite madness has ever felt the inebriation a spanish hero in one of the plays of calderon to apologize for his most fervent but most sudden passion observes that he loved his mistress before he knew her because he was fated to love her others the very caesars of love may exclaim i saw i loved i conquered but then such a happy victory will more depend on the heroine than the hero unless the latter should possess a brilliant enquipage a noble mansion and a noble income and in that predicament the hero may justly attribute his triumph entirely to himself but of the kind of love which we form for a person quite unknown to us the most pleasing instance is that of the once famous zayde who by the means of an unknown portrait hung in her fathers gallery felt a most vehement passion for her lover about twenty years before ever she saw him so that without any violation of decency she might have thrown herself into his arms at the very first moment they met but unfortunately when she met the man she so ardently loved she passed several years in his society which a resolution not to love him because she loved his picture which it is evident was not necessary for her to know was his picture till the last page of that romance  among this class of lovers by anticipation we must place our good charles for he was fond of emily and his heart palpitated warmly at the sound of her name long before their first accidental interview at mrs wilsons he loved without having seen her for he loved her most affectionately for her filial piety and her patient sufferings but when he saw her to love is but a poverty of conception to designate with precision the tumult that rushed on his heart that made him inactive in the day and restless in the night with emily the grand affair of love was far different as she had not any equal impulses to love charles before she saw him when she did see him the passion grew by slow gradations she was averse to indulge the susceptibility of her heart she had a latent propensity to a dangerous infection rather than that she felt the immedicable disorder to gain the full possession of her virtuous heart it was necessary to merit it and as such opportunities do not easily occur at least in true histories like the present it was long before she perceived the just claim of charles to that valued gift and when she began to love most unfortunately it occurred that she was obliged to dread and to hate as we purpose shortly to detail  emily entered the parlour one day followed by the reverend ephraim dandelion she flung open the door with a hasty violence unusual with her mild manners her face was one blush her whole frame one disorder heavens what is the matter child enquired miss million nothing madam replied the confused emily but mr dandelion i presume will be taught to respect himself or me for the future as it assuredly will not be repeated it would be giving it too much importance to remember it  well but what was it emily i dare say some country joke of our young bishop  dandelion replied miss emily is so touchy that she takes fire as easily as the wadding of my gun or as a little field of furze what the deuce can a man do with his hands more inoffensively than to arrange the tucker of a charming girl true my hand slipped and miss emily was in such an agitation that de she frightened me  the eyes of charles darted fire they were fixed on dandelion the reverend ephraim most probably caught them for he bent his head and employed himself in pulling the straps of his boots emily marked the full direction of charless fervid eyes she felt an emotion of gratitude and alarm  indeed is that all said miss million bridling with a look which she divided between the plaintiff and the defendant but which might be discriminated by an analyzer of a look into an insulting sneer for emily and a jealous reproach for ephraim i advise you child that if such harmless freedoms are to occasion such violent resentments to hide yourself from the figure of a man but you have seen so little of the great world that such gauchete of manners must be the consequence but i do not see mr dandelion what you have to do with miss emily  mr dandelion observed vaurien would do well when he thrusts his hands into a rosebush to take care of not scratching himself with the briers i wish my good friend the tucker had been well armed at all points you have had but a bloodless victory and have taken the outworks without even the apology of a siege  you country gentlemen said sedley are most robust in your refinements you crush in your embrace and your raptures annihilate delicate nerves it is all bussing at a gossips christening i think you are the only respectable part of the community who perpetuate the venerable kissing of queen besses days or her good father whose kisses i think generally concluded with blows i believe a woman conceives a kiss from a country gentleman full as dreadful as a tug or a shake you are all for overflowing bumpers no matter what wine you have done in the turning of a lock what a sensitive man would have taken three years about  de said dandelion you all set me like a pack in full cry i am sure i am sorry to have offended miss emily but i never yet offended by a little play  play sir continued sedley why it is coming to blows i fear miss emily has received some marks from your cudgelling arms i know a friend mr dandelion who is a man of sensibility and refinement and who has now paid his devoirs to an amiable woman these twelve years he never passed an evening with her but in the company of a third person he admires her music she admires his verses he was seven years before he kissed her hand but to have touched her tucker  sir as soon would he  but i will say no more  when the company broke up charles took dandelion aside and said miss emily balfour i am sorry to see in this house without a protector such i imagine she cannot want long but till she has a protector we should all of us consider it as our indispensable duty to perform that office you however do not  if you would consult your own ease i must insist that you never offer to give pain to that lady by a single word or a single action  so ho young squire whistled dandelion  you are the protector of miss emily who gave you this right  my humanity i do not mean to interchange any conversation to a person of your character conviction must be brought by other means mr dandelion my father was a clergyman it is an awful profession and he who seems ashamed of it has attained a degree of depravity which i think is quite of a recent date so saying he gave a violent shake to his cropped hair and braided tail for when our young parson was in town his clerical encircling curl was twisted into an elegant tail sustained by a tortoiseshell comb  and pray sir calmly demanded dandelion what can you mean by this  perhaps you may understand me better now said charles repeating the action to the utter discomfiture of his fashionable crop while the braided tail hung dishevelled on his back  i believe you mean to insult me  precisely so i have now only insulted you but mean as you are the next time you do not escape correction  while this short dialogue was passing between charles and ephraim the door had been left ajar and the maid of emily in passing had been attracted by the firm tones of charles the whole scene was revealed through the magnifying glass of her eye she examined every motion and in a very poetical amplification of our heros concise prose she detailed the whole to emily who when the terrible description was closed rejoiced to find that the duel was a bloodless encounter charmed by the modest the sensible and concealed manner which charles had chosen to protect her this action was repaid by her little heart with more than gratitude  in this manner emily passed six months in the house of miss million much to her dissatisfaction the refinement of sedley was insidious the brutality of dandelion disgusted the interest she took in vaurien was censurable and the growing affection she felt for charles was imprudent miss million had now heard her so frequently applauded by every one and particularly since the attack of the reverend ephraim on the fair bosom of our heroine that she began to feel weary of a girl who carried the whole weight of attention to her side her displeasure gleamed through several obscure hints dropped to mrs betty her waitingmaid who blew the gleams into a kitchen flame they met a most terrible bellows in the mouth of mrs bully who besides accusations of socinianism whispered in close secrets and talked in imperfect surmises that she had made a most important detection of the loose morals of miss emily this part of her accusation agitated the curiosity of the lower part of the house and a most unfortunate circumstance which then happened confirmed all the foul accusations of the orthodox and benevolent mrs bully  emily now viewed the altered features of patronage she saw herself the dependant of a mean an unfeeling and an uneducated woman of fashion to her sensations every look was reproach every expression contempt and every civility insult not that miss million uttered her vulgar sentiments in their clear and appropriate language but to the luminous sensibility of emily the sordid heart of miss million lay open and her sensitive soul now shivered in all the varying seasons of a year of patronage it was now she perceived that she had not regarded the counsel of her father in seeking her independence from herself she saw her existence in sorrow or in pleasure as the face of her patroness chose completely miserable and humiliated in her own mind she felt herself unprotected and knew not where to find a refuge  chapter xxii vauriens friendships the friendship of charles for vaurien had become indissoluble some opinions which the gaul had at first thrown out alarmed him but he considered them only as those dangerous paradoxes peculiar to the intemperate philosophers of his country nor was charles a little delighted by perceiving the energy of his own eloquence operating on the superior intellect of vaurien who had gradually relinquished his own notions one by one and at present seemed only a mere reflection of the pure and honest charles he reposed on the bosom of this cherished friend his virtues daily excited admiration and none so much as his extraordinary liberalities since his late remittances from france which as he informed his friends he had been so fortunate as to receive to vaurien charles poured his secret sorrows he touched mournfully on the dissipations of lady belfield and lamented the contempt he hourly received from his former gentle patroness as for my lord you acknowledge said he that he is obstinately lost to reason and an enemy to that constitution which protects his person and his property which must be slowly reformed not rapidly destroyed united closer not disorganized in vain i willingly yield some principles which i deem political superstitions but in return he yields me not one opinion however fantastic however destructive he and his party would innovate all things but my lord does not agree with mr subtle mr subtle with mr dragon nor mr sympathy with dr bounce philosophy has it is prejudices not less pernicious not less inhuman than the popular prejudices of the most intolerant people and at what aims this philosophy in forming a man without a heart it is of no consequence to me whether a persecuting religion burns me in an autodafe or whether a persecuting philosophy conducts me to the guillotine it is always the same thing for my neck  to similar conversations vaurien had not only given his approbation but expressed his surprise that a free briton like charles should violate his dignity by the dependence of patronage gratitude said he for the reception accorded to a foreign wanderer still kept him in the house of belfield but his day of enfranchisement should not be far and he should rejoice to observe charles spurn his splendid but ignoble chains and for this purpose offered a liberal supply of money charles felt grateful and only refused the offer through delicacy observing that whenever his patrons should hint at a dismission he would rejoice to accept it tres bien said vaurien musing  lady belfield was exasperated by the insensibility of charles she had exhausted her whole artillery and she in vain essayed to soften the human statue into animation she now suspected that his heart was occupied by some rival to her confidential vaurien she opened her surmises their mutual passion had greatly subsided and it it is height it was a love that knows no jealousy her ladyship and vaurien would have mutually assisted each other in procuring themselves new lovers  indeed replied vaurien to the enquiry it is an insult to your ladyship shall i dare to say you have a rival in an abject being  i desire vaurien said her ladyship reddening that you will inform me  i cannot my indignation would preserve silence  sensitive vaurien you anticipate my feelings i insist on knowing  he is my friend you must grant me the most inviolable secresy charles is unworthy of your regard your rival added vaurien with a sneer halfsuppressed is a low woman picked from the streets and whom he has placed in a petty shop he gave the address of mrs wilson  the face of lady belfield burned her eyes caught fire and she said scarce audibly is the wretch so low how humiliating the villain his presence is a reproach vaurien he shall not remain here  at this house continued vaurien miss balfour accidentally hired lodgings he has taken me frequently to this womans but the sweet emily for whom you know i feel a passion a passion as yet ungratified knows nothing of her character  i have told you vaurien replied her ladyship that i have already secured that dear girl to reside with us some time receive that innocence with gentleness smile at least on the victim of my friendship and your love when she bleeds let me not hear her cries  from this conversation vaurien hastened to his lordship with belfield he had for some time past engaged in complicate conspiracies this morning my lord he said a trusty courier has brought me letters from breast rowan oconnor has secured connaught we have a garrison of defenders in all the remote towns of ireland surely potatoes are inflammable the irish are so hot our party gains at paris the jacobins are playing gently now with the moderes but rely on it it is the young tiger with his keeper who attempted to domesticate the animal but when the tiger knew his strength he tossed about the head of his keeper for his amusement an embarkation for england is preparing the coasts are lined with men the invasion is at no great distance but your lordship wants patriotism and this is the only moment when all the thames should roll like another pactolus on sands of gold money is wanted in ireland dragon holds a correspondence with almost every town in england we have all the idle the discontented the bankrupts and the hotbrained youth of every town you see our party is formidable rant has become an itinerant orator and his sixpenny eloquence scatters more sedition among the lower classes than all the money of your lordship he is quite intelligible to them ranting roaring raving he draws his metaphors from the very gutters of the people and so far like virgil as your addison says the fellow tosses his dung about him with some effect  his lordship listened with intense delight to this rapid sketch of the gaul what he barely touched on his fertile imagination expanded by anticipation already on the ruins of london a committee of public safety seemed to arise take all my dear vaurien all i have to give but the dilatoriness of all those projects which you describe so rapidly has left me a ruined man mortgage i cannot more and for swindling i have not sufficient credit if this invasion of england fails where shall i fly  france replied vaurien will be proud to enrol the name of belfield among it is english citizens we have already some british worthies of a kindred merit but i can proceed no further if charles remains in your house i suspect he is a ministerial spy  he shall have his dismission said his lordship  such were the friendships of vaurien yet at the very instant he evinced a sudden ebullition of sympathy which virtue would have been proud to own passing the hall he observed a servant lad who had retired into a dark corner and seated on a bench was weeping and sobbing what has happened william enquired vaurien  i have just received a letter sir from my poor mother who tells me my father is dead he has been bedridden these ten years his death might have been borne for my poor mother could hardly support herself and a helpless old man but we are both now in such despair i cannot sleep at the thoughts my father will not have christian burial the creditors insist first on being paid the body is detained and heaven only knows where my fathers soul rests it can never rest surely if not buried in christian ground ah sir i remember that when the great methodist surgeon of our village anatomized the strong man that was hanged for continually breaking out of prison he felt a qualm of conscience and employed me in the night to dig a grave in the churchyard that the bones might be buried in holy ground for he no doubt could not answer to his conscience if they had remained unburied if people are not buried in church ground what will become of their souls my mother is distracted and i am afraid to walk in the night vaurien smiled at the artless tremors of the lad and his mother and quieted their holy horror by his liberal assistance  chapter xxiii a declaration of love not known to the lover since emilys residence in portmansquare although so long a time had elapsed mrs wilson had not yet paid her a visit this separation had been occasioned by misfortune and not by neglect there are some beings who seem selected by outrageous fortune not only to receive the full weight of her fatal sling but to be stuck round by her harassing and petty arrows mrs wilson in issuing one day for this very purpose either that really she had been so closely confined at her industrious counter that she was quite a novice in the art of walking the crowded streets or that accustomed to indulge many profound reveries of sorrow she was rather seen than that she herself saw she had hardly cleared the view of her house when she encountered a porter who with the full weight and the broad expansion of a chest of tea was equally oppressed as blinded yet unfortunately determined at the same time to be rapid in his motions so that the exertion of sight entirely rested on the passengers and not on the porter the latter indeed proceeded rapidly but securely for he was in no danger of being reversed but rushing round the corner of a street where mrs wilson had arrived at that very nicety of point of turning when the two future contenders are perfectly unperceived by each other  in not half a second of time  the porter rounded and mrs wilson fell it proved no trifling fracture and she had hitherto been confined to her house emily had more than once called on her had sympathized and found her more estimable at every interview yet her fathers suspicions had made in indelible impression on her mind and prompt as she was at the tender call of friendship suspicion made her rather tremble than enjoy  when this poor woman found herself in a state of convalescence she came immediately to her young friend i hope miss emily she said your situation is agreeable  alas mrs wilson emily replied if it is not i must attribute it to my present state of feeling every scene takes much and sometimes all it is effect from our existing ideas i feel that if i were in an elysium it would appear gloomy in the image of my father there is yet too much life for me quietly to remember that it has ceased to exist his minutest habits and his accustomed phrases still engage my affections and i gaze on what i cannot view and i listen to what i cannot hear to me he is not dead and i seem to live in the cruel torments of an absence i never yet knew and cannot teach myself to suffer consider then my present situation here is nothing but mirth and splendor and my heart is agitated by a perpetual conflict of interior misery and exterior gaiety but with me the heart will ever prevail over all it is constraints it will color the scene i view will prompt in my sorrows the languor of my conversation and must ill fit me to be the companion of miss million every day i feel i am an intruder in this great house and yet i consider myself as it is humblest servant i sold my freedom when i united myself to it is generous owner gratitude takes from me the power of choice otherwise much could i wish my dear mrs wilson that i still occupied the small room of your small house there i think i could feel quietness and to me quietness seems an enjoyment i almost think it felicity my independence would then arise from myself temperance would be my gratification useful yet not unpleasing occupations all my wealth and your conversation would constitute all that i wish to hear of the world when i entered this superb mansion i unthinkingly violated the solemn injunction of my dear father who as if he had been aware of this splendid slavery this silken chain told me only to derive my subsistence from myself ah if i were but once more in your little room  but what do i say there my father would sit before me every thing in your house would remind me of his presence the arm chair would tell me where he twice swooned and the bed would for ever revive his last his affectionate yet dignified hour but these are foolish tears the unavailing tears of memory yet is their sweet sadness endeared to the living they ever relieve me and when i have wiped my eyes my heart feels the energy of fortitude and i then say i live as heaven chooses  if you would live with me replied mrs wilson i will change my house on industry alone depends all my business and industry will make business in one street as well as in another i have heard some of my neighbors who have quitted their first shops to get into larger ones complain that their present street is not half so lucky as their former one i have attempted out of mere benevolence and not of mere pride to play the philosopher i have shown them that in their first shops with much less business they were much more industrious and that when some people get rich it is a chance that they become again poor and really without suspecting it i have pursued a certain notion of aristotles which i met the other evening that there is no good or ill fortune but what arises from our own ill or good conduct and that to say a man is very unfortunate is to say that he wants capacity or wants industry however i have made no converts of my good neighbors and one particularly who i fear by his expensive mode of living and by the affected education of his daughters who when their fathers man is weighing cheese are employed at delighting his ears by jarring with a concerto of haydn and who have hung round their shop among cheshire and wiltshire cheeses some select views of ancient greece i say this poor man who made a respectable fortune in his first shop by his own industry is now convinced that great russel street is one of the unluckiest streets in town but i am flying off in a tangent when i have something to communicate of a serious and interesting nature  what i now impart must my dear miss emily be confided to your secret ear it is not only your delicacy which i fear to irritate but the kindness of the humanest man which i tremble to offend a devoted friendship for two persons whose happiness is dear to me as the existence of my children will if it is returned but in the smallest portion receive with affection or pardon with facility what my heart has prompted me to disclose  why this embarrassment mrs wilson what secret can you have to preface thus solemnly can you fear to unfold or i to hear what you say interests me the innocent have no secrets i assure you i never had a secret in my life i have indeed been made acquainted with that kind of intelligence but i generally found that a secret was only malice in disguise i must freely say that extorted silence i can violate without any conscientious yearnings have you a secret which you would not tell me as frankly as any other friend  indeed i cannot agree yes i must say that innocence may have it is secrets which it would expire before it would reveal ah there are some delicate situations which if not fearfully and cautiously concealed might wear the most criminal aspect mrs wilson here gave a sigh much more profound than audible  well my dear mrs wilson replied emily you must know more of human nature than myself i never could enter into any mans character but my fathers all men assuredly are not pursued by the same ill fortune and all therefore may not be as selfsevere often has he told me that he never conceived a thought that he was not prompt to express excellent man there was a holiness in his mind and respecting those critical situations to which you allude where innocence takes a criminal aspect he used to say sincerity is wisdom what today we conceal may appear tomorrow and the explanation we avoided will then come too late we have got into our usual moralizing strain my dear mrs wilson but i am now quite prepared for your secret  while emily was pronouncing her fathers apophthegm on sincerity mrs wilson reddened changed her posture and drew out her handkerchief to place before her eyes emily was intent on her netting the pointed address she had made her innocent heart never suspected when mrs wilson recovered from certain uncomfortable sensations she proceeded thus you know miss emily that to the singular benevolence of mr charles hamilton i and my children are indebted for our daily bread we should now be worse than mendicants for mendicity has it is friendships alone in this metropolis god denied me one i considered myself as an outcast no relative to aid me with an assuasive word of consolation poverty was combined with despair my soul sickened my existence was poignant more than once my armed hand was raised to my breast but when my eye has sought to take a final farewell of my children the weapon fell and the mother lived here mrs wilson burst into tears and her thick sobbings impeded her voice  dear mrs wilson said emily in emotion i believe your situation was as singular as the benevolence of mr charles his modesty studiously conceals his merits but no man who is uniformly benevolent can so far indulge his natural dispositions the voice of gratitude will utter the secrets of modest philanthropy he has felt for me here i too am his debtor but it is unknown to him he has seen me embarrassed and has delicately extricated he has seen me insulted and has silently protected it would have been generous to have protected a female but to have done this unknown to all but to her offender has in it something of the delicacy of those sensitive beings who in an age of romantic generosity were only alive to the impulse of heroism  mrs wilson was now more composed and this voluntary applause bestowed on her friend cheered and animated a soft smile brightened her tears like a sunbeam gilding a watery cloud she said perhaps miss emily you have observed mr charles of late how exanimate how pallid how melancholy  he has told me said emily he is unwell  alas replied mrs wilson he thinks he never can be well sleepless nights and feverish days if they cannot rapidly annihilate the source of life press down it is elasticity and wear away slowly but surely it is springs never expect more to see him other than he is his malady is in his silence and he will prefer that silence to his health he perishes without the little consolation of saying i perish enamoured of his malady he smiles in his sufferings  explain yourself exclaimed emily earnestly and tremblingly  i must first continued mrs wilson assure you that mr charles sometimes in the native simplicity of his heart confides circumstances which he would not expressly mention if my gratitude had not taught me to study him minutely to catch every variation of his tones every expression of his gestures every distant combination of a casual word i had to this moment like others only perceived that his health decayed while the cause would have been mantled over in the most resolute concealment like you miss emily in his residence he is unfortunate you alike feel the tortures of a splendid dependence similar in your sentiments you are similar in your sufferings if you mutually look into your own hearts you will see that of the other  a quick blush covered the face of emily warm as the first suffusion of an early passion  and now miss balfour when i venture to say that with diffidence but with ardour he loves you must i be censured for unburthening a truth that has long oppressed my heart who in this world are dear to me but my children and yourself and mr charles rest only assured that he knows not of my coming here and suspects not that i have discovered the concealed source of his infelicity did i not know him the noblest of men i should not have addressed myself now to the most amiable of women gratitude would not have exacted my disturbance of your repose pardon me then if i have acted erroneously it is the error of respectful affection  emily paused was distressed and raveled her network i know not how to reply she said my dear mrs wilson i have the highest regard for mr charles not to value him would show myself worthless i owe him much he is the only friend i have of his sex but when i assure you that i never felt more than respect for the masculine character i speak with my wonted sincerity the passion of love has never molested my quiet i never could love any man but my father i loved him because he was great and unfortunate but the friendships of my own sex form the only social pleasures i can receive from another there is no delicacy none of the tender and melting features of nature in man if my father had not been my father even him i should have thought severe as for myself i have found some relief lady belfield has given me an invitation to reside with her during an absence of miss millions from town believe me when i say that the friendship of her ladyship an amiable and accomplished woman yields a careless untempered joy a fearless happiness which the severity of man can never communicate  name not lady belfield cried mrs wilson with energy and emotion i must not further prolong my visit but dear miss emily remember that charles hamilton will be silent but must love i conjure you not to notice to him that i have mentioned his name to you on this delicate discovery never perhaps would he pardon and his displeasure would render the life i owe him loathsome  she quitted the fair emily and left her absorbed in those tender trepidations of the mind when with halfreluctant halfassenting emotions the earliest flame of passion breaks from the heart where it lay concealed and unfelt to diffuse itself over the form to sparkle in the eye to bloom in the feature to melodize the voice and to polish the air while nature seconding the innocent embarrassment bewitches the lover by calling forth those newborn charms more fatal to his repose than those he traced ere his mistress knew her first amorous thought  but the severe fortune of charles doomed that this first amorous thought was never known to him and instead of charming it terrified the cradle of love is wreathed by the graces and the music of hope pours its fascinating sound but to our hero love was nursed by the furies and the melodies of hope were exchanged for the mysterious reproaches and the averted face of his emily  chapter xxiv the punishment continued when the crime has ceased when mrs wilson had quitted the fair emily and was passing through the hall one of the footmen familiarly addressed her and was on the point of forcing her to an embrace when violently bursting from his arms in an agony of horror she exclaimed and has it come to this  she rushed from the door  body of me cried the footman why the old dame thinks i dont know her again she has gone off for all the world like a modest woman so the holbornhill madam is miss emilys good friend birds of a feather i warrant are intelligence for mrs bully  let us follow the miserable and humiliated wilson she reached home without a perception of having issued from the house of miss million the hall and the footman were fixed in her imagination a repeated gesture seemed as if she was continually shrinking from his touch she writhed in tortures her face was now reddened by the deepest shame and soon succeeded an ashy horror over every feature as soon as she had reached her house she hurried to her chamber threw herself on the bed and spoke incoherently in an agony of spirits father of mercies is mercy alone denied to me is not an error washed away by tears like mine no i had not endured thy final punishment i see there was a degree of misery yet reserved for me sharper than the secret sting that lay in my heart when i was a prostitute my shame was reserved for myself there was no friend to reproach no perdition to the cherished feelings of social affection no one marked me i sinned no i only erred in peace children children what have ye not cost me what now will ye cost me shall i curse ye shall i abandon ye have ye not extended your mother on the slowest rack of agony  poor children ye are innocent i alone am guilty heaven decrees that the punishment shall endure when the crime has past shall i murmur to taste the bitterness my own hands have prepared now wherever i wander wherever i fix the finger of scorn will point at me a low a miserable prostitute a fever shakes my frame cruel retrospection i thought myself reinstated in virtue and comfort  one stroke of accident destroys my eternal peace this footman  the idea is insupportable  my shame is promulgated  miss emily must at length know me the wretch i am wise was her fathers counsel that sincerity is wisdom what we conceal today may appear tomorrow explanation has come too late for the blush it would have cost me i now must give the pang that shall endure with life she surely addressed herself to me to claim the elucidation of my mysterious history o torture i will fly into the country i will seek some chance servitude i will perish and no one shall know where the wretched wilson dies  this then is the suspended punishment of heaven i tasted bitterness i feed on gall my children my children if ye perish ye cannot reproach your delirious mother  it is your country your god decrees it  leaving this victim of her own error and of public prejudice we return to the house of million as soon as the footman who had more than once known her in her degrading character entered the servants hall he informed the coachman that the dame of holbornhill had just passed from the apartment of emily and that she flung out as proud as if she had been a modest woman the coachman related the circumstance to his very good friend the cook without extenuating or setting down aught in malice in these cases the imaginations of men are not apt to prove so fertile as those of the women for reasons known assuredly to an observer of human nature the cook embellished it the chambermaid refined it while mrs bully gave it the beginning the middle and the end so severely exacted by the great aristotle in the composition of an epic and here we must observe that lying is the eloquence of the vulgar to affect and persuade the human passions requires a forcible emotion of the soul for a gentle emotion like the flat uniformity of a sleeping sea cannot please long we must storm the mind poets and orators will therefore best succeed in taking possession of the attention of their readers and auditors because they alike are skilful in amplification which in truth is nothing but lying an exact representation would not affect we should not long read a poem or listen to an oration which had nothing but the simplicity of truth of this the vulgar are sensible although the cause is concealed there are no greater liars than the vulgar for experience has taught them the utility of lying they employ augmentatives or diminutives as they desire to excite a correspondent feeling and the vulgar are without knowing it great poets and orators  the cook mentioned that a vile strumpet known to john and miss emily had just gone out the chambermaid that miss emily and john were acquainted with all the strumpets in town and mrs bully hurried to mr million to assure him that it was now high time to speak out that miss emily was only fit company for women of the town and was concerned with john that she herself had seen in her possession an abominable book and was besides a professed arian  well well it is just what i thought exclaimed mr million taking the lord knows who into the house of a bank director because she was an old blind lieutenants daughter i shall have all the daughters of the old knights of windsor curse her harp twanging in my ears that makes me as melancholy sometimes as a fall of stocks he hastened to miss million who certainly was singularly shocked with the intelligence considering that she already had heard it from betty two hours before and was then quietly dosing over the last new novel  my dear father cried miss million i am all of a tremor my poor nerves it is shameful not fit to be told pray call in john accuse him before me let me hear all that has past it will be in the papers tomorrow if mr libel should hear it millionhouse will be scandalized a footman  john being summoned related his simple story and reduced the epical lie of mrs bully to a mere assurance that the person who had issued from miss emilys apartment was a common prostitute  miss million being now alone sent in for emily and began thus miss when i suffered you to make portmansquare your asylum it was from my benevolence emily trembled but you have abused my goodness and instead of the girl you was at exmouth i find you are the associate of a low prostitute  emily pale and alarmed cried heavens what do you mean tell me i beseech you quickly  your alarm and your tremor are extremely adroit performed to admiration why one would think to look at you you really trembled but it is the profession of your friend one might imagine that you did not know who was the person who called on you this morning  her name is wilson she let lodgings to my father  i dare say she lets lodgings she is well known in this family a very chere amie of johns you will have the kindness to quit millionhouse as early as you can i need not recommend you a lodging so saying she hummed a tender opera air and left emily in the parlour motionless and silent  at length sensation revived to consciousness she now relieved her oppressed heart in one of those little monologues her innocence had rendered habitual  then are my fathers suspicions verified all that he said how severe how true what confidence can we bestow on our associates friendship how thy name is abused simplicity how thy air is mimicked this wicked woman  charles too  they must be united she is employed by him for the purpose of seducing me every mystery is now revealed he was frequently quoting thomsons boundless confidence of soul  so too did the licentious sedley she was unwilling to part with me at first she now offers me a refuge in her house she would even change her residence to receive me this day she told me that charles loved me  hypocrite how have i escaped your toils and charles too refined dissembler does he deceive me whose image my fancy cherished next to my fathers he protected me from dandelion  i thought it generous i find it mean  he would reserve me for his prey oh emily poor deserted girl i feel now as if the whole earth had conspired against me where shall i fly  to these arms exclaimed vaurien as he entered the parlour throwing himself at her feet your face miss emily is covered with tears refuse me not the consolation of uniting mine not a tear on your face but melts on my heart tell me your distresses accept my little aid i have heard some abrupt effusions of sorrow i cannot live and forget them  emily confused hesitating and deeply sobbing had lost her voice her fine auburn tresses fell in disorder on her face and her neck she raised two dewy eyes to heaven the tears fell and glittered on her hair she looked a magdalen of guido vaurien with gentleness placed her in a chair he knelt took her hand imprinted a fervid kiss she had not even the presence of mind to resist or to perceive his improper attitude the image of her father was before her she gazed in a silent agony of imagination her tears were renewed vaurien was emboldened by her insensibility  at this instant charles slung open the door  he uttered an audible ejaculation emily started where am i she cried is it you sir and she darted a glance of anger and horror  think it is no one replied charles quickly and hurried from the room  deceiver murmured emily she covered her face with her hands and sat absorbed in grief vaurien composed his attitude and stood near her chair such was the confusion of emilys mind that few traces of what had occurred left their impressions on her recollection the entrance of charles had revived her anger and her fear when she turned her eyes on vaurien she looked with kindness she considered that his presence had proved her protection  vaurien caught the instant change do me the honor miss balfour of suffering my assistance what occasions this great distress  you see before you the most miserable of her sex a woman without a friend  say not so adorable miss emily whoever knows you must be your friend and if a softer name would not offend there is who would only live to preserve it  alas sir you mean not to irritate a spirit already wounded i have hung ever the verge of destruction blindly feebly yet boldly o were my father living angel in heaven art thou insensible to the voice of thy daughter on earth thou did open to her the volume of her fate and now can thy paternal tenderness not reach thy miserable wanderer  dear miss emily your imagination is disturbed calm the vehemence of feeling inform but do not agitate me  mr vaurien you perhaps can inform me you know where i lodged with my father the woman says it is to you and mr charles she owes her existence  ah miss emily replied vaurien turning aside his head it is a delicate subject let your silence spare my feelings  nay dear sir i must say more much more you must tell me all if you would be my friend miss million has this moment told me that that woman    is a low prostitute  vaurien spared her the words  and you sir have protected her said emily quickly  she is the friend of charles continued vaurien i knew nothing of her common charity makes no distinctions among it is first claimants i prefer assisting the worthless rather than to chill the warmth of my heart by enquiries which may delay too late the succor due to the worthy  generous man and is it then true i know nothing of human nature i thought her a suffering angel  native goodness i repeat she is an infamous woman charles is her friend i will never more enter that house but surely they have not molested your tranquillity  o much much cried emily o delusion of the heart heaven and my father surely protected me this woman had such facile tears on her face such unobtrusive goodness such concealed merits there is a refinement in depravity i thought till now that the wicked affected an ostentatious virtue  trust mesaid vaurien lady belfield has a just esteem for your character her house is open to you  chapter xxv the misery of shame without guilt a novel species of authorship vaurien when he met charles on his return rallied him for his abrupt departure from emily she is a finished coquette said he when you are present but alone she is one of those dangerous girls with overflowing hearts who are apt to throw us off our guard you witnessed her charming disorder twas lucky you entered a glance invites her a word possesses her she is now coming to lady belfield a chaste pair of doves to be yoked to the car of venus could you imagine that the female character is so deceptive but deception is their occupation and their amusement their utile and their dulce  charles listened with horror and shuddered with reflection vaurien dropped several obscure hints of former interviews with emily and exhibited such confirmed familiarity and offered to share her favors with such friendly confidence that charles recollecting the visible delight which emily took in all the conversations of vaurien and that disdainful glance with which she harrowed his soul when he broke in while vaurien was at her feet blamed his precipitation of passion and contracted discernment concluded the gaul to be the favored lover and suspected the purity of emily  ah my friend he cried would i were but banished from this house patiently i cannot suffer one whom i revered as an angel to become before my eyes an associate for lady belfield to view her will be hourly to revive regrets which suppressed by absence may slowly die away existence becomes a torture in her presence   tres bien said vaurien musing  in the mean while lady belfield had made exact enquiries relative to mrs wilson nor did johnson the old friend of charles hesitate to give into her ladyships idea of the entire transaction so prone are the best men to decide by appearances his lordship had been already prepared to unite with lady belfields measures and a few days after the above conversation with vaurien charles found on his table a note from her ladyship in her own handwriting containing a final dismission her ladyship laid considerable stress on his offensive and degrading connections  mrs wilson cried charles will herself vindicate this undeserved obloquy  at this moment the following letter was brought from this unfortunate woman   my dear sir scarcely can my scattered thoughts collect to address you i have settled my affairs the sum you so benevolently assisted me with will accompany this i have taken my departure i fly i know not whither  i forget to acquaint you with the distressing circumstance that involves my ruin the hateful character in which once i rather erred than sinned carries it is punishment when the crime has long ceased no human benevolence can now efface from my heart the indelible degradation i have mentioned to you that to miss emily i revealed all my history excepting that humiliating period when your hand prompted alone by charity snatched me from so many nightly horrors yes i concealed this hideous feature of my life could miss emily have embraced a prostitute and yet from this small failure of sincerity i derive this agony of mind which attaches the misery of turpitude and shame while i can think  i waited on her will you forgive me to reveal your state of mind which you do not even suspect i know but could i see you perish in silence yes sir the eye of gratitude secretly studied your every gesture your every interrupted idea your every evanescent aspiration gratitude watched and divined your heart emily has traced you in some concealed offices of kindness her voice told her gratitude her blushes her love            it is at intervals i write  i was recognized by a servant  my face glows my hand trembles my tongue is parched a fever preys on my vitals others will tell you of my shame heaven has set it is mark on my face and i wander a female cain a terrible thought flies and returns to my imagination  shall a mother be a murderer an instant would make my children angels yes fearlessly could i raise to the father of all mercies an arm of blood the blood of my children would to my god tell not of the cruelty but of the chastisement and the contrition of their mother            it was but phrensy the agony of thought which oerleaps all bounds when the heart is exhausted the feelings are quiet i have just pressed the dear children to my bosom heaven surely directed every intendering look every winding embrace the eye of infancy the kiss of childhood can compose the perturbed heart of maternal despair how wondrous and how secret are the impulses of nature in the existence i loath i feel an enjoyment in when i seem to live for them my heart worn with age and sorrow beats then warm with youth and pleasure  i fly from london  ah should i be found perishing think of the survivors with their mothers crimes they stand unconnected they are the children of virtuous parents for i was a virtuous wife although a criminal mother farewell generous youth ever shall i be as grateful as i must be miserable  elizabeth wilson   most unfortunate of her sex cried charles her life points a moral it is a lesson for the times a dereliction from chastity is punished with excessive severity and unjust punishments produce real crimes woman must resist the combined attacks of love that passion which our modes of education and our manners have taught her to think is the important occupation of life but the negligence of a parent an accidental occurrence an unsuspicious moment a wandering of sensibility a refined intrigue the certitude of confidence and the fondness of affection overpower or inveigle that moral sentiment which otherwise would have persevered in it is habitual duties woman requires therefore a more energetic fortitude than even man but fortitude is masculine and a female stands unprotected amidst the illusions of her heart but when the hateful life of prostitution is derived merely from the indigence and despair of virtue it is still chastised with the same torture the domestic porch of peace is for ever closed such unhappy wanderers are inured to viciousness by our barbarous and unrelenting accusations a wise and philosophical regulation of the illustrious frederick prohibited under severe penalties the aspersion of that female who had returned to the arms of her friends and to the renewal of those domestic virtues which she had suspended rather than deserted how long will philanthropy tranquilly gaze on a vast multitude of females perishing in youth  poor wilson thou art no criminal  and yet thou were a prostitute child of sensibility thy heart would burst at the accusation thou did rush in the darkness of the night to feed thy perishing children  thou could not have been a prostitute in the blaze of day and i who would not suffer a widow and her children to perish in the streets am now involved in her apparent criminality johnson censured me for having formed disgraceful connections and to her ladyship i can now no more refer this unhappy fugitive he who aids unfortunate virtue for this woman is most virtuous popular prejudice decrees as a participator in a libertinism he abhors  and emily then knows my passion and has so long deceived mrs wilson  the flower that is covered with the virgin dews of innocence can then conceal a young and foul serpent yes her i have seen vaurien i have heard her infuriate glance shivered my frame yet can i never forget her i loved her when i thought her virtuous and i now must mourn her as if a sudden death had deprived me of her whom i loved the pleasures of life are not for me i will sit by the side of their tomb and think of the departed happiness it holds  he now framed a respectful reply to lady belfield related the nature of his connection with mrs wilson and lamented that her abrupt flight must render his conduct mysterious when he quitted the house vaurien conversed with him in a tenderness of tone that seemed as if he were shedding tears and he insisted on his accepting a liberal loan to assist him in his pursuits  old friendships that have been interrupted rather through inattention than pride are in adversity viewed by an eye that clouded with a tear gives a peculiar tenderness to the object on which it reverts charles flew to johnson and poured in his honest ear the change of his fortunes johnson repeated his old observation on the danger of bad connections however he continued trust me that lady belfield has some concealed reason for this dismission she cannot conscientiously object to any form of intrigue i respect your silence but it instructs me and what now think you of your friend vaurien  charles replied he is the most engaging of men and the most tender of friends my honorable connections would have set me afloat on the wide sea of life without mast or rudder the prompt kindness of vaurien supplies the ungentleness of fortune he has voluntarily lent me a considerable sum of money which i refused but for his acceptance of my bond  so then observed johnson after instilling in you an abhorrence for your dependence on lord belfield the adroit gaul has induced you to depend solely on his generosity  charles with warmth replied you ever condemn in vaurien those actions which you would praise in another  yes i have learnt young friend that virtue is not always implied by actions of virtue does that sound paradoxical i must even say that the criminal is often virtuous for as a vicious character may think proper to perform the duties of virtue so may the virtuous character be pressed into the commission of crimes it abhors but it cannot shun  and there exclaimed charles you have described mrs wilson  charles now communicated his dispositions to adopt some literary avocation and soliciting johnsons opinion he replied as follows  if you desire to be distinguished as a genius of the first class in some honorable province of literature whatever may be your parts and abilities you are too poor at least by several hundreds a year a finished genius in this age is the labor of half a century a writer now blooms at forty and flowers at sixty we require in this age of taste such hewings and such polishings so much of the axe and so much of the file and so much fillagree work that i consider no writer out of leading strings before thirty supposing that then he has been carefully swaddled nurtured with the most delicate pap and eternally humoured in what relates to place connections domestic habits coincidences accidents and a crowd of ceteras which you will find numbered one by one in helvetius i see clearly now that we shall have no more any men of genius for after all these pains in which i am sure no mortal must expect to be successful the most inconsiderable accident or omission may spoil the whole man of genius as poor tristram was ruined by the want only of a windowpulley  our great authors write little and write rarely and exhibit nothing of genius but in their compositions i have been in company with two of our finest poets four of our great historians a dozen of our fanciful novelists and they were as solemn and as dull as a court of aldermen when there is no business to transact the fire of genius has become quite of a culinary nature an immense fire raised for the moment for the preparation of some delicious repast but when that is performed the saving housewife screws up the sides takes out the coals and leaves it in an ordinary dimension  you may acquire however a subsistence in literature if you are tolerably ingenious i confide a secret the man you see before you has obtained money by his literary performances as if he were the first genius of the age  you surprise i only knew the name of one johnson on the roll of modern same  it shall not be my fault replied johnson if you ever see another several literary men of the day have sold their works by a mistake of the public concerning names but i have some honesty and more delicacy i am a nameless writer but my productions have names my occupation is to adjust to arrange to rescind and to ramify somebody brings me a solid glutinous drop and my pen becomes diluent i am furnished with the raw materials and then i weave silk cotton or worsted at the order of my employer i lardoon meagerness sir i am the writer which you see is no synonime of author of a library i have written travels into russia tours into scotland embassies to china an earls philosophical essays a baronets economical researches a doctors history and a counsellors reports i am the venerable parent of a dozen as chopping literary boys as walk this town you know this is an age of authors and you perceive one of the reasons it is just my employers whose heads may be as bald as caesars should wear their laurels or their literary false hair for as the epigram says they swear it is their own hair  and so it is for i know where they bought it you were surprised the other evening that sir alexander appeared to forget in conversation the principles of his own book but i assure you sir alexander never read his own book the origin of this occupation not so singular as it seems was owing to this circumstance i was a writer in a review and whenever i examined a work composed by a gentleman i made most alarming strictures on the necessity of a knowledge of philosophical grammar which no gentleman can be supposed to know and i recommended an application to some man of letters who might be no gentleman yet a philosophical grammarian no one comprehended what i meant by the words philosophical grammar but they were formidable confusing and alarming every month i repeated the urgent necessity of philosophical grammar gentlemen were frightened applied to the printer who gave my address and since that time i have been a philosophical grammarian and having sufficient employment not a word now appears concerning the necessity of philosophical grammar  charles now placed himself under the eye of this secret artisan of literary works and perceived that where invention and imagination are not required an author writes on in sunshine and in rain in gaiety and in sadness and with a mechanical pen forms a mechanical book  chapter xxvi the platonist among the characters selected by vaurien as persons whose talents and dispositions seemed adapted to coalesce with his general views by some peculiar bias of their own was an original enthusiast who in this history we shall denominate the platonist  he resided in a romantic part of scotland and had now arrived in town to attend the progress of a great work on polytheism he accounted it as a favor of the gods to have been enabled to subsist in that cheap country there he found a picturesque landscape surrounding a cottage retaining an antique aspect it was indeed formed from the small remains of an abbey and what is supposed to have been a watchtower still stands at the extremity of his garden and there he placed his library there abstracted from all things and all men he reads plato and homer and views nothing but the skies  his cottage is at the entrance of a deep forest and the windows command a view of the high road a circumstance that occasions him much anxiety and he wishes that the cottage could only have been viewed by the gods his life is solitary but most poetical yet we can hardly deem that a solitude which is graced by the society of a beauty romantic sensitive and happy he has a set of very singular companions a great variety of animals and birds his mornings are consecrated in the watchtower to homer and plato the afternoons he gives to what he calls a conversation with his mute friends in the evening he wanders in the forest explaining plato to his lovely companion and concludes the night with a hearty supper and with the undisturbed rapture that flows from a heart that beats in unison with his own  at school he formed this devotion for homer and a pedant inspired a poet it was owing to the accidental literary bigotry of his master and his incessant reverence of that poet which was not prompted by the ardour of taste but by the frenzy of verbal criticism the bust of homer was placed over his chimneypiece the head of homer was engraven on his seal and in his hours of sadness he consoled himself with an homerical verse and in his hours of merriment he toasted the old meonian by pouring a generous libation to his memory the infatuation of the master was communicated to the scholar but the impressions were of a more delicate and sublime nature in one it was the impotent extravagance of a frigid verbalist but in the other it became a debauchery of sensibility breaking from a most inflammable and abstruse imagination he had unfortunately plunged deeply into the commentaries of certain platonists who explain homer into allegories discover celestial systems and convert the iliad into a greek bible of the arcana of nature  when he quitted the school his mind was deeply tinctured by all the colorifications of the platonic prism he mused on the bewitching notion of universal beauty which pervades that enthusiastic philosophy but when at length he obtained a complete copy of platos works the intellectual malady diffused itself in every nerve of his mind and such was the conflict of his animal spirits that he could never read plato without violent palpitations of the heart and more than once such has been the agony of his sensibility that he fainted over the volume as he held it with a kind of religious tremor these indeed are the peculiar features of enthusiasm that abstraction of the imagination which roves amidst unknown scenes and gazes on poetical chimeras it is felt by poets in the fury of their orgasm by philosophers in the ideal fabrication of their systems and by mystics in their attempts to abstract themselves from earth to heaven  when we read the discoveries of another we acquire a spirit of discovery the imitative genius of man becomes every thing to which it is accustomed he read of a thousand fine meanings in plato and homer which he could never have imagined but having once imagined them he added a thousand more of his own a mind like his only requires the scattering of a small handful of seed to cover it is extensive and fertile soil with a vast efflorescence and like that happy climate that feels not the rigor of a changing season his mind was a year of one continued summer every day brought it is new discovery and every day was a day of triumph  like other inspired persons for he considered his delight as inspiration he now conceived it a duty to enlighten a dark and erring world all europe he cried is surrounded by a dismal night hence men are continually molesting each other and one man only impedes another while he himself is impeded he observed old religions decaying while modern sects were filthily spawned forth and lamely crawled from each antiquated and expiring monster he first communicated his notions to a private circle some considered them as the curiosities of a student of great learning some as the philosophical amusements and paradoxical vanities of a man of genius but few discerned that they were the delusions of a literary lunacy their doubts soon ceased when to the astonishment even of the learned world in this close of the eighteenth century were published two quarto volumes in which he avowed himself a platonist in it is most religious sense and in which he affected to prove that the christian religion was merely a bastardized and barbarized platonism the divinities of plato were the divinities to be adored and he affirmed that no people could be virtuous and happy if they were not taught to call god jupiter the virgin venus and christ cupid  it was now in vain to dissemble his friends attempted to reason but logic reforms no enthusiast an enthusiast cannot fail to gain his cause because he alone can be his own judge in vain the world opposed and worse than opposed neglected he was an atals for himself the solitary supporter of a system even too unreasonable to be adopted by philosophical reasoners and even too delusive to delight philosophical fanciers he knew he said he was the gemistus pletho of the age and he was content to the opposing world he therefore opposed plato and homer and he looked not in this barbarous age to be rewarded with a garland in the school of philosophy  he saw himself deserted but forgave the unkindness of men because he found himself consoled and indeed fully occupied by the humanity which he had discovered in other animals even this was mysterious for he darkly hinted that he was not a little versed in the language of beasts he lodged in his house a most numerous society on the stairs in his study from the garrets to the cellars and even to the very roofs were assembled a numerous retinue of the mute citizens of the world and he was observed to pass entire days in a very large aviary of birds  the platonic system had obtained him some admirers among the fair sex it was not ill adapted to their capacity for being incomprehensible it is mysteriousness irritated female curiosity and it was at least more sublime than disclosing an enigma or unfolding a charade it was pregnant with the dissolving energies of a delicious sentiment for what the platonist terms the science of universals is made to consist in universal beauty it was a homage to the sex he used sometimes to break out in expressions like these beauty walks silently on the extremities of it is feet alluring ravishing and raising all things by it is power it swims above the light of forms it covers the occult union of the gods the entire system was elegant and brilliant it exhibited only forms of symmetry and grace and the female attention that was once allured by the ideal perfection of an eternal beauty the image existing in the mind of the divine architect and became initiated into the platonic doctrine of ideas was soon entangled in a tissued net of silk and silver that adorned rather than perplexed the lovely captive where she sought a master she found a lover and entranced listened to the eloquence of diction the dazzling of metaphors the inexhaustible poetry and the infectious enthusiasm of a man who came recommended by many accomplishments of personal figure and by many graceful acquirements the platonist is a masterly musician a sublime poet and when warmed his voice is melodious his eye is illuminated by quick intelligence his face takes all the changes of his soul every gesture is adapted to every sentiment and like the cumean sybil he looks the image of inspiration his usual style on these subjects shows all the art of poetry without it is labor he pours forth an opulence of diction and his copious periods roll with magnificence as if he were reading an english imitation of ciceros manner with felicitous expression he intenders by pathetic sentiment and charms by the gaiety of exuberant imagery even his mystic unintelligibility becomes a grace it serves as a resting place to repose the mind that has followed him in his elevations and they who are not void of imagination lament when the platonist closes his voluble and enchanting elocution  he had long sighed to unite himself to a beautiful female on whose bosom he might meditate in rapture and reverie solitude deprived of such a companion presented nothing to his sensitive soul but a desolation of the passions the beasts and birds with all his vaunted knowledge of their language he confessed were not equivalent to the absence of this inestimable associate among men he could find no companions for such was the extreme irritation of his sensations that his mind had refined itself to a feminine delicacy it was appalled by serious expostulation and shrunk in horror from coarse merriment in explaining the principle of beauty he found consolers and admirers among the women but he discovered no female whom he could select from all the world for to a congenial disposition and a singular beauty of person he required what is still more rare an intimate knowledge of greek  except a total ignorance of greek charlotte fenton was the nymph of his soul nature had cast them in the same mould but a diversity of education had provided different materials to store their imagination from childhood she had lived in a rural solitude studious of works of the most extravagant fancy and all the day and part of the night were consumed in a little circle of magic from which she never issued she walked fearless on the utmost verge of romantic fiction with all works of reasoning she was disgusted her logic consisted in sentiment and from the impoverished narratives of history where all men to her eye seemed dwarfs she roved to the gigantic heaven of homer who though somewhat disguised in the versions of pope were to her still heroes she read with avidity the ancient romances of amadis de gaul and feasted on the six folios of perce forest the arabian tales were not disapproved and spenser was the most modern poet she read but when our platonist opened the vast scene of his philosophical fancy her curiosity flew with a hundred wings she gazed in mute astonishment and sat hours in silent meditation  but the divine greek was the only language by which he could communicate his sensations she entreated his instruction and they had scarcely advanced to the third book of the iliad when the delighted platonist thus proposed a new system of life   the ancient philosophers he said when they felt the impulse of divine energies quitted the tumultuous habitations of men we must frustrate the magic of circe and bid adieu to the detaining arms of calypso for many years must we be exercised in the cathartic virtues for the purpose of separating as much as possible the soul from the dark folds of the body and then at length when we have destroyed the tyranny of the passions those baneful suitors which had so basely revelled in the palace of the soul we shall enjoy the delightful beams of science and wisdom till becoming established like ulysses in our paternal port like him we shall be united with our father from whose embraces we have been so long unhappily torn away we shall find the lyre of true philosophy on the banks of lethe there let us pass away our lives in blissful contemplations and in listening to divine harmony secluded from the base multitude of mankind  and this my lovely charlotte has been the only resource of the enlightened and pious ancients either we must travel or retreat for the delusions of modern religions are an impiety to the gods pythagoras and plato the interpreters of nature considered it as necessary for the acquirement of knowledge to traverse many seas and inhabit many countries but for traveling we have no money euripides composed his tragedies in a cave democritus his philosophy in a sequestered spot demosthenes became an orator by the shores of the sea and numa consulted the nymph egeria in silence and in solitude even the imitators of these great men moses jesus and mahomet alike retired at stated intervals to arrange their systems atheistical as they are the presence of the gods is only visible in solitude archimedes heard not the falling walls of his city carneades at his meals forgot to eat so that he had nearly been famished in his own house and what think you of that philosopher who deprived himself of his sight that he might not be disturbed in his sublime contemplations by intervening objects and that other who lest he might be tempted to issue from his studious retreat shaved half of his head that it might hinder him from appearing in the world for in that platonic age no wigs were worn  i languish for retirement that i may compose a life of homer of whom nothing is known and finish my platonic commentary on our divine poet i have calculated the verses arranged the materials and the daily labor of three years will establish a system which shall endure with the elements it describes does venus inspire my charlotte to relinquish the atheists of an unplatonic world and to soar to the mysteries of the divine geometrician  such was the conversation of the platonist who discovered that venus had inspired they sought the romantic spot we have described and the time now arrived when they were sent back to the world enriched by the life of homer and the copious discoveries of our platonist to renovate the age of astraea when polytheism was to form an universal religion  chapter xxvii vaurien visits the platonist the language and manners of animals the silent voice of gesture however visionary to some may appear the reveries of the platonist so unsettled are the opinions of most philosophical men on the interesting topic of religion for every popular creed has been examined with severity or ridicule that sensible of the beneficial influence of some prevalent system they have long sought and are still seeking for some new religion which founded on the invariable principles of nature shall offer to all people an universal opinion thus that even the most rigid philosopher may appear amidst the popular worship with a hand of reverence and a heart of piety while the sacerdotal robe shall no more disguise the most eminent religious hypocrite  polytheism as explained by the researches of the learned and by the fancies of the visionary is allegorised till it becomes a system of natural philosophy the gods are but the elements and they therefore still exist visible and palpable campanella was of opinion that the world and the elements had sensation because that which is composed of them has sensation and nothing can be in the effect which is not in the cause see bail article campanella  it is also now considered by some that a revival of the notion of the demigods or heroworship would serve as a noble engine of that immortality which forms the passionate devotion of elevated minds the erection of a pantheon the following extracts from the monthly reviews on this novel extravagance of platonism i transcribe being doubtful whether otherwise the greater part of what is here written on the subject will not appear incredible  there are some who aim to place the heathenism of greece as interpreted by the platonists among the religions publicly taught in temples and professed in society we fear it is not to be ranked among the harmless dreams of literary caprice we have heard reports of some persons being willing to incur expense for opening a pantheon in honor of the benefactors and instructors of society m r vol xvii     new series  this is the right age for making such platonical impressions there is a debility of intellect which succeeds to excessive inquiry whose morbid craving the platonic opinions are admirably calculated to gratify after the age of reason was past they found savor with the mindsick inhabitants of athens and alexandria of rome and constantinople and are likely once more to accompany the progress of european declension vol xiv      in modern italy many persons have given into these chimaeras and the theurgists have been excited the jealousy of ecclesiastical authority vol xvii     in this metropolis is in some circles a favorite object the platonist terms this edifice a place for commemorating the ascent of excellent demons to worship such men would be only adoring some particular virtue and perpetuating by our piety the virtue we adore every human virtue forms an attribute of the divinity and the creator would be reverenced while we felt and confessed his attribute in his creature  the age seems propitious to every species of fanaticism skepticism spreads rapidly and superstition gathers new energy to oppose skepticism established opinions are too moderate for either hence religion breaks into sectarism and philosophy divides into systems extravagance wrestles with extravagance the imagination wanders astonished and halfdelighted but calm sense looks around and retires in horror religion and philosophy have become two gladiators one departs not without destroying the other yet who shall be certain that one alone will triumph two gladiators have sometimes perished together by their mutual aim  one of the favorite projects of vaurien was an antichristian hope to overthrow the religion of jesus he therefore associated with all those whose talents or power would cooperate with this intention he desired to overturn christianity not because it was a system of religion but a system of opulence he was no enemy to the new testament but to the bench of bishops vaurien had also another reason for his hatred of christianity it is principles were too peaceful too selfmortifying and too enervating but the present times are as sanguinary as those of any former period and we do not see why some should so much dislike christianity for these causes since christians are now as ferocious cutthroats as those of ancient times be it as it may vauriens idea of christianity appears in the following pensee of beaumelle p     paganism accustoming men to ferocity by sanguinary sacrifices in deifying great generals and courageous citizens their wise legislators inspired a love of liberty christianity in only showing sacrifices without blood in putting softness in the human character canonising obscure persons detached from worldly interests gives them a spirit of obedience christianity talks too much of heaven to induce much attachment to the objects of the earth and by inculcating submission to monarchy is an enemy to all reasoning  he had formed a strict intimacy with the platonist and now visited him to stimulate his industry in the promulgation of polytheistical publications  when he arrived at his house the lovely charlotte informed him that the platonist was then occupied at his prayers in chaunting a noonday hymn to apollo you then said vaurien do not unite in his prayers charlotte replied i hold apollo in no esteem because of his ill usage of daphne we women are willing to be won but not to be forced it is cruel to persecute what we cannot subdue venus is my protector  vaurien looked languishingly on charlotte and exclaimed venus likewise is the goddess of young men i worshipped her in the remains of her temple in greece good gods cried the romantic charlotte thou then art my amiable brother the first i have met who has paid due reverence to my divinity the platonist is mindless of her daily orisons were we but in her temple to perform her rites as herodotus describes  all heaven all earth is her temple exclaimed vaurien and sure the blushes that breathe like roses on that cheek the liquid brilliancy of those eyes the soft heavings of that bosom proclaim the presence of the divinity  ah said charlotte you are the first man who ever joined me in a votive testimony to venus  by this time the platonist had concluded his long hymn to apollo vaurien now ascended with difficulty at the bottom of the stairs was a large kennel of dogs of various nations who lived in a good understanding with each other excepting when a bone was thrown among them for then the dogs behaved like men that is they mangled and tore each other to pieces with sagacity and without remorse monkeys and apes were chained on the banisters a little republic of cats was peaceably established on the first landing place he passed through one room which was an aviary and another which was an apiary  from the cieling of the study of the platonist depended a polished globe of plated glass which strongly reflected the beams of the sun amidst this aching splendour sat the platonist changing his seat with the motions of his god so that in the course of the day he and the sun went regularly round the apartment he was occupied in constructing a magic lanthorn which puerile amusement excited the surprise of vaurien  the platonist accounted for it my dissertation on the eleusinian mysteries is not all understood the whole machinery reflected on a white sheet will be more intelligible than any i could give on a sheet of paper in the presence of the gods in the most holy of the mysteries demons appeared with the heads of dogs pletho says this who lived a thousand years after the mysteries then i have omniform and terrific monsters then the demiurgus the progress of purgation inspection crowning torchbearing and finally friendship with the gods but here is the great difficulty how shall i represent the intolerable effulgence of the divine light much it grieves me that for this sublime purpose a candle and a piece of colored tin are all i can get into the lanthorn the gods are not always favorable to my attempts after long experiments i conceived i had discovered the perpetual sepulchral lamp of the ancients last week i invited my friends to a philosophical lecture on my perpetual lamp i triumphed in my discovery but ere my lecture closed my lamp was suddenly extinguished good gods  vaurien condoling with him on the imperfection of all human representations of the divinity and the extinction of a perpetual lamp enquired the reason for his singular attachment to the mute creation here the platonist assumed a dignified air threw himself back in his chair to receive the full beams of the sun then musing raised his kindled eyes on vaurien and addressed him  to you whom i respect as the great reformer of the age who feel a piety for the gods and aid their solitary adorer i will unfold the inspirations of wisdom  know then that all men are brutes and all brutes are men at first their figuration appears materially different but it is not so in reality many brutes approach closely to the human form and among men many approach closely to the brutal form we have monkey faces bull heads asinine countenances spider legs and porpoise obesity and among females we have the face of a tygress catlike claws owllike screechings and serpentine involutions that they are not more minutely exact has absolutely arisen from the chance organization of nature but their passions their gestures and their propensities are the same  you will object that the brute creation has not made an equal progress in art and science with the human species but this i deny the brute creation are wiser than we they only cultivate those science which are of real utility to them take for instance the ape he is a perfect similitude of man the paws of an ape are much like our own why then you would say have apes not made an equal progress with man because and i speak from having lived among apes more than twenty years apes are not so susceptible of listlessness or ennui as ourselves les singes ne sont pas susceptibles de lennui quon doit regarder aninsi que je le prouverai dans le troisieme discourse comme un des principes de la perfectibilite de lesprit humain  helvetius lesprit vol i iv  gentile reader we do beseech thee to observe that the perfectibility of the human mind this fashionable phrase of our london philosophers is merely an obsolete fancy imported from france  an ape is never idle and always happy and justly has helvetius observed on this very topic that it is to this desire of activity we owe all the great actions of great men most men are despicable animals when by themselves a brute never all generals all poets all historians have become so through rank idleness a listless existence tortures so having nothing better to do the general sacks or massacres a town the poet writes his commemorating ode and the historian shall a thousand years afterward write you every particular and very often in the present tense  and this i affirm that in those arts and sciences which are of real utility to animals and birds they excel all mankind can the weavers loom spread the fineness of the spiders web can the architect build like the beaver sails the mariner like the nautilus and in domestic life can we skin fish like the cat clamber like the monkey and scent like the dog ask the swiss peasant who climbs and hangs securer on the sharp points of precipices himself or his chamois they have therefore in far greater perfection than ourselves that peculiar art or science they desire to excel in any we advise a man of genius to apply only to a single pursuit it is precisely what does every brute and therefore i aver that every brute is a man of genius  here the platonist paused and desired to exchange seats with vaurien as the sun had got round to him then with a collected air he resumed his discourse  to you the confident of my heart i reveal it is wondrous secret know then i have obtained the various languages of brutes with whom i converse by the hour i can convert my person into all forms my voice into all intonations  their language is precisely the same which men would employ in a similar predicament imagine to yourself a company of dumb men how would they converse evidently by gestures such is the language of animals gesture is a vocal silence an incorporated voice they too have their tones but their gestures are exercised with inconceivable perfection and by these they preserve a communication with their brother brutes i mean men they have few ideas but many sentiments are not logicians but passionate beings they feel exquisitely and yet they express all they feel  the emotions of gesture constitute a language far superior to that of vocal enunciation it is the spontaneous and universal language of nature our method of communicating our ideas is tedious imperfect and deceptive by gesture alone we can discover the involuntary feelings of the heart say do not the quick and flashing eye the cheek whose tints are fugitive the halfaverted mien the frown that breaks that passes but is not forgotten the look that refuses while the hand presents exhibit the personal dispositions the perturbed eye the walk now quick now slow of cataline showed in his distracted form the soul of conspiracy the unaltered mien the changeless peace of every motion of socrates who at home or abroad xantippe confessed never showed one ruffled feature did these not testify the regular current of his constant mind and the wretch with pliant features whom titus observed to turn aside the halfstifled laugh at the misfortunes of innocence while he gave abundantly causeless sighs and tears these indicated to titus the concealed villain in that young man said sylla speaking of caesar who walks so unmannerly along the streets i see several mariuses cicero relates of anthony that he frequently struck the ground with his knees by the vehemence with which he pleaded yes my friend as the bent bow is compressed with a double force the arrow is more impetuously darted it is an arrow driven by the storm of heaven that pierces where it touches who knew better of nature than cicero when he advised his brother that to be affable in his government he must do something more than invite to feasts nil interest habere otium apertum vultum clausum little it signifies to set your doors open if your face is closed we platonists have long known that gesture is the only language of the passions and that brutes possessing this in greater perfection than men employ a purer and more energetic language  and indeed the great campanella affirmed that beasts spoke to each other because they certainly understand each other for which simple observation the inquisition singed his beard and threatened to burn his body such was his divine knowledge of gesture that during his imprisonment of many years he tells us that he knew all the sentiments of his absent friends or enemies by mimicking all their gestures and taking all their postures some have had the temerity to affirm that he was a melancholy hypochondriac but burke tells you he has tried the experiment i have often observed that in mimicking the looks and gestures of angry or placid or frighted or daring men i have involuntarily found my mind turned to that passion whose appearance i endeavored to imitate our minds and bodies are so closely and intimately connected that one is incapable of pain or pleasure without the other burke on the sublime and beautiful p   0  and lavater cites it as an indubitable fact and are burke and lavater lunatics  and therefore on this curious topic how admirable is an observation of rousseau who seems to me to have been a true platonist in neglecting says he the language of signs which speak to the imagination we have lost the most energetic of languages the impression of words is always feeble and we speak to the heart much more forcibly by the eye than by the ear emile lib iv p       i am charmed said vaurien by this account of the language of beasts and assuredly you have made many curious observations on their national character and domestic manners  i have indeed long been a citizen of the vast republic of brutes and they have consoled me for the ingratitude of my own species how i lose my patience when i hear your great philosopher acknowledge the feelings of brutes to be more exquisite than those of men and then pronounce that their principle of motion though it seems determined by motives is merely mechanical and depends absolutely on their organization buffons natural history vol iii p     smellies translation  but buffon i am told only wrote on animals which is quite a different thing from conversing with them his sublime narrative of the camels journey through the deserts is unrivalled by modern eloquence but he himself never traveled through a desert and he is therefore a greater poet than a natural historian  ah my friend how enchanting is the simplicity of the domestic habits of brutes when i become a matchmaker between a dog and his female how i envy the short term of their courtship he is no coxcomb and she is no coquette he lingers not with cold compliments on the beauty of her colors her birth or her age he feels but one desire the multiplication of his species but then what sincerity in every gesture what vivacity in his eyes and with what tenderness his tongue caresses his beloved men are such eternal bablers in love or in rage but an animal simply evinces his passion by a single act is he revengeful he honestly bites is he affectionate he fervently licks he is never an assassin or an adulator  how have i admired the cool sagacity and magisterial air of a venerable furred longwhiskered tom sitting stately stretched voluptuously or quietly dosing by my winter fire sometimes he goes a hunting for a little recreation but his velvet sides are stuffed with that equability of humor which shows that his existence is his enjoyment nothing but a female cat can discompose his serene philosophy  mules because they will not submit to be tutored by us who are not equal to them in point of their ability after having carried the traveller on the slippery edge of precipices picking their way step by step and stopping when near danger when they arrive at home are beat and abused for their stubborness what wisdom in the mules what idiocy in the men some mules having been chased from a paddock never offered to return yet it was perceived that the grass had been eaten they watched and observed every night that they leapt over the fences and after their stolen feast returned to their adjoining field before the morning erasmus tells us he saw a dog that had been taught to convey meat in a basket from the shambles attacked by other dogs he would defend his masters property but when he saw his assailants too numerous he would then snatch a piece of the meat lest he should get nothing but blows and honor in the ruinous war  does not history present us with more numerous instances of the fidelity of dogs than of men like men of strong sensations their resentment is proportioned to their gratitude when i was at mountedgecumbe i saw a monument on which i gazed with awe it is raised to the memory of a huntsman who neglecting to feed his dogs for three days as soon as he entered was torn to pieces a dreadful howling spread through the whole society and feeling more sensibly the passion of vengeance than that of hunger they long left their victuals untouched when a dogbutcher at canton enters a street all the dogs pursue him in full cry when a kamtscadale loses his stick by which he drives the dogs of his sledge they instantly perceive it and run off as fast as possible to overturn him in the snow ill treat a dog he will long remember it and when you seek his reconciliation will preserve his dignity and make no advances while he knows the hand that now caresses once struck and shall we now say with buffon that these are only pieces of mechanism who merely derive their motion from their organization i confess it requires a patience which looks like sublimity to acquire a knowledge of their habits and language swammerdam passed ten long years extended on his belly to characterise the national genius of ants reaumur must have devoted as many to discover the various nidifications of birds and he indeed cleanly traced the manner in which they digested their food i myself have patiently watched through forty days and forty nights the nuptials of a frog  to touch but rapidly for i see the sun is declining on birds thomson has described the passion of the groves in mellifluous numbers worthy of plato and with a knowledge of their language as mavelous as his numbers  the language of birds is elliptical resembling the periods of tacitus little said much understood every species has a different intonation as every native of a large kingdom has his provincial dialect the voice of the raven is solemn of the dove mournful of the rook gay but awkward while the merry woodpecker loudly laughs and the fernowl serenades his mate at the moonlight oak  i could give you instances of a sublime maternal affection a rapid yet intricate invention a vigilant artifice in concealing some cherished abode heroic acts of sexual attachment and a spirit of sociality that if interrupted has an influence on the health the passions and the enjoyments of the friendly brute  delicate birds have their vanities as well as delicate people a goldfinch before a mirror is a perfect coquette she smooths her plumes as she sits on her perch and gazes with delight and if she is provided with a little bucket and chain she will draw it up and then look around that her ingenuity may not pass unobserved delicate birds have also an exquisite delicacy of passion the wild canary sooths with his song the dear connubial nest in the annals of my aviary shall it be recorded that one as he was singing suddenly dropped the unfinished song alarmed the female she slew from her breeding nest and sought her silent consort she pecked at her friend he was no more she stood beside him refused nourishment and gazed in silence till she died this curious fact is noticed by kaimes and is by no means improbable these exquisitely sensible birds appear to die frequently of sudden frights of three canaries i have known two found dead in their cage although apparently left well   such are the domestic manners and such the various conversations of these citizens of the world join to this the pythagorean system of metempsichosis established among the wise ancients and then judge of the awe and veneration i feel for this neglected portion of our fellows much it afflicts me when i hear the experimental philosophers consider themselves scientific when their ingenuity has invented the most exquisite tortures here one famishes a vulture to see how long it can exist without food a locust has it is intestines pulled out and filled with cotton then transfixed with a pin remains five months moving it is legs and it is antennae to the great satisfaction of the philosopher canine mothers big with their infants are anatomised alive to rip out the young who are born like so many macduffs aquafortis is dropped on a living animal to trace the entire progress of singeing blackening and burning the living flesh and two sparrows are starved to death to verify whether bruised seed or minced meat is best adapted to recover their almost extinct life good gods  vaurien having felicitated the platonist on the new world he had opened to himself said propose to overturn christianity by the publications of the platonists and to erect a pantheon that the gods may be honorably reverenced  that is my important pursuit i have already prepared the soaring and ecstatic olympiodorus the noble and obscure heraclius i join the asiatic luxuriancy of proclus divinely explained by jamblichus and profoundly delivered by plotinus plotinus who was surnamed intellect by his contemporaries such was the fervor of his mind that he was accustomed to write without attending to the orthography or the revision of his works which perhaps occasions their divine unintelligibility for the celestial vigor rendered him incapable of trifling concerns and he therefore committed them as fast as he wrote to porphyry who perhaps laboring under the same divine influence was equally incapable of orthography or sense  the platonist concluded this conversation with an invective of which the style appears to us so curious that we shall give the exact expressions as a specimen of the platonic effervescence in a ciceronian period   i have long perceived the ignorance and malevolence of christian priests from the most early fathers to the most modern retailers of hypocrisy and cant every intelligent reader must be alternately excited to grief and indignation to pity and contempt at the barbarous mythological systems of the moderns for in these we meet with nothing but folly and delusion opinions founded either on fanaticism or atheism inconceivably absurd and inextricably obscure ridiculously vain and monstrously deformed stupidly dull and contemptibly zealous apostolically delirious or historically dry and in one word such only as arrogance and ignorance could conceive impiety propagate and the vapid spirit of the moderns be induced to admit a dissertation on the eleusinian mysteries p       my dear platonist exclaimed vaurien if you can roll periods like these your genius will be rewarded by yourself being chosen by the nation to lay the first stone of a pantheon in london for the ascent of excellent demons  chapter xxviii a jewish philosopher a dissertation on the jews tending to prove that they should not be burnt another favorite project of vaurien was that of assembling the dispersed hebrews this impious project as a good catholic terms it was not peculiar to the political imagination of this gaul since among others two of his compatriots meditated the same design the marquis of langalerie at the commencement of this century disappointed at every court to which he resorted prepared to collect these fugitive asiatics in the isles of the archipelago a genius of a sublimer character the famous marechal saxe having merely missed possessing the empire of russia by his inconstancy in love solaced his ambition by a fanciful sovereignty over the wanderers of israel this project is of that inviting and plausible kind that it will never be extinct in the romantic and chimerical heads of some fervid adventurers but there exist opposing reasons in the character of this people which depending on principles in nature are irreversible the children of jacob are composed of all nations and cannot blend alike with the people among whom they reside as there are metals in nature which no chemical process can amalgamate with others  vaurien had made acquaintance with a jewish philosopher and called on him for the same purpose he had visited the platonist he found the jew at dinner eating porkchops and at the side of his plate lie open the jewish mendelsohns phaedon a sublime imitation of plato on the immortality of the soul the jew desired to conclude his meal quietly and proceeded in employing at once his teeth and his eyes but the head digests not like the mouth and the jew had now so violently abstracted his imagination that vaurien rose with impatience the philosopher then started from his reverie and lamenting that the sublimest conceptions were the obscurest closed his plato and listened to the gallic christian  how long shall philosophy exclaimed vaurien mourn over the degradation of the human species our great revolution ferments the spirits of all our european youth and of every friend to the rights of man france has emancipated the negroes france would emancipate the jews whenever the legislator violates the equality of nature the state appears to retain slaves but in reality it loses so many patriots i was present at one of the late earthquakes in italy the multitude were gazing on the ruins of a town the nobles sighed at the vestiges of their grandeur the opulent citizens mourned their buried fortunes a voice from the multitude broke the melancholy silence exclaiming now we are all equal a sublime and terrible truth unhappy is that country whatever be it is grandeur in which a great portion of it is citizens would consider exile as no punishment and an earthquake would communicate the sensation of delighted vengeance and this must be the feeling of every indian negro and every european jew every where found and no where respected wherever ye wander ye drag along the same ignominious chain  you deliver yourself replied the jew with the voluble eloquence of your nation in this temperate climate we fear no earthquakes and we are no friends to such frantic revolutions as a philosopher i conceive it my duty as it is my pleasure to correct popular errors by simple truths a philosophical history of the jews would be a history of human nature no nation has assumed such a variety of aspects their government was theocratical aristocratical republican and monarchical now tributary and now exacting tributes fugitive and stationary impoverished and opulent superstitious and enlightened a people now the most ignorant in europe introduced those sciences which are cultivated by all men but themselves  but a conversation must not be a dissertion it is difficult to say little on what we could say much i shall confine myself to some of the most prominent popular prejudices  what has been the origin between the christian and the jew of this implacable hatred rivality the principles of christianity are inimical to the principles of judaism christianity in it is earliest stage was the rebellious child of an aged and imbecile christianity is nothing but improved judaism i will give one instance which i have never observed remarked the sacrament for which so many have suffered is a simple rite now performed every sabbath night by the religious jew wine and bread are placed before the master of the house after a benediction he hands the cup round and breaking the bread gives to each a portion jesus amidst his disciples was performing this rite called keedsh and in the allegorical style of a young rabbin said of the bread and wine this is my blood and this is my body which they certainly were when assimilated in his person to this simple circumstance we owe all the idiocy and cruelty of transubstantiation parent at first the jews attempted to punish christianity afterward christianity was enabled to massacre the jews every thing is simple in it is connections the principles of nature however involved by the artifices of men are few and invariable  not among the least of hebrew grievances has been that of the christians having written their history the jews are chiefly known by accounts drawn up by their enemies who have vilified with monkish rancour and perpetuated the calumny of the day reflect on the ignorance of the christian ages not that christianity necessarily includes ignorance but ignorance may include christianity the papal power was an universal monarchy no solitary voice opposed the vulgar arm yet sometimes we catch in history a feeble voice that with a cautious generosity seems to whisper something for the sufferers of israel silent tears were shed from the eye of philosophy we now live in an age when a man may tell his fellow citizens firmly and audibly the cause of his tears yet even in this age when this people attracted their attention have philosophers ceased to be philosophers voltaire but neither rousseau nor mirabeau was their enemy lately when the learned dohm of berlin published his treatise sur la reform politic des juiss mr hartmann opposed that work of humanity sheridan has pourtrayed them in the old style voltaire hartmann and sheridan christian libertines had been duped by some jewish usurers mr hourwitz a literary jew of poland has composed the apology of his nation with the energy of an israelite roused into action who feeling deeply writes forcibly he tells us that he knows many young men have conceived a hatred against jews because several have supplied them with money by which means they lost their health and their fortune he knew a german magistrate who persecuted all jews because when young by their money he had contracted a shameful disorder  such cases only show that the prudent jew knows the value of money and the imprudent christian is an abject slave of his unsubdued passions  in our country i have seen with indignation mr burke compose a diatribe against all israelites as moneylenders clippers and coiners and whatever crimes his black imagination could create his style is too beautiful to lose itself on such offensive subjects it is a gilding sunshine that exhaust it is splendor on a dunghill dr moore in his travels benevolently abuses them the pleasant doctor perhaps envies some rich jews he may happen to have met in the course of his peregrinations philosophers write sometimes more than they think and are therefore very liable to take effects for causes the jews may be all what they tell us they are we enquire in our turn why they are so are men born moneylenders and why are those christians who are in the same predicament as the jews jews in every thing but in the exterior  to mr cumberland the israelites ought to be grateful but they are too ignorant to be grateful his comedy performed in provincial towns has loosned a little some cruel prejudices but this writers humanity is eccentric a flattering painter who made it his care to draw men as they ought to be not as they are    it is imagined that the jews are distinguished by a national countenance and it is piously conceived as a mark inflicted by the divinity similar to that of cain their complections are dark and adust their nose aquiline and their eyes full and black their cast of features is frequently noble and expressive the more polished jews residing in england are the descendants of those emigrants who escaped from the human bonfires of spain and portugal they have therefore naturally preserved in their families the physiognomy as well as the customs the habits and the language of their ancestors the jews who have found a refuge here from their national degradation in germany and poland are distinguished by the fair complections the gray eyes and the red hair of those nations had lutheranism found sectarists in spain and portugal and flown to england from the ordeal of the inquisition many members of our established church had been distinguished by what we term jewish faces the judaic visage we sometimes ridicule is frequently the countenance of his spanish majesty la croze ridicules the prejudices of the spaniards against the jewish blood which secretly defiles their church and state gibbons vol iv  to p  0  note  i formerly read a spanish novel in which the following interesting incident occurred  the inquisitor at goa as he was examining a jewish heretic discovered that he was his grandson   the hebrews who have no spot on earth their own include all the varieties of the human species and by differing from the natives among whom they resides only show that they are men  their universal dispersion and isolated existence have excited the curiosity of the philosopher and the triumph of the theologian it has been repeatedly affirmed it is repeated and will be repeated that it is a punishment for their denial of the divinity of jesus but the jewish nation had ceased to be a nation and were dispersed long before the appearance of jesus why has this fallible proof so long existed christians are willing to accept this as an existing miracle and jews are willing to be considered as a nation selected by the divinity a philosopher feeling none of these interests modestly pursues truth and boldly espouses her all national effects are to be traced to natural causes every other cause is that of fanaticism and cruelty and the discovery which exceeds reason made only by reasonable beings is the feverish dream of a sick man  two causes have conspired to produce this dispersion and to give a distinct existence among other nations  the political situation of the jews is indeed a phenomenon in national manners an artifice for such it was if not inspired by the divinity at once singular and sublime of their legislator has generated a power durable as the universe longinus termed moses a genius of no common magnitude voltaire bolingbroke and their school of philosophy have labored diligently to persuade their readers that moses had never any other existence than that of some ancient heroes of romance a prince arthur whose name was a subject for romantic biographers m pastoret in his moise considere comme legislateur et moraliste p   has proved that moses is mentioned by a pagan writers by strabo justin menethon diodorus siculus pliny and apuleius but their notices are equally romantic and uncertain  in this work the reader will find a good analysis of the mosaic legislation it is learned pious and heavy that philosophy is very narrow that gives for the cause of the jewish isolation the strict inhibition of moses against idolatrous practices idolatry has ceased but they are still isolated  extending his views with a vastness that ennobles but not exceeds human sagacity by rigid and numerous customs which he consecrated by their holiness he has produced from generation to generation an inheritance of manners has rendered the domestic life of a modern european the same as an ancient asiatic and by his genius through this awful interval of time still influences the fugitives he headed and isolates them among the most populous nations what at first in his code seems minute frivolous and absurd is sublimely political the simple rite of circucision he so sagaciously adopted as an indispensable duty still further explains the magnificent conception of moses perceiving that mingled with other nations they might assimilate to their customs like small streams mingling with rivers he commanded an operation which performed in the infant state compelled every man to bear in his body the judaism his heart had renounced  another cause produced an universal dispersion of jews their commercial character wherever a ship sailed a jew voyaged wherever a great town was established a jew was it is inhabitant it was necessary for them to separate that they might flourish we trace this fact in what relates to their english history they were numerous but not congregated he who could find no employment at york succeeded at norwich or was enriched at lincoln thus we find them distinguished by their residence jocenus the jew of york jacob of norwich sarah the jewess of malmesbury etc  their law not admitting of the military profession and animating them to conjugal embraces by considering sterility as a malediction their populousness became remarkable they lost not by the casualties of other nations and accumulated men as they did money by regular arithmetic if they had not suffered such effectual massacres europe might have exhibited the new jerusalem  the origin of their proverbial wealth is equally simple as the causes already assigned when christianity was established it degraded beneath the rank of men the children of jacob not merely vassals they were frequently bondmen with the other cattle the circumcised slaves were transferred from proprietor to proprietor earl richard purchased of his brother henry iii his jews for a lease that to employ the forcible expression of prynne those whom the king had excoriated he might eviscerate a more remarkable instance is that of this king who when he suspected the disaffection of prince edward to confirm his loyalty made over the jews to him and the following year prince edward being as deeply indebted as his father transferred them by a new assignment for two years to the caturcensian merchants toveys anglia judaica a learned humane and jocular history  one blushes to find such facts in the history of men  in this singular state industry was a source of prosperity christians were then most religious little wise and less industrious jewish wealth increased and wealth produces privileges they were proud in a mock parliament in a chief justice and an exchequer of their own opulent they still preserved the closest frugality abjectly penurious and grossly sordid a sketch of their domestic life is given by the quaint and witty fuller in his church history b iii par    for first of their fare it was coarse in the quality and yet slender in the quantity thereof insomuch that they would in a manner make pottage of a flint swiues flesh indeed they would not eat but dogs meat they would i mean beef and mutton so poor and lean that the refuse of all christians was the jews portion in the shambles their clothes were so poor and patched beggars would not take them up to have them attendants they kept none every one waiting on himself no wonder then if easily they did overgrow others in wealth who basely did underlive themselves in all convenient accommodations and at par  0 endless it were to reckon up the indignities offered unto these jews apprentices nowadays do not throw sticks at cocks on shrove tuesday so commonly as on that day they used clubs on the jews when they appeared out of their houses a people equally unhappy at feasts or frays for whenever the christians at any revels made great entertainments the jews were made to pay the reckoning and wheresoever any brawl began in london it ended always in the old jewry with the pillaging of the people therein  such is the jocular humanity of this honest ecclesiastic a similar character distinguishes the labors of the antiquary tovey both these english writers of jewish history felt as men but sometimes reasoned as christians    even to apologize for these offensive manners causes are not difficult to be assigned their domestic virtues however flourished luxuriant and beautiful like their own plam and almond tree on their natal soil time has accidentally preserved some interesting narratives of their patient sufferings their fervid affections and their heroic resistance  where wealth is concentered among the few it finds persecutors among the many their borrowers were great expenders and miserable calculators the estates of the idle christian were ingulphed by the mortgages of the industrious jew the sovereign with their opulence filled his exhausted treasury and the baron securely committed his rapine christian injustice produced jewish usury the price of money ever becomes proportioned to the risk objects of national pillage they became objects of national rage half the nation was their debtors a massacre was a receipt in full sometimes they were expelled the kingdom for their usury to the jews are justly ascribed many useful inventions of commerce and this debasing spirit of commerce which has diminished throughout europe the more elevated faculties of man may be considered by reflectors as a kind of punishment redounding on those christians who compelled the suffering israelites to be nothing but merchants a horde of asia has converted enlightened nations into companies of traffickers and public depredators and lowering to one level the great with the worthless has annihilated that spirit of honor which could give more value to a wreath of oak bestowed by a nation than to the enormous pension now accorded to a political minion despair with the jews was the parent of invention and bills of exchange were imagined by them at the moment there was something sublime in the conception to transfer by a species of magic to the most distant parts of the world estates that could only have a local value and wealth enormous to the eye readered invisible yet real  and then it was apparent that usury was practiced by christians and while the jews were universally execrated for usurious practices his holiness of rome by the means of his bankers the caursini compared with a jew bore the same affinity as a skinner has to a sleecer i quote tovey p     the several statutes made to prevent usury after the jews had left the kingdom prove it to be a crime not peculiar to them   at these periods calumnies were propagated sometimes absurd and sometimes terrible and indeed have been continued to this enlightened period of time i could show volumes of compiled calumnies i will confine myself to two they have been frequently accused of crucifying children and the chief narrative of this kind is even supported by ten historians this fact is instructive the agreement of several authors concerning some extraordinary circumstance does not amount to it is proof so many say a thing because others have said it to such writers we may apply the simile of dante  come le pecorelle escon dal chiuso           e cio che fa la prima laltre fanno addossandosi a lei sella sarresta semplici e chete e lo imperche non sanno   it is thus all history is composed nine of these historians copied from their predecessors and the original narrator gives it as a rumor and describes it as a romance i know not of any jew who was hanged for crucifying a child but i know that when these accusations were formed the king was very poor and the fines were very heavy the jews have never used and wood for the purpose of crucifying christians but the christians have employed a great deal for burning jews this circumstance of the crucified child is even revived in the adventures of a guinea and solemnly given as an example of jewish hatred another novel the adventures of john buncle says that even the gay jews have in contempt and abhorrence a country dance called the little jesus and the author adds they hate our holy religion beyond every thing such are the thoughtless men who strengthen and not loosen popular prejudices   it was long supposed and i am told is yet that the jew is distinguished by a peculiar and offensive smell to stink like a jew is an adage which furetiere has preserved in his dictionary but this smell it seems always disappeared when a jew was converted to christianity the author of roma santa says  cosa maravigliosa che ricevuto il santo battesimo non puzzano piu a french bishop touching on the wonderful effects of baptism writes  abluitur judaeus odor baptismato divo et nova progenies reddita surgit aquis vincens ambrosios suavi spiranime rores   the learned ramazzini has no doubt but that the jews in their most flourishing periods exhaled a fetid smell solomon encircled by his voluptuous and aromatic court in his private interviews with the queen of sheba when they met to amuse themselves with enigmas and charades must have been more repulsive to that queen than is generally imagined our philosophic sir thomas brown in his vulgar errors has given the tenth chapter of his fourth book to a most learned discussion of the following question  why jews stink after a splendid exhibition of numerous facts he is not willing to credit the imputation but cautiously leaves the question undecided    the truth is no rich jew would become a convert to christianity the converts were therefore picked out of the filth of the streets sordid in their manners as in their occupations but when baptized they passed through proper ablutions were perfumed and dressed the virtue of the holy water had therefore nothing extraordinary  their lower classes are accused of being tutored and practiced in dishonorable traffics no traffic is dishonorable where bread is wanted they are industrious cunning and fraudulent observe the poor christian occupied in the same situation is it not difficult to ascertain between a jewish and a christian pedlar who is the honestest man  such has been the ancient state of these men a chronologer tells us when he arrives at a particular date on this day six hundred jews were massacred at york and in the succeeding article that the king was crowned with great splendour and rejoicing i confess i cannot so calmly pass over from massacre to revelry nor account murder less murder because it is given in a collective manner some i believe do not feel their heart more agitated by a recital of six hundred than six others blush for their country and christianity yet christianity is not connected with persecution  the state of the modern jews is not less severe than that of the ancient they groaned in ages of persecution and in ages of toleration they are degraded in england it is doubtful whether the jews be citizens they are merely tolerated inhabitants even this expression is too gentle since their last banishment they attempted to return under oliver but the fanatics could not agree charles gained by bribes and indifferent on religious professions connived at their admission but the parliament of england has never abrogated their decree of expulsion see blackstone vol iv p     edition      it seems there to be said that jews born in this kingdom are entitled to certain privileges what these are i never could discover can banished men have privileges blackstone says what these privileges are with respect to jews was the subject of very high debates about the time of the famous jew bill it is not my intention to revive this controversy again for the act lived only a few months and was then repealed therefore peace be now to it is manes this dark passage seems clearly to show that jewish privileges are a nullity lord chesterfield on this subject says that the noise against the jew bill proceeds from that narrow  spirit of intoleration in religious and inhospitality in civil matters both of which all wise governments should oppose vol iv p     this british land which when the slave touches he becomes free retains the child of jacob in abject degradation the jew cannot purchase the house which he inhabits and is not permitted to elevate himself among his horde by professions which might ennoble his genius and dignify his people  russia has chased them from her inclement region denmark will not tolerate them and in norway and sweden not an israelite wanders see m dohms treatise sur la reform politic des juifs  italy cantons them into obscure quarters of her cities now closes her gates to their entrance and now places on them an humiliating badge with them the holy father has not scrulped at an infamous breach of faith this badge now consists of a yellow mark worn in their hars a custom to which perhaps shakespeare alludes when shylock says  for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe  no jew is permitted to reside in the voluptuous city of naples so late as in the year    0 the jews having obtained distinguished privileges from the king of the two sicilies a monastic prophet having predicted that his majesty would have no male heirs unless he expelled the jews lo they were expelled if any now by courtesy can glide in he is still at the discretion of some new prophet or some secret enemy an italian jew has shown me some privileges purchased by his family from the pope given under the binding terms of vita mortale durante and ab eterno which since the french revolution his holiness has cancelled but retained the money in italy they probably imagine that the children of jacob are really jacobins which if they were would not be surprising    germany sometimes affords them but the protection of a single night every jewish child but increases the taxes of his parent and a marriage is as lamentable as a death the hebrew father of many children is severed even from domestic innocence the sons are dispersed from their natal earth dohm  men who may be said to be born exiles are children of affliction who cannot but raise their disinherited hand against their mother country all men are not jews but how long will it be necessary to remind us that all jews are men  the jews therefore who have pleaded their own cause have dipped their pen in tears and in gall mr bryant has said they are every where distinct and unconverted and consequently enemies to the gospel they are like the waters of styx which remain unmixed wherever they flow and retain their bitterness to the last bryant on the truth of the christian religion p    here is imagination and orthodoxy but no humanity this bitterness is an effect and not a cause mr bryant and others are surprised why the jews persist in refusing baptism and the jews are surprised why mr bryant and others refuse circumcision when two parties are equally insane they feel the same degree of conviction and can therefore never change their opinions i can assure this learned pious and fanciful writer that there are jews who cherish their sephar torah with the same zeal as mr bryant does his new testament admire it as miraculously would die for it as devotedly all nations are alike characterized by a veneration for the religion of their forefathers the divinity has implanted the sentiment in human nature god would view all men in peace and men rebel against the divinity in their mutual persecutions jesus has commanded us all to consider every man as a brother and to love him like ourselves the authority and not the sentiment is extraordinary the new testament is a code of benevolence and yet it has produced crusades but men pervert all things   it remains now to add that there is a mortifying inferiority in the mind of a jew when compared with that of other europeans the entire system of hebrew education is inimical to the progress of the human mind dark and stationary in ignorance or bewildered amidst intricate superstition their modes of life are little favorable to form a taste for the productions of nature and art and the sole occupations permitted them the arts of wealth extinguish the bolder and prominent passions  the national character of this people is therefore monotonous never illumed by a glimmering though a departing beam of reason and never venturing on amelioration as the blind can only walk with confidence in their narrow but accustomed precinct sensible they do not here bear chains under tyrants they feel grateful that they exist under men but the energies of glory die in inertion and honor is strangled by the silken cord of commerce  every where the jew degenerates this degeneracy has passed from their mind to their form diminutive and timorous they verify this verse of virgil  degeneres animos timor arguit eneid lib iv ver    closely translated by dryden fear ever argues a degenerate mind the jewish veins impoverished and exhausted want a mixture of christian blood their arms bear now the rust of fifteen hundred years to athletic exercises their sedentary occupations are averse from youth to age they breathe a sickly existence under the domestic roof and homekeeping youth have ever homely wits shakespeare  the reform you propose to effect among this people is not desirable for at present they are unworthy of it their superstitions are perhaps never to be extirpated they believe that their written law contains all that men should know a spanish rabbin speaks the sentiments of his brotherhood  en nuestra ley se comprehend todo lo subtle y profundo de las sciencias lo que no es ansy en las otras in our law are contained all the subtilty and profundity of the sciences which is not so in any other no doubt this learned rabbin who knew his law perfectly must have been a tolerably illiterate person and conceived his law resembled peters brown loas being veal mutton and wine the oral law says david levi who believes in every thing but in jesus christ is the explanation of the written law delivered by moses in the same order he received it from god and this oral law consists of six voluminous classes and exhibits in detail such minute indecency and miserable puerilities that the jesuit sanchezs famous treatise de matrimonio becomes chaste in the comparison the bigots commit impieties more frequently than the philosophers every jew gives his assent to the belief of this galimathias a small sect in turkey attempted only to believe in the pentateuch they were called caraites but these reasonable beings have ceased to exist and have been annihilated by the persecutions of the genuine jews  omars they would burn every book but their alcoran they believe that their oral law was really delivered by god to moses paragraph by paragraph as it now exists consisting of twelve folios of absurdities a very cyclopedia of ignorance men must be trained gradually to support the glorious weight of a rational freedom we must never hurry to feasts the famished their enjoyment might be death your nation was not more prepared to enjoy liberty than the negroes and the jews whom you now excite to snatch at the perilous gift let men deserve liberty before they obtain it permit them to reform themselves but to command reformation is on your side to give the name of freedom to despotism and on theirs of glory to sedition  let us labor gently to loosen the bonds of prejudices to extirpate unnatural hatreds and to convince the christian and the jew at the close of the eighteenth century that modes of faith were never modes of humanity and that the hour should have already passed when the christian should be generous and the jew grateful to oppose this principle is to cherish an absurdity in politics and a dereliction in morals this sketch must not be closed without informing the reader that in literary berlin the jews are now enjoying singular honors as men of genius and study the late moses mendelsohn by the force of his reasoning has been surnamed the jewish socrates and by the amenity of his diction the jewish plato denina in his prusse litteraire says that to this jew is the german language indebted for many graces and ameliorations bloch a jewish physician was the first naturalist of the age herz is a professor with four hundred auditors mainon a profound metaphysician there are jewish poets and jewish artists of eminence and which perhaps exist no where but in berlin a jewish academy of sciences and a jewish literary journal composed in hebrew all these great men during their youth had to struggle with their poverty and their talmud but the example of moses mendelsohn animated his people and his associates his fellow citizen he instructed as a father and his rival he cherished as a brother literary jews must always be rare no students are liable to such numerous obstacles their most malignant and powerful enemies will be found among their domestic associates if a literary christian is matured at thirty a literary jew can scarcely be matured at forty they have therefore addicted themselves to those studies which are pursued without much connection with the manners of men they have had severe metaphysicians and industrious naturalists and have excelled in the profession and the science of medicine voltaire has addressed to isaac silva a poetical epistle which gives immortality to the jewish physician in polite letters they have had no literary character of eminence nor now does their stony soil put forth a solitary bloom of future genius   here the jewish philosopher at length ceased and vaurien departed considering that the jew was by no means so agreeable as the platonist that he showed more erudition than he wished to hear and was as little adapted for his politics as for his amusement  chapter xxix a committee of public safety a massacre an universal peace grammar and reason besides the revolutionary assembly at lord belfields unknown to his lordship a secret committee met at the house of mr reverberator they now joined and vaurien addressed them   in england you have adopted two modes of getting rid of your kings the reigns of charles i and james ii have produced to your nation more real utility than if they had been the most exemplary princes they have taught all sovereigns that there are different manners of regal punishment by death or expulsion let every citizen give his opinion respecting the present monarch whom we have agreed to dethrone  expel with a pension said subtle  expel with a pension echoed reverberator  expel without a pension cried dr bounce he never gave me a living  behead him said rant  assassinate him exclaimed dragon  this last mode observed vaurien combines expedition safety and tranquillity but this king through a long reign has not rebelled against his people nor will his people easily rebel against a sovereign who without imbecility is affectionate without effeminacy is domestic without tyranny is firm a monarch who like another augustus suffered without a murmur although it cost a tear the horrid calumnies of an eternal aretine yes the father of his country suffered himself what he could not permit the obscurest individual to suffer he trusted to the purity of his life and to the voice of his subjects a sovereign whose confidence in their affections was such that he would have reclined his head and slept on the bosom of his meanest subject but kings must fall if we would rise  there is a vile rheumatic wind from that door exclaimed subtle close it reverberator  reverberator after some ineffectual attempts cried curse the door it will neither open nor shut the hinges are dropped  vaurien smiled observing the monarchy of that state then is dissolved a door must have it is hinges  but it does not follow cried dragon with a frown that a state must have it is king you gauls catch at every remote allusion burlesque the solemnity of your councils and ruin your cause by your eloquence speak less think more and let your arm be your voice  a simile is harmless replied vaurien but to proceed may not the assassin be assassinated the king is loved  a poisoned arrow blown through a tube it strikes like the lightning the invisible is alone traced in it is effect cried dragon  well thought observed vaurien kings to respect the people must fear them therefore they must be beheaded or expelled  you observe said subtle turning to reverberator how exact are my computations this morning i calculated all our opinions and casting up all the probabilities and the possibilities i computed a certitude that this evening we should determine on assassination but i have prepared another calculation you propose dragon that it should take place when the king goes to parliament the chances are against you for the wind may blow against the arrow or the arrow may for aught i know be inhaled into your own throat then there are the horses who added together with his majesty make so many to one you miss we should never stir a foot without calculation when johnson entered a room he used to number and to measure his steps it is thought to have been superstition i believe it was done metaphysically for it astonishes me that not more legs are broken daily since few calculate their steps and a single one too long or too short may overset a man  nature said vaurien effects her facile operations without the intervention of metaphysics we calculate nature but are only amused by our figures a new fact overturns an old system reflect my friends on the necessity of dispatch what has been done at the tower  dragon replied this morning for two hours the tricoloured flag was hung out to the amazement and terror of the town i got a boy to do this merely by half an hours conversation on liberty boys form the best citizens every argument to them is new and incontrovertible i dare say citizen rant you find this at your lectures  to which rant answered citizens my lungs my arms my feet this cadaverous face and these ferocious locks flying like the serpent hair of furies perform miracles among apprentices i have learnt the french language since the revolution i talk of constantinople while every one knows i mean london of mahomet when i strike at jesus and of a conspiracy of the seven kings against the liberties of infant rome when i clearly describe the allied powers it is thus i defy all law helvetius did the same is not this genius in me all comes from helvetius he is the ova of human nature the learned london corresponding society our respectable booksellers of pigsmeat and our political missionaries deserve well of the republic but they persist all in printing what they have to say i have printed in every class of literature but whatever is most energetic from my tribune makes no impression in print my works are like the acidity of lemon squeezed on salts of wormwood if the instant froth is not caught it is vapidness my satire is termed outrageous ribaldry my eloquence inflated gaudiness my thoughts tedious common place it is said i have neither simplicity nor dignity neither nature nor rhetoric but approach my tribune hear my screams of indignation my whispers of discovery the foaming vengeance of my mouth the thundering resolution of my arm and the audible contempt of my foot i assure you citizens a living line of animation runs along the room i have seen the very benches tremble with rapture while the opposite echo of my voice seems like that of some divinity heard but not seen my butchers are resolute as the gladiators of rome my tailors are heroes to a man and my shoemakers are so many solons the canaille are the nobility of human nature  true replied vaurien and i have always been surprised at your english aristocratic custom of decanting port you carefully reject the dregs but the dregs are at once victual and drink and contain more true spirit than the thin upper liquor our french wine has no dregs for it has no body it is all alike lively and sparkling but it will not keep so we drink it off all at once time only slattens and sours let us now understand from citizen dragon the conduct of his proposed massacre  dragon now pushed on to the edge of his chair raised two bloodshot eyes and a haggard countenance then drawing up part of his coatsleeve till half his arm was bared addressed the committee  exactly a month from this night or about one in the morning i have prepared my friends we divide in three bodies the first assemble at charing cross under the statue of the tyrant the second collect at the tower the third penetrate the bank the charing cross party will decapitate by torchlight the tower will provde us with arms but i fear we may be disappointed at the bank for money however an active night does much when the sun rises we shall give up the city to pillage that will be a kind of current coin for the people  when i was at paris i studied the magnificent virtues of robespierre and the energetic heroism of danton these are the express words to be found in thelwalls sober reflections and god forgive his sobriety  to some english readers robespierre appeared a cicero but the genius of his oratory consisted in having retained some of the declamatory verbiage of the french writers he was not known for any work or other evidence of genius before the vast concussion that threw such unworthy beings uppermost danton was singularly illiterate in disposition a ruffian in heart a coward but in person a giant barrere was or is un poet de province assez mince a magazine contributor collot dherbois an opera garetteer un faiseur de petits verse such are the men who had never been inscribed on the list of fame in france and whose names had perished had not something more monstrous than villainy urged them to become the dracos of a great people great and virtuous republicans have bled on the guillotine the names of lavoisier bailly and others were known but these obscure and vulgar villains like so many phaetons incapable of conducting the singular power to which they aspired have themselves perished after spreading a conflagration throughout the world    i consulted with the animated barrere and the calm and persevering collot dherbois they conducted their massacres on a new plan they first set fire to part of lions without permitting a single massacre to be performed in the burning quarter trusting to the justice of gunpowder in the opposite quarters the patriots were marshalled and while they performed their duties quietly on the inhabitants the fugitives who escaped from the flames were compelled to throw themselves on their swords this ingenious contrivance succeeded tolerably not so much as they desired and they afterward very patriotically voted when they perceived that they had only effected half a massacre to raze the magnificent city of lions here you have hearts no bigger than pins heads you would have hesitated at this sublime massacre  and do you mean enquired dr bounce to destroy london in your fury do you mean to burn my meeting in the old jewry  do not disturb my reverie continued dragon darting a fiery glance on bounce that night the two houses shall be the lamps of liberty to illuminate the metropolis those haughty phantoms of state shall vanish we shall walk in blood we shall see by flames at noon london will be half in ruins and half it is citizens be piled on each other happy and fraternised people liberty shall be the benign sunshine to gild these horrors and you shall be free when you exult over your ruins  how many can you assemble demanded vaurien  three hundred replied dragon nodding earnestly  calculate calculate cried subtle exultingly not a probability not a possibility  you have deceived us cried vaurien i considered half of london was at your devotion  why shall we not all unite continued dragon rant has his apprentices do you account liberated newgate as nothing is the kings bench unfurnished with true republicans is bridewell destitute of patriots will not half the young men of the day assemble when we once begin  calculate calculate repeated subtle  the old jewry is safe said dr bounce rubbing his hands   cest un jeu perdu said vaurien we must give up the massacre  give up the massacre cried dragon starting from his chair and extending his bared arm i will first massacre myself rant you are silent  i never open my mouth replied the lecturer unless i can collect an audience of more than three hundred  none of you cried dragon have made any progress in the philosophy of politics how few assassinated caesar how instantly did massaniello effect his revolution one night completed the conspiracy of fiesco and marius and sylla are immortal let us imitate the vast designs and splendid deeds of great men in a cause like this the coward only is avaricious of blood and the fool only is prodigal of words a massacre in politics is an electric shock it calls forth a flame from the coldest bodies i have joined in glorious massacres you must want a feeble conception of the scene  in the silence and shade of night when the still air is almost heard then like a summer thunder suddenly bursting from all parts shouts and groans the shrieks of women the clash of swords the firing of pistols the lurid skies now dark with smoke now red with flame some fugitive and others pursuing the people now precipitating and now precipitated the streets kennelled with blood the passage obstructed by corses and the exulting eye of a true patriot glutted and tranquil amid boundless carnage at such a moment my friends every conspirator is ardent with triumph while every citizen is frozen with terror i entered a church at paris with but a few friends above five hundred priests had sought an asylum they were chaunting te deum when we entered all their voices were united but not one resisted our daggers we gradually heard voice by voice decline till only a solitary accent sounded in the hollow arches of the church we left him to his fate protected by the corses of five hundred of his slaughtered companions believe me the arm of an active patriot does not tire let men be assembled and i ask not a minute to a man you have heard of the assassin of the princess of lamballe i had him over but he has been shipped off he was a master the rich cannot fight and the poor will place a wellfed spider with one who has been fasting for ten months the meagre one attacks massacres and gorges this curious fact verifying the singular abstinence of spiders has been lately given by mr vaillant in his travels he confined a spider in a glass bottle during the space of ten months it lived but it is belly was diminished to a point he then introduced a spider in vigor and condition the spider which had undergone such a turkish ramazan gazed on the stranger some time and at length alarm ceasing with familiarity he fraternized with him with all his claws and the rich and corpulent spider was soon pulled to pieces by the meagre and famished fellow citizen  men are spiders in this respect not a town in england but will rise will not the french fleets be safe in our ports  consider the winds the winds cried vaurien you are as sanguine as you are sanguinary you surely are diseased with a calenture and imagine the seas to be green fields  damn the winds retorted dragon did not monsieur volney tell us he would manage them by this time are we then to postpone a salutary massacre for a nw or a ne you then have deceived me i depended on the winds  we cannot calculate the winds yet observed subtle but there is an existing possibility of this next year  assuredly or in ten thousand years hence said reverberator  damn your gigantic system exclaimed dragon you talk of ten thousand years and suffer the existing hour to pass away unnoticed unknown and unused your whole life is reduced to childhood  nothing can be done with the quakers said vaurien my project of an universal peace charmed but my mode terrified my system is however well calculated france by it is extent and it is populousness can hold out a war longer than any neighboring country so that when other nations are half destroyed it will retain a respectable and select number of republicans in our calculations we look rather at the expense of powder and ball than of men we have too many men but are often in want of ammunition the genius of our new tactics is to fight incessantly by land and at sea to board the enemy that we may relieve ourselves from the superfluity of our men to destroy or be destroyed is the only secret of our art a diurnal war of twenty years is therefore desirable i flatter myself two millions of our enemies might be annually got rid of at the close of the twenty years we should be able to establish what hitherto has been the closet dream of the philosopher  an universal peace  your calculation is commendable replied subtle but this general peace greatly resembles the peace of a churchyard it is a kind of peace which may be already enjoyed in a desert my project is evidently superior i would not slaughter but reason with men what are the causes or motives of war many indeed have been assigned yet they are all resolvable into one the proposed advantage obtainable by a war now of advantages or disadvantages no criterion exists but our conviction it is therefore a matter for argument nations at present make war before they negotiate they should negotiate before they make war a war rarely produces any real benefit to either party but is attended with inevitable evil to both at a peace the contending nations rejoice rather should they mourn then only they perceive themselves placed amidst ruins and desolations a war has been often kindled by a misterm in a treaty this observation is verified by a recent fact thomas pain complains of a verbal inaccuracy of the american treaty with england which might serve for a substantial cause of a war the treaty makes a concession to england to seize provisions and other articles in american ships the term other articles thomas pain affirms includes all other articles whatever he conceives the detection of as much importance as our philosopher subtle  and thus also in law which is another kind of war i was saved at the old bailey because the attorney general had mispelt my name subtle by subtle a letter more or less a comma or a full stop have frequently disturbed the peace of europe i am of opinion that it is necessary to convince the world that instead of armies composed of soldiers it should only form them of correct grammarians and expert logicians nations quarrel because they do not understand each other reason is immutable every obstacle is removed by a lucid explanation a treaty of war would be more desirable than a battle of war who could resist arguments strongly deduced and grammar nicely correct there would be no misunderstandings for there would be no misterms  grammar and reason exclaimed rant i give my vote of dissent in toto what would become of me and my works if grammar or reason were to be their criterions cannon and gunpowder are as necessary as pen and ink  i am no great admirer i confess of grammar and reason said reverberator i have a natural antipathy to them for when i was an ostler at newmarket i ever observed that certain anomalies in the english language had the greatest effect on my horses and my associates some of our most energetic expressions are both unreasonable and ungrammatical  mr subtle is however just in what he says respecting grammar and reason said dr bounce for had the writer of the first chapter of genesis but known either he would not have used the word elohim which plural word gods has given to some a strong proof of the existence of the trinity by which so many honest men like myself are kept out of the hierarchy  i should fear said vaurien turning to subtle that your treaties of war to be conducted by logic would be as deceptive as our present treaties of peace for it seems you can reason with equal force on both sides you can mr reverberator informs me prove that man is a stone and then that a stone is not a man  i can replied subtle with an exulting tone it is the easiest operation of my logic for it is performed by the mode of the ancient syllogism in my great work you will find many propositions more curious and extraordinary to our present business i do it thus a stone is a body an animal is a body man is an animal ergo man is a stone again no stone is an animal man is an animal ergo man is not a stone let beings i repeat rational and intelligent act with rationality and intelligence and i confidently affirm that a sound logic would conduct the affairs of the world more forcibly than an iron world of soldiers  most powerfully put replied vaurien with a smile i am glad however that you have extricated me from the horror of petrifaction yet if i read your great work i become a petrifaction again subtle you merit the praise of our comic poet raisonner est iemploi de toute ma maison et le raisonnement en bannit la raison but when shall we meet to agree  so saying he dissolved the committee of public safety  chapter xxx a final project of the gaul a character of the french nation when vaurien reflected on the indeterminations of his secret committees the imbecility of his coadjutors and the evident smallness of the number of true republicans in this country he perceived that it was necessary to congregate men by other means than the projects hitherto pursued after profound meditation he sketched several plans equally ingenious and at length selected one which appeared to promise an universal confusion to delight the young enthusiast in his closet the enlightened by honors rendered to science the populace by the astonishment of a new and universal sensation and the true republican by enabling such to meet for mutual support and like david to number his people  he now sat down to compose this great work he entitled it a proclamation in the name and authority of all nations and he called himself agent general of all the arts and sciences  it is design was an exhortation addressed to all the english the scotch and the irish to commemorate the birth the works and the name of newton he proposed that an act of parliament should immediately decree a national edition of his works that his majesty should annually go in state to newtons printing press and pay due homage to the art of printing as the emperor of china to reverence the art of agriculture annually conducts the plough that columns sacred to newton be erected in every great town throughout the three sister kingdoms that the name of newton be inscribed among the princes of the royal blood that a new order of knighthood be formed called the newtonian that his majesty should bestow on the agent for all the arts and sciences the title of sir newton vaurien that a newtonian fleet be prepared for new discoveries in every quarter of the world and finally that the house of the archphilosopher which we do not blush to relate is at present converted into an eatinghouse and eating is full as useful as philosophy should be raised into a magnificent temple his discoveries to be set to handels music and philosophical hymns to be daily chanted to his memory throughout these three kingdoms  to defray the charges of this sublime project he proposed that two guinea subscriptions be deposited at his bankers and that any surplus of money after the chophouse had been raised into a temple be applied to the relief of the poor in the manner so humanely recommended by dean swift it may be necessary to inform most of my readers that this entire project has been published in london last year see de par toutes les nations a book to be purchased at elmsleys the author is monsieur de la blancherie who madame roland mentions among her numerous train of lovers this circumstance is creditable to his taste whether it is to his politics i determine not monsieur de la blancheries intentions may be very innocent all that i am informed is that his zeal for the present project occasioned him to be threatened with the alien bill but if he now resides in this country it is an evidence of the justice of our government and the simplicity of his heart i will venture to assure this gentleman that newton is reverenced by englishmen not like true republicans but honest men not like boys but students they read his works with the same calm and slow sagacity by which the briton formed them a great man requires no other monument than his works their energy reproduces itself in a few kindred minds and he is immortal because he lives in others   such is the literal analysis of this eccentric project a cool and rational briton will instantly pronounce it the conception of infanity and that no political mischief could attend any similar publication as if great madmen were not to the full as dangerous as great villains if vaurien were mad there was certainly a method in his madness but vaurien was in good health although not in high spirits when he composed this great work it was a final project every exertion of despair if unsuccessful is considered as an act of lunacy but attended with success we then acknowledge it the sublime invention of no ordinary genius this project ceases to be an absurdity when confronted with some of a kindred character realised in france the removal of the bones of voltaire and rousseau carried with an idolatrous pomp to the deification of a pantheon the national commemoration of a ferocious liberty by the exhibition of an allegorical pantomime and the national dresses motley and fantastical in all forms and all colors were assuredly not extravagancies of lunatics but puerilites of designing men puerile only in their appearance invented to captivate the eye to please the fancies of women to awe youth into respect and to divert the passions of the multitude into any channel of observation and converse rather than suffer them to roll their turbid waves amidst the secreted fountain of power the infantes barbati bearded infants are to be used as other boys and they give them harmless mockeries that they may not entertain themselves by seizing on the dangerous instruments of men but they will not permit the children of nature to amuse themselves with any other toys than those manufactured a la mode parisienne  there was sagacity in this last attempt of vaurien he had hitherto promised to his patron rapid wonders which should be followed by each other with undeviating and miraculous power the cardinal de rohan did not more revere the bust of cagliostro whom he considered as the great illumine of the age than lord belfield confided in the head of vaurien but the gaul in every event had proved the dupe of his own impetuous imagination the fleets of france were dispersed were taken and were burnt the irish were loyal and felt a british indignation at a gallic gasconade the true republicans in london were too few to enumerate and too contemptible to listen to bold firm and discontented men he found but their audible discontent proved the freedom of our country he saw that our government felt all the infirmities of long administrations no government can reach a stationary perfection all were formed by human passions and all are carried on by contending interests every government is good which is supportable vaurien saw that ours could not be as pure and vigorous as in it is youth of      it is sound constitution is rather debilitated by luxurious ease than imbecile by a pithless and frigid age he saw our press was free our juries were holy our judges honest a minister may be censured and impeached and the voice of the people can reach the throne and the purity of our constitution had been tried in it is fountain head vaurien had seen with surprise that a member who professed himself independent could expel when he elevated his voice a member who had been spawned forth from the filth of commercial corruption  he perceived the imbecility of the chiefs of his party who assumed the sovereignty of human opinion and one of whom only had a just claim to genius in vain the unfeeling the sophistical and the metaphysical subtle had chosen to characterise free men like herds of yahoos in vain he had with minute malice and hyperbolical calumny artistly painted a sombrous and terrific picture which he chose to term the english constitution in vain he had created a being with a petrifaction for it is heart icewater for it is blood and clockwork for it is motion which he chose to term a man still more in vain was reverberator the noontide shadow of this metaphysical giant his ten thousand years could only occasion the laugh forgotten with the moment when vaurien heard him affirm the wonderful influence of mind over the exterior organization and that life might be prolonged at will and looked on this philosopher of eternity he smiled to view a diminutive frame a shrunken countenance a man broken down in the maturity of life whose volubility was interrupted by an asthma whose vigor marched with tottering legs and whose boldness trembled with shattered nerves this reverberator who conceiving that all things were acquirable by the perserverance of habit attempted in his walk to take large strides that he might gradually make a gigantic step to diminish his food by slow gradations that in time he might exist with the least or possibly without any food and on the same principle straining and emaciating his mind with his body attempted to become a man of genius by writing comedies without taste poetry without imagination and politics in a rage from sympathy he could expect little since although he was willing to overturn all religion he still retained so much of the priest as to insist on becoming an archbishop of canterbury for the rest of the society peace be to their manes  situated thus desolate in hope and active in despair he published this eccentric proclamation and resigned it to the influence of chance chance to which so many great characters have had recourse and which he knew in the most complicated and ruinous game sometimes turns up the dice which decides our fortune  vaurien had ill calculated the genius of our nation he had committed the error of his parisian friends they think we resemble them that is they consider us as men much worse than we are they have examined some loose rotten bricks which have fallen from the british edifice and decide on the wondrous piles by some natural casualties in vain we are told that all men are the same men national characters are opposite to moral and not to physical causes can be ascribed that hostility of opinions which has from age to age removed at so vast an interval the genius of these neighboring nations the same winter and summer refrigerate and heat paris and london but not the same wellpoised government and the same domestic virtues taste is a criterion of national character voltaire never comprehended the genius of shakespeare johnson never tasted the ingenuity of voltaire an english and french student peruse the same authors but do not write the same sentiments even the severity of metaphysics in france has been rendered a vehicle of entertainment for women helvetius the fashionable french metaphysician is tolerably characterised by whitehead who wrote this at the time his works first appeared is it not enough helvetius schentes elucidate your waking dreams though each who on the doctrine doats skips over the text to skim the notes goats beard    but when subtle followed with measured steps the paths of these airy gauls he could not soften his austerity with their superficial gaiety we cannot acquire the volatilised delicacy the lighter graces and the susceptible and feminine imagination of the french  redoubtable they are in politics for they execute rapidly what they project incessantly insidious in their professions subtle in their hypocrisy and sanguinary in their power in france they feel to inexpressible delicacy or to inconceivable horror their individual murders have ever been characterised by peculiar and complex barbarity long ere their national genius broke out in recent massacres it was to be traced in their private murders which were conducted by singular intricacy and perpetrated with singular horror a lady of rank to revenge her lover confined in the bastile poisoned her father her brother and others of the family a female rival visiting her friend when she layin put arsenick in the broth a frenchman invited a country family consisting of four persons to his house and by a most inventive plan separated them murdered every individual and took possession of their estate another in england after having murdered his landlady during a whole week was employed in calmly dividing the corse in small portions a number of similar authentic facts might be given they have ever exhibited a most inventive method in their cruelties and the revolution has only shown the world that national character which has long been known to the philosopher  impetuous feelings are fugitive and take an opposite direction they commit murders and then inscribe ici lon danse women in all things they are women in vengeance impatient of restraint in war a siege discourages and repels them in peace an orderly constitution could neither excite their love nor their reverence terrible in assault contemptible in slight vast in their projects imbecile in their pursuits capable of imagining all things incapable of performing any they triumph for a moment and despair through a century of all nations they alone have felt that calenture of political imagination which has aspired to an universal monarchy or an universal republic but they have never known that british vigor of judgment which could form for englishmen the most perfect constitution humanity can suffer when the french were slaves us they reverenced when free us they imitated now licentious they envy and they hate europe they may afflict with continued revolutions yet may their designs be frustrated one revolution was sufficient for the english dangerous rivals for they address themselves to the imagination they seduce the eye and inflame the heart they mingle prominent virtues which conceal their radical viciousness incapable of perseverance but they will perish in their cause if destruction comes rapidly they will declaim on freedom when they exercise tyranny revere the humanity of peace while their hand is armed with death they will reform prejudices while they introduce prejudices still more calamitous they term themselves citizens of the world while they sly from place to place and only leave in their career the memory of their desolations they come to destroy or be destroyed to fraternize with them were to embrace and to perish  the french resemble watermelons of which proverbially not one in a thousand tastes with perfection their liquor is aqueous and rarely delicious while the english like the cocoanut bear a rough and hard incrustation which protects the milk of human kindness as this work has assumed in it is progress a deeper political cast than the author at first proposed he conceives it necessary here to add that he loves the cause of freedom above all other human interests he rejoiced at the french revolution and exulted to view that to english principles was that great nation indebted for it is liberation it is fatal progress has only shown what some suspected that slaves are not immediately prepared to become freemen it is now fashionable to lay the disastrous events of this barbarous war entirely to the misconduct of ministers the writer professes neither admiration nor esteem for a financial administration disgraceful to england and the avowed enemies of letters and philosophy but thus much he will urge for any minister that when some part must be adopted if this part prove unfortunate there immediately arises an opposite faction who with affected fagacity trace the beneficial effects of a contre operation it is evident that this sagacity is very easily acquired and when it is noisy or cloquent influences the unthinking mob   chapter xxxi more of vauriens loves and friendships it is now time to imitate the manner of rapin in his history who when he has finished a certain portion of the affairs of the state as we have done returns to wind up those of the church and then on to the state and then backwards to the church a comfortable and unfatiguing regularity we much envy we novelists are classed beneath our brothers who profess authentic history and yet we have to feed the fire of our imagination with the most costly aromatics but the fire of an historian is extremely small and kept up by mere wood and coal but as the eyes of most people are more perfect than the delicacy of their olfactory nerves it has happened that historians are considered as sublime personages and we as nugatory trislers as for our church affairs they are much easier to narrate than those of the other historians a church being the very last object of a novelists attention it is with us as with many other men to go to church for marriage is an act of despair and when we discover that we are in an exhausted state to save our reputation we have recourse to the parson  emily with secret pleasure now gazed on vaurien she felt the same degree of fascinated affection as charles experienced placed in a similar situation they mutually loved and hated when emily listened to lady belfield she conceived ideas of contempt and to vaurien of confirmed horror relative to charles of the character of mrs wilson she had received indubitable evidence she and charles felt alike for the innocence and purity of both were the marked victims of the disappointed passion of her ladyship and the cruel malice of the gaul yet it is worthy of observation that all these complicated mischiefs were originally derived from a young mans charity for a miserable prostitute  emily had scarcely resided a month with lady belfield when she found her dependent life even more wretched than with the daughter of the loancontractor the beauty and dissipation of miss million by no means rivalled those of her ladyship and having been born in puddinglane she was not so expert and creative in her derelictions from decency and virtue as her rival who had been born in grosvenorsquare and yet we shall not have recourse to climate to solve this problem as many other philosophers would she had not yet seized on the natural genius of dissipation for it is by no means a facile labor to become the most abandoned and the most amiable of women an experienced taste is required even in the selection of impurities  the domestic manners of her ladyship were viewed with a sensation of horror a stranger to her lord yet residing under the same roof when describing the embarrassments of their fortune her high play she termed a national debt an avowed and criminal intercourse with her favorites was called a fleurette and with her claimants a stamped receipt her private conversations alarmed her hourly for her ladyship to give an evidence of her friendship threw off her reserve and like the duessa of spenser discovered under the gay and brilliant dress by which she enchanted the public eye a form of demoniac ugliness and vicious distortion  in vaurien emily perceived nothing but humanity and accomplishment he too wore a beautiful mask but art had so emulated nature that if the innocent emily mistook a mask for a face others of more experienced sagacity had been alike deceived  sometimes when she sat alone her thoughts wandered to charles his image had been placed on the altar of her heart and we do not readily break the idols which we once have worshipped yet on vaurien she looked as on her protector and facilitated by the desolation of her hopes and the urgency of her wants the designs he meditated  in the mean while vaurien perceived the growing passion of his rival who in the confidence of his friendship confessed the restless emotions of his bosom to love her said charles who merits not love is a fascination it is in vain i combat and i resolve when her image comes before me every thought turns to her eternally i gaze on that intellectual phantom which takes the pure form without the impure mind of this girl vaurien was alike convinced of emilys predilection for charles because not only he had caught her abrupt monologue which we have given at the moment she had discovered the character of mrs wilson but also because she made frequent enquiries concerning charles and mourned over his character less with the regret of displeasure than with the grief of passion  charles although he would not enter the house of belfield was induced by his restless anxiety to enquire concerning emily of her maid by her he discovered that she was far from being of congenial dispositions with her ladyship with whom she did not appear on the easiest terms that she was melancholy and often had been observed in tears the maid however confessed that emily seemed much delighted by the society of vaurien that she often played to him on her harp that they passed hours in conversation and that she consulted with him on every pressing occasion the interrupted connection between her ladyship and emily he attributed to the spirit of rivalry while the latter part of the information amply confirmed her character according to the descriptions of his friend vaurien  his agitated spirits preyed on his frame and his health visibly declined in his literary pursuits he gave marks of the distraction of his mind and some singular blunders he had committed convinced johnson that he concealed some powerful emotion too apparent in it is effects he said to him one day my good friend i did not know you was the absent man but you will ruin me you inserted i find in mr snowdens travels to russia mr fervids description of his newlydiscovered island under the line and you have sent to the printer of the british critic the article on the abolishment of episcopacy which was meant for the critical review while this month the critical contains that orthodox dissertation to prove the nature of the trinity on the principles of common sense the literary world is in confusion the rivingtons menace with the pillory the robinsons who yet do not command the pillory threaten to starve me out of employment you know that all the arts and sciences all the wit and genius of the age are absolutely under control of the rivingtons and the robinsons brothers and booksellers the former publishers of the british critic and the latter of the critical review it is supposed that messrs rivingtons occasionally write some of the greek articles in the british critic and that messrs robinsons write what articles they choose i have no objection to their writing and return thanks for many kind notices respecting myself which i will labor to merit but i consider them as the anthonies and octaviuss of the republic of letters and hope they will not treat me in the present instance as the great cicero was treated that is after having been massacred and mutilated fragments of his corse were hung up in terrorem to the public eye i desire therefore they would be careful of the extracts they make which form the fragments of an authors dead body  charles desired to relinquish his pursuits acknowledged himself absorbed in a passion fatal to his repose that he loved an object who merited not love and now related the history of emily which he had hitherto concealed  johnson instantly insinuated an idea that vaurien had been deceiving him respecting the character of emily  impossible replied charles would the man who with one hand has given me the means of subsistence snatch from me with the other it is only enjoyment  johnson having received his promise that he would never more touch another manuscript assured him that he would soon give him more certain evidence of the artifice of the gaul  he seized on the earliest opportunity of conferring with emily and delighted her when she was assured that charles was virtuous and impassioned  and whence she enquired his shameless connection with an abject being  eccentric humanity that being is a virtuous woman we must learn to correct our prejudices if we would not too frequently pierce with an added sting the bleeding bosom of virtuous misfortune what she related is true but she could not relate all her modesty concealed her incontinence johnson related her interesting connection with charles when he had finished emily raised her eyes to heaven exclaiming my father once have you erred virtue then may assume a criminal appearance sister of affliction where does she now wander victim of prejudice and delicacy i could now embrace her with the confidence of virtue i could press this woman who was a prostitute to my artless bosom as an image of maternal affection tell mr charles he is an excellent young man if i ceased to esteem him the cause of that cessation will convince him that i now must esteem him but the more  if you esteem him said johnson then have i an accusation against you charles knows that you are attached to vaurien and take a visible delight in his society  i am only born replied emily to be deceived yes vauriens accomplishments were eloquent and his virtues were splendid his character now becomes unintelligible is he then a villain  ah my father are you again right my father sir at his death exhorted me to fly the agreeable  i should not then have incurred this just imputation  your father observed johnson counseled you wisely the agreeable ever make an easy conquest of your sex  when these mysteries were elucidated vaurien discovered them in emilys countenance and conversation she at length accused him of his ungenerous treatment of charles  vaurien paused some minutes then raising his hands exclaimed with energy  i appeal to heaven that i am not ungenerous this man and no doubt this woman even at this moment exist on my bounty since he provokes the discovery i have concealed blame me not for the confidence i have held religiously inviolate i will show you his bond all this can be but a collusion of the wretched parties as for this charles he is no where to be found he has suddenly disappeared  he now showed emily the bond which was for five hundred pounds as she looked on it mingled sensations agitated the generous concealment of vaurien waked a beaming pleasure in her eyes the silence the connections and the flight of charles gave a poignant reproach to her heart her face burned with indignation her eye softened with delight the amiable character of vaurien rose to her mind  and when she turned toward vaurien she gazed on an animated adonis listened to tones that melodised her soul and was dazzled by eyes that melted with their tenderest fires he threw himself at her feet confessed himself her adorer and moaned in such despair at the treachery and envy of charles that emily in piteously listening shed tears with the tears of vaurien  this was one of those moments of activity with the gaul in which his genius instantaneously performed what the slow conceptions of vulgar villains could not have achieved by repeated deliberations when he could force himself to resist the overflowing sympathy of the artless emily he had charles immediately arrested and by a weighty bribe gained over his keeper to deliver to him any letters he might write this done he forged a letter to johnson in charless handwriting vaurien was expert in counterfeiting hand and at naples his ingenuity had once nearly been rewarded by having his hand severed but he had timely decamped preserving with the instrument of his art all it is former skill in this letter to johnson charles was made to inform him that he was compelled to quit the kingdom in haste and trepidation that hitherto he had played the hypocrite that his attachment to mrs wilson had been of a very ancient standing and had proved ruinous and finally he desired johnson would call on vaurien to thank him for the considerable sum he owed him but which he could never repay  johnson read the letter with silent astonishment he examined and reexamined charles did not appear and every letter was evidently of his writing he hastened to vaurien and emily each shared in the same astonishment johnson whose suspicion had not entirely deserted him scrupulously examined the countenance of vaurien never man appeared more poignantly afflicted he expressed little and scarcely were his words audible a tear trickled on his cheek he wrung his hands he looked sometimes on emily and sometimes on johnson shook his head and groaned  when johnson was quitting the house he heard of so many of vauriens liberalities to the domestics that his spontaneous loan to charles ceased to be extraordinary william told him that had it not been for vaurien he should not have known what had become of his fathers soul since without his generosity it had never rested in church ground a collection of mendicants was waiting at the door to receive vauriens weekly stipend this man thought johnson must be what he seems and my national prejudices have injured him  chapter xxxii a vicious and great man capable even of virtue thus were affairs situated at the time vauriens newtonian system was published charles in prison was as melancholy as jeremiah forming lamentations on modern friendships and this pythias conceived himself betrayed by one damon and deserted by another vaurien perceived that the compass of his fate was closing the circle it described and that the commemoration of newtons same seemed to be left entirely to the planetary system he had formed and that he who had inscribed his works on the face of heaven must regard with a smile the earthly celebrations of mortality some friends of lord belfield had informed his lordship that he had entertained a dangerous adventurer that among the privileges of nobility was not accounted that of an exemption from impeachment and besides they assured his lordship that his physicians were of opinion that a change of climate was absolutely necessary for his health his lordship indeed was of the same opinion not in respect to his health which he affirmed was vigorous but to his affairs which he acknowledged were disordered and the voice of a creditor is as aweful as that of a physician they both convince the patient that he can expect no quiet unless he slies from their regular attendance  vaurien had now fixed the bias in the sensitive heart of emily and he was anticipating the moment of her fall he had consulted with lady belfield and the boudoir of her ladyship had been selcted as the altar on which the virgin victim was to bleed  the great events of great men are governed by the same capricious influence which directs the little events of little men the web of fate is woven by the hand of fortune and she industrious yet indiscriminate spinster takes the casual ball from her basket and careless works now with threads of gold and now with damaged yarn she weaves on our fate but makes no distinction of personages the hero frequently envies the bandit for often the latter has found his existence to be a triumph over innocence while the former has perished in the act of his injustice every thing in this world seems good or ill fortune and the events of fortune are suspended on the slightest accidents a plank immerges the conspirator into seas stormy and profound as his designs in the hour of exultation and a pebble is slung into the head of the giant in the hour of confidence  lord belfield was bitterly reproaching vaurien for his abortive and vast designs he had at length discovered that he was a fertile tree luxuriant in leaves but void of fruit and complained much in the style which a ruined lover of alchymy would formerly have employed to some beggarly goldmaker who had promised to roof and floor his apartments in the mexican fashion before the spaniards arrived but after the multifarious industry of years lo a furnace had burst with a terrible explosion or at the very crisis the aurum potabile in the crucible was whisked down by a cats tail great or little causes vaurien averred had hitherto frustrated his comprehensive system while they were computing like two subtiles what is evidence and what is only equivalent to evidence intelligence was brought that messrs dragon and rant were arrested for high treason a quarter of an hour afterward monsieur vaurien received a note of epigrammatic conciseness from mr dundas without a scotticism or a vulgarism it there appeared that this hospitable country dismissed the gaul and in twentyfour hours were the seas to receive vaurien a breathless friend rushed in to entreat his lordship to set off instantly on his tour through europe your government observed vaurien are adopting subtiles system of punishment it makes us all travelers i have long been one to me the chances and the changes of fortune have by custom an uniformity in their varieties my chimerical head has considered europe as the inheritance of every sublime politician in these periods of revolution but i fear that my shadow will ever be reflected on the earth of my neighbors and never on my own  vaurien was collected and intrepid and he would have been equally so had the letter of dundas been his majestys order signed for his execution mithridates and hannibal carried about them an antidote against poison and had vaurien been now in modern italy he would have continued the precaution which these great men used in ancient italy but in these northern climates he knew we only poisoned rats what communicated this intrepidity to the gaul was a persuasion that he was born to suffer a public death what is inevitable to a superior mind conveys no terror whether the philosopher was to be hanged guillotined beheaded broken on the wheel or empaled he knew not the mode entirely depending on the customs of that country where he was to make his final exit   eh bien thought vaurien as he was filling his portmanteau the liberty of these britons is like a bottle of their port locked in a glass beaufet they see it and there it is  but only taste it at the option of their master who keeps the key at his own disposal their liberty will not intoxicate their heads here the people submit to the laws  damned fools  the laws must be submitted to the people  there should be no laws at all as subtle says and then if there were no laws every thing would be lawful   diable he exclaimed as he lifted his portmanteau i carry nothing away from this opulent country i play my cards ill after all my shooting parties with that schoolboy of naples he would have spoiled my handwriting for the forgery on the treasury spain i lost by those garlickdigesting grandees because i desired to curtail their names i mistook the real number of my confederates when i looked over my papers as they appeared in writing i imagined every single man to be at least six i thought i had an entire family when i discovered i had only a hotbrained boy the prussian idiot i had persuaded for i knew it would win him that he was an invisible an illumine i used to tread on his feet and then entreat his pardon for my not being able to see him all my party did the same his majesty was buffetted about the whole day which quite flattered his powers of invisibility the court of berlin had been ours but for the minister who while he received english money persisted in assuring his majesty that we were impostors and that his palpable obesity was not of so spiritual a kind as ever to escape the eye rome had been mine but for those cardinals who call themselves nephews of the pope but i found that they were more accurate in calling him their holy father the ottoman and the russian empires are fair and open fields but they are too distant for the moment in america i have friends at work who will burn the place if they do not succeed there is no room for me i do not choose to be a hermit amid a hundred thousand acres the dutch are near  sanguinary and unfeeling i knew the boors were but little imagined that those unwieldly porpoises sleeping in stagnated water should ever leap out to frolic with uncouth airiness to the national tune of the marseillois hymn  but the possession of emily i have missed for a single day a kingdom i can always discover but a child of love and nature kingdoms may not present charles remains in prison from either i derive no further benefit and i wish no being unhappy who impedes not my political views  he now took his pen and addressed the following letter to emily  admirable emily when you receive this letter vaurien is on the seas here my projects are concluded and the sole passion that now occupies my thoughts is my benevolence  you have escaped sweet bird of love but in the depths of night the lights were placed and the net lady belfield and myself have long woven was at this moment to have closed on you child of nature and woman of beauty your unsuspicious innocence was the magic that attracted and the magic that would have precipitated your ruin i have already proved seductive to your mind and the mind of an accomplished woman a mere creature made up of imagination and sensibility when once possessed is securing a party in the fortress who will soon be too strong for any opposition at the outworks  nature has been prodigal to me but art has even exceeded her liberalities had i lived in england i had rendered you the most miserable of your sex but since i am banished from it i will render you the most happy  all that i have insinuated relative to charles and mrs wilson is a foul invention of too common a kind to have cost me any difficulty domestic treasons are beneath me it is only national treasons which i feel as my genius and consider as my glory my dear girl in this head of mine revolve all the cabinet secrets of europe monarchs i have deceived dukes i have ruined and ministers i have embarrassed you now perceive i claim no merit in having deluded a country lad and lass  are you not surprised at my gaiete de coeur what you conceive me at this moment immersed in thought and confounded by disappointment it is precisely at moments like this when i am engaged in no particular project that free from politics i feel myself and act the man with you i have ever been serious and sentimental yet could you have then listened to my conversations with her ladyship if your eyes had had intelligence i assure you our faces were too frequently most impolitical but i trusted in your boundless simplicity as you confided in my boundless art you have therefore no conception of my character you have often said we feel more than we express but i express more than i feel that is all art il faut toujours peindre en beau whether in love or in politics the humane the sensitive the sublime vaurien with such glorious titles have you proudly decorated my name if he has any superior talent it lies toward the sarcastic the caustic and the malicious  you now imagine me to be a villain  i am so and with my national vanity i think i am a great villain  i abhor vulgarity even in villainy  but do not here tear this letter with indignation you must know all of vaurien ere you execrate him  and then i dare you to hate him  the moment i discovered that johnson was ruining all my schemes i resolved to deceive that stern and suspicious anglican some little merit was in that deception for it required my boldest exertion when i quitted you i arrested charles i had lent him the money that i might command him at all times well knowing he could never repay me i forged the letter which johnson received all charless letters were delivered to me the simple youth is at this moment moaning over the perfidy of modern friendships and the coquetry of modern loves  i am not now rich yet i can be generous there are human sharks or london cannibals who would give money for any legal instrument a bond you may tell charles is no trifle he signed it as carelessly as if it had been a private memorandum it is a public one with this you receive it take it yourself to him in the fleet let him receive his freedom and his fortune from the hand he adores i wish it had been more for it was not money of mine let him possess his emily yet i write the words with a pang in my heart show him this letter and let it is secrets perish between you there assure him that his emily is a precious casket whose gems have been unrifled although a robber had already possessed a false key hundreds like yourselves i have injured many an honest charles i have met but never in so soft a form a soul more chaste and a mind more exquisite  adorable emily you are something more than woman and yet are all woman something that the imagination gazes on with delight yet awe taste is silent when it would describe you and in memory only you are viewed with your singular excellence  will either of you forget vaurien   having sealed this letter the gaul took his departure in a neutral vessel for holland and ere he reached it is shores already meditated a new government for that ruined people his speculations received considerable enlargement from several patriots and two or three philosophers his compagnons de voyage who with him were taking the benefit of the alien bill patriots and philosophers whom the oerpressed stomach of england had disgorged with a violent but a salutary effort  finis errata p  0
