unwelcome news  the earl of belmont is in town   clairville my father in town   courteney will whom i sent to london upon some particular business is just now returned and tells me my lord came from

if he has been informed of this how can i excuse my conduct   courteney tell him the truth   clairville the truth   courteney yes  that his lordship in his last letter to you at paris proposed a match

clairville pshaw why will you trifle you know i cannot   courteney cannot my lord  gravely   clairville no lady ann does not please me   courteney because miss darcy pleases you too well   clairville prythee do not torment me courteney   courteney doubtless his lordship will excuse the violence of a passion which keeps you here at windsor under a fictitious name sighing at the feet of a young divinity that has visited this sublunary world in the shape of an humble dependant upon a haughty lady of quality   clairville what a blunder has fortune committed to place her in that state  courteney she is an angel   courteney an angel lovers have a fine creative fancy it costs them little to make angels goddesses nymphs    clairville are you apprehensive then that my passion for miss darcy may lead me too far   courteney why truly my lord there seems to be some reason for my apprehension  however this may be some particular business obliges me to leave you   clairville particular business is this affair to be a secret to your friend   courteney i have no secrets that i would hide from you my lord my sister whom you have often heard me mention with tenderness though i have not seen her since she was a child has privately withdrawn herself from an aunt with whom she has resided since the death of her parents and it is conjectured she is gone to paris to meet me my last letter to her being dated from thence   clairville her aunt had made some prudent choice of a husband for her perhaps    courteney no  the old lady is a bigoted roman catholic  and having a large fortune to bestow attempted to make a proselyte of the poor girl promising her in that case to settle her estate upon her this failing she laid a scheme for entrapping her into a convent which my sister being informed of fled to me   clairville who gave you this intelligence   courteney a friend of my fathers whom i accidentally met with upon the terrace who had seen me at leyden while i was at the university there and knew me immediately we cannot hope you see to be longer concealed therefore it is absolutely necessary my lord that you should present yourself as soon as possible to your father  what do you resolve to do my lord   clairville give me a day or two to consider   courteney but in the mean time my sister    clairville true  you ought to fly immediately to her assistance   courteney and leave you here my lord   clairville why not do you doubt my prudence   courteney your lordships in love   clairville can you think me weak enough to form a rash engagement with a young woman to whose birth and circumstances i am wholly a stranger   courteney you are in love my lord   clairville you are determined then to acquaint my father with my being here   courteney certainly unless you resolve to present yourself to him immediately my friendship for you my lord has already carried me farther than it ought i have indulged you in coming over privately that you might gratify your curiosity with a sight of the lady your father designs for you this done you promised to go back with me to paris there to wait his express orders for your return but you have not kept your word you still linger here  my remonstrances have hitherto been fruitless   clairville well since it must be so i will go back with you to paris   courteney were it not better to wait upon your father who is perhaps by this time informed of your return   clairville i cannot see my father i cannot resolve to marry the lady he has chosen for me kind and indulgent as he has ever been i have not fortitude enough to meet his frown  i will write to him when we get to paris and we will set out tomorrow now are you satisfied   courteney i am my lord your servant i will go home and give the necessary orders for our journey   clairville nay prythee take a turn with me dear courteney my heart is oppressed and i have a thousand things to say to you   courteney your lordship must excuse me we have not a moment to spare   going miss autumn and miss courteney appear at a distance courteney stops looks at them then comes back to clairville and says if your lordship is only for a short walk i think i will accompany you   clairville laughs so you have a moment to spare then confess honestly that the sight of miss autumn has brought you back   courteney miss autumn sure my lord you do not imagine that i would neglect any serious business for the conversation of such a vain coquet   clairville not unless you were in love courteney   courteney well i am not in love with miss autumn i do assure you my lord   clairville with whom then   courteney nor with your pastorella my lord your blushing dryad who with all her innocence and simplicity has had art enough to ensnare your affections   clairville dear courteney speak with more reverence of what i love  they are again in sight shall we go round and meet them   courteney well since it must be so i will attend you   exeunt courteney and clairville scene ii enter miss autumn and miss courteney miss autumn it is very true my dear when i told you this morning that you would make but an awkward fine lady you surveyed yourself in my glass with a certain consciousness  mimicking her well i will allow that you are tolerably handsome but half that bloom which you brought from the country might be spared provided you knew what to do with the remainder  indeed harriet i am almost ashamed of your simplicity   miss courteney why my dear whimsical friend what faults have i committed lately   miss autumn faults you never do one earthly thing that is right  all my documents are thrown away upon you  you blush truly when a sop looks attentively on you  you cannot meet the steady gaze with the confident stare you speak without lisping walk without tottering and courtesy without tossing back your head   miss courteney all this is gross affectation   miss autumn indeed harriet you are a silly girl with all your knowledge  you have spent eighteen years of your life in cultivating your understanding without reflecting that it is by your beauty only you can hope to make your fortune cease to be wise child and grow prudent do not study the belle lettres but the belle air  reason less with your tongue and more with your eyes  why really now i believe you imagine nature gave you those two sparkling orbs for no other purpose but to see with   miss courteney you railly your sexs follies so agreeably my dear that one would conclude you despised them were you not too often seen practicing them yourself  your eyes serve you for many other purposes besides seeing   miss autumn my eyes child are welldisciplined troops they know how to attack conquer pursue retreat beg quarter    miss courteney beg quarter i am sure they will never give any if they can possibly help it  what an obstinate siege have they laid to the heart of poor freeman   miss autumn true and they have carried the place at last you find   miss courteney well and what do you intend to do with it   miss autumn do with it  why throw a garrison into it and march off to new conquests   miss courteney i doubt the place is not tenable my dear two enemies to your power pride and resentment have got admittance and it is more than probable will expel your garrison   miss autumn that indeed would be a great disgrace upon my generalship   miss courteney mr freeman is a man of sense he has perceived that your design was only to torment him you are too much and too little of a coquet my fair friend and have not artifice enough to dissemble the want of it   miss autumn prodigious what the sage harriet taking upon her to give me lessons in coquetry   miss courteney i might profit by your faults were i disposed to commence coquet   miss autumn well since i find you have some skill i may venture to consult you sometimes upon my operations tell me truly then do you think freeman will escape me   miss courteney i think he has already   miss autumn this would mortify me extremely if i did not despise the rebel   miss courteney i perceive you do   miss autumn not that i think him despicable i assure you   miss courteney no really   miss autumn no really why is he not handsome has he not wit learning elegance   miss courteney ha ha ha and yet you despise him my dear   miss autumn despise him  why yes  and yet i do not despise him neither  i only mean that i do not like him   miss courteney why should you not like him is he not handsome has he not wit learning elegance   miss autumn pooh to convince you that i do not like him observe how ill i will treat him the next time we meet   miss courteney that will be the way to convince me that you do like him   miss autumn strange indeed you could not say more were i to treat him well   miss courteney no but i should say as much   miss autumn you have a mind to maintain paradoxes i perceive   miss courteney indeed you are mistaken i have no mind to be ridiculous the glitter of false wit like the shine of false jewels serve at once to show the poverty and vanity of the possessor what i mean my dear is that if you are indeed  indifferent toward mr freeman you will treat him with that general politeness which a man of real merit is sure to meet with from a woman of sense too much or too little attention to such a man is alike liable to be construed into a secret attachment   miss autumn according to this rule my dear harriet you have certainly a secret attachment for his friend mr belmour   miss courteney confused i a secret attachment why is it possible you can have discovered  that is that you suspect    miss autumn ha ha ha no my dear your extreme reserve made me first suspect and afterward discover    miss courteney what have you discovered   miss autumn that you love mr belmour  aye you may blush  this was a secret that required all my sagacity to discover but as for his passion for you  any idiot might have found that out   miss courteney yet does not reserve become one in my circumstances an unhappy orphan compelled by my ill fate to become a fugitive from the friend to whom i owed my past and from whom i expected my future support thus distressed  perhaps censured    miss autumn i will not hear you talk so censured you cannot be you have acted upon motives too justifiable and i hope my fortune is sufficient to keep distress far from us both   miss courteney generous charlotte yet if lady autumn should discover me she will think it her duty to force me back to my aunt   miss autumn most certainly what favor can youth and beauty expect from a coquet of fifty   miss courteney indeed my dear you make too free with the foibles of your fathers widow but you ought to remember that if she loves admiration at fifty it is because she was a coquet at fifteen   miss autumn that is true  i protest i tremble at the idea of being one day what my stepmother is at present oh heavens in the midst of wrinkles and gray hairs to dream of gentle languishments vows ardors  but there is some comfort yet fifty and i are at an immense distance   miss courteney do not cheat yourself my dear with that thought young though you are you will be old whatever advances with such rapidity cannot be accounted far distant    miss autumn well i am determined to grow grave in time dear harriet give me a lesson every day till you have completed my reformation  but is not that freeman and belmour yonder they are certainly come in search of us  come hither harriet  you who pronounced the rebel had escaped me  mark that pensive air those folded arms  well my sage monitress of eighteen will you pretend to assert that he is not thinking on me now can i not for my life resist my inclination to teaze him a little  do dear girl indulge me this once i promise you i will not be very cruel  nay you shall prescribe the utmost limits of my triumph and when you think i am carrying it too far  only pull me by the sleeve and i will instantly recollect myself   miss courteney ha ha ha i see your reformation is begun   scene iii enter lord clairville and courteney courteney your servant ladies we have been looking for you this half hour   miss autumn one would think you expected to find us like daisies springing up under your steps i observed your eyes bent constantly on the ground   clairville my friend is a little thoughtful today   miss autumn aside to miss courteney mark that harriet he has certainly escaped me do you not think so   to courteney that is your melancholy is it not so mr freeman well does not this prove what i have often told you there is not the least sympathy in our minds you are always sad when i am gay but i have a mind to be complaisant for once and will permit you to choose the humor i shall be of during the next half hour   courteney carelessly bowing pardon me madam you must choose for yourself you are so agreeable in whatever humor you assume that it is impossible for me to give the preference to any your smiles and frowns become you in my opinion so equally that i am charmed alike whether you smile or frown   miss autumn aside a little disconcerted indeed so indifferent   miss courteney aside to her i think i must pull him by the sleeve my dear   miss autumn mr bellmour my mamma sent you a card this morning you and your friend dine with us i hope   clairville we will certainly wait on you ladies   courteney it must be a farewell visit then ladies for we set out for paris tomorrow   here clairville and miss courteney talk apart miss autumn going and so unconcerned too aside this resolution is very sudden sir to be sure paris is a charming place you are vastly in the right to go miss darcy my dear we have but just time to dress for dinner   clairville we will wait on you home ladies   miss autumn drawing away her hand from courteney who offers to lead her no ceremony sir i can walk without assistance   courteney piqued by heaven this is better than i expected   exeunt courteney clairville miss autumn and miss courteney scene iv enter lady autumn and her woman at the other side lady autumn there they are but i shall not join them these girls are never weary of walking   simple they are young madam   lady autumn young well i suppose you do not think me old and yet i hate walking it is a robust exercise   simple to be sure there can be no pleasure in walking when one has the rheumatism so bad as your ladyship has   lady autumn the rheumatism who told you i had the rheumatism what because i was laid up with a sprain which i got by running rather too giddily indeed after my squirrel it passed for the rheumatism   simple i am sure madam the doctors called it so   lady autumn the doctors were blockheads then  not return to join me aside and looking about simple observe whether mr freeman be coming back   simple no indeed madam he is walking on toward the house with the young ladies   lady autumn aside it is certainly so he is vexed i treated him with too much rigor last night rigor was always my fault i cannot help it  sighs simple bless me i hope your ladyship is not taken ill   lady autumn ill no and yet one cannot be very well when one is the cause of so much pain to others   simple madam   lady autumn it does not signify there is no living without a confidant  simple you have been in my service but a short time but i have a notion that you are very discreet   simple curtseying indeed i am madam   lady autumn aye i know you are i am seldom mistaken in my judgment of people to show you then that i think you very discreet i am resolved to make you my confidant   simple confidant i thank you madam  but but  i had rather keep the place i was hired for madam   lady autumn yes i am determined to deposite all my secrets in your breast  know then simple that there is a young man who seems  but why do i say seems  who is desperately  what shall i call it  who really languishes with an unconquerable invincible hopeless fatal dying passion for  for  me  is not this a sad thing   simple yes indeed madam it is a very strange thing   lady autumn a strange thing i say is it not a sad thing   simple to be sure it is a sad thing madam and i am very sorry for it   lady autumn poor freeman i am sorry too  but there was a kind of fatality in it  i never told you simple the manner of our first acquaintance   simple no madam   lady autumn one morning when i was sauntering in the forest habited in a loose white sack with my walkingcrook in my hand  poor lord autumn used to say i looked like a nymph in this dress  i found myself fatigued and was obliged to rest under a tree  here i sat or rather reclined in a pensive attitude when i was roused by the sight of a monstrous snake that had fastened on my arm    simple lord bless me madam what did you do    lady autumn do  i screamed so loud that two young gentlemen who were walking at a little distance came running to me  both were eager to assist me  but mr freemans assiduity was so animated so languishing  so  so  in short the blow was struck i perceived immediately that i had made a violent impression   simple but pray madam if i may be so bold how did your ladyship get rid of the snake   lady autumn the snake  o i was mistaken it was only a caterpillar which my fears had magnified into a snake mr freeman then offered me his hand to lead me home but it was with such a timid aspect  since that day his friend belmour and he have been constant visitors at my house and although his passion has been continually increasing yet he has concealed it so carefully that no person in the family has discovered it but myself   simple i will answer for it madam nobody dreams of any such thing  but i wonder the gentleman has not broke his mind to your ladyship    lady autumn no he has ever been silent awfully silent as to that point  such is his extreme timidity  timidity simple ever accompanies a violent passion for flames as the poet says burn highest when they tremble most   simple  looking out i vow madam here is mr freeman coming all alone  sure he intends to break his mind now   lady autumn it is he indeed  this can never be chance he has certainly followed me hither his passion has at length got the better of his timidity and he is resolved to declare himself  i must not be too reserved  i must not kill his hope  simple observe his looks when he accosts me   enter courteney courteney your ladyships most humble servant i did not expect to meet you here madam   lady autumn no you had a mind for a solitary walk then   courteney no indeed madam i have been walking all the morning i left mr belmour with the young ladies to take leave for we set out for paris tomorrow   lady autumn how do you leave us tomorrow  is this to try me  aside positively mr freeman you must not go   courteney indeed madam i must there is an absolute necessity for it   lady autumn indeed but there is no absolute necessity for it do you think i have so little penetration as not to have discovered the cause of this sudden resolution   courteney so she means my lords passion for miss darcy  if i could but draw some intelligence from her concerning this young woman it might be of use  aside   lady autumn now is he considering with himself whether he may venture to make a discovery of his passion  i protest i am all in a slutter he wants courage  aside  mr freeman have i guessed truly as to the cause of your sudden departure   courteney i cannot answer that question till i know what it is your ladyship guesses   lady autumn  looking down upon her fan affectedly nay now mr freeman  this is too much  you throw me into the greatest confusion imaginable  to be sure i have guessed  a passion so very obvious  but methinks it would better become you to explain yourself    courteney why madam i confess you have guessed truly my friends passion is indeed pretty obvious but there are certain reasons which make it highly improper for him to indulge it   lady autumn his friends passion prettily turned  how cautious how diffident  aside  well sir this you may assure your friend of however that to my certain knowledge he need not despair   courteney so she favors this business i find aside   lady autumn well sir do you still hold your resolution of leaving us   courteney your ladyship may easily imagine that i am somewhat interested in this affair    lady autumn yes yes i can very easily imagine that   courteney i should be glad therefore to know    courteney positively you shall know no more now  you men are so importunate  but suppose now i should give you an opportunity of talking to me upon this affair   courteney i should be greatly obliged to you madam   lady autumn he might have thrown a little more rapture into his answer  aside  well i shall be alone in the drawing room after dinner  and  but this looks so like an assignation that i have a good mind to withdraw my promise   courteney assignation how could that come into her head  aside  no no madam depend upon it i will hold you to your promise   lady autumn adieu then till dinner simple do you hear lay out my pink and white  i shall dress immediately   exeunt lady autumn and simple courteney  alone what a piece of affectation but if she has not entered heartily into the interest of this miss darcy with whom my pupil is madly in love i shall be able to discover her character and circumstances and must take my measures accordingly   exit courteney end of the first act act ii scene a drawing room in lady autumns house enter courteney as from dinner courteney if i do not hit upon some method to rescue lord clairville he is undone i observed him all dinnertime  his attachment to this young creature is amazing   enter lord clairville clairville courteney i wished to speak a word to you in private i have been thinking all day on this journey to paris   courteney well my lord   clairville i find i cannot resolve to go    courteney i suspected as much   clairville without first seeing my father   courteney there you are perfectly right my lord you intend to wait on him tomorrow i suppose   clairville not so neither i would prepare him first  i intend to write to him to explain my reasons for returning before i had received his orders and to assure him that i cannot think of marrying lady anne and that i wait his answer here i will just step to my lodgings and write my letter and return immediately   exit clairville courteney alone my lord has a very contented air he has certainly brought his mistress to terms but what those terms are i must endeavor to find out this girl i fear will draw him into some rash engagement i can form no judgment of her character and designs she is so reserved ha here she comes  i will try to found her and for once in order to preserve my pupil i will assume a language foreign to my heart   enter miss courteney miss courteney mr freeman is it certain that you set out for paris tomorrow   courteney if not tomorrow madam most certainly the next day   miss courteney i have a relation in paris whom i have not heard from for several weeks  it is of great importance to me to have a letter safely conveyed to his hands  will you execute this little commission for me   courteney receiving the letter which he puts into his pocket book with pleasure madam but the honor you do me in employing me upon this occasion will be envied by my friend   miss courteney mr belmour tells me he does not go with you   courteney he once resolved otherwise and his affairs required it should be so but i who know how difficult it is to be in love and to be wise am not surprised that he has changed his mind   miss courteney  in confusion this is an affair which i do not pretend to judge of will you walk into the next room the coffee is brought in going   courteney  detaining her nay but this is an affair which concerns you madam more than any other person  you must indeed you must permit me to plead for my friend  i know the sincerity and ardor of his passion for you    miss courteney hold mr freeman  am i to think you serious   courteney you wrong yourself and me by supposing i would jest upon so delicate a subject   miss courteney it is strange methinks that you should encourage him in the liking you say he has entertained for me his fortunes seem to be high i am poor and dependant  do you think his parents will approve of so unequal match   courteney what have parents to do with a tender engagement   miss courteney ha   courteney his i believe have destined his hand to another but his heart i am sure will always be yours   miss courteney aside in great confusion what can he mean   courteney my friend adores you madam he has the power and the will to make you happy  to place you in affluence and splendour  it is true that circumscribed by a fathers authority he cannot offer you his hand  but    miss courteney no more sir  this insult is too plain turns and weeps oh why am i thus weak  indignation scorn contempt would better become me   courteney she is strangely moved in tears too  her beautiful disorder affects me  surely i have been to blame   miss courteney endeavoring to seem composed i will not ask you sir what you have observed in my behavior which could encourage you to treat me thus freely  you no doubt act upon principle and it is not surprising that persons who hold riches to be the greatest good should think they are more than an equivalent for virtue   courteney charming creature aside   miss courteney you boast your friends rank and affluence  it belongs indeed to the great to be licentious with impunity my humbler fate makes other maxims safer i have been taught to think poverty a less evil than dishonor and to aspire to that distinction only which is attainable by all the distinction due to virtue   courteney how could i harbor a profane thought of such a woman  aside  i have offended so greatly madam that i hardly dare solicit much less hope for pardon but if you knew    miss courteney no apologies sir to me your offense is general and proceeds from the bad opinion you have formed of my sex yet to judge of all from an acquaintance perhaps with the worst is an error which a man of sense ought surely to have avoided  it is sinning against conviction for whatever libertines pretend the contempt they feel for those they have seduced is a proof of that secret homage which all men pay to virtue   courteney i am ashamed and confounded at what has past  yet permit me    miss courteney no more sir we must be strangers for the future therefore return the letter i gave you i shall find a fitter way of conveying it   courteney do not madam deprive me of an opportunity of doing yon this small service   miss courteney with some emotion no sir no  that letter would introduce you to the friendship of a man whose sentiments and conduct are very different from yours  alas what would his generous heart suffer were he to know the insult his sister has been subjected to this day   turns and weeps courteney looking earnestly at her her brother  good heaven  should it be possible  takes out the letter and reads the direction ha to mr courteney  her wellknown hand too  confusion have i then been all this time practicing on the virtue of my sister   miss courteney turning toward him give me the letter sir   courteney the letter belongs to me for oh my dear harriet my amiable my virtuous sister i  i am courteney  i am your your brother   miss courteney is it possible   courteney i am nay shrink not from my embrace  and yet your doubts are natural you were so young when we parted it is impossible you should recollect my features  but i have tokens that may convince you see here your mothers picture this bracelet of her hair her last dear gift   miss courteney you are  you are my brother but why have you concealed yourself so long and why  why this severe trial of your sister   courteney my dear harriet i must take shame to myself i knew you not under a borrowed name and in a place where i so little expected to meet you  i shall never think on what has passed without the deepest confusion and remorse anxious to preserve my pupil from offending his father by an unequal marriage and suspicious of your real character i have insulted innocence and heaven to punish me has turned that insult on my sister   miss courteney oh that my brother may be taught by this adventure never more to insult distress and innocence and to consider every virtuous unprotected young woman as a sister alas i was afraid my slight from my aunt had exposed me to your suspicions   courteney i know your motives they free you from all blame   miss courteney but why did you assume the name of freeman   courteney i believe you already guess that the young gentleman you see with me is the earl of belmonts son whom i have accompanied in his travels his father having provided a match for him he prevailed upon me to come with him privately to england in order to see his intended bride without being known by her   miss courteney his intended bride   courteney yes his intended bride  but why this emotion sister you love mr belmour  ah this is what i fear  but remember my dear harriet that mr belmour is lord clairville and never can be yours and were he weak enough to offer you his hand i am bound in honor to prevent it he was committed to my care by my benefactor and my friend and should i encourage his passion for you it would be such a scandalous breach of trust as would sink me below the meanest of mankind by heaven i would rather lose my life than incur the infamy of having betrayed my pupil into a clandestine marriage with my sister   miss courteney be calm brother and place some confidence in me you will find that i deserve it   courteney it is well then promise me to conceal your name and family still from lord clairville if he knows i am your brother he will possibly be weak enough to expect my concurrence with his designs and my fixed resolution to oppose them may occasion a breach between us   miss courteney heaven forbid   courteney nor would i have miss autumn know me yet by any other name than freeman   miss courteney and is this necessary   courteney i am apprehensive from her mistaken kindness for you that she will certainly acquaint lord clairville with the truth   miss courteney well i will be entirely governed by you   courteney then my dear harriet you must resolve to go with me tomorrow to your aunt i am assured that she is very desirous of being reconciled to you and you cannot with any propriety stay here where lord clairville may have such easy access to you   miss courteney to return to my aunt is the hardest injunction you have laid upon me yet but even in this you shall be obeyed   courteney tomorrow morning early a postchaise shall be ready for you i will join you on the road and conduct you to essex  but how is this harriet you are in tears  i expected more firmness from you   miss courteney i am to blame  but    courteney here is somebody coming  retire and compose yourself and oh remember the honor of your brother is in your keeping   miss courteney farewell rely upon me   exit miss courteney courteney looking after her it were a sin to doubt her yet she loves lord clairville what a difficult task does my situation impose upon me compelled to make two persons miserable whose happiness i would purchase at the expense of my own   enter lady autumn lady autumn waiting in expectation of my coming  so it should be  a passionate lover will always prevent the hour aside   courteney without seeing her if i can but avoid a discovery till i have placed her out of his reach my honor will be safe   lady autumn lost in tender contemplation aside  mr freeman  advancing   courteney i ask your ladyships pardon i did not see you   lady autumn no well here i am according to my promise  but you must not impute this condescension  you must not presume upon it   courteney presume madam   lady autumn nay positively you shall not gaze upon me thus  i shall blush ten times more if you do   courteney gaze upon you madam   lady autumn how his respect for me embarrasses him aside you were talking to me this morning of your friends passion mr freeman you remember the phrase  your friends passion  need i tell you that i am  very favorably  disposed  to hear all you have to say upon that subject   courteney my friends passion  i must put that notion out of her head  aside oh dear madam i was only jesting   lady autumn how sir   courteney raillery i do assure your ladyship   lady autumn i am confounded   courteney you were certainly mistaken madam if you looked upon my friends attachment in any other light than mere gallantry   lady autumn this is strange yet he owns an attachment that is something however  aside  so then i am to suppose that    courteney nothing more than such homage as the young and beautiful will always claim from our sex   lady autumn when you speak of beauty there i am sure you flatter and yet poor lord autumn used to think  but lord autumn perhaps was singular in his opinion   courteney what does she mean aside   enter footman footman madam miss autumn sends to acquaint your ladyship that the coffee is upon the table   lady autumn what an unseasonable interruption  aside  mr freeman i do not think you have any great inclination for coffee   courteney indeed i have madam i will attend your ladyship  offering his hand   lady autumn i protest he trembles all this inconsistency is nothing but extreme respect aside  come sir we will talk of this affair another time   exeunt courteney and lady autumn end of the second act act iii scene i the drawing room miss autumn and her woman miss autumn i am astonished  leave me tomorrow morning and return to her aunt what can have occasioned this sudden resolution sure lady autumn has not affronted her  betty    betty madam    miss autumn have you observed any coldness lately between lady autumn and miss darcy  she talks of leaving me tomorrow i am afraid she has taken some disgust   betty o dear maam you are quite mistaken miss darcy has other thoughts in her head   miss autumn other thoughts what do you mean   betty lord maam i mean nothing not i but i know    miss autumn what do you know   betty nay maam i know nothing not i  but i have seen something and i have been told something   miss autumn then pray say something what have you seen and what have you heard   betty for that matter maam nobody knows how to keep a secret better than i do   miss autumn oh if you have been trusted with a secret  i shall not tempt you to betray it i assure you  go and tell miss darcy that i wish to speak with her here    betty depend upon it maam miss darcy will confess nothing she has carried this matter too closely   miss autumn you would fain disclose this secret i perceive but i will not gratify my curiosity at the expense of your fidelity  go and deliver my message   betty nay maam since you will have it  though i am sure i never thought to have told    miss autumn be gone impertinent i will not hear you   betty nay maam what i know is no great matter it is only that mr freeman is in love with miss darcy   miss autumn what is that you say come back  mr freeman in love with miss darcy impossible   betty oh dear maam why impossible miss darcy is a fine young lady and to be sure mr freeman doats upon her   miss autumn doats upon her  tormenting wretch  but tell me instantly all you know   betty i would have told you before maam but you were so nice about betraying a secret  you would not hear me   miss autumn that is true  but this is a secret which ought not to be concealed you know miss darcy is my friend  she may be taking some rash step  it is fit i should enquire into this matter  so mr freeman is her lover then sighs   betty yes maam i am sure he is for you must know maam that they met here in this very room today i saw them with my own eyes  i was passing by the door when they were in earnest discourse  now i abhor listening maam  i am above it  so i stood still and shut the door halfway that they might not see me but i could scarcely hear a word they said  they talked so low  at last i saw miss darcy burst into tears and presently afterward mr freeman threw his arms about her neck and kissed her   miss autumn kissed her and did she suffer that   betty yes indeed did she maam and kissed him again very cordially too   miss autumn amazement her motive for leaving me is now too plain   betty to be sure maam why maam mr freeman is to go along with her   miss autumn how do you know that   betty why maam you must know that mr william mr freemans servant  his gentleman i should say for he is above wearing a livery    miss autumn what is that to the purpose go on    betty i hope you will excuse me maam  but mr william has for some days made his addresses to me upon honorable terms   miss autumn absurd creature what then   betty he told me maam under a promise of secresy that his master was certainly going to steal a marriage with miss darcy for that he had ordered him to hire a postchaise for her that he was to attend her as far as london and mr freeman was to join them there but where they were to proceed afterward he did not know   miss autumn it is certainly so  what a dupe have i been all this time  treacherous harriet   betty if i had thought this news would have discomposed you so much maam i would not have told you   miss autumn discomposed what is it to me whom mr freeman marries  leave me   exit betty miss autumn  alone discomposed  yes i feel it but too sensibly  ungrateful harriet but why do i complain of her have i not always affected to despise this man laughed at and raillied him continually he is coming let me laugh and railly still let me conceal my weakness at least  it will not be i cannot look at him without betraying myself   going enter courteney courteney miss autumn you are wanted at the quadrilletable   miss autumn i shall not play tonight sir exit   courteney that was spoke in a peevish tone  i am sure  her eyes seemed full of tears too can that impenetrable heart have feelings charming creature she only wants a little sensibility to make her irresistible   enter lord clairville clairville i am in no humor to play this evening  dear courteney take my place    courteney that you may have an opportunity of entertaining miss darcy  is it not so my lord   clairville i confess it is but why must i find you eternally in my way what is it you apprehend   courteney great inconveniences from this attachment my lord and i think it my duty to oppose it   clairville i must dissemble with him  aside  what do you imagine i am weak enough to be honorably in love with this girl   courteney ha and do you own my lord you have dishonorable designs upon this girl as you call her   clairville why if i had what then   courteney what then confusion dishonorable designs upon  upon  this is too much my lord let us talk no more upon this subject   clairville this is astonishing by heaven his color changes what can this mean aside   courteney my lord i must advise nay i entreat you to think no more of miss darcy you will find insuperable difficulties in your way hereafter i will explain myself more fully   bows and exit clairville stay courteney i insist upon your explaining yourself now  gone  what am i to think of this he loves her himself perhaps  what then does he expect i should resign her to him has he been base enough  no that is not possible   enter miss courteney miss courteney i thought mr freeman had been with you sir   clairville mr freeman madam it was mr freeman then you wished to see   miss courteney i have a little business with him   clairville business with mr freeman madam how long has mr freeman been honored with your confidence   miss courteney i always esteemed mr freeman sir   clairville well madam he is worthy of your esteem   miss courteney he seems chagrined at something  aside  will you not join the company sir in the next room   clairville her looks are colder than usual but i will clear up all my doubts at once  aside  indulge me with a few moments madam while i entreat your pardon for having concealed my real name and circumstances from you i am now at liberty to declare myself since my father by this time knows my resolution never to marry the lady he designed for me   miss courteney what would he say aside   clairville my name is not belmour it is clairville i am son to the earl of belmont and heir to his title and estate but title and estate with you i am sure will weigh nothing if the man is unworthy but if as belmour i have been so fortunate as to gain your esteem you will not refuse your hand to clairville   miss courteney generous youth oh my hard fate aside   clairville you turn from me you answer me not  was it then a vain hope i flattered myself with when i believed i was not disagreeable to you   miss courtevey oh brother what a task have you imposed upon me aside   clairville keep me not dear miss darcy in this cruel suspense  but why do i say suspense  your silence speaks plainly enough  your affections are bestowed upon another   miss courteney oh think not so my lord my heart    clairville go on madam i conjure you   miss courteney is sensible to your worth but    clairville finish the harsh sentence madam you love another   miss courteney love another oh heavens aside  what can i say my lord the honor you do me demands my most grateful acknowledgements but there are obstacles    clairville my father  he will consent perhaps  if not he will forgive   miss courteney i understand you my lord no this can never be  there are difficulties which cannot be surmounted  yet do not suppose me ungrateful  insensible of  what am i going to say  think of me no more my lord and obey the commands of your father   exit miss courteney clairville think of her no more  difficulties that never can be surmounted  courteney said the very same words  i fear it is too true that they love each other their secret conferences the simularity of their conduct their mutual confusion and reserve all contribute to heighten my suspicions distraction this double jealousy of the objects both of my friendship and my love is intolerable  can then courteney  i cannot bear these doubts  i must and will be satisfied exit   enter lady autumn and simple lady autumn did betty tell you this   simple yes indeed madam   lady autumn it cannot be  i will not believe it  i know i am the object of his secret affection   simple i would lay ever so much your ladyship is mistaken   lady autumn simple i begin to think you have not so much understanding as i once imagined you had   simple here is mr belmour madam pray ask him i dare say he knows all his secrets   enter clairville lady autumn leave me  exit simple  mr belmour where have you been this half hour   clairville with impatience is mr freeman gone home madam   lady autumn no certainly he sups here tonight and you too i hope  we will join him in the garden he is there  but first mr belmour i would ask you a question  do you suspect your friend to be in love   clairville ha this may lead to a discovery  aside  i do madam   lady autumn you do  well that is heartily said and so do i  laughs  poor freeman  yes he is in love a person of the least discernment in the world might have perceived his passion   clairville then your ladyship has perceived it   lady autumn his sighs his languishments his tender assiduity  do you imagine all this could escape observation   clairville yet it did mine  how have i been deceived   aside lady autumn but has he not trusted you with the secret   clairville me madam was it likely he would own his passion to me   lady autumn i think so but you have found it out however and i doubt not can guess the object   clairville sighing yes madam i believe i can  but your ladyship knows i am sure   lady autumn i vow this is very provoking  know  yes certainly i know  that is i can guess  but sure you would not be so unpolite as to oblige me to name her   clairville well madam i will name her then but your ladyship must condescend    lady autumn condescend  bless me you are leading me very far methinks  i will not hear another word upon this subject  you are making conditions for your friend i find  but come tell me what would you have me condescend to   clairville when i have named the lady to tell me if i have guessed truly   lady autumn well i protest this is a very modest request  and to you would have me own  but name her  name her   clairville miss darcy   lady autumn looking disappointed miss darcy is this your discernment you never was more mistaken in your life   clairville am i mistaken madam   lady autumn certainly but i know upon what grounds  miss darcy has surprised us all with a sudden resolution to go into the country tomorrow and miss autumns tattling woman has told us that it is at mr freemans instigation  that he has provided a postchaise for her and is to conduct her himself she pretends to know this from his own servant  idle stuff  but we will railly him upon it   clairville so it is all out persidious courteney aside   lady autumn well what do you think of this absurd report   clairville that it may possibly be true madam for you say miss darcy is to leave you tomorrow   lady autumn yes but not to steal a marriage with mr freeman ha ha ha how people may be deceived do you understand the language of the eyes mr belmour   clairville the language of the eyes madam   lady autumn if you did you would not have been so much mistaken with regard to your friends attachment your suspicions would have fallen somewhere else i assure you  come shall we take the air in the garden the sun is almost set   lord clairville excuse me madam i have a little private business with mr freeman   lady autumn you will find him in the garden  i will bring you to him   clairville i will follow you madam  exeunt lady autumn and simple perfidious courtney it is too plain he has supplanted me basely supplanted me and the story he has told me of his sister was invented to excuse his sudden absence is this the friend who possessed more than a brothers part of my affections i have been his dupe his bubble i will find him instantly acquaint him with my detection of his perfidy and demand satisfaction   end of the third act act iv scene i a garden enter courteney and miss courteney talking courteney yes my dear sister i agree with you that lord clairville has acted with great delicacy and this frank offer of his hand is a proof that his esteem of you is equal to his love  but do not carry your gratitude too far do not encourage sentiments that must be suppressed the earl of belmont will never consent to your marriage  i am bound by honor to prevent it  endeavor then to banish him from your thoughts   miss courteney to banish him from my thoughts is  perhaps  not in my power but never to be his without your approbation i can and do promise because i am convinced you ought to act as you do   courteney and you hold to your resolution of going tomorrow   miss courteney i do   courteney how does this generous selfdenial endear you to me believe me my dear harriet it wrings my soul to be obliged thus to oppose your happiness  were any thing less than my honor at stake  but you are just enough to perceive the reasonableness of my conduct   miss courteney no more i beg you on this subject  but tell me when you will permit me to regain the confidence of my friend   courteney whom do you mean   miss courteney miss autumn  my sudden resolution to leave her tomorrow without being able to give her a satisfactory reason for it and your design of conducting me yourself having by some means or other come to her knowledge she suspects you are my lover and her resentment    courteney resentment does the suspicion of my being your lover give her any concern   miss courteney i am to blame i have betrayed my friends secret without being sure of his sentiments for her   aside courteney but tell me dear harriet is it possible that miss autumn can be jealous   miss courteney jealous what an inference has your vanity drawn miss courteney thinks i have entered into some engagements with you and considers my not having communicated them to her as a breach of our friendship   courteney confused yes to be sure  that is very natural  then she is angry  but as you say she considers it as a breach of friendship  that indeed accounts for her anger but tell me harriet are miss autumns affections wholly disengaged is there not one happy man in the world who has been able to touch her heart   miss courteney perhaps i may not tell you that but i will tell you whose heart she has touched   courteney that is no great matter  whose   miss courteney yours brother   courteney you may be mistaken   miss courteney am i mistaken   courteney no  now laugh if you will  but do not tell your friend i would not swell her triumph and be numbered in the list of her discarded admirers    miss courteney there is no danger of that i believe   courteney but what proofs have you of her partiality for me   miss courteney the strongest in one of her temper she affects to hate you   courteney that is a good sign i confess   miss courteney and me she has ceased to love now that she suspects me to be her rival i can perceive her heart is torn with jealousy yet she affects her usual gaiety and unconcern  but indifference is of all dispositions of the mind the hardest to feign and she is too little practiced in dissimulation to feign it well  i wish it were consistent with your plan to own our secret   courteney do not press me on this subject  my situation is already sufficiently perplexing  should lord clairville suspect you are my sister  but i think i see him in the next walk  leave me dear harriet  i would not have him find us alone   exit miss courteney enter lord clairville clairville it was she  they separated at my approach  both both are perfidious   aside   courteney my lord you seem chagrined at something  what is the matter   clairville ask your own heart  have you dealt ingenuously with me in regard to the lady who parted from you this moment   courteney  hesitating my lord    clairville i will spare you any further dissimulation sir i know all   courteney i am sorry for it my lord because it convinces me of my sisters imprudence  she has broke her word with me weak girl  aside   clairville your sisters imprudence  yes that was one of your artifices to furnish you with an excuse for quitting me  false false courteney   courteney forbear these unjust reproaches my lord  by heaven till this day i knew not that my sister    clairville no more of your evasions sir  the story you told me of your sister may or may not be true it matters not though it is most likely it was feigned to cover your designs upon miss darcy   courteney he knows her not yet i find she has kept her promise  my generous sister  aside   clairville you knew my passion for miss darcy  confiding in your friendship my unsuspecting heart trusted you without reserve and while you were treacherously supplanting me in her affections i was weak enough to believe that your eagerness of opposition was the effect of a prudential regard to my interest   courteney and so it was  so it is still    clairville villain it is false    courteney ha villain  he thinks i have wronged him  but then this outrage  villain it is too much    clairville yes villain i repeat the term and will support my assertion lead where you please i will follow you   courteney  after a pause no my lord i will neither lead nor follow you at present you think i am your rival  think so still  after the treatment i have received from you it would be mean to undeceive you   clairville against such plain such convincing circumstances what can you offer in your justification   courteney nothing  i will offer nothing  and yet i could undeceive you with a single word  but you do not deserve this condescension my lord  you who have condemned your friend unheard  who have suffered a light illgrounded suspicion to rob him of the merit of many years faithful attachment  injured insulted and branded him with the name of villain  while he  but no more  hereafter you will know the motives upon which i have acted  then when shame and remorse for your offense have entitled you to my forgiveness then i may think you worthy of an explanation   clairville this language is very bold sir  sure you forget    courteney oh no  i remember you are a lord a title greatly inferior to that of a man of honor    clairville how sir   courteney my lord nobility is virtue or it is nothing   clairville well grant it possible i may have wronged you by my suspicions  answer me then one question is it true that you go with miss darcy tomorrow   courteney it is    clairville you own it   courteney i do  and    clairville no more  i am convinced  thou mean seducer  but hope not to carry it thus triumphantly  within this half hour meet me behind the gardenwall  there if i cannot obtain satisfaction from the man i will at least do justice on a coward    courteney coward my lord i will meet you   clairville it is well  i shall expect you exit clairville   courteney  after a pause in taking revenge a man is only even with his enemy in passing it over he is superior  this sounds well the practice is something difficult  but is lord clairville my enemy  a lover and jealous appearances strong too against me but such an outrage villain coward   enter miss courteney miss courteney oh brother how greatly you distress me i heard high words between lord clairville and you he shot by me this moment with looks inflamed with rage  scarce bowed to me in passing  i fear you have quarreled   courteney calm yourself dear harriet and conside in my prudence   miss courteney excuse me brother but i cannot help telling you that your prudence has hitherto produced nothing but confusion by some means or other the whole family knows that i go under your conduct tomorrow   courteney this must be owing to some imprudence  i doubt    miss courteney your relation to me being a secret this has raised a suspicion of my having entered into a clandestine engagement with you on this account miss autumn has withdrawn her friendship from me lord clairville despises me and you are become the object of his resentment all these inconveniences might have been prevented had you declared yourself my brother   courteney perhaps not  obliged as i am in honor to oppose lord clairvilles passion for you had i acknowledged you to be my sister i should have exposed myself to importunities which it would have been difficult to have rejected and after all my conduct might have had the appearance of artifice   miss courteney my heart forebodes some misfortune  were it not better to own me now to lord clairville than to leave him in a mistake which draws his suspicions on you   courteney it is indeed unlucky that he should suspect me to be his rival had he been more temperate i believe i should have undeceived him but now an explanation would seem cowardice walks aside   miss courteney  aside ah i perceive how it is i must and will prevent it  lady autumn this is fortunate   enter lady autumn miss courteney i beg of you dear madam not to quit mr freeman  something has happened    lady autumn what  has he explained himself to you then   miss courteney explained himself to me madam i find your ladyship knows something of the matter   lady autumn i believe i do    miss courteney then madam you see the necessity of preventing    lady autumn i understand you  leave me with him   miss courteney if i can but see lord clairville before they meet again  aside and exit hastily   lady autumn it is so  he has not had courage to declare his passion to me himself and has employed her to mediate for him  i think i have carried punctilio far enough  so respectful a flame deserves  he sees me and advances  mr freeman you have chosen the most retired part of the garden to walk in these shades are a nurse for tender thoughts as the poet says   courteney my thoughts madam    lady autumn come come  i have known your thoughts for some time i know you love  i know too that you are beloved   courteney and do you condescend to tell me so madam   lady autumn i do and yet perhaps i ought not but your respectful silence has had its weight with me i assure you   courteney and has miss autumn madam consented   lady autumn miss autumn though mistress of her fortune by her fathers will has yet much to hope for from my favor  she will hardly presume to offer any opposition or if she should    courteney ah madam did you not this moment flatter me with the hope of being beloved   lady autumn yes you are beloved i repeat it   courteney then surely no opposition is to be apprehended  your consent secures my happiness  thus let me thank your ladyship    kneels and kisses her hand lady autumn oh rise  these raptures  yet methinks he scarcely touched my hand  what invincible respect  aside   enter a footman footman madam the earl of belmont is at the gate and sends to know if your ladyship is at home   lady autumn the earl of belmont i hardly know him  admit his lordship what can this visit mean   courteney it is strange yet it is lucky   aside nothing could happen more fortunate for me madam than my lord belmonts visit whatever be the occasion of it his lordship can acquaint you with some particulars relating to my family and character which it is necessary you should know and which will serve to show you that i am not wholly unworthy of the honor you design me   lady autumn i am impatient till i see him  adieu   exit lady autumn enter miss courteney miss courteney sure never was any thing so unfortunate lord clairville is not to be found   courteney my dear sister i have the most surprising news to tell you    miss courteney it is good news then for you look pleased   courteney lady autumn is the most generous woman in the world and i am the happiest of men    miss courteney what do you mean   courteney would you think it your dear saucy tormenting lovely friend has owned an inclination for me to her stepmother and this paragon of stepmothers overlooking the inequality of fortune is determined to make us happy and has promised me her hand   miss courteney you amaze me   courteney it is true and just at the moment when i was preparing to acquaint her with my real name lord belmont arrives from whom the discovery will come with more advantage   miss courteney lord belmont here my fears of a quarrel are at an end  i suppose i am now at liberty to convince miss autumn that i cannot be her rival  she promised to join me in the garden    courteney paint if you can your brothers transports and obtain me permission to throw myself at her feet mean time i will attend lord belmont who is doubtless come hither in search of his son our little excursion will draw some reproaches from him but when he knows all i shall be justified in his opinion as for you my dear harriet your conduct has been so generous    miss courteney no more on this subject i entreat you  i shall be impatient to know what passes between the earl and you  you will find me here in the garden   courteney i will come to you  adieu   exeunt severally end of the fourth act act v scene i the drawing room enter lady autumn and lord belmont lady autumn what you tell me my lord surprises me greatly your son here in windsor under a borrowed name and a constant visitor at my house  what an adventure   lord belmont it is very true madam he left paris with his governor some weeks ago without acquainting me with their intention and as i am informed have passed the greatest part of their time here  are there not two young gentlemen who visit your ladyship under the names of belmour and freeman   lady autumn pray my lord which of them is your son   lord belmont he who calls himself belmour the other is his governor a young man of a good family but low fortunes whose father was my friend and upon that account as well as for the good qualities i observed in him i determined to take care of his fortune i placed him at the university of leyden and when he had finished his studies sent him to travel with my son to whose care i confided him  young as he is his merit justified my choice of him for this trust   lady autumn no doubt of it my lord  all the world must approve of your choice mr freemans merit  but freeman is not his name your lordship says   lord belmont no madam courteney is his real name   lady autumn courteney  your lordship had reason to say he is of a good family  courteney is a name that any person might be proud to own   lord belmont and he always supported the honor of it till now   lady autumn till now my lord  i am sorry  your lordship must excuse me  but any imputation cast upon mr freeman  mr courteney i mean    lord belmont i see madam you are prejudiced in his favor i am not surprised at it  courteney has many good qualities but to me he has shown himself ungrateful i confided my son to his care and he has either led him into this misconduct or has concurred with him in it either way he has betrayed his trust   lady autumn a youthful frolic perhaps love   lord belmont aye madam that is what i apprehend  your ladyship must excuse me but although miss antumn is an accomplished young lady    lady autumn your lordship is extremely mistaken miss autumn is not the object of mr courteneys vows i assure you   lord belmont mr courteney madam is his own master he may offer his vows where he pleases but i persuade myself your ladyship will not encourage my son in a clandestine address to miss autumn when you know that i have other views for him  it was to tell you this madam that i took the liberty to trouble you with a visit   lady autumn i do assure you my lord i know of no correspondence between lord clairville and miss autumn  i never expected to be consulted by her upon these occasions a motherinlaw of my years cannot be supposed to have much authority over a girl of one and twenty   enter simple hastily simple oh dear madam i am in such a fright i hope your ladyship will excuse me but here is mr belmours servant who tells us that his master and mr freeman have quarrelled and are gone out to fight   lord belmont what can this mean  quarrelled  with your leave madam  bid the fellow come hither   exit simple lady autumn it cannot be my lord i left mr courteney a few minutes ago   enter william william my old lord here we are all blown up aside   lord belmont well sir what is the meaning of the alarm you have given the family   william pray my lord pardon me i am but a servant and was obliged to obey the orders that were given me   lord belmont what orders   william i brought my young lord his pistols as he commanded me and to be sure i believe some mischief is going forwards for i know my lord and his governor have quarrelled i overheard them in the garden i was behind an hedge  a challenge passed between them and my young lord meeting me sent me to bring his case of pistols i followed my lord unobserved and saw which way he went and some time afterward i saw mr courteney taking the same path   lord belmont bring me instantly to the place i may yet prevent their rashness   exeunt lord belmont and william enter miss courteney miss courteney oh madam i thought my brother had been with you   lady autumn your brother  but this is no time for explanations i will follow lord belmont  my fears distract me exit lady autumn   miss courteney alas what are your fears to mine  oh charlotte   enter miss autumn miss autumn well madam your coquetry has produced fine effects  two of the most amiable young men in the world are this moment perhaps dying by each others hand and you the cause  false woman    miss courteney my coquetry dear charlotte mr freeman   miss autumn name him not would i had never seen him  but you how have you deceived me  such insatiate vanity in one who pretended to be so far superior to all the little foibles of her sex  who was continually pressing her grave rebukes upon me and throwing out moral sentences at every turn  away  hypocrisy at eighteen  unnatural vice   miss courteney my dear charlotte these are unjust reproaches i never was your rival  mr freeman is my brother   miss autumn freeman your brother  freeman mr courteney  how barbarously have i treated you   miss courteney alas perhaps i have no brother now neither of us knew each other till this day and then an accident  but i cannot enter into particulars  dear charlotte let us haste    miss autumn whither would you go my dear we shall have some intelligence presently  all the servants are gone after them   miss courteney shocking intelligence perhaps  oh why have i concealed this fatal secret so long   miss autumn why indeed but let me not blame you  i have been too rash already in my censures   miss courteney sure the sight of lord belmont  but he may come too late  i cannot bear this cruel suspense any longer going   miss autumn stopping her here is somebody coming  my dear dear harriet i give you joy your brothers safe it is him    enter mr courteney miss courteney my brother  thank heaven  but oh lord clairville  aside  what terrors have you caused us where is your friend   courteney be not alarmed my dear nothing has happened  but the whole house is in strange confusion how came this foolish affair to be known  miss autumn ha she looks as if she had been weeping delightful thought her fears perhaps for me  going up to miss autumn will you pardon me madam for the disingenuity i have been guilty of in appearing before you so long under a borrowed name my sister may have informed you that    miss autumn your sister sir has been under too much anxiety for you to enter into explanations  my dear harriet when you have chid your brother sufficiently for the fright he has put you into come and give me the history of this pretty adventure that i may know whether i ought to pardon him or not exit miss autumn   miss courteney oh brother what affliction would you have spared me had you permitted me to undeceive lord clairville   courteney as things were situated it was not fit you should   miss courteney but have you met   courteney yes i met him i thought i could not in honor avoid it   miss courteney oh heavens    courteney be calm and hear the event he brought pistols and insisted upon my taking one he then bid me fire i refused saying that as i was resolved he should in every point be the aggressor he should fire first he did and missed me and on my soul i believe designedly for by the changes in his countenance i could perceive that grief and not anger was then the predominant passion in his mind  my turn was next i fired my pistol in the air then calmly told him that his father was here and that i would explain myself in his presence he spoke not a word but bowed and left me and we took different paths to the house  but tell me dear harriet does miss autumn seem to know her mothers favorable intentions has she acknowledged any thing to you   miss courteney i have seen her but for a few moments since you left me and neither of us was then in a humor to enter upon a discourse of that kind but now that she knows who you are she will certainly have no reserves to me  adieu i am going to her   exit miss courteney courteney  alone lady autumns generosity is so surprising that it looks more like caprice than a design taken up upon reflection i dont know what to make of it   enter lord belmont lord belmont so sir you are here i have been in search of you where is my son how has your honorable rencounter ended   courteney not dishonourably my lord for either of us  lord clairville will be here this moment he will do me the justice to acknowledge that this affair was forced upon me   lord belmont ungrateful youth and dare you own to me too dare you own a quarrel with my son   courteney my lord i can no more suffer an injury than i dare do one   lord belmont this is the language of conscious worth and but ill becomes a man who has so basely betrayed the trust that was reposed in him   courteney basely betrayed my trust my lord   lord belmont yes sir basely   courteney this reproach this unjust reproach my lord  but you have been my benefactor i know how much that sacred title claims from me  rail on my lord you shall never force me to be ungrateful   enter clairville clairville my father how can i appear before you after what has passed how can i hope for pardon   lord belmont rise clairville you have been to blame but so have i your fault has been the consequence of my imprudent choice of a governor for you you have forgot your duty but he was your seducer   clairville no my lord whatever reason i may have to complain of mr courteney in one particular instance in which i only am concerned yet let me justify to yourself your choice he has in every respect fulfilled your intentions and faithfully discharged the trust which you reposed in him   lord belmont faithfully discharged his trust he who could engage in licentious brawls with his pupil and attempt the life of one committed to his care   clairville my lord    lord belmont be silent you can say nothing that can extenuate guilt like this mr courteney after what has happened you must not reckon upon my friendship  the salary i allowed you while traveling with my son is yours for life  but we must meet no more if you consider the loss of my protection as a misfortune remember you have yourself only to blame for it   courteney there is but one real misfortune my lord which a man can suffer and that is when he is conscious of a crime and has any thing to reproach himself with the salary your lordship offers me i will not accept judging of me as you do you cannot mean it as a reward and low as my fortunes are i will not be indebted to compassion for that which your esteem only ought to bestow upon me lord clairville i promised you an explanation before your father and    clairville hold sir it is but just that i should first clear you of an imputation which cannot wound you more than it has me  my lord you have reproached mr courteney without cause he sought not my life but gave it me when in his power i urged him with the most opprobrious terms to accept my challenge and when my rashness had given him an advantage he forbore to take it   lord belmont if this be true i have wronged him greatly wronged him   clairville oh courteney a treacherous rival and a generous enemy how can you reconcile this contradiction   courteney i never was your rival my lord it is my sister whom you have all this time addressed under the name of darcy   clairville miss darcy your sister   courteney neither she nor i knew this circumstance till today when an accident which i shall ever remember discovered us to each other i opposed your passion for her at first through prudence but when i knew her to be my sister my honor was more immediately concerned to prevent the continuance of an attachment which could never have the sanction of your fathers consent my sister with a spirit becoming her birth adopted my sentiments she refused your offered hand and consented that i should conduct her where you could not have access to her hence rose your jealousy and the consequences that followed   lord belmont courteney you have acted nobly in this affair   courteney i have done my duty   lord belmont but what brought your sister hither and why did she conceal her name   courteney she took refuge with miss autumn from the bigotry of her aunt who not having been able to pervert her to the roman catholic religion by the offer of settling her whole fortune upon her was laying schemes to entrap her into a convent   lord belmont something of this i heard before and had determined to enquire into it  is miss courteney still here   courteney she is my lord but tomorrow i shall take her into the country lord clairville will then i hope forget a slight impression which he will have no oppurtunity of increasing   lord belmont generous youth  yet you have one more task to perform worthy your disinterestedness  engage my son  i know your influence over him  engage him to submit to my choice   clairville alas my lord were it possible for me to cease to love miss courteney your commands were sufficient  in this and only in this one point i cannot obey you   lord belmont courteney i rely upon your honor   courteney you may my lord securely   lord belmont worthy son of a father whom i loved and esteemed i will not entreat you to pardon the harsh treatment you have received from me till i have made you an atonement equal to the injury  i leave you to complete your reconciliation with your friend   exit lord belmont clairville i scarce can look up to you courteney  such nobleness such generosity to fall under my mean suspicions  can you forgive me   courteney let us exchange forgiveness my lord  i was to blame for leaving you so long in a mistake which occasioned these suspicions   clairville my friend my brother  yes courteney it must be so  your sister    courteney think of her no more my lord  are you not convinced by what has past today that you are not to expect my concurrence in this affair   clairville alas i am indeed  yet leave your sister to her own determination   courteney my sister is already determined   clairville i see i am doomed to be miserable there is no hope of obtaining my fathers consent and your too rigid honor    courteney banish from your heart then a hopeless passion and if possible bend your will to your fathers choice   clairville never do not urge me on that head my resolution is fixed   enter lord belmont lady autumn miss autumn miss courteney and simple lady autumn oh mr freeman  mr courteney i

myself without your consent but    lord belmont this you promise then   clairville i do my lord  sighing   lord belmont it is something though not all that i have a right to expect from you   clairville you have indeed my lord a right to expect my obedience in all things possible but i can never    lord belmont make no rash resolutions son for i will be obeyed behold my choice   taking miss courteneys hand and leading her toward him miss courteney surprised my lord   clairville my father can this be real   lord belmont take her clairville the best the worthiest gift a father can bestow a truly virtuous woman she who could sacrifice her fortune to her conscience and subject her inclinations to her duty who could despise riches and triumph over love she brings you in herself a treasure more valuable than both the indies take her my son and endeavor to deserve her   clairville best of fathers  this amazing goodness  oh let me thank you thus  kneels   lord belmont courteney i have yet but half discharged the debt i owe you  generous young man had i a daughter  but in all things except the name i am your father   courteney all the gratitude the reverence the duty that sacred title claims expect from me my lord   lady autumn mr courteney after such a testimony to your merit i need not blush to declare my intentions    courteney i acknowledge your ladyships goodness  you have permitted me to hope for favor here   addressing himself to miss autumn  how blessed should i be if you madam would confirm it   lady autumn how is this   miss courteney  half aside to miss autumn now dear charlotte do not play off any of your too agreeable airs  did you not half an hour ago own to me that    miss autumn smiling ah do not betray me  well sir since you have obtained my mamas consent though i cannot imagine how i will not hazard the loss of her favor by my disobedience  here is my hand since it must be so   courteney charming creature to deserve it will be my glory   lady autumn i am confounded  simple  do i dream   aside to her simple no indeed madam you do not dream now you are but just awake and have been dreaming all this time  i always told your ladyship that if the gentleman was in love it must be with one of the young ladies   lady autumn confusion   courteney what can this disorder mean dear madam if i have been so unfortunate as to have offended you    lady autumn ah that seducing accent  simple even at this moment might not one believe  but i shall relapse  lead me to my chamber  my lord a sudden indisposition  oh what a delusion   exeunt lady autumn and simple courteney here is some mystery   miss autumn  aside to miss courteney i could unfold it i believe   lord belmont to miss autumn be not uneasy madam i take upon myself to reconcile lady autumn to your generous choice   courteney lord clairville i give you joy and yet congratulations from me on the completion of your wishes may appear selfinterested but if my sister continues to maintain those sentiments she has this day manifested the rectitude of her heart will in some measure atone for the inferiority of her rank and fortune as for me though perhaps i have proved myself rather too young to be your governor i am yet old enough to be your friend and shall ever be proud of that distinction not from the consideration of your wealth and honor but because i am convinced that you want neither example nor precept to instruct you that there are no characters so truly noble as that of a woman of virtue and a man of real honor   epilogue written by dr goldsmith spoken by mrs bulkley what five long acts  and all to make us wiser our authoress sure has wanted an adviser had she consulted me she should have made her moral play a speaking masquerade warmed up each bustling scene and in her rage have emptied all the greenroom on the stage my life on it this had kept her play from sinking have pleased our eyes and saved the pain of thinking well since she thus has shown her want of skill what if i give a masquerade i will but how ay there is the rub pausing i have got my cue the worlds a masquerade the masquers you you you to boxes pit gall lud what a groupe the motley scene discloses false wits false wives false virgins and false spouses statesmen with bridles on and close beside em patriots in party colored suits that ride em there hebes turned of fifty try once more to raise a flame in cupids of threescore these in their turn with appetites as keen deserting fifty fasten on fifteen miss not yet full fifteen with fire uncommon flings down her sampler and takes up the woman the little urchin smiles and spreads her lure and tries to kill ere she is got power to cure thus it is with all  their chief and constant care is to seem every thing  but what they are yon broad bold angry spark i fix my eye on who seems to have robbed his vizor from the lion who frowns and talks and swears with round parade looking as who should say damme who is afraid mimicking strip but his vizor off and sure i am you will find his lionship a very lamb yon politician famous in debate perhaps to vulgar eyes bestrides the state yet when he deigns his real shape to assume he turns old woman and bestrides a broom yon patriot too who presses on your sight and seems to every gazer all in white if with a bribe his candor you attack he bows turns round and whip  the mans a black yon critic too  but whither do i run if i proceed our bard will be undone well then a truce since she requests it too do you spare her and i will for once spare you
