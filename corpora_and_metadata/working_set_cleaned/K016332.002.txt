the delicate distress a novel  the delicate distress a novel in letters  in two volumes  by frances  vol ii  lamour ne peut jamais subsister sans peine dans une ame delicate mais ses peine memes sont quelquefois la source de ses plus doux plaisirs  recueil anonyme dublin printed by brett smith for the united company of booksellers mdcclxxxvii  the delicate distress letter i lady woodville to lady straffon i do indeed my dear fanny sincerely rejoice at the pleasing prospects which seem to open to your new friends i also congratulate you on being in so high a degree instrumental to their happiness  i think i may almost say that providence seems to interest itself in the future sat of the amiable laura  there is something very particular in your becoming accidentally acquainted with lady somerville so critically  had your meeting with this charming woman been deferred but a month longer the connection between ye might in all probability have been only productive of unavailing good wishes and mutual esteem  but the lucky arrival of signior lodovico has made you a principal performer in the great drama of lauras life  though not an absolute predestinarian i am apt to believe that there is a sort of fate in marriage and as one absurdity creates another i find i must lean a little to the manichean doctrine to establish my thesis by supposing that there is a good and evil genius which presides occasionally at that great crisis on which all the color of our future lives depend i sincerely hope that lauras union with the young melespini will be completed under the happiest auspices  i do not feel one doubt arise in my mind with regard to his fathers consent  the only cloud which i foresee to intercept the brightest sunshine will arise from the separation of lady somerville and laura  but that like a cloud also will pass away  for though the tenderest affection for a husband does not oppose the natural claims of parents or relations on our hearts i in some measure lessens their force  our hopes and fears are directed to another object and selflove strengthens our attachment to that person on whom we find our happiness depends  you see i have a passion for philosophizing upon every subject  where incidents do not abound it would be impossible to keep up even a monthly correspondence without these little aids i will not call them arts for i detest the mean idea which is conveyed by that expression  i shall be glad to have my expectations gratified by hearing of the counts immediate concurrence with his sons inclinations  in the mean time i beg you to present my compliments to lady somerville and her fair daughter and to assure them that i regret my not having the pleasure of being known to them  fanny weston is quite transported at the happy meeting of lodovico and laura but says she can so scarce believe it true because it is likely to send so fortunately  i can perceive that lady harriet has doubts with regard to the event but as she finds me sanguine on the subject she suppresses them  sir james thornton with a sigh exclaimed what an happy man is lodovico to find the object of his passion disengaged this has left me more in the dark than ever with regard to his attachment for i am pretty sure lady harriet is not his object  i cannot help remarking upon this occasion how much the particularities of our own situation affect our judgments with regard to others and how much more than we are willing to allow our opinions are warped and biassed by it even in matters that appear indifferent to us  adieu my fanny  true love from me and mine to you and yours  e woodville  letter ii lady straffon to lady woodville my dear emily shall from henceforth be our augur  be her predictions fortunate and be they ever verified  the wished for packet is at length arrived  it contained a letter for lodovico and one for lady somerville  the moment he had read his which was fraught with congratulations from all his friends and the most plenary indulgence from his fond father to his ardent wishes he entreated me to go with him instantly to the cottage  we almost flew there and lodovico in the highest rapture acquainted lady somerville and his loved laura with the glad tidings  lady somerville received the news with tears of joy conflicting passions warred in lauras face gladness and grief took turns the bright suffusion of her cheeks the brilliant animation of her eyes expressed her heart felt joy but when she turned those eyes upon her mother their radiance was obscured by starting tears the transient roses fled from her fair cheeks and left the lily mistress of the field  lady somerville was affected by these sudden emotions and retired to peruse her brothers letter  she returned soon and giving it into my hands said with a sigh by this you may judge if i flattered my brother by calling him the most generous of men alas why must i appear unworthy of his kindness by declining it but when he knows my reasons for so doing i hope he will acquiesce in them and pardon me  upon reading the counts letter i found that after testifying his joy at his sons attachment to laura he added that it was from the mothers hand he hoped to receive the daughter and conjured her by the friendship that had ever subsisted between them to return to her native country with her children to hold the first place in his house and to contribute by her presence to restore that happiness which had been deeply wounded by the loss of an amiable wife  when i had finished the letter which i read aloud i feel myself unhappy said lady somerville in not being able to comply with my kind brothers request  it is long much longer than i thought it would be since i devoted the remant of my wretched days to solitude  here i have lived and here will pass that portion of my life which heaven may yet allot me  as she spoke i thought i saw her expressive eyes fixed on her lords picture as if addressing her vows to him but she had scarcely finished when laura springing from her seat fell at her mothers feet and catching her hand cried out my more than parent is it possible your love for me should have so little power and could you part so easily with her whom i have often heard you call the living transcript of your dear dead lord but laura must not cannot quit her mother all pleasing prospects vanish at that thought which makes the word appear even more a solitude than ever i found this cottage  the parents heart was touched  no my beloved child said she i will not bar your happiness  since you desire it i will again behold the fatal place which gave me birth and even strive to lose the sad remembrance of my griefs in your felicity  i owe this sacrifice to lauras filial tenderness  what would my child have more  tears and embraces supplied the place of language or rather superceded it for some time but when their emotions had subsided the young pair expressed their joy and gratitude at lady somervilles condescension in the most proper terms and the evening was spent in such a manner as could only be pleasing to those who are blessed with feeling hearts  the count has accompanied his letter with a very noble present to enable his sister and niece to appear as the widow and daughter of lord somerville  there is something above pride in that thought  as lodovico and i returned home he entreated me to use my interest with lady somerville to consent to his being privately married by her ladyships chaplain before they set out for genoa  i think she can have no objection to this request  i hope i shall be able in a few days to send my emily an account that this affair is happily concluded  till then adieu f straffon  letter iii lady straffon to lady woodville when the subjects are pleasing i find narrative writing not so dull as i once thought  i begin to fear i shall make but a poor figure in the epistolary way when i have concluded my little novel for i honestly confess that my dear emily beats me all to nothing in the moralizing strain  sorry am i on this account only that i must now proceed to the denouement of my simple yet interesting story  lady somerville desired two days to consider of lodovicos proposal at the end of that time she expressed her consent in a most elegant letter to me  she said that as she had on every occasion concurred with my requests she hoped i would not think her too presuming to make one to me which was that i would accept of her cottage with every thing which it contained except her lords picture and that with my permission she would fill its vacant place with lauras portrait  i was both pleased and distressed at her politeness and generosity  i accepted her present  in that charming sejour i shall spend many hours in thinking of its amiable owner and in reflecting on the inscrutable ways of providence who after so many trials has been pleased to restore this valuable woman to her country and friends  such characters as hers were never meant to droop in obscurity she owes herself to society and will i hope recover some degree of that happiness she thinks totally lost in the exercise of those virtues which in her retired state she could never be called on to exert  slight as the preparations were for a wedding which it was determined should be private they took up every moment of our time till yesterday morning when lodovico lucy sir john my little emily and i set out together for the cottage before breakfast  we were received by lady somerville and the charming bride with that graceful ease and politeness which is the result of good sense and operates equally upon all occasions after breakfast sir john led leura into the chapel lady somerville presented her hand to lodovico the priest and alter were prepared sir john had the honor of personating lauras father and had the pleasure of completing lodovicos wishes by bestowing her hand where she had already given her heart the servour of lady somervilles devotion was truly edifying when the ceremony was over she endeavored in vain to suppress her tears but they were tears of joy  sir john presented the bride with a pair of earrings and a cross of diamonds and i had the pleasure of placing my picture in a bracelet upon lady somervilles arm from the elegence of our dinner and supper at the cottage i apprehend that lady somerville is one of those extraordinary characters who do not think that the most refined understanding or the most exalted sentiments place a woman above the little duties of life  the new married couple are to dine with me this day sir john is gone to try if he can prevail upon lady somerville to accompany them next week they set out for genoa they are to occupy our house in town while they stay in london may their voyage thither and through life be attended with prosperous gales amen and adieu  my dear sister f straffon  letter iv lady woodville to lady straffon i sincerely congratulate my dear fanny on the fortunate denouement of her pleasing and interesting narrative and join in her good wishes for the happiness of lady somerville and the new married pair  as you seem inclined to rally me on my turn for moralizing i shall not exert it at present though i think lady somervilles story a very proper subject for it  but to deal ingeously i have a stronger reason for declining to expatiate on it than what i have mentioned which is my being stinted in time as i am going to dine at lord witherss where we shall stay this night on thursday we are to dine at sir william lawsons and friday is fixed for our setting out for york  this short letter will probably be the last you will receive from me till my return from thence if i were superstitious i would not go to york as i cannot help feeling a kind of presentiment against it why did lord seymour attempt to inspire me with this disgust i will not reason farther upon the subject  obedience is better than sacrifice but pray is not that sometimes the greatest we can make  affectionate regards and sincere congratulations wait on the hosts and guests at straffonhill from all this house and from  yours most truly e woodville  letter v lord woodville to lord seymour in justice to those friendly apprehensions which you seem to suffer on my account i think i ought to inform you that the somuch dreaded event of an interview with the marchioness is over without my being sensible of the least ill consequence from it all lovely all engaging as she is i had armed my heart with the remembrance of her former treatment and though the little rebel did flutter at her sight i think its emotions were rather the effect of resentment than a softer passion  the worst symptom i discovered in myself i will be perfectly sincere was my being piqued at the composure of her air and deportment when she first saluted me is it possible seymour she can be really indifferent or is it only the artifice of her sex that makes her appear so  as the room was very full and she stood at some distance from me before i could approach her she was taken out to dance by lord bellingham  when her first minuet was over she desired i should be called out and though i felt the utmost reluctance to accept the compliment it was impossible to refuse i am certain i never acquitted myself so ill in my life you have seen her dance and therefore know that the eyes of the whole company were engaged by her and my confusion passed unnoticed  as i led her to her seat she wished me joy and asked if the fair cause of it was in the room i answered yes  she then entreated i would present her to lady woodville whom she longed to see more than any person in england as lord seymour had told her that she was a perfect beauty  i made no reply hut led her to the place where lady woodville sat who received her with the utmost ease and politeness i swear to you my dear seymour that emily never appeared half so lovely in my eyes as at that moment the innocence and gaiety of her heart lighted up her charms and i flattered myself that the marchionesss brow seemed overcast with the pale hue of envy  lady harriet and she renewed their acquaintance they all soon after joined your sister sandford and continued in the same party for the remainder of the evening i danced country dances with one of the miss broughtons and returned home triumphing in the just preference which my heart accorded to lady woodville on the comparison i had drawn in the ball room between her and the marchioness  fear for me no longer my too timid friend but congratulate me on the most arduous of all victories having conquered myself  yours ever woodville  letter vi lord seymour to lord woodville hotwells bristol dear woodville i thank you for the attention you have shown to those apprehensions which you seem to think groundless i did not expect to hear from you during your stay at york the constant hurry and dissipation of the scene would have been a sufficient excuse for your silence both to me and yourself if you had not fancied you had not good news to communicate  i know you incapable of the smallest deceit and am certain that you think your last a faithful transcript of your heart but alas my friend you impose upon yourself if you imagine your passion for the marchioness extinct or that it is possible for you to give a preference however justly deserved to any other woman breathing therefore for the truly amiable lady woodvilles sake i conjure you to avoid all future comparisons as i think it will be highly injurious to her merits to put her on a level with that object which your partiality has made you look upon as the standard of perfection  after the confession of my own weakness i condemn myself for reasoning with you upon this subject  i know it is preaching to the winds  our passions make our fate and we ought to suffer without repining those calamities we bring upon ourselves but what philosophy should enable us to bear the heartrending agonies of having involved the innocent in our punishment and rendered the amiable and deserving unhappy who can speak peace to my sad heart when i reflect upon the miseries in which i have plunged the everdear charlotte beaumont  i know this horrid image will shock your nature and for a time you will shudder at yourself but quickly say these are the gloomy visions of seymours disturbed brain i would not make my emily unhappy for the world  then fly directly to the marchioness to banish the sad thought  but i have done for ever on the theme for if this picture does not speak to your heart i cannot paint more strongly  my wishes for your happiness but without hope except in flight shall still attend upon you and my highest esteem shall ever wait upon the lovely lady woodville  seymour  letter vii lord woodville to lord seymour my dear seymour i confess your last letter shocked me extremely but not from the motives you may possibly imagine i am truly grieved to find your mind so overclouded or ingrained with the dark tints of melancholy as not to allow your reason fair play answer me were you not just then returned from the methodists chapel when you sat down to write when i expected congratulations songs of triumph and the laurel wreath how could you cruelly pop an old fashioned prophecy upon me of what never was nor is nor ever shall be  but away with thy dismal presages thou pseudomagus have i not told thee infidel as thou art that no action of my life should ever discover the real state of my heart to lady woodville or make her think it was not all her own have i not been married above eight months and am i not now just as tender and obliging as the first day we were united  had thou real pity or compassion thou would advise me to desist from my pursuit of the marchioness on her account rather than lady woodvilles o seymour what a triumph would it be if i could humble this proud beauty and pay her scorn for scorn again reduce her to that soft trembling voice with which she first uttered those dear sounds i love  recall her image to your view on the first night we met her at the bois do boulogne  what perfect beauty amazing grace and native modesty beamed round her angel form  there is a picture for you and i hope much more to the life than your tisiphone  i have often thought of asking you by what talisman or spell your heart was preserved from becoming her instant victim you did not know your charlotte then perhaps you felt the marchionesss power and loved like me but in pity to your friend endeavored to suppress your passion i should adore you if i thought it were so  i do not think her half so beautiful as she was then though her person is much more improved  she can be gazed at now without a blush and wears a rouge i suppose in order to heighten the finest complexion in the whole world  we  on the raceground she ha  old a pharobank for her at  gaged me to prevail on lady wood  of the party  she seemed vastly med with her but whenever she mentions her assumes a peculiar air of sensibility  i think i heard her sigh when she pronounced the name  what an odd mortal was i to sit down to write when i have scarce time to breathe sir james thorntons mare was distanced he has lost above five hundred pounds but what is much worse i think he has lost himself  i never saw such an alteration in any creature i am almost sorry i brought him to woodfort  the ladies fancy he is in love but i cannot get the secret out of the simpleton lady woodville and her nymphs are much yours i entreat you will drink half a dozen bumpers of burgundy before you sit down to write again to  yours sincerely woodville  letter viii lord woodville to lord seymour ah seymour what a tale have i to unfold to you i am undone for ever lost to virtue relapsed again to all my former follies  i dote i die for love do not despise me seymour but once again stretch forth thy friendly hand and strive to save a sinking wretch alas it is in vain fate overwhelms me and i must yield to the impetuous torrent but hear my story first before you pronounce stern sentence on me and guilty as i am perhaps you will pity me  for some days past the marchioness contrived to throw herself perpetually in my way and strove to engage me in the most interesting conversations by hinting at particular scenes in which we had formerly been actors fool that i was the recollection charmed me and my weak heart expended with delight at the repetition of its former follies  last night your sister lady sandford not being well declined going to the ball the marchioness sent to lady woodville to desire she might attend her to the rooms emily politely assented and they went together  she returned and supped with us  after supper she said she hated being cooped up in a carriage at the course and asked if i could lend her a horse for the next day the ladies informed her that no woman of fashion ever appeared on horseback at a race she replied she had no idea of a salique law imposed by jockies that she despised all vulgar prejudices and would be the first to break through this arbitrary rule if she could engage any lady to accompany her  she soon prevailed on miss weston who rides remarkably well to be of her party and again applied to me for a horse i told her i had not one that had been used to carry a lady but if she would venture on that which i usually rode it should be at her service  she accepted my offer and after dinner the next day fanny weston ransford and i attended her at lady sandfords and sure there never was so lovely a figure as she made on horseback   diana huntress mistress of the groves  the charming isabel speaks looks and moves when we came to the raceground all the company thronged round her and though the horses were then running she seemed to be the sole object of every ones attention she affected to be displeased at the general gaze and said if there was room in lady woodvilles carriage she would get into it we rode up immediately to it but on perceiving that emily was in the chariot and lady harriet with her she would not suffer me to mention her design lest it might be inconvenient to my wife whose present condition is now very apparent  thornton was by the side of the chariot talking to the ladies who were in it he immediately retired to make way for us to come close a crowd had followed us and some one of their horses struck that on which the marchioness rode  it immediately made an effort to disengage itself from the throng and in spite of all she could do ran away with her with such amazing swiftness that it seemed to outgo all the racers  i followed instantly  o seymour judge of my emotions when i saw her fall to the ground when i came up to her she was senseless her eyes closed and her face covered with blood and dust i raised her in my arms and held her to my breast but unable long to sustain her weight in that posture i sunk down gently held her on my knees and gazed in stupid silence  at that instant numbers came up to us among the rest thornton and lady woodville who on perceiving blood upon my cheek fainted  she might have fallen to the earth for me i was insensible to all the world thornton luckily caught her in his arms and conveyed her to her chariot  notwithstanding all the applications that were used the marchioness seemed irrecoverable and my despair is not to be expressed a gentleman that was present opened a vein in her arm she then lifted up her languid eyes and looking round her closed them quick again and whispered as she lay upon my bosom i die my lord but ought not to repine since i expire within your arms  a crimson blush succeeded to her palenese and a vast shower of tears soon followed i know not what reply i made but i have reason to suppose it must have been expressive of the complicated passions which affected me i carried her in my arms to lady wintertons coach and conveyed her in that manner to your sisters  we had all the assistance this place could afford my spirits are so extremely harrassed that i cannot write more than just to give you the satisfaction to know that she is not in danger  would i could say as much  adieu till next post woodville  letter ix lord woodville to lord seymour as soon as the fair invalid was laid on the bed and the medical tribe who were summoned from all quarters had performed their usual evolutions of pulsefeeling profound looks and long prescriptions i knelt by her bedside and tenderly inquired her health she told me that though much hurt she did believe the only incurable wound she had received was given by herself in the weak confession she had made when she thought her situation had placed her beyond the necessity of longer disguising the tender sentiments she felt for me she would give worlds to recall what she had said but as she knew that was impossible begged i would not despise her or meanly think her capable of a design to rival lady woodville and that the moment she was sufficiently recovered she should fly me and england for ever  think of my situation seymour and forgive my weakness while i tell you i poured forth all the fondness long concealed even from myself within my laboring bosom and swore with too much truth i never had one moment ceased to love her she sighed and wept i kissed her lilly hand and bathed it with her tears  how much longer we should have continued in this situation i know not had i not been roused by a message from lady woodville to inquire the marchionesss health and an excuse for not making the inquiry in person on account of her own indisposition i started seymour  and recollected that i had a wife  i flew home instantly found emily had been blooded and put to bed  i rejoiced at being able to avoid the sight of that amiable woman said i would not disturb her by going into her chamber and ordered another bed to be got ready for me against night  conscious guilt will make a coward of the bravest man i could not bear my own thoughts  i dreaded being alone i went to the coffeehouse to drown reflection in noise and nonsense the conversation turned entirely on the accident that had befallen the marchioness and i replied with the utmost complacency to every trifling question that was asked because it related to her  i soon grew weary of this scene i walked out and found my steps insensibly straying toward the marchioness  by chance i met thornton who with more liveliness in his looks than i have seen for a long time told me lady woodville was much better and would be glad to see me that she had expressed some uneasiness at their not suffering me to go into her chamber when i called at home though she was then asleep  i went directly back with him and saw my emily she looked pale and dispirited questioned me with great tenderness about the marchioness and said the fright she had suffered on her account joined to her apprehension of my having received some hurt had quite overpowered her but she would endeavor to become a stouter soldier sweet gentleness how thy soft looks upbraid me  i determined not to go to the marchioness that night but sent to know how she did and sat down to write my last letter to you in that and this are contained only the transactions of one fatal day  where my narrative will end i know not but the only relief that is at present left me is the pouring out my heart to you  i again implore you to pity its weakness and pardon its follies  yours ever woodville  letter x lord woodville to lord seymour too cruel seymour how am i to interpret such an obstinate silence am i so far sunk in your esteem that you disdain even to hold converse or correspondence with me now was the time to have exerted all your friendship and stopped me on the very verge of ruin  but you disclaim the painful office of counselling an incorrigible selfwilled man and i now triumph in your cold neglect lest to myself in such a critical juncture i have a higher pride in being able from my own conduct to claim your friedship and esteem than i could have felt had i acted conformably to your prudent advice and declined the meeting of my most dangerous foe  the morning after the date of my last i was surprised to find lady woodville in the dining room dressed and waiting breakfast for me when i came down stairs between seven and eight oclock  i thought she looked paler and more delicate than i had ever seen her with an air of resignation impressed upon her countenance which added to its natural sweetness had rendered her one of the most interesting objects i had ever beheld the tenderness with which i enquired her health seemed to animate her languid frame and her eyes quickly recovered their native luster  after breakfast she proposed accompanying me to see the marchioness i was embarrassed beyond measure but knew not how to prevent her doing what appeared to be so proper just then thornton luckily came into the room which afforded me a moment to recollect myself i told her i thought it would be better to send first to inquire how the marchioness had rested and whether she was yet able to receive our visits emily seemed to blush at her want of consideration and readily assented to my proposal  williams was dispatched with a card and soon returned with a verbal answer that the marchioness was much better and would be glad to see us i hoped she would have had address enough to have saved me from the embarrassment which such an interview must give me but there was now no retreating and emily and i got into the chariot together  when we were shown into the marchionesss apartment she was lying on a couch in the most elegant dishabille  what a subject for an apelles seymour it was with difficulty i could restrain myself from expressing the transports that i felt she rose to receive lady woodville with such an air of graceful dignity as queens might gladly learn i saw that emily blushed and looked confused at her amazing superiority but was relieved by the entrance of your sister lady sandford  the marchionesss behavior toward me was remarkably cold and distant and i thought she overacted her part so much that any other woman in the world but emily must have perceived something extraordinary in the change of her manner but happily lady woodville is a stranger to suspicion  you may suppose our visit was not a very long one yet it appeared to me insufferably tedious and i thought myself more obliged to emily when she rose to go away than ever i had been to any one in my life i had the happiness to hear that the marchioness had received no hurt from her fall that could be of any ill consequence the blood that appeared was from a slight contusion in her nose  ransford came to wait on her while we were there and as he handed my wife to her carriage and i was quitting the room the marchioness with the utmost fierte though in a low voice said lord woodville return instantly or never  the manner with which she pronounced these words astonished and confounded me i then saw that her behavior toward me was the effect of resentment not art  yet how had i offended how forfeited that tenderness which she expressed for me the day before inexplicable creature mysterious woman of all riddles the hardest to be expounded by the boasted wisdom of thy vassal man  i bowed and withdrew in the utmost amazement at her conduct and by vainly endeavoring to account for it i fell into such a profound reverie that i did not even perceive the motion of the carriage till it stopped at our lodgings  i rhen felt myself ashamed at not having taken the least notice of emily during our little journey and by way of saying something told her i had heen considering whether we might not set out for london the next day if it was agreeable to her she smiling said my will was hers and though quite unprepared for such an expedition as she did not know i purposed going so soon she would be ready at what hour i pleased  i knew not what i said when i talked of london and had not the least intention of carrying her there but my blunder was lucky as it gave me an opportunity of paying a well deserved compliment to her complacency and condescension and also of paying the way to my going without her if the sovereign arbitress of my fate should command me to attend her i likewise appeared to have the merit of sacrificing my own inclination to hers by readily consenting to her returning to woodfort  upon these terms we parted and i set out with a slow pace and a disturbed mind to measure back the ground i had just passed during my walk i reflected upon the disagreeable necessity i had laid myself under of acting the hypocrite with a woman whose amiable qualities compelled me to esteem her and whose personal charms fully entitled her to the fondest affection of an unengaged heart deceit cannot dwell long with honor and i determined either to sacrifice my passion to my virtue or at once to triumph over character honor and every other consideration in life and act the villain boldly  almost distracted with the struggles of my mind i entered the marchionesss apartment i found her lying on a couch with a handkerchief close to her eyes which she removed upon my entrance and showed her lovely face all bathed in tears i advanced with precipitation and would have kissed her hand but she withdrew it from me with such an air of coldness and disdain as almost petrified me then rising briskly said is your wife with you  i gravely answered no she then burst into a violent passion of tears and exclaimed ah woodville after what had passed between us but a few short hours ago how could you use me thus how did you dare to insult me with the presence of that object whose legal claim to your affection renders mine criminal  i was so much alarmed and confounded at the vehemence of her voice and manner that i knew not what answer to make but told her it was lady woodville who had proposed our coming together and that i knew not how to avoid attending her without running the hazard of giving her offense  what then you fear as well as love her and you avow it to my face  i would not willingly madam inflict unnecessary wounds upon the victim i have sacrificed to you nor add brutality to perfidy  her color oe to crimson  so then my lord you vainly hope to keep a flame alive in two such hearts as mine and lady woodvilles to love en turk and play our passions off against each other for your sport  amazing vanity but know it will not do my lord her soft insipid nature might perhaps submit to be the loved sultana of the day then yield her place to me or any other and meanly take it back again from your caprice but i will reign alone or else despise that transitory toy the empire of your heart  you may remember madam there was a time when more than you now ask or i can give my hand and heart were offered at your feet you then disdained to accept them they are no longer free for doting on you as i do with all the fervor of distracted passion i cannot be insensible to the merits of unoffending innocence and love nor cease one hour to feel the anguish of remorse for having injured lady woodville  if the frankness of this confession madam should exclude me for ever from your love i have the consolation to know that it must insure me your esteem  without some claim to the latter i should be unworthy of the former but if under these unhappy circumstances you still can condescend to feel that passion which you have professed let me upon my knees conjure you to tell me how i may preserve my honor without forfeiting what is as dear to me your love  i had knelt at her feet during the latter part of this discourse  her eyes had streamed  i do not blush to own that mine were not quite dry she remained silent for some minutes and when i pressed her to speak she replied with a determined voice and manner there is no alternative my lord you must fly with me or never see me more  i had dreaded such a proposal yet could scarce believe she would make it and with the utmost agitation cried out impossible but before i could utter another syllable she laid her hand upon my lips and said i command you silence  you must not shall not answer me i know you are to quit this place immediately would i had never seen it but as you are now to determine the fate of one whose love for you has made her leap the bounds prescribed to her weak sex o do not reply rashly but take the last moment that can be allowed before you pronounce the doom of a fond wretch who has placed more than her lfe  her happiness or misery  in your power  i rose and bowed totally unable to speak or even to think from the confusion of my ideas she took advantage of my silence to tell me she would not receive any letter upon this subject from me but that she expected to see me at twelve oclock next day and smiling added lst you should frget i will present you with a little monitor which will remind you of your absent friend  she then gave me her picture which i had a thousand times in our first acquaintance solicited in vain i kissed it with transport see here said she and drew a miniature of me which i had formerly given her out of her pocket and now take care that you preserve my image as carefully as i have done yours  then looking at her watch you must leave me it is near lady sandfords dining hour and i must dress how slowly will the miserable moments creep till we two meet again but i shall defy time after that as it can neither add to or diminish from the felicity or anguish which must then irrevocably be my portion  i entreated her to spare me on that subject as she would not permit me to reply you must withdraw then immediately my lord for i can neither think or speak on any other theme she permitted me to kiss her hand before i left her and seemed to have conquered all those violent passions which possessed her at my approach i confess i quitted her with infinite reluctance and so i now must you  woodville  letter xi lord woodville to lord seymour i parted from the marchioness in a more irresolute and confused state of mind than i had ever before experienced i well knew that all the color of my future fate depended on the resolution i was compelled to make within a few short hours i found it absolutely impossible to determine on any thing from a consciousness of the importance of my final determination  never sure had reason and passion a severer strife one moment i resolved to sacrifice every thing to love to fly with my adored isabella into some distant country and live in shades with her and love alone the next instant the image of the gentle emily obtruded itself upon my imagination in her present situation pale and dying methought i heard her last soft sigh express my name i felt myself a murderer and started at my shadow  in this distracted state i had wandered a considerable way in the field and saw night coming on apace without power or inclination to think of returning to york when i heard the sound of a horse galloping toward me  the man who rode him called to me to direct him the nearest way to the town and also if i could inform him where lord woodville lived  the sound of my own name surprised me and i inquired his business  the fellow quickly knew me he instantly alighted and told me he was a servant of sir harry ransfords and had been sent express to let his young master know that lady ransford had eloped two days before with captain barnard and that it was supposed they were gone either to france or ireland he added that the poor old knight was almost distracted for the loss of his lady and wanted his son to pursue the ravisher  the servant pressed me to mount his horse and expressed his simple astonishment at my being by myself in such a lonesome place at that hour i refused his offer and we walked on together it was near eight oclock when i got home and as it was the last night of the races i did suppose emily was gone to the ball  but i found her alone  i thought she looked as if she had been in tears though her eyes sparkled when she saw me this little circumstance had its full weight and the unaffected joy she showed at my return without seeming to be alarmed at my absence when contrasted with the violence of temper which the marchioness had discovered in the morning so far turned the scale as to determine me to remain a slave to the obligations i owe to my wife and the world and though i am persuaded that i shall never be able to extract the arrow from my wounded heart i will suffer it to rankle there in silence and endeavor to derive fortitude sufficient to bear the anguish from the noble consideration of having sacrificed my pleasure  i must not style it happiness  to my duty  what would my friend have more  my mind grew much calmer after these reflections  in order to prevent my relapsing i locked up the marchionesss picture in my writing box and threw the key into the fire that it might not be in my power to gaze away my reason for that night at least  emily was much surprised at the account of lady ransford and captain barnard  her own innocence keeps her a child  she begged i would not mention the story before lady harriet  i knew there had been an attachment between the captain and her but thought it long since over  yet why should i imagine that time could conquer love o never never seymour  lady woodville and i supped tete a tete the young folks as she calls them though they are all older than herself staid late at the ball  i was impatient for ransfords return and had sent to the assembly room to look for him but he was not there  i ordered every thing to be in readiness for his setting out immediately on his filial errand  when the ladies and thornton came in i retired to my chamber to wait for ransford by frequently revolving my unhappy situation in my mind i began to consider it in a new light which at once increased my misery and confirmed me in the justness of the resolution i had before taken of bearing it in silence upon strict examination i found i was the only culpable person of the three and therefore ought to be the only sufferer   wretch that i was i had deceived myself and in consequence of that error i had imposed upon another how vain to imagine that the marchionesss cruel treatment of my love her preferring age and infirmity to me on account of superior rank and riches had supplied me with arms sufficient to vindicate my freedom and break her tyrannic chains o seymour they are twined about my heart and naught i fear but death can loose them  it was near three oclock when ransford came in he seemed in very high spirits  when i told him of lady ransfords ill conduct he said he was not in the least surprised he had long known that his stepdame only waited for a gallant who had spirit enough to engage in such a frolic with her and he thought his father had a fair riddance  i was surprised to hear him treat the affair so lightly as i know him to be a man of nice honor i then asked him whether he intended going immediately to his father he answered no said he was engaged in a pursuit of the utmost consequence which he could not quit and that he did not believe he should see ransfordhall for some time  i told him i thought his father would have reason to resent his neglect and pressed him to wait upon him though but for one day he persisted in his resolution and we parted i think it odd that ransford did not communicate his motives for acting in this manner to me  but what have i to do with other peoples affairs my poor tortured mind is sufficiently incumbered with its own  i think i need not tell you that i passed a sleepless night  at breakfast i told emily that i should be ready to set out with her for woodfort after dinner if she pleased she seemed delighted and the carriage was ordered at half an hour after four  i entreated sir james thornton to return with us for a few days he made a thousand excuses but at length complied at lady woodvilles request  i was now to enter upon the most arduous task of my whole life that of taking an everlasting leave of the woman whom i doated on  and in this highest act of selfdenial i must appear to her a volunteer i am grieved that brutus should have said virtue was but a name o let me bend before her awful shrine and pay my grateful vows for the kind aid she lent me in that hour of trial  i endeavored to assume an air of calmness on my entering the marchionesss apartment she fixed her eyes her piercing eyes in steadfast gaze upon me as if to read my soul a minute passed in silence i found she would not speak and hardly seemed to breathe you see before you madam an unhappy man who dares not purchase transport with remorse and therefore turns selfbanished from her sight whom most his soul adores  she quick exclaimed is it possible and am i then despised neglected  for a wife cold and unloving woodville why did you ever feign a passion for me why strive to make me think it still subsisted in your frozen heart you cannot bear remorse ungrateful man should not i have shared it with you is then my fame less dear than yours and did i hesitate one moment to sacrifice that and myself both to you obscurity and infamy were not bars to me whilst you infirm of mind desert the woman you pretend to love for fear your wife should cry  true madam i replied i would not give her cause to weep for worlds  nay what is more for you you have acknowledged too that the step your kindness prompted you to take must be attended with severe regret also on your own part what should i feel then from rendering you unhappy i have not fortitude to brave such two fold agony  o you have half that guilt to answer for already  but my pride revolt at my own meanness leave me sir  leave me for ever woodville i shall obey you madam but before we part for ever suffer me at least to satisfy your pride by declaring that no man ever loved with fonder passion than i now feel for you  how far time and absence may be able to conquer it i know not but should they fail of their usual effects it is impossible that i should bear it long and now my isabella one last embrace  may angels guard you  i rushed out of the house like a distracted man but had not walked a quarter of a mile before the rectitude of my conduct toward this too lovely woman began by flattering my pride to qualify my passion and i returned home in a more rational state of mind than i have known for some time  rejoice with me my friend the conflicts past and be just enough to acknowledge my triumph more complete than the much boasted one of scipio he only resigned an alienated heart  while i forego a self devoted victim  i am this moment going to step into the coach for woodfort where i shall impatiently long to see you but o write soon to strengthen and applaud my growing virtue  yours woodville  letter xii lord seymour to lord woodville hotwells believe me woodville there is not another event within the power of fortune which could now give me half the joy that i received from your last letter i do congratulate my noble friend myself and all the world on that heroic virtue which has enabled you to pass the ordeal fire unsullied and unhurt rather let me say that like the amianthus the asbestos or salamanders wool  you have gained new whiteness from the flames and shine with brighter luster than even unblemished innocence can boast  i find my style perhaps too much elevated by my sentiments but sudden transitions must have strong effects i had scarce a hope of your escaping the snare that was laid for you and mourned your fall from honor with infinitely more regret than i should have done your death had the latter happened my grief would have been selfish but in the other case i felt for those pangs which you must have inevitably suffered and for the miseries which your crimes must have inflicted upon your amiable and innocent wife  but i do not wish again to recall this gloomy prospect to your view you may now and ought to look forward to a long train of hapiness for surely if such a thing is to be found en earth it must arise from a consciousness of having acted rightly who then can be better entitled to it than yourself  as i have found some little benefit from these waters i propose staying here some time longer  i shall then have some affairs of consequence to my fortune which i have too long neglected to settle in london so that i cannot hope to see you at woodfort in less than two months  i entreat to hear from you often but must insist upon your not mentioning the subject of our late correspondence forget it woodville and be happy  yours ever seymour note the journal promised by lady woodville to lady straffon is purposely omitted as it contains nothing more than an account of some of those particulars that have been already mentioned which happened during the week they staid at york races  the editor    letter xiii lady straffon to lady woodville i flatter myself that this letter will reach woodfort soon after your arrival there and that it will find my dear emily rejoicing in the calm delights of domestic happiness after the scene of hurry and dissipation she has so lately gone through  i give you credit for the lovely picture you have drawn of the marchioness and also for the tender concern you express for the accident that beel her  but i am sorry your nerves were so weak as to occasion your fainting  i allow much for your present situation but do not let that or any thing else my dear sister suffer you to indulge in an habitual lowness of spirits there is an air of languid discontent runs through the latter part of the little journal you were so good to send me that alarms me much  yet i am certain you endeavored to conceal your sentiments even from me and i approve your caution as i am persuaded that by speaking or writing on any subject that affects us we strengthen our own feelings of it and half the simple girls who are now pining for love by murmuring rivulets or in shady groves would forget the dear objects of their passion if they had not a female confidante as silly as themselves to whom they daily recount the fancied charms of their adonis and utter vows of everlasting constancy  but do not now my dear emily so perversely misunderstand me as to suppose that i would wish you to conceal any thing that distresses you from me or that i should desire you to let sorrow prey in silence on your heart merely to save mine the pain of suffering with you no i conjure you to speak freely to me and if i cannot cure i will at least sooth your anxiety if real and endeavor to laugh you out of it if imaginary  we have had a very agreeable visitor for these ten days past at straffonhill  lord mount willis  he lived abroad chiefly in italy these ten years yet is not infected with foreign fopperies and can relish both the food and manners of his native country sir john met him last at paris from whence he is but just returned  he tells us that sir james miller and his cara sposa are universally ridiculous her ladyship affects all the lively gallantry dune dame francoise but is unfortunately incumbered with all the clumsy aukwardness of a vulgar englishwoman sir james plays deep and has lost considerably lucy seems hurt at the latter part of this account the goodness of her heart is inexhaustible  the approach of a certain desirable event with that of winter will i hope soon afford me the pleasure of embracing my dear emily and her lord we shall return to london in ten or twelve days have you made any discovery in the terra incognita of sir james thorntons heart does fanny weston sigh in concert with the aeolian lyre or have the equinoctial blasts so chilled her flame that she prefers a warm room and cheerful company to lonely meditation and soft sounds  how does lady harriet hear this second instance of captain barnards perfidy and how does the poor old gouty knight support the vulgarly called loss of his detestible wife i find myself in a very impertinent mood and that i may not ask more questions in one letter than you may be inclined to answer in two i shall for the present bid you adieu  f straffon  letter xiv lady woodville to lady straffon yes my dear fanny i am now thank heaven safely arrived at woodfort  would i had never left it i think even the place and every thing in it is altered during a short absence of twelve days the trees have lost their verdure and the birds cease to sing but though the autumnal season may have produced these effects i begin to fear there is a greater change in me than in any of the objects that surround me  yet am i in the spring of life not ripened even to summer while like a blasted flower i shrink and fade say fanny why is this the animal and vegetable world bloom in their proper season youth  while amongst those whom we call rational grief steals the roses from the downy cheek and flowing tears often dim the brilliant eye lord seymour is unhappy thornton sighs and my loved lord seems wretched  need i go on and close the climax with my breaking heart  chide me or chide me not the secrets out i am undone my sister in vain lord woodville strives beneath the masque of tenderness to act a part which he no longer feels the piercing eyes of love detect his coldness  his kind attention is all lost on me his stifled sighs belie his face and tongue and whisper what he suffers when he smiles  o fanny tell me how i have offended him how lost that heart which formed my utmost bliss let me blot out that passage with my tears it cannot it must not be  i will not live if i have lost his love why are you not here to flatter me  to tell me that my fears are groundless and that he sighs from habit or from chance  ah no i since he whom i adore has failed to blind me i cannot if i would be now deceived yet if i have erred why does he not speak out and tell me i have done wrong believe me fanny i have tried my heart examined every hidden thought that is there and cannot find out one that should offend him  are all men thus inconstant i was too young to mark sir johns behavior when you were married first a sudden ray of hope now dawns upon me perhaps the great exertion of my lords spirits while he remained at york may have occasioned a proportionate degree of languor  perhaps he may again recover his natural cheerfulness and your poor emily may again be happy  perhaps  i will strive to hope the best  i have no thoughts of going to london  i always purposed lying in at woodfort  i had flattered myself you would be with me at that hour of trial but i do not now expect it  i know sir john would not consent to your running the hazard of traveling in your present situation as it has formerly been of ill conseqence to you i therefore release my dear fanny and desire she may not suffer the least anxiety on my account  i find myself much more at ease than when i began this letter and i must affirm though in contradiction to your opinion that pouring forth our distresses in the bosom of a friend affords at least a temporary relief to the afflicted i am not able to write more at present but will answer all your queries by next post   till then adieu e woodville  letter xv lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny there never sure was such a man as lord woodville  he is not only determined to preserve my affection but to rob me of the poor consolation of complaining that i no longer possess his in spite of all the pains i have taken to conceal the anguish of my heart he has certainly perceived it and by the most tender and interesting conversation had well nigh led me into a confession of my being unhappy  thank heaven i stopped just short of that  had i avowed it he doubtless would have asked the cause and artfully have drawn me in at least tacitly to reproach his conduct o never never fanny can i be capable of that indiscretion  but were i weak or mean enough to do it i have now no reason for complaint  his tenderness politeness and attention are unabated no other person but myself could possibly perceive the smallest alteration in his conduct and i begin to hope that my apprehensions have had no other foundation than an extremity of delicacy bordering upon weakness in myself a thousand nay ten thousand women might and would be happy with such an amiable and tender husband nor has your emily a wish ungratified but that of seeing her dear lord quite happy  i am sorry to tell you that sir james thornton leaves us tomorrow he is to set out immediately on the grand tour my lord has in vain endeavored to find out the source of his melancholy we can discover nothing but that he is unhappy which i am sincerely sorry for as he really is the most agreeable accomplished young man i ever was acquainted with  lady harriet affects to appear thankful for her escape from captain bernard but finds his elopement a cause for sorrow on his ladys account sir harry is so much enraged at his sons neglect of him that he begins to be reconciled to his wifes conduct and speaks of him with more acrimony than of her indeed i think mr ransford highly to blame for refusing to attend his father upon such an occasion  fanny weston is a la mort at sir james thorntons quitting us that love is the cause of her mourning i well know but i begin now to apprehend that sir james and not lord seymour is the object of her passion she has a much better chance in this case than the other for i am persuaded if thornton knew of her affection for him he would endeavor to make her happy  alas if he loves another how impossible i fancy he is enamoured of one of the miss witherss  his fortune and family are such that i do not believe he would be rejected yet i could not wish him success for poor fanny westons sake  men more easily triumph over an unhappy passion than women dissipation change of place and objects all contribute to their cure while perhaps the poor sighing fair one is absolutely confined to the same spot where she first beheld her charmer and where every object reminds her that here he sat walked or talked  i am persuaded there is a great deal more in these local mementos than lovers are willing to allow i therefore shall not oppose fanny westons going to london if she should again propose it  sir william and lady lawson are to dine with us this day  i will try to muster all my spirits to receive her i would not for the world make her unhappy by giving her the least room to suspect that i am so  adieu my dearest fanny to you and you only i can without blushing discover all the weakness of a heart that truly and sincerely loves you  e woodville ps i have this moment received a message from my lord to let me know that he shall spend three or four days in hunting with sir william atkinson i am glad of any thing that can amuse him    letter xvi lady straffon to lady woodville i cannot express how much my dear emilys last letters have affected and distressed me  your being unhappy is certainly sufficient to render me so and what adds to my concern is my being absolutely incapable of affording you the least consolation as i am utterly ignorant of the real cause of your affliction i sometimes think that it is only a phantom conjured up by your too delicate apprehensions and is of course merely imaginary  at other times the natural constancy of men alarms me with an idea of lord woodvilles having met at york or elsewhere some object that may for a time divide his heart with you  observe my dearest emily that this is mere conjecture  but we must take certain positions for granted before we can reason upon any thing now do not start when i tell you i had much rather your uneasiness should arise from the latter source than the former  though i should consider even a transitory alienation of his affection as a misfortune  let us now suppose this to be the case and then see how far you have reason to be distressed by such an incident the passions of the human mind are i fear as little under our command as the motions of our pulse  you have therefore just as much reason to resent your husbands becoming enamoured of another person as you would have to be offended at his having a fever  but if in consequence of that delirium he should sacrifice your peace to the gratification of his passions by an open and avowed pursuit of the beloved object or otherwise render you unhappy by unkindness or neglect you might then have some cause to complain but if he be unfortunate enough to feel an unwarrantable passion and keeps that feeling all his own his merit rises above humanity and he ought to become almost an object of adoration to you  has he not fled from this alluring charmer has he not hid his passion from the world nor wounded even your pride is not his tenderness and kind attention still unremitted toward you indeed my emily allowing these to be matters of fact you owe him more than you can ever pay consider what his regard to you must be that can prevail on him to sacrifice his passion to your peace  then do not i implore you my dear child by even the least appearance of distress aggravate his but be assured that from a heart where honor is the ruling principle you have every thing to hope and that the transitory gloom which now affects him will be succeeded by the brightest triumph and that his reason and his virtue will both join in securing his affection to you upon a more solid and permanent foundation than it could ever have been if this accident had not happened  i have gladly laid hold on what you will think the greatest evil lord woodvilles having conceived an involuntary passion but formidable as they may appear to you believe me emily it is of little consequence compared to both what he and you must suffer should there be found no real cause for your distress a mind so unhappily turned as yours would then appear to be must be incapable of receiving or administering content i am shocked at the horrid idea and will not dwell upon it longer  as i kept your letters in a particular drawer of my desk in looking for your last but one chance presented me with your first letter from woodfort where you set out a strenuous advocate for the existence of terestrial felicity fallacious as the opinion may be i am truly sorry you have had any reason to alter your sentiments but let it at least console you that if you are not an example of your own argument there is no such thing as an exception to the general rule that happiness is not nor ever will be the lot of human nature till perfection becomes inherent to it  the subjects of this letter have sunk my spirits so much that i fear i shall rather increase than lessen your depression if i pursue them farther i will therefore change to one that ought to give me pleasure and will i hope afford you some  lord mount willis thoroughly apprized of our dear lucys former attachment to sir james miller has declared a passion for her in the most polite and elegant terms that can be imagined sensibility he says is with him the highest mark of virtue and a heart that could feel what hers has suffered for an unworthy object must be capable of the highest tenderness for one who can at least boast the merit of being sensible of her charms  a little false delicacy has as yet prevented lucy from declaring her sentiments in favor of this charming man for such indeed he is though i can see she likes him full as well and must necessarily approve him much more than she ever did sir james miller  but lucy declared she would never marry and that she would leave her fortune to my emily  i know this dwells on her mind though it never did on mine for i have as little says in the vows of disappointed love as in the promises of successful ones however i both hope and believe that lord mount willis will triumph over her scruples and that i shall have the pleasure of seeing her the happy wife of that very amiable man  i am sorry you are to lose sir james thornton but perhaps the want of his company may induce lord woodville to come to london and i should rejoice at any cause that could produce that effect for i cannot bear the thought of your lyingin in the country  fanny weston is not of a temper to break her heart for love but i would by all means have her come to town her aunt lady weston talks of going to bath next month and if fanny chooses to accompany her i will answer for it that that gay scene of dissipation will soon conquer an hopeless passion whether lord seymour or sir james thornton be the object  we arrived in hillstreet last thursday tomorrow sir john is to place my little edward at eton the simple mamma will feel the loss of her dear play fellow but the prudent mother will bless the memory of henry the sixth who instituted that noble foundation  the accounts we have received of sir james miller are shocking  he has been obliged to quit paris on account of his debts and is retired into some of the provinces  his lady remains in the capital living away upon credit without character i begin to pity the unhappy man  you will easily perceive that this letter has been written at different periods the world breaks in upon me i am embarked in the stream and must be hurried away by the current with sticks straws and a thousand other insignificant things  adieu my dear emily i hope soon very soon to see you  for if the mountains will not come to mahomet etc  f straffon  letter xvii lady woodville to lady straffon i am sincerely sorry for having given pain to my dear fannys gentle heart as i cannot say that her participation has alleviated my distress for giving the fullest scope to the arguments you have advanced what do they prove but that your emily is unhappy and that she knew too well before you set lord woodvilles merits in the fairest light cruel fanny why could you not find out some fault in him to make me love him less but it is impossible he is without dispute the most amiable of mankind  i told you in my last that sir james thornton was to leave woodfort the day following which was tuesday on monday night he took a very polite leave of us all and i thought appeared more cheerful than he had been for some time past when we were at breakfast on tuesday we were told sir james had set out at six oclock and immediately after my lords servant presented him with a letter  he appeared to show some emotion while he read it and soon withdrew to his closet in less than half an hour i received the following billet with the aforesaid letter enclosed  to lady woodville i should be unjust to my unhappy friend should i conceal the noble and generous sentiments he expresses for the most lovely and deserving of her sex and i should still more highly injure the unbounded confidence of my dear emily should i prevent her receiving the tribute due to that merit which could inspire so truly delicate and sincere a passion i feel i know not what kind of a mixed sensation for poor thornton i both admire and pity him  i would have delivered the enclosed with my own hand but feared my presence might distress my emily or perhaps restrain the pitystowing tear which i confess i think his sufferings merit  adieu my dearest emily woodville   sir ja thornton to lord woodville indebted as i am for many obligations to your lordship and sensibly awake to the warmest sensations of gratitude i could not think of quitting woodfort and england for ever without gratifying that friendly curiosity which has so often sought the cause of the too visible change in my manners and appearance you will perhaps be startled when i tell you that this alteration is owing to yourself  ignorant of every refinement and elegance of life dissipated in my temper and unattached to any particular object by your lordships friendly invitation i arrived at woodfort  heavens what a scence opened to my astonished sense the sudden effect of colors to a person just restored to sight could not be felt more strongly every object i beheld was new was amiable yet in this charming groupe my lord there were degrees of merit and my then vacant heart dared to aspire at the most perfect of her sex need i now tell you that lady woodville was its choice yes i avow it passion is involuntary nor would i if i could be cured of mine  yet witness for me heaven that sensual and abandoned as my past life has been no gross idea ever mixed with hers nor did her beauteous form ever raise one thought that even she need blush to hear  i do not my lord affect to place this purity of setiment to the account of my own honor or even my friendship for you no i confess myself indebted for it to her charming image which ever appeared to my delighted sense accompanied by that uncommon delicacy that graces every word and action of her spotless life  that like a sacred talisman has charmed the unruly passions of my mind and made me only feel the pangs of hopeless love  such a confession as i have now made my lord will i flatter myself entitle me both to your regard and pity i go self banished from all that i esteem and love from you and lady woodville  it would be the height of impiety to doubt of her happiness and a long continuance of the blessings you now enjoy is the kindest wish that i can make for you felicity like yours admits of no addition  when you have read this my lord burn and forget it but let the unhappy writer be totally banished from your remembrance conceal my presumption from the too lovely lady woodville lest her resentment should be added to the miseries of  your unhappy friend james thornton   o fanny i am distressed beyond measure by these two letters why did this weak young man place his affections upon me why not bestow them where they were likely if not certain to meet with a return it is said that love is involuntarily but i believe it is only so in very young or enervated minds  if we will not struggle with our passions they will surely overcome us but they may certainly be weeded out before they have taken too deep root  i am doubly distressed by this unlucky attachment  poor fanny weston her passion for sir james thornton is but to visible  would it not be cruel to attempt her cure by letting her into this secret i know not how to act  why did my lord reveal his foolish letter or why did he not sigh in secret and conceal his illplaced love o these audacious men they dare do any thing  there is however a degree of modesty in his keeping the secret while he was here i am convinced if he had given the slightest hint of it i should have had detested him even as it is i feel myself offended and in a very awkward situation i shall certainly blush when i see my lord and yet why should i be humbled by another persons folly what husband but mine would have put such a letter into the hands of a wife such a mark of confidence ought to raise me in my own opinion as it is an undoubted proof that i stand high in his pleasing reflection dwell upon my mind and banish every gloomy thought that has obtruded there  as lucys happiness is of infinite consequence to mine i hope soon to hear that she is lady mount wills  yours as usual e woodville  letter xviii lady straffon to lady woodville i cannot see why my dear emily should be hurt or offended at sir james thorntons innocent passion had he dared to avow it to you it would have lost that title and should have been considered as an insult but let the poor youth sigh in peace for a few months and i will venture to promise that he will get the better of his folly  dying for love is a disorder that comes not within our bills of mortality  not but i believe that a long and habitual fondness founded on reasonable hopes will when destroyed destroy life with it   o the soft commerce o the tender ties  close twisted with the fibers of the heart  which broken break it and drain off the soul  of human joy and make it pain to live but these are not the sport of feelings with which masters and misses who fancy themselves in love are commonly affected for though youth is the season when we are most capable of receiving impressions it is also the season when they are most easily erased i think i might venture to pronounce that there are not five hundred couples in the cities of london and westminster who are married to their first love and yet i firmly believe there are at least ten times that number of happy pairs if so what becomes of the first passion  to be sure we now and then met with a foolish obstinate heart that cherishes its own misery and preserves the image of some worthless object to the last moment of its existence among this simple class i fear i shall be necessitated to rank my sister lucy for though she does not pretend to have the smallest objection to lord mount willis yet can she not be prevailed upon to give a final yes  his behavior on this occasion is truly noble for though i believe that never man was more in love he has made it a point both with sir john and me not to press lucy for her consent i fear sir john will grow angry at last and perhaps hurry her into a denial which she will have reason to repent all the days of her life  however she will now have some time to recollect herself as sir john has this day received a summons to attend his aunt lady aston who is dying and will probably leave lucy a lage legacy  that poor idiot sir james miller has mortgaged the last foot of his estate but then he has got rid of his wife  she died of a fever at paris twelve days ago upon the whole i think fortune has been kinder to him than he deserved  i am much pleased with lord woodvilles behavior in regard to the letter but indeed my dear you treat these trifling matters much too seriously and lest i should myself grow grave upon the subject i shall bid you  adieu f straffon  letter xix lady woodville to lady straffon dear fanny i have not been well these three or four days  lady lawson who is so good as to stay with me and all the sege femmes about me think that a certain event is nearer than i apprehended my lords foster sister who has been brought to bed about five weeks is now in the house and every thing is prepared for my accouchement  my lords tenderness seems doubled on this occasion  he scarce ever leaves my apartment he reads to me with his eyes oftener fixed on my countenance than the book and seems to watch every change in my looks  what a wretch i have been fanny to suspect this amiable man of want of love would it not be sinning against him yet more highly to let him know my crime by asking his forgiveness for my unjust suspicions  no i will blush in silence and humble myself before heaven and you who alone are conscious of my folly  pardon thou great first author of my happiness and thou dear parent sister guardian of my youth excuse my weakness that had well nigh dashed the cup of blessing from me or mingled it with bitterness for ever  i hear my dear lords tuneful voice inquiring for his emily i come my love  adieu my dear sister e woodville lord woodville to lady straffon with the foregoing letter joy to my dear lady straffon to sir john to miss straffon and to all who love my emily i have the transport to inform you that she has made me the happy father of a lovely boy and herself as well as her situation can admit my sister lawson lady harriet and miss weston join in congratulations and compliments to you with your affectionate  woodville       note the letters from lady straffon that immediately follow this contain only congratulations and minute inquiries about her sisters and nephews health and as they are by no means interesting the editor thinks it better to omit them and return to the correspondence between lord seymour and lord woodville  letter xx lord woodville to lord seymour my dear seymour i have been at home now above a week yet have purposely avoided writing to you as your last interdicted me from mentioning the only subject of which i am capable of thinking o seymour it is in vain to disguise it my head and heart are filled with her alone upon the exertion of any painful act of virtue we flatter ourselves that we have absolutely conquered its opposite vice or weakness our vanity triumps and like the french we frequently chant out te deum without having gained a victory  too much i feel that this has been my case i begin to fear that i shall not even be capable of disguising my unhappiness and of practicing this dissimulation which in my singular situation should be deemed a virtue  i have discovered that lady woodville has lately wept much i once surprised her alone in a flood of tears i could not bear them they reproached me seymour but it was with silent anguish i pressed to know the cause of her distress had she revailed it and but once upbraided me though in the gentlest terms i fear i should have thrown away the mask avowed my passion and quitted her for ever  but her soft nature knew not how to chide and seemed alarmed for fear she had offended her suffering gentleness unmanned me quite or rather on the instant it restored all that is worthy of the name of man my reason and my virtue and i dare hope that from that time she has been well deceived and that i only am the victim of my own weakness  i shall address this letter to london i think it is more likely that it should meet you there at present than at the hot wells i entreat you will wait upon the marchioness and tell her seymour what my heart endures let me at least have some merit from the sacrifice i have made and not be deemed ungrateful or insensible by her  if you hear any thing of ransford let me know  his father is outrageous at his conduct and even i think he is to blame  adieu my valued friend woodville  letter xxi lord seymour to lord woodville dear woodville i am sincerely sorry for your relapsing into a state of weakness which must be always a state of misery i confess i thought you in the surest train for happiness as the having conquered ourselves is the only subject i know for real exultation but as your conduct has been truly noble and that no person has suffered from what i now consider as your own misfortune no one can have a right to reproach you and it is for your own sake alone that i now entreat you to struggle with your too partial attachment to an unworthy woman  you desire me to acquaint her with the state of your heart can you suppose me so weak as to comply with your request were it within my power but i must travel some miles to afford the fugitive conqueror the triumph you designed  she set out from london five days ago with your friend ransford i hear they intend making the tour of italy together prosperous gales and calm seas attend them  you see when a lady is bent upon traveling she can easily supply herself with a cicisbeo and i fancy that ransford will be a much more agreeable companion upon this party than your lordship could possibly have been  he carries not the stings of remorse about him the bane of joy or peace neglect of his father may sometimes possibly cloud his gaiety but one glance from the bright eyes of the marchioness will quickly dispel the gloom  will you forgive me for owning that i am transported at their union would to heaven that you could receive joy from it also had she fallen lower than she has done it might have mortified your pride but if you can divest yourself of selflove you must allow that ransford is more calculated for a lover than you are i think he bows with a better grace sings charmingly dances superlatively well is more adroit in his person it above an inch taller and has ten times your vivacity  i both hope and believe that they are married and as ransford does not want penetration be may possibly have discovered your attachment to her he will therefore probably prevent her returning to england for some years let her but keep out of your way and i care not what becomes of her  do my dear woodville let me congratulate your escape from that circe and rejoice with you in the amiable character of her whom providence has designed to bless your future days  i have business that will detain me in london for this month to come the moment that is finished i will fly to woodfort and hope to find you and every one there as happy as they ought to be to wish for more is in vain  seymour  letter xxii lord woodville to lord seymour how could my cruel friend attempt to jest with misery like mine it is impossible  it must not cannot be the marchioness gone off with ransford by heaven it is false though thou my dearest truest friend aver it you thought to cure my passion by this legend but you have blown the sleeping embers to a flame and honest indignation for the injury she sustains adds fuel to the fire  ransford why ransford knew her not six weeks ago  their first meeting was at york  he must have seen her passion  she could not disguise it nay i know she would not  she is above disguise  why seymour should you treat me like a child and strive to impose impossibilities upon me how can a heart that has felt what yours has done sport with a lovers anguish i am impatient till i send off this that by the messenger you may restore her peace and clear my honor o you have set my bosom all on fire be quick and quench the blaze lest it consume the innocent cause of all my wretchedness along with your distracted friend  woodville ps the servant who carries this must neither sleep nor eat till he brings back your answer i shall do neither till i receive it for pity sake my friend trifle no farther but at once relieve and excuse the distraction you have caused    letter xxiii lord seymour to lord woodville well may thou call thyself distracted woodville and i as such can pity and forgive thee  yet must i not become infected by thy folly and treat thee like a wayward child indeed  as i would not have descended to a falsehood even to have cured you of your weakness for i cannot call it passion so neither shall i sooth you now by contradicting the truth that i have already asserted and however impossible it may appear to you that the marchioness should so quickly enter into any engagements with ransford it is most certain that they left london in the same postchaise on monday sennight and that she declared her intention of visiting italy to my sister sandford who was extremely scandalized at her behavior with regard to mr ransford during the short time she staid in town since they returned from york  be assured that i am sincerely affected by the miserable condition of your mind  i cannot help considering you as in a state of fascination for if your reason could operate at all you could not possibly be astonished that a woman who had jilted you four years ago and preferred age and disease to you when she professed to love you and when it was in your power to marry her should abandon you now that she cannot be your wife for a lively agreeable man who is probably as much enamoured of her though not quite so romantic as your lordship  as you are not at present in a situation to receive any benefit from the admonitions of friendship i shall reserve my sentiments for a fitter occasion and not detain your servant longer than while i subscribe myself  still yours seymour  letter xxiv lord woodville to lord seymour yes seymour i will own i have been mad i wake as from a dream yet why my kind my cruel friend have you recovered me from that delirium which like an opiate while it weakened soothed my enfeebled sense and left me scarce a wish to struggle with my malady yes she is gone my friend repeats it and it must be true  married to ransford can i yet believe it o may the furies light their nuptial torch dissembling cruel woman she saw the anguish of my breaking heart when honor triumphed over my selflove and prevented my accepting the sacrifice she offered to her destruction  perhaps that stung her pride perhaps she loves me still but could not bear to be rejected by me  perhaps i have undone her peace as she has mine  o no a younger gayer newer lover absorbs all thoughts of me i am forgotten and i will forget  not isabella my life my soul my love do not detest me seymour i would but cannot conquer this disease  the moment i had sent off williams with my last to you i ordered my horses and rode off thirty miles toward london not only to be so much nearer the return of my express but to prevent lady woodville from observing my distraction  when i had got about five miles from woodfort i sent back my servant to let her know that i should spend three or four days in hunting with sir william atkinson whom i just then met going up to london  i had settled my plan with williams who returned even quicker than i thought is possible i have now spent three days at a wretched inn where were it in my choice i would remain for ever here i can curse and i can weep  but the innocent lady woodville may be rendered unhappy by my stay  she loves me as i loved the  let me not name her  sir james thornton leaves us in a few days i must return to woodfort  o write soon and once more say you pity and forgive  yours ever woodville  letter xxv lord seymour to lord woodville dear woodville i write to you merely because you desire it for i am well convinced that nothing which i or the greatest philosopher that ever existed could say to you would have any effect upon your mind in its present state and my own is at this instant so extremely agitated that i am scarce capable of writing at all  i have this day received a letter from captain beaumont  the contents will amaze you about six weeks ago the acknowledged son of madame de beaumont was taken ill of the small pox and as her daughter had never had it the general and she thought proper to send her to a friends house lest her beauty should be endangered by the infection  this young lady now about fifteen who had never been out of her mothers sight before happened in the family she was placed in to become acquainted with a young musqueteer handsome and accomplished but without rank or fortune they quickly became enamoured of each other and at the end of a fortnight eloped together and got safe into holland they might possibly have been overtaken and prevented from marrying if the lady to whose care maria beaumont was entrusted had not dreaded the violence of madame de beaumonts temper so much that she did not dare to inform her of the misfortune till it was past remedy  in the mean time the young and by all accounts amiable heir of the family expired in his fathers arms the violent agitation of madame de beaumonts mind threw her into a raging fever  during her delirium she raved incessantly on the ingratitude and baseness of maria and her own inhumanity to the unhappy charlotte  the general who now considered himself as childless gladly laid hold on the opportunity of endeavoring to recover those he had formerly not lost but thrown away  he therefore prevailed on madame de beaumont to see charlotte he went himself to the convent and having declared his hitherto concealed affinity to charlotte he obtained leave from the abbess to let her visit her dying mother  but no tongue or pen can express the various emotions of surprise grief and joy which were occasioned by the sight of his lovely daughter when she cast herself at his feet to receive his benediction  like poor old lear he would have knelt to her and begged forgiveness  but when she presented herself on her knees by the bedside of madame de beaumont the unhappy woman unable to sustain the sight of so much injured beauty fainted quite away but the moment she was recovered to her reason she called for charlotte and never let her quit her sight or ceased to pour forth blessings on her and implore her pardon till she expired  before she died she entreated charlotte to quit the convent and remain with her unhappy father while he lived she desired that a dispensation from her vows might be immediately solicited from the pope and that captain beaumont and lord seymour might be sent for in order to obtain their forgiveness but only one of her wishes was accomplished  captain beaumont arrived about two hours before her death she saw and blessed him  he writes me word that neither his father nor himself can prevail on charlotte to think of returning into the world again but that she has consented to go into the country with them for a couple of months merely in hopes of roconciling the general to his youngest daughter he desires me to fly to belville that i may at least see his sister before she is again secluded from the world for ever  o woodville i want but wings to obey him but hark my chariot wheels rattle and my impatient heart much more than beats responsive to the horses feet  adieu adieu my friend seymour  letter xxvi lord woodville to lord seymour i know not whither to congratulate or condole with my dear seymour on the very extraordinary events that have happened in the beaumont family his feelings i know must arise from those of his beloved charlotte and i am at present doubtful whether she will ever again recover in the same degree that peaceful resignation which we may suppose she had acquired and was in full possession of a few weeks ago  all the passions of that gentle nature must now be roused to tumult the sight of her dear seymour must give her joy transporting joy which is as much an enemy to peace as the most poignant misery and yet again must she be torn from all the social ties of human life again be buried in that quick sepulcher a convent  do not my friend indulge a single thought of her returning back into the world  it cannot be charlotte beaumont will not be prevailed upon even by the man she loves to break her vows to heaven for though i believe her possessed of the most exalted virtue she cannot possibly be free from superstition as she is both a woman and a catholic  you will perhaps be surprised at my writing to you in this strain but i would wish you to guard your heart against its greatest foe against selfdelusion seymour that sly slow underminer of our reason and our peace that lying whispered to my weak presumption i might behold the marchioness unmoved fatal fatal error it has undone me seymour but i will think i mean speak of her no more  i have an anecdote to tell you which convinces me that adams curse is intailed on all his offspring    for either  he never shall find out fit mate but such  as some misfortune brings him or mistake  or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain  through her perverseness but shall see her gained  by a far worse or if she loves withheld  by parents or his happiest choice too late  shall meet already linked and wedlockbound  to a fell adversary his hate or shame  which infinite calamity shall cause  to human life and household peace confound thornton quitted woodfort three days ago  the morning he went off he left a letter for me which contained an absolute declaration of the most ardent passion for lady woodville you may perhaps think he was a little out in the choice of a confidant  by no means i assure you i enclosed his letter immediately to my wife and felt myself really concerned for his misfortune emily is certainly capable of inspiring the most delicate passion thornton was a second cymon when he first saw her and i may with great truth say that with all the beauties of an iphigene she is possessed of every amiable virtue that can inspire esteem and respect  i would give millons to change passions with him  i can scarce hope to hear from you while the charming delirium of your happiness lasts but when you return again to reason and misery i shall then be a proper companion for your affliction but in every situation of life i shall remain unalterably  yours woodville  letter xxvii lady straffon to lady woodville as my dear emily may yet be considered as an invalid i think myself bound to write every day and every thing that can possibly contribute to her amusement without expecting or waiting for any acknowledgment of my letter  sir john returned last night from paying his last duty to his aunt lady aston and very well she has paid him for his attendance she has bequeathed to him the pleasant manor of ashfield which is worth between eight and nine hundred pounds a year and made him her residuary legatee when he has paid her bequests of twelve thousand pounds to lucy a thousand pounds apiece to my children and some few legacies to old servants  as soon as sir john had acquainted us with this agreeable news he asked lucy if she was yet determined with regard to lord mount willis when to my great pleasure and surprise she answered yes i think i shall be ready to give him my hand before this day sennight though i cannot positively fix the day as lawyers are dilatory folks  sir john then began to rally her on what he imagined to be her attention to settlements etc and told her that my lord and he would take care of all those matters without her assistance she answered with a very steadfast countenance and determined air you will pardon me brother for once and only once in my life i am resolved to act for myself  now hear my resolution which i desire you will communicate to lord mount willis tomorrow morning  when his lordship did me the honor to address me i had then but five thousand pounds a fortune much too small to be an object of consideration to him but neither he nor you knew at that time that i had but a use even in that small sum for life  sir john attempted to interupt her by inquiring what she meant she begged that he would suffer her to proceed without interuption and went on  the severe treatment i met with at the same time from sir james miller made me at that time resolve that i would never marry  we little know our hearts in many particulars of life but least of all in this  but the extreme kindness i met with at the same time from lady straffon laid me under such indeliable obligations as no time nor circumstance can ever efface i then determined nay declared that i would bequeath my fortune to my niece emily and no power on earth shall make me alter my resolution  from my aunts unmeritted goodness to me it is now in my power to fulfill my intentions before my death and to give a proof of that gratitude which i owe to my more than sister again both sir john and i would have broken in on her discourse but she beckoned for silence  when this the first wish of my heart is accomplished i shall still have a much better fortune than lord mount willis first expected with me  but it must not be all his sir james miller has been in some degree conducive to that happiness which i expect and hope for from an union with his lordship sir james is poor and wretched justly punished for his crimes but not rewarded for the benefits he has conferred on me  some small provision must be made for him without his ever knowing from whom he receives it i formerly looked upon him with horror and aversion i now consider him as my benefactor and the saving him from the miseries of extreme poverty will relieve my mind from a sort of mental debt  sir john could forbear no longer but clasping her in his arms said providence had made him rich indeed when it had bestowed such measures on him as his wife and sister both he and i said every thing to dissuade her from her intended gift to emily but in vain  sir john seemed to hint as if he thought it would be better that her generous intentions toward sir james miller should be executed by lord mount willis rather than herself by no means brother replied lucy were there a remain of tenderness for him in my heart the world should not bribe me to marry its sole lord generosity should flow from principle not from passion and as i can truly boast that this action with regard to sir james miller arises from the first source nothing must change the current of it my conduct on this occasion is i think the highest compliment that i can pay to lord mount willis and i have not a doubt of his considering it in that high light  we both acquiesced in her opinion and sir john waited on lord mount willis this morning to inform him of lucys intentions he says he never saw any person so transported as his lordship he said he had ever looked upon lucy as the most amiable of women but that her generosity to sir james miller made him now look up to her as to a superior being and that if she gave thousands he ought to give ten thousands to the unhappy man who had been in any degree instrumental to his felicity  this will be a whimsical contest i think emily but i do not fancy that lucy will consent to my lords interfering with her designs at present she intends to lay out four thousand pounds in an annuity for sir james which if he continues to live abroad may support him decently  i have been this day to be speak a pair of diamond buckles and a very fine egrette which sir john and i mean to present her with i know lord mount williss family jewels are very rich but my dear lucys virtues will out shine them all  indeed she is an honor not only to her sex but to human nature  she joins with me in entreating yours and lord woodvilles company at her wedding surely my emily will not refuse us both you can have no doubts but that your little boy will be taken every possible care of and even a little months absence from that dear face on which your dotage hangs will make an amazing change for the better in it  he will be as handsome again by the time of your return to woodfort  lucy writes this night to lady harriet and fanny weston to attend her nuptials  all girls will fly to a wedding so that you will be left totally alone if you are so ill natured as to deny our request  who knows what a good example may do  the pensive lady harriet may perhaps be prevailed upon to sigh no more for her perjured swain but may possibly be inclined to make some worthy man happy as to fanny weston i am persuaded that the festivity of a wedding will entirely conquer her hopeless passion for the wandering thornton she is no penelope believe me and i fancy mr wills my lords brother will be able to banish the errant knight quite out of her mind  adieu my dear emily i hope you will make me happy in your next by telling me that i shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you indeed i want nothing else at present to complete my felicity  f straffon  letter xxviii lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny i am extremely charmed but not surprised at lucys conduct  here is every thing to be expected from sensibility and delicacy joined but indeed i have scarce ever known them separated in a female heart refined manners are the natural consequences of fine feelings which will even in an untutored mind form a species both of virtue and good breeding higher than any thing that is to be acquired either in courts or schools but when these two qualities receive every addition that education and example can bestow  when youth makes such bright objects still more bright  and fortune sets them in the strongest light  it is all of heaven that we below may view  and all but adoration is their due   thus do i think of our dear lucy yet i must say that she has been uncommonly fortunate in having such an opportunity of exerting the noble qualities of her heart and proving how much superior she is to the detestable meanness of malice or revenge charming girl may she be as happy as she deserves  she as well as you has entreated me to partake happiness  alas fanny though grief is contagious we cannot always sympe with joy  strange perverseness of our natures that accepts the evil and rejects the good do not from this suspect me of malevolence or suppose that i do not truly rejoice in lucys felicity but there is i know not why a kind of weight that hangs upon my mind which i find it impossible to remove perhaps change of place may help to shake it off  be that as it may i shall certainly comply with yours and lucys request  my lord has kindly promised to accompany me and our sweet little babe is to be left at lady lawsons indeed fanny you scarce can think what a sacrifice i make to quit him for a day but he will be under the protection of the best of women  i fear there is a scene preparing that will trouble her repose that bad miss fanning what a heart must hers be how void of gratitude and where that virtue is wanting there can subsist no other  neither precept nor example can operate on base minds  is it not strange that nature should vary so much in the human genius as to create a lucy straffon and a mary fanning so nearly of the same age too both descended from good families and both well educated the animal creation do not differ thus from their own species there are no furious sheep nor mild tigers  nature is uniform in all her works but man  hapless variety sad source of misery the tiger and the lamb are not less similar than the betrayer and betrayed  yet both wear the same form and only by experience is the difference found  nay sometimes we have seen the fairest face conceal the vilest heart as lurks the serpent underneath the rose  this is a mortifying subject i will no more of it  fanny weston as you guessed is in high spirits at the idea of lucys wedding  she talks of nothing but dress equipage and jewels ever since it has been mentioned  but a new subject is of infinite use in the country and i do not know whether a great funeral had not entertained her quite as much  nodding plumes and painted escutcheons will amuse the imagination when gilt coaches and gay liveries do not come in the way   happy trifler how i envy her  yet i am sure she loves lucy and fancies that she is really enamoured of sir james thornton too  i am certain that lady harriet would gladly be excused from going to london but i will not seem to see which way her inclinations tend  the silent heart which grief assails  treads soft and lonesome over the vales  sees daisies open rivers run  and seeks as i have vainly done  amusing thought but learns to know  that solitudes the nurse of woe and a sort and tender nurse it is  but dissipation may perhaps be good for us all and lady harriet shall try the recipe as well as  your affectionate etc e woodville  letter xxix lady straffon to lady woodville i think myself extremely obliged to my dear emily for her compliance with her friends request  you cannot conceive what delightful effects the hopes of seeing you have produced in hillstreet  sir john talks of nothing else but the sparkler you know he used to call you so  lucy is all gratitude for your kindness and my little emily holds up her head most amazingly that her aunt may observe what a fine carriage she has and how much she is grown since she saw her  the servants are all transported with double joy for lucys wedding and your arrival in short every one wears a smiling face and i shall not pardon it if there should appear the smallest trace of gloom on yours  i am very sorry for what you hint at with regard to lady lawson  but be assured that a woman should be thoroughly convinced not only of her husbands attachment but of his morals also before she intrudes a female inmate younger though perhaps not fairer than herself  the caution should be equally attended to with regard to male intimates  i have seldom known an habitual friendship that did not kindle into what is called love where there have been youth beauty and unceasing opportunity to fan the flame  i think if i were in lady lawsons case i should not feel much  for the heart of a man who is capable of seducing a young creature that is immediately under his protection can never be worth regretting i have always heard that sir william is a very debauched man and a truly delicate woman cannot preserve her affection for such a one long  contempt must follow vice and where we once despise we soon must cease to love  nor do i look upon miss fanning as an object of pity  bred up as she has been with so excellent a woman one should suppose her heart replete with every virtue  but she cannot possibly be possessed even of the common merits which we expect from a chambermaid when she can descend to prostitution without temptation  had she been led astray by an agreeable young man i could have pitied nay perhaps have loved and even esteemed her for i am not such an amazon in ethics as to consider a breach of chastity as the highest crime that a woman can be guilty of though it is certainly the most unpardonable folly and i believe there are many women who have erred in that point who may have more real virtue aye and delicacy too than half the fainted dames who value themselves on the preservation of their chastity which in all probability has never been assailed she alone who has withstood the solicitations of a man she fondly loves may boast her virtue and i will venture to say that such an heroine will be more inclined to pity than despise the unhappy victims of their own weakness  i have sported my opinion upon this subject very freely you must therefore allow me to explain myself more clearly i know your delicacy will be hurt if i do not and i may expect to be severely attacked by my dear little prude  first then i confine my fair penitents to the first choice a second error of this sort is never to be pardoned  passion is the only excuse that can possibly be made for such a transgression and a woman who has made such a sacrifice to love alone may be perfectly satisfied that she can never be subject to that passion in the same degree again for there never is above one human creature that we can love better than ourselves  the woman who receives two gallants is in my mind quite upon a footing with the most venal beauties whose capacious hearts scorn to be limited to any number all married ladies i absolutely exclude from my order of amiable unfortunates  they cannot even pretend to be deceived  whereas a simple girl however mean her condition may flatter herself that her lovers intentions are honorable old legends tell of king cophetua and the beggar maid and your pamelas and your mariannes encourage hope in young untutored minds which perhaps the artful destroyer takes the utmost pains to increase till they can trust and he betray no more  this is i confess a nice subject for a woman to treat upon but i promise you i will endeavor to make my girl distinguish between vice and weakness and i hope while she detests the one she will be always ready to pity and if in her power to protect the other  there is no character i so heartily abominate as that of the outrageously virtuous i have seen a lady render herself hateful to a large company by repeating perhaps a forged tale of some unhappy frail one with such a degree of rancour and malevolence as is totally inconsistent with the calm dignity of real virtue  have you ever read a fable which is bound up with mr moores but was written by mr brook called the female seducers i think it the prettiest thing that ever was written upon this subject  to that i refer you for my sentiments at large  your remark upon the diversity of natures amongst the human species is pretty and ingenious  but when we consider the amazing variety there is in the animal creation and how many of them are noxious we cannot wonder that there should be some difference in human kind had we been all formed with equal virtues those very virtues would have been rendered useless  an insipid tameness would have prevented emulation and life would have become a perfect sinecure  on the other hand were we all vicious disorder and confusion must take place and this world be quickly reduced to its primitive chaos without temptation there could be no virtue and without virtue this world could not subsist  we should not be so much pleased with the gentleness of the lamb if there was no animal more fierce nor should we feel the sweetness of the woodlarks note so sensibly as we do if we had never heard the screech owls voice or the croaking of the raven it is by comparison alone that we are capable of estimating good and evil both in the moral and natural sense  i could illustrate my argument as fully amongst our own species as in the brute creation but i have drawn this letter to such an immoderate length that i must at least defer the remainder of my discourse parson like to another opportunity  every thing is settled to lucys mind and lord mount williss happy day is fixed for saturday fortnight i hope you will come to town next week till then  adieu my ever dear emily f straffon  letter xxx lady woodville to lady straffon dear fanny i should have answered your letter by last post but was prevented by having company the two miss witherss spent three days with us  i told you before they were charming women but agreeable as i first thought them i now think them ten times more so  the eldest is extremely sensible and perfectly accomplished but of a grave turn the youngest has every merit of her sister with the most engaging vivacity imaginable she is soon to be married to an irish nobleman  happy man who is to be blessed with such a companion  she seems to feel some regret at the thoughts of quitting her friends and england but says she is sure that her lord will be so good to let her visit them sometimes and she would by no means wish to detach him from his native country or prevent his spending that fortune in it which he derives from it  miss withers is gone to ireland with her sister i am almost sorry that i ever was acquainted with these sweet girls since i am to lose the pleasure of their society so soon they told me a piece of news which though it surprised did not displease me  mr ransford is married to the marchioness of st aumont and they are now in france together  is it not odd that my lord never mentioned this particular as it is no secret in the country and he must certainly know it as he has been once or twice to see sir harry ransford but i think you desired me never to pry into his motives for any thing and i obey  indeed fanny you appear to me to affect the stoic too much from what you say about lady lawson but we can all bear the misfortunes of others with great fortitude  when they are lashed we kiss the rod resigning to the will of god   in my mind lady lawsons trial is a very fiery one  she is she must be doubly distressed as to the slight infidelities of husbands i think the wife must be contemptible who resents them but every woman that truly loves her husband wishes to preserve his heart and a consciousness of his attachment to another object must be productive of the most poignant anguish happy happy sister that have never felt that hydra of calamity  i grant that sir william lawson has ever been a debauched man but always had except in this instance so much regard to his lady to decency and humanity as to conceal his vices from her he therefore had not forfeited her esteem though she had lost his love  o loss beyond repair then her affection for that wretch miss fanning must add to her distress not having been blessed with children she looked upon this worthless girl as her own daughter  and can she in a moment forget the tenderness she has indulged so long and detest the wicked couple as she ought  impossible  i am really angry at your philosophic insensibility upon this occasion  for my part i can scarce behave with common civility either to sir william or miss fanning but lady lawson who is a saint behaves with her usual kindness to them both nor has ever seemed to have discovered or hinted the least suspicion of what is already too visible to the whole country  yet her lovely face is emaciated and pale and sometimes involuntarily sighs and tears escape her  i know my lord is extremely distressed on this occasion he loves his sister tenderly but fears his interposing might possibly make sir william lay aside all restraint and perhaps occasion a separation from his wife i am glad for this reason that we are leaving the country as i imagine miss fannings situation will make her removal necessary before we return to woodfort  you need not have apprehended my dissenting from your generous sentiments with regard to the unhappy victims of love  nay i carry my humanity further and feel for those who without strong passion fall a sacrifice to the vile arts of their seducer and their own weakness that unsuspecting confidence which is too frequently the cause of womens ruin must certainly arise from a generous disposition and i should look upon a young innocent girl who was armed at all points like a moor of moorhall to be an unnatural character  at the same time i detest a vicious woman more than any thing in the creation and for this reason my compassion does not extend to married ladies in general any more than yours  they have always a protector to fly to who upon that occasion if upon no other will with open arms receive them  for though every man may not love his wife every man is certainly jealous of his honor and the false notions of the world are at present so constituted that the failure of a woman brings infamy upon her husband while in a much more pitiable case it rests solely upon the injured unfortunate  however fanny i agree with you this is too nice a subject for a female pen though one is insensibly led into reflections that are humiliating to an honest mind but when he who knew the frailty of our natures adjudged the convict criminal his sentence was not severe for well he knew it was impossible there could be found a wretch so lost to humanity as to throw a stone  let not the young the gay the rich the fortunate whose situations in life have prevented their being liable to temptation like an herd of deer turn their armed brows against their wounded friend and give her to the hunters  miss withers and i were last night talking upon this subject and she repeated a little poem that lord digby her sisters lover had shown her it was written upon a particular occasion at a water drinking place in ireland called mallow some years ago  the unfortunate subject of it had been a much admired character in that place a few seasons before and dignified by the title of sappho  the lines are extremely pretty turn over and you will find them in the next page  verses written at the fountain at mallow in the county of cork in ireland thou azure fount whose crystal stream was once a nobler poets theme while to inspire the tuneful strain sappho was called nor called in vain ah let the good forgive if here i pay the tribute of a tear in tender grief for sapphos fate the wonder of thy banks so late so many virtues were thy share thou most accomplished ruined fair one error sure may be forgiven and pardon find from earth and heaven that sovereign power made us all suffered the sons of light to fall and often to mortify our pride from virtue lets the wisest slide ye fair no more her faults proclaim for your own sakes conceal her shame since if a nymph so wise could fail we well may think ye all are frail a truce for the present with this and every other subject but the pleasing thought of our meeting which i hope will be on tuesday evening next  till then adieu e woodvile ps we have got a furnished house in st jamessstreet and i am strongly tempted to bring my sweet little harry with me  cruel fanny never to mention my little cherub but i will be revenged and love him better for it    letter xxxi lady woodville to lady lawson london jan    a thousand thanks to my dear lady lawson for the pleasing account she has given me of herself and my dear little boy you will perhaps think me ill natured for rejoicing that you have no other companion at present but i am not so selfish as you imagine upon this occasion for i well know that the most agreeable company in the world could not abate your affectionate attention to him  but there are certain situations in life when our dearest friends become irksome to us from an apprehension that they may possibly discover what we wish to hide  there needs no other illustration of my opinion than a fair confession that i have sometimes seen you under these very circumstances with your brother and myself  but i hope and believe you will never again experience them i may now speak freely upon a subject which though your virtue and goodness concealed sir william has thought proper to mention to my lord with every eulogium on your conduct which noble as has been it could deserve  miss fanning set out for yorkshire this morning truly sensible of your goodness and her own unworthiness sir william says he is certain that it is not in your nature to detest her as much as she does herself he told my lord that this affair was by no means so unfortunate an event with regard to you two as it might at first have appeared to be as your behavior had not only made him esteem and admire but love you also a thousand degrees more than he ever had done before  he declared that he felt the impatience of a lover to throw himself at your feet and said he never should forgive himself for having rendered you unhappy by his infamous conduct joy joy to my dear sister will you forgive my saying that i envy your situation  i would give you an account of lady mount williss wedding dress equipage etc etc did i not know that your full heart can have no room to entertain such trifling ideas but i am certain it will give you pleasure to hear that lord mount willis is as amiable and accomplished as his charming bride and that i think they have the fairest prospect of a long uninterrupted course of happiness  as the house of lords are now sitting your brother purposes staying in town till march but i may whisper to you what i would not have him hear that i cannot help regretting so long an absence from woodfort from my child and from yourself  lady harriet my sister straffon and fanny weston present their more than compliments and my lord joins in love and sincere congratulations with your  truly affectionate woodville  letter xxxii lord woodville to lord seymour is it possible that my dear seymour can be so totally absorbed in his own felicity as to make him entirely forget his absent his unhappy friend i have been above two months in london without hearing from you miss straffons marriage with lord mount willis brought lady woodville and me to town  i confess i flattered myself that a change of objects and a scene of dissipation would have assisted me in conquering the gloomy disease that hangs upon my mind far from it i think it has rather increased my malady by laying me under greater restraints than i experienced at woodfort as all humors both of the mind and body acquire additional force if they are denied a vent  as my ill fortune would have it we are lodged in the same house the marchioness lived in and to add to my distress there is a picture of hers which was not finished when she went away that is hung up in my dressing room as lady woodville was coming to speak to me yesterday morning she overheard me in earnest discourse with the fair shadow she immediately retired supposing there was some company with me  when we met at dinner she smiling asked me who the lady was that came to visit me in the morning i could not for some time conceive the meaning of her question but when from the naivete of her discourse i understood it i was all confusion and your sister lady sandford who was at table with us gave me a look that perfectly convinced me she was acquainted with my folly  the inhuman marchioness must have revealed my weakness to her  seymour could not betray his friend yet may i not from hence deduce a kind of tacit compliment to myself by supposing she must have been vain of her conquest when she proclaimed it weak consolation like a drowning wretch i catch at rushes  why why can i not tear her fatal image from my breaking heart you have seen her seymour it is a thousand years since i beheld her  have age and ugliness yet overtaken her or is she lovely still excuse my raving  such i know it will appear to you  i know not whether i told you that lady woodville had presented me with a son before we left the country and appears if possible still more amiable in the character of a mother than before she was one  i rejoice to think that her being a parent has added to her happiness as well as her merit our virtue and our felicity are both increased by the diffusion of our affections  what a wretch am i then seymour who feel all mine concentered in one object where they must rest for ever  this reflection on myself is too severe nay most unjust for i declare that i am sensible of the utmost tenderness for the lovely the unoffending lady woodville and i would die rather than render her unhappy  at the same instant i adore the cruel insolent ungrateful marchioness what tortures must arise from such a state of contradiction  i am truly impatient to know whether you have prevailed with your fair vestal to renounce her vows and enter once again into this world of cares be assured i am sincerely interested in every thing that relates to you and this the most momentous point of your life is of the utmost consequence  to your ever affectionate woodville  letter xxxiii lord seymour to lord woodville yes woodville i confess it i have been absorbed entranced in the most delightful delusion that ever lulled the restless heart of man i have passed three months in paradise i thought not of the world nor of its cares  i even grudged the hours that nature claimed for rest they robbed me of my charlottes tuneful voice though her loved form often visited my slumbers  but the gay vision is now flown and i indeed awake as from a dream  you may suppose i reached belleveue in as short a space of time as it was possible  my charlotte was prepared to meet me at our first interview through all the agonizing joy i felt i perceived a steady calmness in her manner that spoke the tender the indulgent friend not the fond mistress the gravity of her dress added dignity to her deportment and awed even my tumultuous wishes into silence i looked up to her as to a superior being and felt myself grow little in her sight she took advantage of my first impressions and spoke to me in the following manner  you see before you sir the happiest of her sex now first permitted to indulge those fond sensations which nature plants in every human heart filial and sisterly affection  i will confess myself still farther gratified by seeing you the only object of a passion which took its rise in youth and innocence but which has long since matured into the firmest friendship and rendered you  pardon me my father the first the constant object of my prayers  but let not the fond wishes of a father or your own desires tempt you to think that aught on earth can move me to exchange the state of tranquil happiness i now enjoy for any other less pure and more precarious my vows were heard in heaven they passed not forth from feigning or forced lips for in the very moment i pronounced the words my heart assented to the pious sounds nor would i then have changed my situation even to be lord seymours wife  nor do i now repent the choice i made though fully satisfied both of your worth and love providence seemed to have planted insuperable bars between us at the hour when i fixed my purpose to renounce the world and my then torn heart found its sole peace in my humble acquiescence to his will  now mark me henry this is the last time that i shall ever speak upon the subject and it is in order to save your heart the pain of fruitless solicitation that i explain my resolution should his holiness be prevailed upon by my fathers entreaties to grant me the indulgence he has requested thus far i will on my part comply with the generals desire  i will spend one two or three months with him in this house whenever he shall command me but my place of residence must be the convent  there i have sworn to live and there i mean to die  there was something so commanding and determined in charlottes voice and manner even while she denounced a sentence so severe that neither her brother who was present nor i attempted once to interrupt her when she had finished i found my heart subdued and ready to sacrifice its very wish to whatever seemed most conducive to her happiness i was alas the fatal cause of the vows she had made how then should i dare to solicit the breach of them  truth woodville flashes conviction even upon our passions as swift as light obtrudes upon the eyes i instantly felt the delicate impossibility of her being happy in the world and as quickly resolved never to importune her to be wretched it was not however without the sincerest regret that i beheld my most sanguine hopes of happiness vanish once more into air  she received my acquiescence with her determination as the highest mark of my affection and told me that she now considered me in a light where the tenderest regard for my welfare was compatible with her duty and that henceforward she could know no difference in her affection for captain beaumont and lord seymour  from that time woodville our days have been spent in the most delightful intercourse and have stolen away almost unperceived by me charlottes voice which was ever charming is now so highly improved that no melody on earth can equal it the good old general who absolutely adores her is frequently melted into tears while she sings and upon all occasions gazes on her with a look of repentant sorrow and delight as if conscious of the injury he has done to the world by robbing it of such an ornament while her charming countenance is lighted up with the animated looks of filial love  she has prevailed on the general to be reconciled to his youngest daughter and her husband he has obtained the young mans release and is to purchase him a commission immediately as soon as that can be effected they will come here and charlotte will again retire into the convent how do i dread the fatal hour of separation and blush to think that even charlottes mind should be so far superior to my own  within these few days she has frequently mentioned her going to paris with a look and manner almost expressive of impatience yet chastened by the pain she sees it gives her father brother and the unhappy seymour must she agaid be torn from my fond eyes have i not sacrificed my wishes to her will and will she rob me of the last sole delight of sometimes gazing on her  her brother tried to prevail on her to let me visit her at the convent but she peremptorily refused nor will she even consent to see him except on particular business her father is the only person she will admit within those walls  this is a selfimposed restraint for the abbess is perfectly inclined to grant her every indulgence she can ask  i know nothing of the marchioness ransford nor any other person at paris i shall certainly accompany charlotte thither and when there shall acquaint you with every thing i hear about them i am truly concerned that your insatuation for that worthless woman should still continue  o woodville had you lost such a treasure as i have and by your own fault too what would your situation have been i will think of my miseries no more  but endeavor to enjoy the small portion of happiness that yet remains for me  i congratulate you on being a father  may that tender tie awaken every pleasimg sensation in your mind and restore your heart to the amiable lady woodville who only can deserve it  direct your next to the hotel de  at paris and till i arrive there  adieu seymour  letter xxxiv lord woodville to lord seymour once more returned to woodforts peaceful shades escaped from crowds and noise to gentle converse and the sweet music of my vocal woods yet can i not enjoy the pleasing scene i have so much longed for  the cause of my coming hither embitters the satisfaction i hoped to find in being here my emily is in a bad state of health occasioned as her physicians think by the foggy air and hurry of london  but o seymour to you i will confess the secret woundings of my troubled soul i fear that sorrow preys upon her tender heart for from the time of our being at york i have frequently imagined her mind was distressed but whenever she seemed to perceive that idea rising in my thought she has instantly banished it by assuming an air of cheerfulness and vivacity and the transition was made with such amazing ease that i thought it impossible she should be insincere and that the gloomy medium of my own reflections and not hers had tinctured her appearance with an air of sorrow can it be possible seymour that a creature so young and innocent as lady woodville can be capable of disguising her sentiments and hiding her grief in smiles  i begin to fear that women are our superiors in every thing if she has perceived my passion for the marchioness and concealed the anguish which such a discovery must occasion to a heart like hers for well i know she fondly loves me the story of the spartan boy would no longer be repeated but lady woodville be henceforth considered as the first example of human fortitude  in what a light then must her lord appear i cannot bear the thought  when the physicians first attended her they advised her setting out immediately for the south of france but she refused to go with a more determined air and manner than i had ever seen her assume before i imagined her dislike arose from the thought of being separated from her son and immediately assured her that he should go with us she thanked me for my condescension but said it had only removed one of her objections and that not the strongest  then with a tear just starting from her eye she entreated that i would not press her farther i kissed away the pearly fugitive as it stole down her cheeks which was instantly lighted up by the soft glow of joy and modesty  she told me then she wished to return to woodfort and if i pleased she would go to bristol when the season came on  i acquiesced in every thing she desired and would at that instant as i would at this have laid down my life to procure her health and happiness we set out immediately for this place  for the first three or four days i thought her better since that i too plainly perceive that she declines  if she should die seymour i shall consider myself as her murderer surely you would then allow me the painful preeminence of wretchedness and acknowledge your situation when compared to mine to be like beds of roses to the rack o no it must not be  she shall not die  i never was so impatient for any era as for the month of june  i have great hopes from the hotwells my emilys youth and naturally good constitution  i had not the least expectation that your charlotte would have been prevailed on to quit the convent indeed i scarcely hoped that she would have condescended as far as she has done by consenting to spend a portion of every year at belleveue happy seymour to have such a subject for expectation before you  it is surely one of the highest degrees of human felicity to look forward with hope  you will pardon me if i think there is some faint trait of the coquette in her refusing to see you at the convent she certainly wishes to keep your flame alive and as she does not mean to feed it with any thing more substantial than her conversation she wisely thinks that that like all other enjoyments might possibly pall upon the taste if too often repeated  she has therefore enjoined you a long fast in order to heighten your relish for the feast of reason you i dare say as a still passionate lover may probably think this little ruse damour unnecessary but i am firmly persuaded that abstinence will enhance the value of our mental as well as corporeal pleasures  a servant has just informed me that lady woodville is ready to ride out  i attend her on horseback every day  adieu my friend woodville ps i hope this will be a letter of credit for me in your books as i have not once drawn upon your patience by mentioning the marchioness  be generous then my dear seymour and reward my selfdenying virtue    letter xxxv lord seymour to lord woodville my dear woodville i have made an exchange directly opposite to yours having just quitted the sweet scenes of belleveue and my charlottes delightful converse for the irksome crowds and noise of this great city  the young musqueteer and his lady arrived at general beaumonts about a fortnight ago charlotte had fixed the time of her return to the convent for the tenth day after they came but her sister madame de carignon being taken violently ill made her postpone her journey and made me hasten mine  from the time that maria complained charlotte never quitted her apartment  belleveue became a desert to me and i fancied i should feel less regret at being separated from her by distance than accident  but the effects are the same be the cause what it may for there is no place or situation that can afford me happiness in her absence  you treat charlotte very severely nay unjustly by charging the highest proof of her delicate affection to the account of coquetry she is too sensible not to perceive that my passion for her renders me unhappy and she though vainly flatters herself that time and absence may effect a cure  this she in confidence declared to captain beaumont when pressed by him to receive my visits  alas she little knows i would not change my malady for health and yet i will conform to her prescription and drink the bitter draught without a murmur o woodville when we truly love it is our highest transport to obey  i am truly concerned for the account you give of lady woodville but find a secret consolation for her sufferings in your sensibility as i am almost certain that your tenderness properly exerted toward her will restore both her health and happiness  i dare not trust myself with a doubt of your conduct upon this occasion  i think nothing can be plainer than her knowledge of your attachment to the marchioness  her positive refusal of going to france marks it too strongly woodville i fear  but i will not reproach you  your own generous heart must sting you too severely  i have this moment received a letter from captain beaumont  madame de garignons disorder appears to be the small pox and as she is pretty far advanced in her pregnancy they think her life in danger what has been gained by making her fly from that disease a few months ago  but i have not time now to moralize i shall send off a physician immediately and shall follow him myself in a few hours my charlotte must want consolation and is at the same time the only person capable of administering it to her unhappy father  yours ever seymour ps i should give you credit for not mentioning the marchioness in your letter if i had not heard that ladies and lovers generally postponed their most material business to their postscripts be that as it may i can only tell you the marchioness and her caro sposo are in this town but where i know not captain barnard and lady ransford are also here    letter xxxvi lord woodville to lord seymour dear seymour lady woodville is much better  sir john and lady straffon lord and lady mount willis have been here this fortnight  the polite cheerfulness of their society has i believe been of infinite service to emily but i still flatter myself that my attention and tenderness have contributed more to her recovery than any thing else  i have now the real happiness to think that every apprehension of her mind is entirely removed i can therefore scarcely doubt but that health and peace will return together for i am but too clearly convinced that the privation of the latter occasioned the loss of the former  there certainly never was a more amiable creature than lady woodville  so unassuming in her manners so fearful of giving pain that she would if possible conceal her complaints even from her domestics who all adore her  is it not amazing seymour that perfectly sensible as i am of her uncommon merits there should be found a being upon earth who holds a higher place in my affection how falsely do they flatter our understanding who say that esteem is the basis of love if that were true i should be the happiest of men should think no more of the ungrateful isabella should no longer feel the reproaches of a wayward heart which would then be entirely devoted to the charming emily  but though i may never be able entirely to eradicate this fatal disease from my mind i have great pleasure in perceiving that the constant exertion of my tenderness toward emily is attended with the sincerest delight to myself as it fulfils a duty and flatters my humanity with the idea of conferring happiness upon an amiable and deserving object  the practice of any virtue is not so difficult as we are apt to imagine  there requires nothing more than resolution to commence  habit will soon make it easy if not pleasant to us  yet still must i envy those who have no need to struggle and when i behold the ingenuous fondness of lord mount willis and sir john straffon to their wives i curse my fate and despise my own weakness for having reduced me to the contemptible necessity of seigning what they are happy enough to feel  we are to return the visits of our present guests in our way to bristol  lord mount willis has a very fine seat in somersetshire  he is a very agreeable accomplished man his wife before her marriage loved sir james miller  passionately loved him  and yet she has withdrawn her illplaced fondness and doats upon her lord shall i be weaker weaker than a puny girl and shall the voice of reason always plead in vain  i dare not reply to these mortifying queries  i most sincerely pity the unhappy general de beaumont his misfortunes have been multiplied on him at a time when he is least able to encounter them there is a spring in youth which makes us capable of resisting almost any pressure but when a body which has been nursed in the soft lap of prosperity becomes enfeebled by years the mind also partakes of its enervation and we have still less reason to expect a vigorous exertion of the mental powers than of muscular strength at threescore  the wisdom therefore that is in general attributed to age arises more from a privation of passion than from experience or any other cause as the nerves grow rigid the heart is insensibly rendered callous the exquisite sensations both of pain and pleasure after a certain time of life are imperceptibly blunted by each returning day and we at last become solely indebted to memory for informing us that we were ever capable of feeling the extremes of joy or sorrow  the only passion which nature seems to design should remain in its full force in our declining age is paternal affection and as the others subside i should imagine that gains strength  there is a mixture too of selflove in it which generally makes its existence equal with our own the objects of this affection are gradually maturing under our fostering care each day they make some advances toward our idea of perfections a likeness to ourselves with anxious hopes we watch the tender buds look with delight upon the opening blossom and gaze enraptured on the blooming fruit  it is our own we planted and we reared it in this most tender point then the poor old general is now vounded his armor and his breast plate thrown aside the barbed arrow sinks into his heart  should madame de carignon die which i hope she will not there are abundance of good christians who would immediately conclude her death to be a judgment on him for his inhuman treatment of charlotte but i who confess myself a sinner have not a doubt of his having already atoned his passive guilt toward her by his contrition  you are the single person who appear to be injured by it  for i am fully satisfied that charlotte is no longer unhappy  i have philosophized and moralized upon this subject to the extent of my time and paper perhaps to prevent my entering again upon another on which i am neither philosopher nor moralist  i shall therefore fly from it by bidding you  adieu woodville  letter xxxvii lord seymour to lord woodville dear woodville madame de carignon is recovered if it can be called a recovery for a fine young woman to survive her beauty  that is indeed absolutely destroyed but as her husbands fondness seems unabated by the loss her homeliness may possibly become an advantage rather than a misfortune  eew very few women or men either have strength of mind sufficient to bear universal admiration and when that is derived from beauty alone there is scarce a young person who thinks it neccessary to attain any other qualification or accomplishment that does not tend to the embellishment of their charms  i have observed through life that we seldom meet with an agreeable man or woman who have been remarkably handsome but perhaps this may be philosophically accounted for  as providence acts by the simplest means and beauty is alone sufficient to procure the love and admiration of mankind great qualities would be unnecessary to the purpose and perhaps bar the original design for we should be more apt to fear than love a human being that we considered as absolutely perfect  i therefore think with milton that where there is bestowed too much of ornament in outward show elaborate the inwards less exact which may be a kind of consolation to those whom nature has dealt her personal favors to with a scanty hand  in the country where i am at present neither youth or beauty are of much value the grandmother and grand daughter are pretty much upon the same footing  what little difference there may be is generally in the dowagers favor as she may probably be possessed of more knowledge and experience and a better fortune  no woman is ever young or old at paris for the same paint that fills up the furrows of the aged cheek hides the soft down upon the youthful one  you see that a word to the wise is enough and that i have followed your plan of philosophizing upon different subjects to avoid recurring to painful ones  i must however acquaint you that i am to attend charlotte to paris in three days she has insisted on my returning to england as soon as she enters the cloister and i have consented on her promising to meet me here next spring provided the general be then living  the poor old man has insisted on captain beaumonts quitting the army and taking possession of his fortune except a small annuity which he reserves for charitable uses he has behaved nobly to monsieur and madame de carignon and presented twenty thousand crowns to the convent of st anthony as a reward for their kindnesses to his beloved charlotte you would pity him sincerely if you were to behold his distress at the idea of parting with his favorite child but  what are alas his woes compared to mine  adieu my friend if i were capable of joy i should feel it for lady woodvilles recovery i shall write to you from paris and am  ever yours seymour  letter xxxviii lord seymour to lord woodville paris i have once more bid adieu to my dear charlotte  but painful as the hour of separation was the recollection of what i had formerly endured from her entrance into the convent with the fond hope of our remeeting in a few months have abated its anguish and some very extraordinary accidents which have happened within these few hours have taken up my whole attention and carried me as it were out of myself  the count de clerembaut for whom you know i have a sincere frindship came to see me yesterday morning  he told me he was just come from the teniscourt where there had been a very warm brouiderie between two english gentlemen one of their names he said was ransford who quitted the field to his antagonist but with a look and manner that seemed to say he was determined to meet him elsewhere  i was alarmed at this account and immediately ordered my chariot and drove to the marchionesss ransford was not at home  i came back to my hotel and wrote to him expatiated on the ill consequences of fighting a duel in paris begged him to defer his resentments till his opponent whom i understood to be an englishman and he should meet in their own country but if he should be circumstanced as to be under a necessity of rejecting my advice i hoped he would at least accept of my service to attend him to the field or command me in whatever way he thought proper  in about three hours i received the following answer  to lord seymour my dear lord i am truly thankful for your kind attention to me but i am at present too far embarked to recede and even your admonition must therefore come too late let the consequence be what it will i cannot think of heightening my distress by involving you in it but i have a much more material act of friendship to implore from you  the marchioness will stand in need of your protection  i need say no more  hasten to her the affair will be over before you receive this i have the satisfaction to think that captain barnard deserves his fate if he should fall by my hand as he has this day added fresh insult to former injury  adieu perhaps for ever william ransford   i instantly ran or rather flew to the marchioness whom i found waiting dinner for mr ransford  she seemed surprised at my entrance as she had heard that i had been there in the morning  the anxiety of my countenance became contagious and she enquired with the greatest earnestness if i knew any thing about mr ransford before i could reframe a reply the lieutenant de police was on the stairs and i rushed out of the room to prevent his coming into it he passed me by and entered  she did not appear to be alarmed  it seems there is a lawsuit between her and her late husbands heir for part of her jointure and she i suppose concluded that he came to execute some order of court relative to that affair but long before he could fully explain the real motives of his coming she ceased to hear and had sunk motionless upon the sofa where she sat  the lieutenant and his myrmidons took possession of every thing au nom du roi and assured us that diligent search would be made for the murderer i entreated him to leave the unhappy ladys apartment to herself and that i would be answerable for every thing in it he retired with infinite politeness which is the best substitute to humanity and in this country which abounds with show and delusion is frequently mistaken for it  as the marchioness is five months gone with child it was thought proper to have her blooded  every possible care has been and shall be taken of her she is distressingly grateful for my small attentions toward her but a mind subdued by affliction is apt to overrate every little mark of kindness  this unhappy affair will detain me here for some time longer  i will not quit the post of guardian to the afflicted fair till i resign her into ransfords hands you shall daily hear from me  adieu seymour  letter xxxix lord seymour to lord woodville yesterday passed away in forming melancholy conjectures on the recent cause of quarrel between captain barnard and mr ransford in intermediate ideas whither he would bend his course and in listening to various reports which were variously repeated by the friends acquaintance and servants of the unhappy combatants  we had however the satisfaction to discover that ransford had made some provision for his escape as he had converted above three hundred pounds into post bills the morning of the duel and had ordered a swiss servant who has lived with him for five years and is remarkably attached to him to attend at a particular place with a couple of the fleetest horses he could hire or purchase from hence i conclude he will travel to switzerland and take up his abode at berne till he can return with honor and safety into england  you will perhaps say why at that particular place more than any other i grant the idea is formed upon a vague conjecture but andre was born at berne and the swiss are of all nations the scotch not excepted the most smitten with the love of their country ransfords mind must be unhinged by this sad accident torn from its props and ready to recline itself on the first friendly stay that will support it the honest swiss looks back with transport on those barren hills where first his mind found joy his body strength and leads his master there to share the gifts which he received from nature and the soil i say he will not stop till he arrives at berne  the marchioness does not agree with my opinion she thinks brussels holland italy nay england more agreeable that is she could like to six her residence in any of those places rather than at berne  they are all equal to me except england where i am pretty sure he will not go  there were too sealed letters found in captain barnards pocket the one addressed to lady ransford the other to the man who killed him i will wait upon her ladyship to morrow to obtain the latter it must certainly throw some extraordinary light upon the affair  i had written so far when i received a summons from the marchioness to attend instantly a thousand apprehensions crowded on my mind i feared ransford might not have escaped and i knew the vindictive spirit of his step mother too well to hope that she would not prosecute i found the marchioness in a state little short of madness  her expressions were such as made me rather fear than feel  her eyes darted fire and she traversed the circumference of her dressing room with the air and pace of distraction she seemed to be unsexed  where is he madam said i let me fly to him and try what gold can do to purchase his enlargemant this must be our only resource let them take it all said she but let me go  a lettre de cachet no monarch nor no minister dare sign it  i will fly to versailles  it is already granted and you see me a prisoner at this moment  dare you rescue me  amazement took away the power of speech i did not understand her it was impossible i should  at that instant a person of a very gentleman like and engaging appearance entered the chamber  he seemed to be astonished at her beauty and perturbation and gazed for an instant first at her and then at me  at last seeming to recollect himself he addressed me in thd following words  i am sorry your indiscretion has permitted our meeting sir  it is true i have received no particular information against you you are therefore at liberty to depart which i beg you will do instantly as you cannot be safe in this house a single moment  i immediately perceived he had mistaken me for mr ransford and readily accepting all the good will he had shown to my friends unhappy situation returned him thanks for his intended humanity and assured him of my gratitude for a favor which i did not stand in need of he blushed at his mistake and said that he had been twelve years in office and had never exceeded his commission but in that way strange that a man should blush that had been twelve years in such an office  he then explained his business  he had a lettre de cachet against madame which the marquess de st aumont her husbands nephew had obtained to prevent her quitting the kingdom till the suit between them should be determined  her rage is not to be described she accused the laws of injustice and its officers of insolence and cruelty asked to what prison a peeress should be led and whether she was to be handcuffed like a malefactor to all this intemperate language the officer replied with great calmness that her ladyship might put an end to her distress by giving security to the court for her stay in paris she told him she would not stay for all the courts in europe he then said something in a low voice about her being confined  she had sent for her lawyer who arrived critically and prevailed on her at last to pass her word jointly with us that she would not quit paris without leave of the court which he said he would apply for the next day  the agitation of her spirits now subsiding she fell into violent passions of tears bewailed her fate and said she was the most wretched of human beings i fear she has more reason to think so than she is yet acquainted with for after she withdrew to her chamber her lawyer at my request explained the nature of the process against her and assured me that the late marquess de st aumont had no power over those lands which he settled on her for a jointure that he was therefore very glad to find she was married to an english gentleman of fortune as he had great reason to believe the cause would go against her  that he feared she was extremely in debt and that all her personalities were already forfeited to the crown as being the supposed property of mr ransford what a scene of distress woodville and what will become of this unhappy pair  before i left the house the marchioness sent for her lawyer into her chamber  i took that opportunity of retiring to write to you and shall now close this melancholy narrative with wishing you good night  letter xl lord seymour to lord woodville dear woodville both my mind and my body are so extremely harrassed that i am scarce able to give you an account of the distresses in which i am involved  just as i had sealed my last letter to you i received a billet from captain beaumont to inform me that the general and he were that moment arrived in paris and that their coming was occasioned by a very alarming account they had received of my everdear charlottes being extremely indisposed  i flew directly to the generals house and found the poor old man sinking under the double weight of years and sorrow he showed me the abbesss letter to him which said that from the time of charlottes return into the convent a fever had preyed upon her spirits that she had concealed her illness for several days and even made light of it when it was too visible that she was now reduced to such a state of weakness that the physicians had declared medicine could be of no use to her and that an immediate change of air was the only chance she had for life  no words can express what i felt on reading this sad letter yet will i heartily confess that her fathers anguish seemed to surpass even mine he called himself her murderer and said if she should die he never could have hopes of mercy or salvation  alas am i not guilty as himself my fatal rashness made her take those vows which her fond love for me in any other case would have rejected  the general determined to remove charlotte out of the convent the next day and convey her as far out of paris as her strength would permit he entreated me to accompany them in their melancholy and slow progress to belleveue judge of my distress at being obliged to refuse but my honor was passed to a wretch who has none  the marchioness  captain beaumont promised to bring me a faithful account of his sisters situation in the morning and i retired home  not to rest  captain beaumont was punctual to his word he came to me before eight oclock and told me that his father and he had seen charlotte and found her in a very weak state that she had consented to set out with them for belleveue but that he did not believe they should be able to carry her farther than three or four leagues that day and entreated me to go with them i readily consented and determined that i would return to paris that night as soon as ever charlotte should retire to bed  the captain and i agreed to meet at the generals house at eleven oclock to follow our fair fugitive who was to set out with her father from the convent he told me that charlotte had made a thousand tender inquiries about my health that she rejoiced at my being still in paris and seemed delighted at the thought of seeing me that day i needed not these new proofs of her regard to increase my ardour for her my soul was on the wing to meet her yet still the claims of friendship were not unheard  i resolved to go immediately to lady ranfford for the letter that was addressed to her stepson and found in barnards pocket then to wait on the marchioness and make my excuse for absenting myself from her the remainder of that day but though she had left paris it was fated that i should not quit it for some time  as i was coming out of my apartment i was met by the lieutenant de police who arrested me as an accomplice with the marchioness in having defrauded his majesty by conveying away her most valuable effects which were confiscated to his use and having fled herself though under an arret  never was astonishment greater than mine  in vain i pleaded ignorance of the fact or the innocence of my intentions or offered to give ample security for those effects which had been secreted by that mean that worthless woman the officer told me he was not quite such an idiot as the person who had taken my word before and that no argument i could urge would have the least weight with him  as the last and most prevailing rhetoric i offered him my purse if he would go with me to general beaumonts and take his bail for my appearance the next day but he withstood my gold and even refused to let me return into my apartment to write an apology for not attending my beloved charlotte  this was the first time i had ever felt the insolence of office  i submitted to it though reluctantly and was immediately conveyed to the chatelet  i sent off a servant to captain beaumont to desire him to come to me but as soon as i was lodged in prison i was informed that no person would be admitted to see me as they considered me as a delinquent of state  i then demanded to be confronted with my accusers and brought before a judge they smiled at my ignorance and told me that as i was not in england i must submit to their laws which were not quite so expeditious as ours and that patience would be my best resource for the present  though my temper is naturally gentle and my passions have been long subdued by affliction it was with difficulty i could command my rage  yet on whom should i vent it on wretches brazed by custom to the wild ravings of resentment or the soft plaints of sorrow  as soon as i was capable of reasoning with myself i considered that a consciousness of my own integrity ought to support me under the disagreeable circumstances i was involved in by anothers fault and am certain it would have done so had i not been disappointed of the painful pleasure of seeing the lovely languid charlotte i lamented the uneasiness which she must feel from hearing of my confinement unknowing of the cause and the apprehension of her thinking me guilty of some criminal action and her suffering from that thought almost distracted me i cursed the marchioness a thousand times  yes woodville from my heart i cursed her bane of your happiness disturber now of mine  when i grew a little calm i desired to see the keeper of the prison as i wanted to know whither i was at liberty to write to the english ambassador who i knew was then at versailles and to the rest of my friends the governor du chatelet was immediately announced and on his entering my eye was struck with the most graceful figuere and engaging countenance i had ever seen he seemed to be turned of fifty but had such a softness of features and complexion as is rarely to be met with but in extreme youth his appearance filled me with surprise i was amazed that such a man should be capable of such an office which i supposed could not only be suited to the most insensible or brutal natures  his conversation was as pleasing as his person he readily assented to my request and said he would take care that my letters should be delivered he then gave orders that my own servants should be permitted to attend me and that any person whom i desired to see should be immediately admitted i thanked him for his humanity in removing every unnecessary restraint and assured him i should make no other use of his indulgence than that of endeavouing to procure my liberty by the most legal means  he increased my astonishment by replying to me in english that he could not have any doubts of lord seymours honor and that he hoped i would do him and his family the favor to dine with them and allow them as much of my company as was convenient to me while i remained in the chatelet  my curiosity to know something more of his family made me accept his invitation though heaven knows how little inclined to mix with strangers or enter into any plan of dissipation i have written to the ambassader and to my dear charlotte by removing her anxiety i have lessened my own  i am not apprehensive that my confinement can last many hours i will therefore endeavor to keep up my spirits with the fond hopes of flying to my charlotte the moment i am released in the mean time i attend the governors summons to dinner and for the present bid my dear woodville  adieu yours seymour ps what is the reason that i do not hear from you whilst at libetty i regretted but in my confinement shall lament your silence my affectionate compliments to lady woodville    letter xli lady straffon to lady woodville  hope travels through nor quits us till we die and without that charming companion i think i should not now survive to tell my dear woodville that i am just released from a confinement of fifteen tedious days but let me be methodical in my relation  no it is impossible my chariot waits to carry me to bellevue to my adored charlotte se is better i am happy and most sincerely yours  seymour  letter xlii lord seymour to lord woodville belleveue charlotte recovers daily my fears for her precious life are abated your silence now alarms me  why must i never be free from apprehensions for those i truly love but i will for the present indulge your impatience and restrain my own  on the first day of my confinement i was shown into the governors apartment which was elegantly furnished and received by him and his lady with the utmost politeness she was surrounded by five beautiful children the eldest a girl about sixteen i will confess it woodville my eyes were insensibly rivetted to this young creatures lovely form and for the first time of my life my heart received a delight from gazing on the charms of another woman besides charlotte  i did not long indulge the dangerous pleasure without calling the wanderer to account and soon perceived that the fair marias chief attraction was owing to her remarkable likeness to my charlotte this observation quieted my scruples and left me the innocent satisfaction of admiring her beauty with a brothers eye yet still my curiosity was increased by the resemblance and as soon as i was left alone with the governor i took the liberty of asking him if he was related to general beaumont  he answered no but said his wife was sister to the late madame de beaumont though much unlike her both in mind and person that he could well allow madame dangueville inferior in respect of beauty but that her understanding and heart were fraught with every charm and virtue that could adorn a woman  i asked him had he never seen his niece charlotte beaumont he answered with an honest warmth yes sir when it was too late to make her happy or reward your merit  would to heaven i had known her sooner i bowed and thanked him even for fruitless wishes and for a time forgot my being a prisoner from the delight i felt at being with one who knew and loved my charlotte  we became totally unreserved and the governor informed me that he was of the n  family descended from one of those infatuated men who had sacrificed their fortunes and renounced their country to serve a weak and worthless prince who had neither inclination or power to reward their attachment  he told me that his father had died of a broken heart while he was but a child that his friends had with difficulty obtained him a commission in the irish brigade where he had served above twenty years without arriving to the rank of captain and that he might have still remained in that situation but that general beaumont by his interest had procured him the post he then enjoyed when he and his family had been reduced to the greatest distress  that he hoped he had acquitted himself in his office with humanity and compassion and by many circumstances which he related convinced me that none but a person of a noble and generous nature was fit to preside over the number of unfortunates that guilt or accident impels to that gloomy mansion sad reflection that those who are fittest for the charge are most averse to accept and least thought of for the office  about seven oclock in the evening captain beaumont inquired for me and was immediately admitted his uncle monsieur dangueville had never seen him before  they were mutually eharmed with each other the captain told me that as soon as my servant acquainted him with my situation he wrote a line to the general to inform him of it and set out on the instant for versailles that he had seen the english ambassador who promised to wait on monsieur le duc de n  the premier minister next morning and obtain my release as soon as possible  i thanked my generous friend for his kind attention to my interests and passed the evening with tolerable cheerfulness the next day about noon i received a visit from mr s  secretary to our ambassador he told me that his excellency had been with the minister and desired that i might be set at liberty immediately that the duc de n  had informed him it was impossible to comply with his request as there was a criminal process instituted against me for aiding and abetting the marchioness de st aumont in open violation of the laws and the only favor that could be indulged me was the allowing me counsel and bringing the affair to a trial with the utmost expedition  i endeavored to make a virtue of necessity and affected to appear contented with the very small favor that his excellency had obtained for me but not to make the repetition of my confinement as tedious to you as the time was to me the day of trial came and by the joint testimony of the marchionesss lawyer her servants and my own i was acquitted of being concerned in her escape but obliged to give bail for four thousand pounds which is the value set upon the jewels plate etc which she either carried off or secreted  thus have i been injured in my honor person and property by my humane attention to that most worthless of humankind but no matter and if the meanness of her conduct toward me sets her in the light in which i wish you to behold her i shall think myself overpaid for every injury i have sustained on her account  the moment i recovered my liberty i waited on the ambassador who had come to paris on purpose to know if he could be any way serviceable to me i made my acknowledgments to him and set out that evening with my dear and indefatigable friend captain beaumont for the loved place where my hearts treasure lay i have already told you that i had the happiness of finding her much better and the joy which she felt at seeing her brother and me has i flatter myself contributed to her recovery  the marchionesss lawyer told me he had received a letter from her dated at brussels wherein she exulted at her own cleverness in getting out of the power of the laws and gave some dark hints of her not being married to ransford heaven grant that this may be true the suit with her husbands nephew will go against her and for her contempt of the arret she will be outlawed and her whole fortune confiscated  so that if as i hope she is not ransfords wife she may possibly be reduced to her original poverty and meet the contempt due to her vices from all mankind  this is the fifth letter i have written to you without receiving a line from you i have certainly reason to apprehend that some fatal accident has occasioned your silence for i can never doubt the sincerity of your attachment to yours  most truly seymour  letter xliii lady woodville to lady straffon pity me pray for me my dearest sister for heaven but mocks my prayers had they been heard lord woodvilles life had never been in danger i am distracted fanny i would that i were though anguish such as mine strains every sense and racks my tortured brain it will not crack no i am still awake to all the mieseries a wretch can feel who doats and who despairs  on tuesday sen night fatal day my lord received a letter from lord seymour while i was present i observed that he was strongly agitated while he read it even to a change of countenance and color i thought there must be some extraordinary cause for his emotion which perhaps he wished to conceal from me i therefore rose softly from my seat and attempted to retire  o fanny can i ever forget the look of sorrow which he wore when taking me by the hand he said you must not leave me emily but share a painful office with your lord  you must endeavor to console poor lady harriet for barnards death ransford has killed him and is fled from paris  he then turned quick away as if to hide his grief it could not be for barnard that he wept and ransford he as well as i believed he was safe  o there is another cause let me not think of it lest it divide my tears which should all flow for him and not for my worthless self  he told me he would go directly to sir harry ransford to acquaint him with his sons misfortune and as he could not do it abruptly said it was possible he might stay to dinner there and begged i would take the most immediate opportunity of informing lady harriet of this unhappy affair his horses were immediately ordered and he rode off  i sent for fanny weston to assist me in the painful task i had undertaken but why do i waste a moment in thinking of any object upon earth but one about two hours after my lord left woodfort one of the servants who had attended him galloped into the court yard ordered the chariot to be got ready instantly and bid my woman tell me that my lord had fallen from his horse and much hurt  i was sitting in lady harriets dressing room when the sound of the chariot passing hastily under the window alarmed me  i rang to know the cause when a servant pale as death told me that my lord had met with a sad accident i cried where is he and rushed out of the room i was met by my woman on the stairs lady harriet fanny weston and she prevented my running into the highway they poured drops and water down my throat i knew not what they did or said to me  an express was sent off for a surgeon who arrived in less than half an hour after my lord was brought home senseless they would not suffer me to see him till he had been bled and his wounds dressed  but gracious heaven when i beheld him  let me try to banish the sad idea  alas i fear it will never be effaced never my sister never unless i live to see his natural form restored to my fond wishes and my ardent prayers  oh join with me my fanny in earnest supplication for his precious life  the humane the tenderhearted surgeon said every thing that could amuse but not dispel my fears that his wounds though dangerous in his poor judgment were not mortal but that he wished for better help than his own  an express was dispatched for middleton or ranby  i cannot but i would not if i could describe the night i passed  my lord remained quite senseless enviable state yet now and then his languid eyes fixed on me about five in the morning he fell into a kind of a dose and remained in that situation till near seven when he awoke in the most violent delirium  he raved incessantly  but not of me  in this most melancholy state he has continued eleven days  a burning fever and a broken heart o fanny it is too much but should he recover it i never shall  mr ranby and the surgeon who first attended my dear lord have both assured me that the hurt which he received from his fall could not endanger his life but neither they nor the physicians who visit him daily can pretend to say what turn his fever will take strong opiates have been given and at length have taken effect he sleeps my fanny while i who have never closed my eyes since the sad accident indulge them now in their once pleasing task of writing to my friend my more than sister grief weighs my eyelids down but not with the soft pressure of an healthful slumber  adieu adieu my dear fanny e woodville  letter xliv lady straffon to lady woodville let not my dearest emily condemn her sincerely affectionate and afflicted fanny for not having instantly replied in person to her most affecting letter  o my emily my child my sister how does my heart bleed for you tears dim my sight and yet perhaps your eyes are dry the burning balls fixed on your dying lord would you could weep as i do  as my spirits have been rather weak and languid since my lying in even while i was at woodfort lady mount willis whose attention and tenderness to me is without bounds prevailed upon sir john and me to pass a few weeks with her at a house which my lord has hired near windsor while his family seat is repairing the old topics of change of air and moderate exercise were exhausted both by sir john and her before i would consent  at length i most reluctantly complied i knew not then why i should feel reluctance but i now begin to think with you that our presages should be listened to  would i had hearkened then to mine i should now be with my dearest emily and by sharing her anguish and fatigue perhaps in some degree might lessen both  but we now must feel the sad addition to our present miseries of knowing that each other is unhappy  about two hours before the post brought your letter to windsor lord mount willis and sir john set out for his lordships in oxfordshire and while lucy and i were sitting at breakfast after they were gone we heard a violent scream  i knew the voice to be my little emilys  i ran up stairs to her chamber without recollecting that she had been some time dressed and playing with the house keepers daughter a child of her own age in the garden  lady mount willis followed the sound and found my poor little angel lying on the ground with her leg broken the only words she spoke were do not let my mama be frighted and fainted quite away  in this condition she was brought into the house i will not attempt to describe mine your situation is by far more dreadful yet sure it was a scene of deep distress suffice it now to say that the moment she is out of danger i will fly to share or alleviate my dearest emilys affliction the fond the tender claims of child and sister now divide my heart  it almost breaks that i must say  adieu f straffon  letter xlv lady woodville to lady straffon my dearest fanny this is the one and twentieth day of my lords illness and on this day be it for ever blessed by me the physicians have observed a change in his disorder attended with many favorable symptoms that gave hopes of life he lay for many days in a state of insensibility had ceased to rave and hardly moved his limbs  at eleven oclock this morning he sighed extremely o fanny those sad sighs too long have pierced my heart then seemed to wake as from a trance the first object he took notice of was me and with a languid voice he said my emily have you sat up all night o go to bed my love then closed his eyes and fell into a little slumber  i could not answer him tears came to my relief and drowned my utterance yes fanny i have wept most bitterly and my poor heart is much relieved doctor fenton insists on bleeding me immediately i know he thinks that i have caught the fever from my lord blessed contagion may it not fanny lighten his disease would i not die to lessen or remove his heart felt pains but i much fear that even my death would not now heal his griefs  she is anothers and never can be his  i fear i rave my thoughts are wild i do not wish that you should comprehend them  your poor dear emily i hope she will recover  a broken limb is dreadful but a broken heart worse they snatch away the pen well well i will be blooded aye and i will go to bed my limbs no longer can support my weight  farewell my fanny ew  letter xlvi miss weston to lady straffon my dear lady straffon i know not how to acquaint you with the additional misfortune that is fallen upon us all our dear lady woodville lies dangerously ill of a fever my heart almost breaks while i tell you that the physicians have but little hopes of her life during the first one and twenty days of her lords illness she never left his chamber nor could even be prevailed upon to rest herself except for a few minutes when quite exhausted on a couch  what surprised lady harriet and me most was that she never shed a tear till lord woodville first recovered his reason and spoke to her the servants who attended in his chamber have told me that while he remained insensible she used frequently to lay her check upon the pillow and kiss his poor parched lips as if she wished to catch the fever from him o madam why were you not here to save her precious life  lady harriet and i have been so much used to look up to her with respect as well as love and sure no human being ever deserved them more that we could not attempt to oppose her resolution farther than by fruitless entreaties though we knew it must be hurtful to herself lady lawson was unfortunately gone upon a visit into lincolnshire two days before my lord woodvilles accident she returned yesterday and is almost distracted at lady woodvilles illness but what is here is or any other persons grief to what my lord endures no words can describe his sorrow and i am convinced if she should die he never will recover  he insisted upon being taken out of bed this day and carried to her chamber doctor fenton finding him peremptory consented though reluctantly good god what a pale and emaciated figure lady woodville at first did not know him but when he spoke to her she started up clasped her arms round his neck and cried out with unnatural strength my dearest lord this this is kind she shall not part us now yes we will go together indeed i will not stay for any thing on earth no not for little harry  her spirits became quite exhausted at these words and she sunk down in a flood of tears we thought lord woodville would have expired on the instant he fainted and was carried back to his chamber in that situation this was the first time that lady woodville had mentioned her child since my lords illness  the doctor thinks it a good symptom and would have the little cherubim brought into her sight  but who can answer for the consequence if he should catch the fever from her at this moment she sleeps and lady lawson is determined to make the experiment as soon she awakes  god grant it may succeed  i hope my little cousin has got the better of her sad accident and that i shall not hear from but see you as soon as possible i send this by a special messenger and shall write every day till you come i am dear lady straffon  your afflicted and affectionate f weston  letter xlvii lady straffon to miss weston o fanny humbled in the dust by the almightys chastening hand i strive in vain to bow my heart to his allwise decrees and bless the arrow that inflicts the wound  how have i vainly vaunted my own fortitude and thought it proof against the severest trials perhaps it is to show me my own weakness that my loved sister and my child are doomed to suffer  i fear there is impiety in that thought gracious heaven look down on my distraction the first the tenderest object of my youthful fondness my emily my sister given to my care by a much honored and a dying parent  for her i felt a mothers tenderness a sisters love why were the ties thus doubly twined around my sad heart if they must thus be broken my daughter too child of my wedded love dear to me for her fathers sake as for my own  both both my emilys at once sure i may dare to say the infliction is severe  nothing can be more alarming than your account of my dear sisters situation i would fly to her this moment but that my poor little girl is also in a fever  my heart is torn to pieces for the two dear sufferers nor does lord woodville want his share of my compassion  i will still look up to the throne of mercy and hope for the recovery of these dear dear friends write to me fanny every hour if possible and o may your next bring comfort to  the truly afflicted f straffon  letter xlviii miss weston to lady straffon dear madam a ray of consolation beams upon us lady woodvilles fever is abated she raves no more the disorder seems now to have fallen upon her nerves and her extreme weakness is at present the principal source of our apprehensions for her when she awoke out of the slumber she was in during my last letter her recollection returned she knew lady lawson and every person near her but seemed particularly anxious to remember what she had said to her lord and expressed great uneasiness at doctor fentons having suffered him to run the hazard of leaving his chamber  lady lawson never quits her bedside and lady harriet who seems to have forgotten all her own distresses hardly ever leaves my lord  i am a sort of courier between both and by slattering each in my accounts of the other hope to forward both their recoveries my lord expresses the strongest impatience to see lady woodville doctor fenton will not consent to their meeting for some days nor even suffer my lords letters to be delivered to him i am called to receive a visitor  who can it be at this improper time  what a flutter am i in you would never guess who this guest was  sir james thornton but so altered as i never saw any creature i began to fear he was married though what is it to me if he were he has been poring his eyes out at geneva ever since he left us and looks as grave and as wise as an old professr of philosophy  do not be angry with me for trifling a little my dear lady straffon i confess i was very glad to see him and as lord and lady woodville have had each of them a tolerable night i think i may be allowed this small indulgence i have a presentiment too that my cousin emily is better  in short every thing seems to wear a more cheerful aspect than it did yesterday  poor thornton was so much affected at his friends illness that the tears stood in his eyes and he offered up an ejaculation for their recovery with almost as much devotion as your ladyship could though he is just come from a place where they say religion is not much in fashion but he is the best natured creature breathing and i am sure he prayed from his heart  he told me that a vexatious lawsuit had brought him to england and that he meant to have returned to geneva without seeing lord woodville or any of his friends but being informed of the situation of this family he had come from london on purpose to make the most minute enquiries  he begged i would not let lord or lady woodville know that he had been here said he would stay a couple of days at sir william lawsons in hopes of hearing they were out of danger then return to town to pursue his lawsuit and as soon as that was over he would go back to geneva  but i shall use my best crowquill to try to persuade him to visit woodfort once more before he crosses the sea again and if i succeed in that i may perhaps try a little farther  this is the last express that i shall send as i hope by next post to be able to give you a still more satisfactory account of our dear dear friends lady woodville is very anxious about her niece  i tell her i hope with truth that the sweet little emily is much better i entreat you to confirm my assertion in your next and to believe me  most affectionately yours f weston  letter xlix lady straffon to miss weston dear fanny the manner more than the matter of your last letter has been a cordial to my heart you could not surely write in such a cheerful strain if our dear lady woodville was in danger and yet your account is by no means satisfactory except where you say that her reason is returned and that she had a good night  your thoughts were diverted to another object and your letter is confused pray be more explicit in your next  i am very happy to be able to confirm your assertion in favor of my child  she is i thank god much better though still in a dangerous state as the bone of her leg knits slowly and she suffers much but though i may not be able to learn fortitude from her example i have at least acquired humanity from seeing that a natural mildness of disposition can better enable us to support the accidental miseries of this life than all our boasted reason and philosophy  i am ashamed of the intemperate lamentations i made use of in my last letter and i entreat you to burn it if you have not already done so  i shall continue to offer up my fervent prayers and wishes for the recovery of my dear sister and her lord and am dear fanny  sincerely yours f straffon  letter l miss weston to lady straffon upon my word my dear lady straffon if i had not very good news to send you and was not very good natured i do not think i should write to you  how you huff one for being glad to see an old acquaintance if i did not know that your ladyship is married i should have thought your last letter had been written by an old maid but i am so overjoyed at being able to tell you that lady woodville is infinitely better that i cannot keep up my resentment against you any longer  yes i am sincerely glad too that the little emily has verified my prediction and recovers daily  now do not expect me to be methodical for i will never be so no nor will i burn the letter you desire for i really do not think there is any thing in it that you need be ashamed of  our affections are not given us entirely for our amusement they were certainly designed to make us feel our mutual dependence upon each other and the total insufficiency of individuals to create their own happiness they are the links which form society and though by being stretched or broken they may give us pain i am certain that we could have no pleasure without them  i think i have got off of this subject very well considering that this is my first coup dessai in the moralizing strain  now for particulars  lady woodville sat up two hours this day  she looks weak and languid but is i really think more beautiful than ever  my lord wrote her a few lines which i had the honor of presenting to her she seemed transported with them but cruel as she is she did not let any body see them the doctor would not permit her answering them till tomorrow  if she sends her letter by me i shall be mightily tempted to peep  but i will not  for i should not like to be served so myself and i think that is the best way of determining all doubtful matters  i saw sir james thornton again last night  you see i mention him last that you may not say he has diverted my thoughts from more interesting subjects he persists in not having his visits announced to lord or lady woodville i have promised to keep his secret and write to him every post till they are quite recovered i shall begin my correspondence this night therefore  adieu my dear lady straffon f weston  letter li miss weston to lady straffon encore my dear lady straffon do not you really think me very good natured but this is now the house of joy and we poor things who have no character of our own camelion like catch the hue of our next neighbor  no letter from you by last post  but no matter i have a little familiar who tells me that emily is better  thank you good spirit for the pleasing news  and now let me tell you that lady woodville is so much recovered that doctor fenton is to leave us tomorrow  i think i shall be sorry when he goes he is a pure chatty man and i have some reason to imagine that he likes me vastly whenever i happen to be sick i will certainly send for him  well matrimony is a fine thing to be sure and it is very hard that i who am so well inclined to enter into that holy state cannot find an help mate meet for me though i have my doubts whether there be many such husbands as lord woodville i declare he appears to be infinitely more in love with his wife than he ever was such tender attention such unaffected fondness i never beheld  he is never out of her chamber but when he is obliged to leave her to her repose which seems now to be perfectly uninterrupted  sir james thornton is a better correspondent than your ladyship  i received a letter from him in answer to mine with some very pretty compliments interspersed through it upon my easy manner of writing traveling i find has improved him for i do not recollect that he ever said a civil thing to me before he went abroad better late than never is a good proverb poor lady harriet her spirits are very low though she has behaved surprizingly well on barnards death but i fear her calmness on that occasion was owing to the alarming situation of lord and lady woodville and that her grief will return with their health i wish she would think of marrying a good husband would make her forget barnard dear good thornton another letter from him and more flattery quelle douceur quel charm adieu my dear lady straffon i must indulge my vanity this very moment by showing his epistle to lord and lady woodville yours ever  f weston  letter lii lady straffon to miss weston thank you my good fanny for your two lively letters  they have been of infinite use to my poor weak spirits and though i may not be able to compliment as agreeably as sir james thornton i will venture to say that i am as well pleased as he with the ease and cheerfulness of your writing i hope my heart is truly grateful to the almighty for the recovery of my dear sister and her lord as well as for the restoration of my little emily whom we now think past danger  you say very justly that our affections were not given us for amusement no fanny they were meant to humble the proud heart to show us our own weakness and fallibility by our frequently bestowing them on unworthy or improper objects and even when directed by nature and reason into their right course to all the tender charities of life they should remind us of our entire dependence on the great author of our being by making us sensible that the most delightful attachments which can be formed by love or friendship serve but to enlarge our vulnerary part and increase our capacity of feeling pain  you perhaps may think this moral too severe but it is not meant to restrain us from the indulgence of those fond sensations which are natural to every good heart but to raise our gratitude to the great giver of all our blessings and to remind us that we hold them by grant from his bounty and not from any right or merit of our own  as my emily gains strength every day we purpose going into essex in a short time and as soon as sir john can settle some necessary affairs there we shall all set out for bristol in hopes of meeting lord and lady woodville there  what a joyful meeting will it be to me my eyes run over at the delightful idea  though lady mount willis took every precaution to conceal her generosity to sir james miller from himself the unhappy man has discovered that he is indebted to her for his subsistence and has written her a most affecting letter acknowledging his own unworthiness and entreating her to withdraw her bounty as he declares he could better support the most abject poverty than the receiving of favors from one whom he had so highly injured and offended there is something in this sentiment that inclines me to forgive even his former baseness and to pity his present misery sure there can be nothing so truly humiliating as receiving obligations from those we have wronged  i sincerely wish that your epistolary correspondence with sir james thornton may answer all your expectation  but remember fanny that flattery costs men nothing and that women are apt to overrate it and frequently bestow their love and esteem in exchange for what has no aintrinsic worth i grant that in the general commerce of the world the person whose politeness and attention are most marked to us deservedly obtains a preference in our regard vanity is in some degree inherent to all human kind and the being rated above our fellows is a species of flattery which the most delicate creature in the world is never offended at but in a particular intercourse between man and woman we should take great care that our own selflove does not impose upon us and magnify the common forms or expressions of politeness into a particular address  do not be angry at this hint fanny as it is only meant to save your vanity for i hope your heart is not yet concerned from the mortification of a disappointment  tell my dear lady woodville that i most impatiently long for a line from her and that i mutually congratulate her lord and her on their recovery i am dear fanny yours sincerely  f straffon  letter liii lady woodville to lady straffon where fanny shall i find words to express my gratitude to the almighty for the blessings i have received from him the smallest of which is my own recovery from the grave words are inadequate to what i feel but he can read my heart life is a common blessing given to all and sure there was a time now long past when i would most willingly have yielded mine into his hands that gave it  but happiness my sister such bliss as mine is but the lot of few o how shall i deserve it teach me fanny teach me every honest art to keep the treasure i have so lately found  lord woodvilles heart  how little alas are we capable of judging for ourselves my lords late illness which i considered as the severest infliction of providence has been the blessed means of my present and i hope future happiness his generous nature struck with the sufferings i endured by one rich gift has overpaid them all  but i must dare not enter into the charming detail of my felicity  my spirits will not bear it but you shall know it all for the present let it suffice to tell you i have not now a wish ungratified but that of being able to render myself worthy of the happiness i enjoy  my lord lady harriet who is a mirror of resignation and fanny weston all join with me in sincere congratulations to you and sir john on emilys recovery how truly thankful ought i to be for the dear childs preservation for indeed i could not have been happy had you been otherwise  adieu my fanny i am as ever yours e woodville  letter live miss weston to lady straffon inclosed in the foregoing i hope your ladyship will believe me perfectly sincere when i tell you that i rejoice at lady woodvilles being able to release me from the office of her secretary by answering for herself for though i am highly sensible of the great honor which your ladyship confers on such a madcap as me by condescending to write to me i must beg leave to observe que la rose a sa picque  for indeed your ladyships kind and friendly admonitions upon the subject of sir james thorntons politeness and my vanity are rather humiliating but in order to make your mind as well as my own easy upon this subject i will venture to assure you that i shall require stronger proofs of sir james thorntons regard than a little flimsy flattery before i suffer my self love to persuade me that the baronet is enamoured of your ladyships most humble servant  f weston ps pray my dear lady straffon do not fancy i am in a huff for i never was in greater harmony of spirits than at present having this moment received a letter from sir james thornton in answer to an invitation which lord and lady woodville commissioned me to make and which he will accept in a few days it is lucky that flattery costs men nothing for the poor dear baronet would certainly be a bankrupt if he were to purchase all that he bestows upon  your ever affectionate f w    letter lv lady straffon to lady woodville like the rich gales from the arabian coast my emilys last letter came fraught with health and joy  what an high cordial must it have been to a fond sisters heart who long has mourned without affecting to perceive those secret sorrows which she could not heal to hear that they at length have vanished  i know not which of us is at present happiest but were the charming contest to be determined by the merit of the competitors the precious palm would be adjudged to you long may my emily enjoy the triumph she so well deserves  i will not cannot wait for a detail of your felicity i will behold and share it  it is possible to be circumstantial under the severest affliction but happiness is by much too volatile for narrative  like a fine and subtle essence it evaporates through the activity of its own spirit we cannot paint the expressive looks which are lighted up by a glad heart the eye alone can catch the brilliant beam which brightens by reflection  therefore expect to meet mine in less than four and twenty hours after you receive this sir john and my girl will accompany me  i have had a very pleasing letter from lady somerville  lodovico laura and she arrived safe at genoa her friends received them all with open heart and arms  the young people have been entirely taken up with feasts b and masquerades to avoid giving offense by refusing to partake in these amusements lady somerville has retired to the very house which she quitted upon her marriage which is twenty leagues from genoa  she there continues to indulge that melancholy which time has been only able to soften not subdue  amiable relict  tell fanny weston that the present harmony of my spirits prevents my answering her letter as i ought but she must not flatter herself that i do not mean to take any further notice of it for the moment i become acquainted with sir james thornton i will insist upon his devising a proper punishment for her pertness and he shall be at once the judge and the executioner  adieu my dear emily i quit you with pleasure at this moment to hasten to that of our meeting  letter lvi lord woodville to lord seymour the apprehensions which my dear seymour expresses on account of my silence have been but too well founded  i have been upon the verge of that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns but how do i now rejoice at not having passed the irremeable bounds in a state of insensibility to the virtues of my now truly dear and i hope happy wife she is an angel seymour  i know what true delight these words will give you they are sincere my friend  they flow from my full heart blinded as i have been to her perfections you will surely pardon the transports of a man who waking from a dream of misery finds himself in elysium  such is my present state what was my former one you and you only know too well  you are doubtless impatient to hear what has brought this happy change with pleasure will i dwell on every circumstance that must endear my emily to my heart and render her still more amiable to my friends eyes  it is now above two months since i received your first account of ransfords duel and the marchionesss distress no words can paint the strong emotions of my mind  a thousand various schemes to succor her rushed instantly through my disturbed imagination my wife was present while i read your letter and saw the agitation of my mind her delicacy prompted her to retire i prevented her and told her i know not how of barnards death and begged her to inform lady harriet of it in the tenderest manner  needless caution  i then told her i would go and acquaint sir harry ransford with the affair and ordered my horses to be got ready immediately  i set out directly on that purpose  but before i had rode a quarter of a mile a sudden impulse seized me a certain foreign and irresistible force that impelled me to fly to the instant relief of the marchioness  the baseness and madness of such a resolve sprang forward to my view at the same moment but the passions triumphed as they always must do at the first onset over the feebler reason  i considered that ransford might probably call me to account for interfering in his affairs and felt a gloomy satisfaction in thinking that the loss of life might be deemed an atonement for the cruelty of my conduct toward emily  i then traversed the road in order to return home through my park and got into my closet unperceived by my family  i there took out the marchionesss picture and hung it round my neck as a kind of talisman against that remorse which i must certainly feel for abandoning my wife i then sat down and wrote a letter to my emily and though at that time under the influence of the strongest delirium i am pleased and proud to own that my tears flowed faster than my ink while i reflected on the pain which she must suffer when sheread those lines  i resolved to travel night and day and not put my letter in the post office till i came to canterbury  as i was stepping out of my library which you know looks into the parterre i saw my little boy at play close by the window with his maid  the sight of my son startled me  the order of nature seemed reversed  the child admonishing the parent i felt all this but felt myself at the same time like one in a dream laboring under an impression of the imagination without reason to correct or free will to control it i could not pass into the park without being seen by them  the private manner of my return would have alarmed the family i was ashamed to be detected by my servant and spent above an hour which appeared a summers day to me in a state of the most restless impatience i have since thought that this little accident seemed as if kindly designed by providence to give me time for reflection but alas the delay quickened the vehemence of my purpose to pursue my scheme  the moment i was at liberty i flew back to the park bid my servants follow me and set off with all the speed my horse could make  but i had not got three miles from my demesne when by some fortunate accident my horse made a false step which he was incapable of recovering and threw me senseless to the ground  how long i continued there or what passed during an interval of one and twenty days has left no trace upon my memory at the end of that period i awaked as from unquiet rest  gracious heaven how shall i ever be able to express my astonishment at beholding lady woodville seated by my bedside the statue of despair pale wan and faded was her youthful cheek her eyes were raised to heaven as if in servent though in hopeless prayer o seymour what a train of horrid images broke in at once upon my burning brain my unsettled reason fluttered on the wing and seemed as if it would depart again for ever  the striking object that appeared before me impressed my senses with a kind of awe yet i had power to speak to her she could not answer  a flood of tears but they were tears of joy suppressed the power of speech she was carried out of the room by doctor fentons orders and i then feigned a slumber in hopes that recollection would afford some clue to lead me through the labyrinth of my situation  the first circumstance that presented itself to my memory was my having quitted woodfort with a design of abandoning that amiable creature whom i now beheld reduced to the state i have already described by her tenderness for me  the next thing that occurred to me was my having had the marchionesss picture round my neck which i now searched for in vain  i instantly ordered every person to leave the room except williams and demanded from him an account of my present situation and what was become of the picture which i had placed next my heart i could have no doubt of his faith or sincerity  he has lived with me ever since i was a child and loved me as if i had been his  he fell upon his knees by my bedside and begged me not to hurry or exhaust my spirits which he was sure must be extremely weak as this was the first moment the fever had left me for one and twenty days during which time he told me lady woodville had never quitted my apartment for a single hour nor closed her lovely eyes  that on the night i was brought home the surgeon had me stripped in order to know if i had received any wound or bruise in my body that he had taken off the picture and given it to my wife supposing it to be hers and at that time she took no notice of it but that he had often since seen her gaze upon it most intently and sigh as if her heart would break  he said that thomas had also brought her the papers which were found in my pockets and she gave them all to him to lock up but that mrs winter her woman who was present told her ladyship there was a letter sealed and directed for her which she took and left the room  that she returned in a few minutes as pale as death but never disclosed the contents though mrs winter took as much pains as she dared to find them out as she could not conceive what i could have to say to lady woodville when i had but just left her  he told me seymour that emily has knelt by my bedside for hours in speechless agony has kissed my feverish lips and bathed my burning hands with her most precious tears and yet she knew i had inhumanly determined to forsake her to leave such worth as hers a prey to pining grief and discontent for whom  you have too justly named her the most unworthy of her sex  you may suppose that during williamss recital my reason tottered in its feeble seat but i had still enough left to rouse my slumbering virtue and to resolve that if i should recover my future life should be devoted to love to gratitude to emily this bear me witness heaven i had determined before i knew or even thought it possible i ever should despise the marchioness  as soon as i heard all that williams had to say i begged to see my wife doctor fenton absolutely refused my request i acquiesced upon his telling me she had lain down to rest  the next day i repeated my entreaties without success  on the third i became so impatient that williams thought it most prudent to let me know the sad truth which was that lady woodville lay dangerously ill of the fever she had caught from me  i was no longer sensible of my own weak state  the tumult of my passions gave me a momentary strength  i rushed out of bed upon the instant never seymour did i experience such another all lady woodvilles merits which i had before but coldly admired appeared to me now in the warmest colors and rose even to perfection but when contrasted with my ingratitude toward her they overcame me  i sunk into my servants arms and shed a flood of tears  in spite of all opposition i would be carried into my wifes apartment  i had resolved to implore her pity and forgiveness of my past follies and to assure her of my future conduct which i could no longer entertain a doubt of as the sincere and tender affection i then felt for her would i hoped ensure her happiness and that i should date mine from her recovery  think of my situation seymour when i approached her bedside  she was delirious yet the dear angel knew me though she raved and in such terms that her words struck daggers to my heart  my strength forsook me i fainted and was carried back to my own chamber the unhappiest wretch that breathed upon the earth  in pity to you i will draw a veil over the wild ravings of my tortured mind and make you happy by telling you that i am truly so by knowing that my dearest emily is out of danger  this letter has been the work of two days tomorrow i am to see my wife  i count the moments seymour and think them hours till then  i have heard that persons who have been once mad never recover the perfect use of their reason or at least are liable to some returns of insanity this thought shocks me for if i could suppose it possible i should ever again sink into that shameful that now detested delirium which so long possessed me i would not wish to live another hour  but it it impossible  my emilys virtues have subdued my heart and time instead off lessening must increase their power  it is high time that i should condole with you on the sufferings you have endured from your generous friendship toward the marchioness the meanness of her behavior to you makes me rejoice in the hope of her not being ransfords wife  yet contemptible as her conduct has made her appear even in my once partial eyes she must not know distress i mean with regard to her circumstances and while sir harry ransford lives it will not be in his sons power to support her in the rank which she has held for some years past  let me therefore entreat you to inform me of the event of her lawsuit with the marquis of st aumont  be not alarmed at this request seymour it is not passion but compassion that makes me wish to serve her for i here solemnly declare that if i were not certain of having entirely conquered the phrensy which had so long possessed my enfeebled reason i have still virtue enough left to restrain myself from ever mentioning her name but the real luster of my emilys virtues have triumphed over the false glare of isabellas charms that fatal ignis fatuus which so long dazzled and misled my benighted senses  i sincerely rejoice in your fair vestals recovery  may she live to make you happy as your uncommon situation will admit  i am truly concerned for ransford and earnestly wish to know what course he has pursued  i think with you that he is now in switzerland and suppose he has written to you before this time what is become of lady ransford but i forget that you were prevented from seeing her before you left paris  adieu my friend  let me once more congratulate you upon my emilys recovery and my own restoration to more than life  i am most truly yours woodville  letter lvii lord woodville to lord seymour the wished for the charming interview is over but where seymour shall i find words to express the delicacy of my emilys conduct when i would have fallen at her feet and implored her to forgive my having made her miserable she caught me in her arms with that modest sensibility which accompanies her every action and said that all the misery she had ever suffered arose from considering herself as the fatal though innocent cause of my unhappiness  that she should ever be truly grateful for the pains i had taken to prevent her being wretched by endeavoring to conceal a passion which she was sure it was as impossible for me to conquer as it had been to disguise  that she had long known of my attachment to the marchioness and that her utmost wish for many months past was to be considered as my first friend that she should never make an improper use of my confidence but that her utmost tenderness should be exerted to sooth the sorrows which she could not heal  a flood of tears opposed her farther utterance  i took that opportunity of assuring her that it was in her power and hers alone to render me the happiest of men  she wiped away her tears and gazed on me with looks of joy and doubt let not your kindness said she tempt you to deceive me i feel too well the impossibility of conquering a fond a real passion but i will strive my lord  i caught her trembling hand and pressed it to my lips o no i cried my emily my love indulge your virtuous fondness and deeply as my heart appears to be indebted to you like a poor bankrupt it shall give its all though it can never pay you what it owes  she quickly exclaimed o i am overpaid in this blessed moment for years of misery your heart but can you give it is it yours my lord  no emily unworthy as it is it is already yours and shall be ever so  tears and embraces closed this charming scene and now with truth my seymour can i boast i never knew what heartfelt rapture was before that hour  the conferring happiness on any creature is certainly the highest enjoyment of any human mind but the paying it to an amiable and deserving object must heighten the sentiment even to transport  sir james thornton has been obliged to return to england on account of a lawsuit he purposed keeping himself concealed but upon hearing of mine or rather my emilys illness he posted down from london to sir william lawsons and remained there till she was pronounced out of danger since that time he had frequent accounts of our recovery from fanny weston with whom he corresponds in a very gallant style  i know she likes the young baronet and as i flatter myself he is cured of his hopeless passion for lady woodville or at least am well assured that he will never presume to pursue it i have prevailed upon my wife to consent to his making us a visit but neither his being at woodfort or any thing else shall prevent our going to bristol in a few days for though my lovely invalid is surprizingly recovered from her late illness the shock which her constitution has received has rendered it almost as delicate as her charming mind i will watch over them both and hope to restore them to their natural state which is almost perfection  i have shown emily all your letters and told her the story of my connection with the marchioness without concealing a single circumstance which passed either at paris or york during my narrative i often did beguile her of her tears they flowed sincerely when i informed her of the struggles of my then tortured mind  i well knew that the confession of my past weakness must give her pain but i was certain she would receive it as the strongest mark of my present sincerity the tenderness and delicacy of her expressions upon this trying subject have if possible raised her in my esteem by convincing me that her understanding is as excellent as her heart and that her mind and person constitute a treasure almost too great for the most worthy man sensible as i am of my own demerits can i ever be sufficiently grateful for such a blessing but i will endeavor to deserve it seymour by devoting every hour of my future life to her happiness  since the recovery of my reason i have received infinite pleasure from playing with my little boy how could i be insensible to the natural and innocent endearments of such a lovely creature but i find happiness and pleasure crouding in upon me through a thousand avenues that my delirium had rendered impervious to their soft attacks and i begin to think that i have been newformed as well as reformed since my redemption  lady woodville who is sincerely grateful for your kind attachment to her entreats you will at your return to paris endeavor to find out sir james miller and purchase for him either a commission employment or annuity which may be sufficient for his support as the unhappy man has absolutely refused to accept lady mount williss bounty from the moment he discovered that it was to her he owed it there is something like greatness of mind in this circumstance which renders him an interesting object what mixtures are we compounded of you may guess your paymistress incog  i impatiently long for the pleasure of hearing from you and am with the warmest affection of friendship  ever yours woodville  letter lviii lord seymour to lord woodville my dear woodville this letter will probably reach england but a few days before the writer of it but i would not for a moment delay pouring forth my acknowledgments for the sincere pleasure i have received from your two last letters and my warmest congratulations on the charming subject of them  yes thank heaven my friend is restored to life to reason and to happiness can seymour sigh while he repeats that sound o woodville my cup has been severely dashed with sorrow nor has there  yet one joy unmixed ever reached my heart yet let me not complain my own imprudence formed the fatal web that has ensnared my peace the unhappy duel that i fought with captain beaumont sealed its ruin  but why should i distress you by tracing my misfortunes to their source it is too much for you to know that i am wretched  no matter for what cause  the length of time that has elapsed since my last letter to you has been fertile of sad events which i shall relate to you in as succinct a manner as i can  when i had been about a week at belleveue the good old general was attacked with a disorder in his stomach which had most alarming symptoms he was sensible of his situation but seemed to wish to conceal it from his children who vied with each other in their tenderness and affliction for him it is impossible to do justice to their merits or describe the affecting scene  at the end of twelve days he expiried and left the most disconsolate family i ever beheld but charlottes grief surpassed even credibility neither her brother sister nor i could prevail upon her to leave the chamber where the body lay till the moment it was to be ierred she passed the nights and days in prayers and ars  judge what i suffered from my apprehensions for her  as soon as the funeral was over she requested that we would indulge her with the liberty of passing a few days without interruption in her chamber we had no right to trespass on her grief but yet our fears for her too delicate constitution made us reluctantly comply with her desire  on the fourth evening of her retirement she sent for madame de carignan who flew to obey her summons but returning in a few minutes to captain beaumont and me with an air of distraction cried out our miseries are but begun o hasten quickly or her angelic spirit will be fled and can i paint the sad the solemn scene no woodville no it will live forever graved upon my heart  but words would wrong my feelings  charlotte my once beloved my now adored and sainted maid sighed out her soul to heaven  grief will not kill us woodville or i should not survive to tell her death  i can no more  adieu my friend seymour  letter lix lord seymour to lord woodville my dear woodville it was impossible for me to have added another word to my last letter i have but a very few more to say with regard to the beaumont family and then the dear the fatal name shall no more pass my lips but remain treasured up in my sad heart a precious hoard for everlasting grief to brood upon  i told you in some of my former letters that captain beaumont visited me every day during my confinement in the chatelet he there beheld and became enamoured of the fair maria dangueville when he had been about ten days at belleveue he acquainted me with his passion and entreated me to speak to his father upon the subject accident prevented my having an opportunity of obeying him till the generals illness rendered it improper  and the real affliction which he has since felt seemed to have quenched the new enkindled flame  but a few days after our return to paris he again reassumed the subject and begged me to apply to his fair cousin and his uncle for leave to pay his addresses to her i told him truly that the situation of my mind rendered me totally unfit to be the ambassador of love or joy but that i was determined before i should leave the chatelet to return thanks for the humane and generous treatment i had met with from the governor and his famy and to entreat marias acceptance of the legacy which her uncle the general had bequeathed me of twenty thousand livres  i thought that captain beaumont appeared displeased at my intention as he coolly replied that he did not want a fortune with his wife and thought i had better bestow the legacy i did not choose to accept upon some of the younger children of the family who might possibly stand in need of my bounty i told him that marias likeness to his beloved sister had made her the principal object of my present attention and that i would put it in her power to dispose of the sum in question as she thought proper  soon after this conversation the captain withdrew and remained for several days so entirely absorbed in grief that i reflected not upon the unkindness of my friends conduct who neither came nor sent to me for near a fortnight  at length he entered my chamber one morning without being announced and found me gazing so intently upon charlottes picture that i saw him not till he exclaimed with a voice of distraction what unmerited affliction and distress has the unhappy seymour brought on all the beaumont race  though the severity of this reproach might have rouzed my resentment at another time i was so much softened by the object then before me my angel charlottes face that bursting into tears i answered  o beaumont cannot grief like this atone for my involuntary crimes and does my friend upbraid my misery  at these words he rushed into my arms and cried forgive me seymour then started wildly from me and went on  but wherefore flow these tears upon a senseless object lost and forgotten in the grave when there is now a fairer and kinder maid ready to heal your sorrows  i could not avoid expressing my astonishment at this unintelligible discourse and it was a long time before he explained himself by telling me that the lovely and innocent dangueville had conceived a passion for me during the time i remained a prisoner in the chatelet and that upon being pressed by her father and mother to receive her cousins hand she had declared that she would rather pass her days in a cloister than with any other man but lord seymour i was extremely affected with this intelligence as it concerned my friend the unhappy girl and my own honor  i assured captain beaumont that i never had spoken to her upon the subject of love or made the least attempt to gain her affections and that i was ready to do every thing in my power to assist in conquering marias weak partiality to me that might not injure her delicacy or my own character  the frankness and sincerity of my manner soon got the better of his illgrounded suspicions he asked my pardon a thousand times for having entertained a doubt of my affection to his dear dead sister but hoped as i had been myself a lover i would forgive his rashness  it was at last agreed upon between us that i should write to maria directly and acquaint her with the real state of my heart which must be for ever incapable of love for any earthly object that i should not see her before i left paris and at my setting out should take an everlasting leave of her by letter that neither her father nor any other person should press her to marry till time and reason might enable her to triumph over a passion which opposition would certainly increase that captain beaumont would continue his assiduities without mentioning his love  that she should not know of the present i designed her till a year was elapsed but if at that time she refused to marry captain beaumont i should be at liberty to put her in possession of the twenty thousand livres and that she should be allowed to dispose of them as she pleased  this affair thus settled my friend took his leave with a thousand acknowledgments for what he called a sacrifice and i sat down to fulfill my promise of writing to maria  when wilson announced a very unexpected visitor it was madame de st far the marchionesss mother whom i had never seen or heard of since the time that you first became acquainted with her daughter  she was then you may recollect an agreeable figure rather comely than handsome and plumper than the generality of her country women she is now emaciated to a skeleton and i could not help feeling some apprehensions that she would expire before she left my apartment as she was frequently much agitated during the time she staid  she told me that her daughter had suffered her to want even the common necessaries of life and had absolutely refused to see her from the moment she became a widow though i detest the marchioness i could not avoid observing to madame de st far that i imagined the first part of her accusation must be unjust as she had formerly appeared in the world as a woman of fortune and therefore must certainly be able to support herself independent of her daughters bounty  she told me i was much deceived and as she had no longer any terms to keep with the ungrateful marchioness she would reveal her real situation  she then informed me that she had lived for several years with a monsieur de verville at dijon by whom she had isabella that at length by the persuasion of his friends monsieur de verville determined to marry and parted with her and her daughter but allowed them a decent support and took every proper care of his childs education  that as she grew up extremely handsome madame de st far determined to bring her to paris in hopes of making her fortune and for that purpose assumed the name she now used and endeavored to appear like a person of distinction that the marchioness was perfectly acquainted with their circumstances and readily entered into the scheme but in order to carry it on she was obliged to run considerably in debt though they were not above six months in paris before the marchioness had the good fortune to charm both you and the marquis de st aumont  she added that the only reason her daughter ever gave for preferring the marquis to you was the probability of becoming her own mistress by his death for that she knew her own disposition so perfectly that she was certain she could not confine her affections to any one person long  o woodville what an happy escape have you had from this vile woman but to make an end of this tedious tale she told me that monsieur de verville died without a will soon after the marchionesss marriage and that she was by that means deprived even of the small income which he had allowed her she implored me to assist her in getting into some convent where she might pass the remainder of her days without hearing of her undutiful and unnatural daughter i have desired her to fix upon a proper place for her retirement and i will readily pay the sum necessary to her admission i presented her with my purse and desired to hear from her as soon as possible  this affair and lady woodvilles commands to find out sir james miller will detain me a few days longer in paris how earnestly do i long to quit it yet are not all places alike to the unhappy no there is one asylum and but one for wretchedness like mine  the peaceful grave  forgive me woodville for talking in this melancholy strain to my now happy friend  may you be long so is the warmest wish of  seymour ps i know not whether i have told you that i have fought lady ransford in vain ever since my return to paris she quitted her hotel in a few days after barnards death and has left no trace behind her    letter lx lord woodville to lord seymour my dear seymour your remark that neither happiness nor pleasure comes to us unmixed is but too aptly verified in me for the real and tender concern which your situation gives me is a strong alloy to that tranquil happiness i should at present enjoy if the friend of my heart were not wretched  there is something so uncommonly distressful in your circumstances that to attempt to lessen your affliction would be an insult to humanity  for who that has a heart to feel anothers loss would wish to stop the graceful tears that flow where reason and where virtue over the tomb are fellow mourners  i am sorry for captain beaumonts disappointment in love but i have infinitely more pity for the young and innocent maria you and i both know how difficult it is to struggle with the first fond impressions of the heart and women in general from a principle of delicacy are much more inclined than men to cherish their first passion even when hope is fled  i have a melancholy proof of this truth too near me  poor lady harriet hanbury she still laments the unworthy barnard and i fear will soon follow him to an untimely grave  while sir james thornton seems to have transferred the passion he felt for lady woodville to miss weston who kindly receives his vows and will i hope soon crown his wishes  i cannot help being extremely shocked at the infamous conduct of the marchioness toward her mother  why need we become volunteers in vice our passions but too strongly and frequently impel us to break the bounds prescribed by virtue but then those passions may i humbly hope in some degree alleviate our transgressions but her unnatural behavior to the unhappy woman who gave her birth admits of no extenuation this could not have proceeded from any passion and must therefore be a double vice  i am however much better pleased to owe my cure to emilys virtues than to isabellas vices as the knowledge of the former are a perpetual source of happiness to me while the discovery of the latter must for ever reflect on my own weakness in being so grossly deceived  madame de st fars establishment in the convent must not be at your expense my emily my lovely generous girl insists on paying her pension she must not be refused whatever she desires by woodville or his friend  i most impatiently long for your return to england i wish you would meet us at bristol where we purpose going in a few days for though my emily is so much recovered that neither her physician nor herself think she has occasion to drink the waters i will not be satisfied unless she does as i flatter myself they may assist in confirming that health which her present happiness seems to have perfectly restored  sir john lady straffon and their daughter are now at woodfort they and my sister lawson are to accompany us to the hotwells lady mount willis has lain in at her house in somersetshire  we are to pay her a visit en passant  she has got a son and is as happy as she is amiable we are all anxious to know what is become of ransford of his stepmother and sir james miller but i am much more so to embrace my ever valued friend and if i cannot heal to sooth his sorrows  may that at least be in the power of seymours most affectionate  woodville  letter lxi lord seymour to lord woodville yes woodville i will take your counsel and hasten to lay hold on the possession of the only good that is now left me your generous friendship i will meet you at the hotwells in a short time but i will not live in the same house with you nor return from thence to woodfort i know the value of your regards too well to suffer it to be productive of misery to you or your deservedly happy wife  no seymours sorrows shall not cast a shade on the bright sunshine of your future days nor subject you to the unavailing pain of endeavoring to erase the dark engrained tints of melancholy which must form the color of my life to come yet i will frequently behold my friend and with sincere delight contemplate his felicity  i have at last had a letter from ransford sure there is a fascination in the marchionesss charms he raves and is distracted at her having disowned him as a husband which she has formally done by her solicitor in order to recover the remainder of those effects which were confiscated on account of his duel with captain barnard she carried her point they were restored to the marchioness de st aumont but her creditors have seized on every thing she left her husbands nephew has carried his suit against her but has allowed her an annuity of four thousand livres while she remains unmarried in respect to his uncles memory  i think this income is quite sufficient for her wants and infinitely beyond her merits i therefore entreat you to reserve your generosity for some more worthy object  the now happy st far is settled in a convent at dijon where she proposes leading an exemplary life lady woodvilles expense for she must be obeyed will not amount to more than forty pounds a year  about ten days ago a monk came to my apartments and desired to speak with me he told me there was a lady in the carmelites convent who begged to see me upon an affair of the utmost importance to one of my friends i enquired very particularly who the lady was he said he knew nothing more of her than that she was an englishwoman and was called jefferson he added that at her request he had been often to seek for me while i was absent from paris that he had given up all hopes of meeting me but rejoiced at his being more fortunate than he expected and entreated me to obey the ladys summons  this affair would have been matter of speculation to me if my mind had been sufficiently at ease to think about it but without reflecting at all upon the subject i entered the carmelites convent at ten oclock the next morning and enquired for mrs jefferson  i did not wait long in the parlour when a lady dressed in deep mourning approached the grate i fixed my eyes intently upon her and knew her to be lady ransford  a crimson glow overspread her cheek when she saluted me and at that moment she appeared a most interesting object  to save her the trouble of apologizing for sending for me i told her how much i had been disappointed at not being able to discover her retreat at my return to paris and i begged to know if i could be any way serviceable to her and at the same time entreated she would inform me of every thing she knew in relation to the unhappy affair between captain barnard and my friend  her tears flowed fast and silent while i spoke  when she perceived that i waited for her reply she took out her pocket book and presenting it to me said your lordship will there find two letters which will render any conversation with me upon this painful subject needless  i commit them to your care in order that every possible use may be made of them for mr ransfords advantage i bear no enmity to his father nor do i wish to make him an exile from that country to which i never more will return  i asked her with as much delicacy as i possibly could what scene of life she intended to pursue and again repeated the offer of my service to her she thanked me and said that captain barnards death had made her think differently from what she had ever done before that she was too conscious of the enormity of her conduct to think of returning into the world that she therefore determined to pass her days in a convent but would always have it in her power to quit it as she did not mean to make any vows  i really admired the rationality of her sentiments and of course approved them but was ignorant by what means she could be supported even in a convent till she assured me that at her marriage to sir harry ransford he had signed an article allowing her in case of separation a power of three thousand pounds or an annuity of a hundred and fifty pounds a year during his life and a jointure of four hundred pounds a year at his death she said the annuity would be sufficient for her maintenance that she desired no favor from a person she was supposed to have injured though the fatal connection between sir harry and her had been the source of all her miseries  she begged me to forward barnards letter to ransford and to send copies of it to the captains friends in england in order to pave the way for ransfords return i promised to obey her and took my leave as i now must of you in order to hasten my setting out  you will probably hear from me once more before you see your unhappy but  truly affectionate seymour  letter lxii lord seymour to lord woodville amiens i have at length taken an everlasting leave of paris and have got so far on my way to my native land but without being sensible of that charming enthusiasm which is styled the amor patriae and which i believe has been oftener described than felt by voluntary exiles for i confess that i have very little idea of local attachments persons and not places have engrossed all the affections of which my heart is capable and though the sight of albions chalky cliffs may not inspire me with much delight i shall certainly feel true pleasure when i behold my dear woodville and his amiable wife  i should not stop on my journey to tell you this because i am sure you must know it untold but my worthy my faithful wilson whom i have long considered as my friend though he still acts as my servant left paris with a slight fever on him traveling has perhaps increased his malady and i purpose halting here till he is quite recovered  i gave you an account of my interview with lady ransford in my last and will now inform you of the purport of those letters which were found in captain barnards pocket after the duel that which was addressed to her ladyship was filled with tender adieus and soft contrition for having involved her in distress and leaving her probably exposed to misery in a foreign land with the most solemn entreaties not to prosecute mr ransford in case he should survive as he there acknowledged that he had drawn the duel on himself  that which he wrote to ransford was short yet contained the fullest declaration of his having fought the quarrel and its consequences from a weariness of life which he said must be for ever embittered by reflecting on the baseness of his behavior toward lady harriet hanbury as well as on the unworthy part he had acted in seducing lady ransford from her duty he implored his forgiveness for the injury he committed against the honor of his family and for having engaged him to hazard his life from a too earnest desire of getting rid of his own  how inconsistent is the conduct of this unfortunate man his attention to the preservation of his antagonists life is certainly noble but what an act of inhumanity was it to lay ransford under the fatal necessity of becoming his executioner or how are we to reconcile the spirit of this last action with the unworthy teor of his former life  i am convinced there is no human creature so entirely lost to virtue as not to be possessed of one good quality at least which if known and properly cultivated might in some measure counterbalance its owners vices to society but we are all too apt to reprobate a faulty character too indolent to search out the latent virtues of anothers heart and find it more for our ease to take it for granted that a vicious person must be vicious throughout than to seek for a grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff  after many fruitless inquiries i am informed that sir james miller has obtained a commission in the hungarian service by some of his friends here and that he left paris about three weeks ago in order to join his regiment rans at brussels but the marchioness and he do live together i have forwarded barnards ter to him and flatter myself we shall soon  him in england  my parting with the dear remains of the beaumont family was truly affecting madam de carignon came to paris on purpose to bid me adieu captain beaumont presented me with his and his fathers pictures he had before given me charlottes portrait  alas it was an useless gift as her dear image is too strongly graved on my sad heart  i will not dwell upon this subject longer but it is impossible that i should turn my thoughts to any other now  i can therefore only say  farewell seymour  finis
