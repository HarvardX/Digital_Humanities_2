advertisement from daniel de foe to mr clark it was my fixed resolution never to foul any paper or take up any bodies time to read or my own to write any thing about the quarrel mr clark would fain make with me but i am oblidged to speak to it which shall be very short mr clark who denis a passage relating to himself in the history of the union would fain rail and huss me into a recantation of the passage in public and since he desires it he shall have all i can possibly make  i had once the honor to meet a gentleman of worth and a friend of mr clarks upon this affair to whom mr clark present i said and to mr clark i said at the same time that i would write to my friends at glasgow from whom i had my information and if they would not stand to it justify own and upon occasion prove what they had reported of mr clark i would give him any reasonable satisfaction but if they would he could not expect i would recant what i had clear evidence of  now being very desirous of giving all men satisfaction that have any objection to make against me i accordingly have written to my friends at glasgow and no doubt should readily have complied with mr clark but to my great misfortune they unamiously write me word that what i have written in my history is all true and they are ready to give ample testimony of it in my vindication when ever i please and have sent me the name of five gentlemen of that city each of them of equal reputation character and credit as mr clark himself no reflection i hope upon mr clark who they say particularly remember the very words  what to do in this case i cannot tell and would be glad mr clark would advise me i have a very great respect nay a veneration and indeed the utmost regard to the office of a minister of the gospel and i believe i have shown it upon several occasions but i cannot persuade my self to oppose mr clarks single negative to five clear affirmatives besides what if one or more of the five should be ministers too will mr clark advise me to take his word and condemn theirs when truth is brought into such a straight i cannot but think i am oblidged to go by the number and reputation of the witnesses and there i leave it if mr clark has a mind to push it any further for he talked much of going to law with me my answer is brief the law is open and though i am a great way off yet if he will inform me what way he would have me proceed i will oblidge him as much as possible in answering though at this distance all the course of justice demands being fully convinced of the truth and impartiality of my history  i had last post a printed paper sent me which some body i really know not who has write in my vindication i cannot but thank the author of that paper for the good will he has shown to me and for his concern for truth which to me argues him an honest man and had he left out that needless thing called praise which asking his pardon the world always calls flattery and i thank god i do not seek nor can upon no terms accept from any body had this been left out i would have set my hand to the truth of every thing in that paper  i see but one thing in it requires explication viz where he speaks of my asking mr clark pardon and this i say needs explication not that it is wrong related but least mr clark or any body for him should suggest that i had owned i had injured him in the history and had asked his pardon  the case is plain i did at the intercession of two honest gentlemen and mr clarks friends they alleging it would be very prejudicial to him agree to alter the sheet as it was first printed to leave out his name and some reflections i had made upon his conduct i appeal to those gentlemen i told them at first i would not leave out the matter of fact according to my promise i caused the sheet to be altered and reprinted and gave strict orders to the printer that none of the first should be published as mrs anderson and her servants i doubt not will do me the justice to own but by the mistake of her servants and without my knowledge many of the first sheets were delivered out which i resented very much and caused the leaf to be torn out of those that came to my knowledge even after the binding and when i saw mr clark i told him how it was and though it was not my fault yet i askt his pardon for it is a mistake  but the good gentleman is pleased to forget this civility and reproach me with it after that acknowledgement as a wilful act of mine which obliges me to tell him i think my self acquitted of my capitulation and shall in any future edition let mr clark see it more plainly  this i say by way of explanation of the paper which is published in my vindication i am told mr clark is mighty warm to find the author of that paper indeed were i the author and had witten it in vindication of another person i would for a muskin of wine own it to him at the cross of edinburgh  the articles of personal characters aforesaid only accepted and i must say in justice to the author and mere dictates of conscience that abating what i call flattery  a thing i abhor and which i wish heartily that gentleman had left out  i see nothing in that paper but i believe to be very true all that is suggested seems just and fairly deduced and all that is affirmed i dare say can be proved and mr clarks paper is so well answered by that gentleman that i need add nothing to it  as for scurrilous treatment and abusive language upon me in which mr clark is pleased to abound he that loves to roll himself in his own mire let him do it railing never mended an argument many a good one has it marred many a bad one made worse i thank god i have not been used to it it is neither the sin of my education or inclination less still is it my talent and least of all do i value it when it flys at me from another if it moves any thing in me it is my pity for i take a man when he is come to railing to be but a few steps off of distraction  and all men commiserate a lunatic in short passion and ill language is below a gentleman inconsistent with a wise man remote from a good man the disease of a learned man and above all indecent and unbecoming a minister  it is a breach of good manners a reproach to letters a scandal to argument and a test of human frailty on these accounts i take no notice of all mr clarks gall it is throwing dust against the wind and it all flys back in his own eyes let him rail on  i cannot think it needful to say any more if mr clark pleases to writ annually or monthly or daily he is welcome i desire all my friends may let him alone as i shall when he has made an end he will have done  and i am very well content to let him have the last word of flighting as he had the first  as to the history of the union  what i have written i have written there it stands supported by truth and sufficient evidence ready to be produced when justice requires it and what can any historian desire more  if mr clark thinks the world is to be amused with his negative and with a bare denying the words upon his mere reputation i tell him again there are men of equal reputation and since he moves me to it i do say of superior reputation to him that do affirm he spoke them and if i might advise him for his reputation it is my opinion he had better let it alone than stir in this lay still any further least the smell of it offend his neighbors  d f  finis
