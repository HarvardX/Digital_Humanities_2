thoughts and details on scarcity originally presented to the right hon william pit in the month of november       by the late right honorable edmund burke  london printed for f and c rivington no    st pauls churchyard and j hatchard no     piccadilly   00  price one shilling and sixpence  preface beaconsfield nov     00 the wisdom which is canonized by death is consulted with a sort of sacred veneration a casual remark or an incidental maxim in some ancient author an interesting narrative or a pointed anecdote from the history of past times even though they bear but a remote and general application to the exigency of our own immediate situation are caught up with eagerness and remembered with delight but how much more important is the instruction which we may derive from the posthumous opinions of those who having been most eminent in our own times for superior talents and more extensive knowledge have formed their observation on circumstances so similar to our own as only not to be the same yet who speak without influence from the little prejudices and passions to which accident folly or malevolence may have given birth in the present moment  the late mr burke in the estimation of those who were most capable of judging stood high both as a scientific and a practical farmer he carried into his fields the same penetrating comprehensive and vigorous mind which shone forth so conspicuously in all his exertions on the stage of public life wherever he was in whatever he was engaged he was alike assiduous in collecting information and happy in combining what he acquired into general principles all that the ancients have left us upon husbandry was familiar to him and he once encouraged and set on foot a new edition of those valuable writers but though he might occasionally derive new hints even from those sources he preferred the authority of his own hind to that of hesiod or virgil of cato or columella he thought for himself upon this as upon other subjects and not rejecting sound reforms of demonstrated errors he was however principally guided by the traditionary skill and experience of that class of men who from father to son have for generations labored in calling forth the fertility of the english soil he not only found in agriculture the most agreeable relaxation from his more serious cares but he regarded the cultivation of the earth and the improvement of all which it produces as a sort of moral and religious duty toward the close of his life when he had lost his son in whom all his prospects had long centered after lamenting in an elegant allusion to virgil that the trees which he had been nursing for many years would now afford no shade to his posterity he was heard to correct himself by adding yet be it so i ought not therefore to bestow less attention upon them  they grow to god  agriculture and the commerce connected with and dependent upon it form one of the most considerable branches of political economy and as such mr burke diligently studied them indeed when he began to qualify himself for the exalted rank which he afterward held among statesmen he laid a broad and deep foundation and to an accurate research into the constitution the laws the civil and military history of these kingdoms he joined an enlightened acquaintance with the whole circle of our commercial system on his first introduction when a young man to the late mr gerard hamilton who was then a lord of trade the latter ingenuously confessed to a friend still living how sensibly he felt his own inferiority much as he had endeavored to inform himself and aided as he was by official documents inaccessible to any private person he was also consulted and the greatest deference was paid to his opinions by dr adam smith in the progress of the celebrated work on the wealth of nations  in parliament mr burke very soon distinguished himself on these topics when the first great permanent law for regulating our foreign corntrade was under the consideration of the house in      he was one of its principle supporters in a speech admired at the time for its excellence and described as abounding with that knowledge in oeconomics which he was then universally allowed to possess and illustrated with that philosophical discrimination of which he was so peculiarly a master about the same time too he zealously promoted the repeal of the statutes against forestallers a measure not lightly and hastily proposed or adopted in the liberal impulse of an unguarded moment but the result of various investigations made by the house or in different committees during six years of scarcity and high prices a measure which although two bills of a contrary tendency had formerly been introduced and lost so approved itself at length to the reason of all that it was ordered to be brought in without a single dissentient voice yet though such was his early preeminence in these pursuits to the last hour of his life as his fame spread wider and wider over europe he availed himself of the advantage which this afforded him to enlarge the sphere of his enquiries into the state of other countries that he might benefit his own the consequence of all was he every day became more firmly convinced that the unrestrained freedom of buying and selling is the great animating principle of production and supply  the present publication records mr burkes most mature reflections on these interesting subjects the more valuable because the sentiments which he delivered on the occasions already mentioned have not been preserved to us either by himself or by others he was alarmed by the appearance of the crop in      even before the harvest in the autumn of that year when the produce of the harvest began to be known the alarm became general various projects as in such cases will always happen were offered to government and in his opinion seemed to be received with too much complaisance under this impression anxious as he ever was even in his retirement and in the midst of his own private affliction for the public safety and prosperity he immediately addressed to mr pit a memorial which is the groundwork of the following tract afterward considering the importance of the matter and fearing a long cycle of scarcity to come he intended to have dilated the several branches of the argument and to have molded his thoughts and details into a more popular shape this he purposed to have done in a series of letters on rural oeconomics inscribed to his friend mr arthur young it may be remembered that he even announced this design in an advertisement but his attention was irresistibly called another way his whole mind was engrossed by the change of policy which discovered itself in our councils at that period when forgetting the manly arts by which alone great nations have ever extricated themselves from momentous and doubtful conflicts we descended against the remonstrances of our allies to the voluntary and unnecessary humiliation of soliciting a peace which in his judgment the animosity of our insolent enemy was not then disposed to grant and which if offered we could not then have accepted without the certainty of incurring dangers much more formidable than any that threatened us from the protraction of the war he hastened to raise and reinspirit the prostrate genius of his country in a great measure he succeeded and was still employed in the pious office when divine providence took him to receive the reward of those who devote themselves to the cause of virtue and religion after his decease two or three detached fragments only of the first letter to mr young were found among his papers these could not be printed in that imperfect state and they seemed too precious to be wholly thrown aside they have been inserted therefore in the memorial where they seemed best to cohere the first and largest of these interpolations reaches from the middle of the sixth to the bottom of the   th page the second commences near the bottom of the  0th and ends a little below the middle of the   th and the last occupying about three pages and a half forms the present conclusion  the memorial had been fairly copied but did not appear to have been examined or corrected as some trifling errors of the transcriber were perceptible in it the manuscript of the fragments was a rough draft from the authors own hand much blotted and very confused it has been followed with as much fidelity as was possible after consulting those who were most accustomed to mr burkes manner of writing two or three chasms in the grammar and sense from the casual omission of two or three unimportant words at a distance have been supplied by conjecture the principal alteration has been the necessary change of the second for the third person and the consequent suppression of the common form of affectionate address where mr young is named that gentleman alone can have reason to complain of this liberty inasmuch as it may seem to have deprived him of that which in some sort was his property and which no man would have known better how to value but it is hoped he will pardon it since in this manner alone these golden fragments to borrow a favorite phrase of critics and commentators could have been made as they were designed to be of general utility to the reader no apology is due if the disquisitions thus interwoven may seem a little disproportioned to the summary statements of the original memorial their own intrinsic worth and beauty will be an ample compensation for that slight deformity though perhaps in such a composition as this professes to be and the title is mr burkes own nothing of the kind could have been fairly regarded as an irregular excrescence had it been placed by himself where it now stands  the memorial which was indeed communicated to several members of the kings government was believed at the time to have been not wholly unproductive of good the enquiry which had been actually begun into the quantity of corn in hand was silently dropped the scheme of public granaries if it ever existed was abandoned in parliament the ministers maintained a prudent and dignified forbearance and repressed in others or where they could not entirely control interposed to moderate and divert that restless spirit of legislation which is an evil that seems to grow up as the vehemence of partycontention abates the consistency and good sense of the commons defeated an attempt which was made toward the close of the sessions to revive against forestallers of one particular description some portion of the exploded laws  last year on the approach of our present distresses the same excellent temper of mind seemed to prevail in government in parliament and among the people there was no proposal of taking stock no speculation of creating a new establishment of royal purveyors to provide us with our daily dole of bread the corn merchants were early assured that they should not again have to contend with the competition of the treasury in the foreign market a committee of the house of commons ventured to dissuade the stopping of the distilleries in a report very closely coinciding with the reasoning of mr burke little or no popular declamation was heard on the miseries of the laboring poor not a single petition was presented or motion made against forestallers the least objectionable of the experiments suggested to increase the supply or lessen the consumption were adopted it is hardly worthy of mention as an exception that a parliamentary charter was granted to a company of very worthy and wellmeaning persons who on the notion of a combination which by the way they totally failed in proving among the trades that supply the capital with bread opened a subscription for undertaking to furnish nearly onetenth of the consumption they were contented to do this with limited profits merely as humane badgers and jobbers charitable millers sentimental mealmen and philanthropic bakers but distrusting a little their own sufficiency for their new business they naturally desired to be exempted from the operation of the bankrupt laws and their bill was carried by a very small majority consisting of partners in the firm all this while under trials much more severe than in the former dearth the inferior classes displayed a patience and resignation only to be equalled by the alacrity and zeal which the higher and middle orders every where manifested to relieve the necessities of their poorer neighbors in every practicable mode  the present is a season of ferment and riot the old cry against forestallers has been raised again with more violence than ever it has been adjudged for the first time it is presumed since the repealing act of      that they are still liable to be punished by the common law with fine and imprisonment at least if not with whipping and the pillory according to the notion which the judge may entertain of their crime  the interpreters of the law must expound it according to their conscientious judgments as it is and the doctrine is not quite new it has certainly been suggested in grave books since the repeal yet men of sober minds have doubted and will doubt whether in the whole code of customs and usages derived to us from our ancestors there can be found any one part so radically inapplicable to the present state of the country as their trade law which formed before commerce can be said to have existed on mixed considerations of police for the prevention of theft and rapine and of protection to the interest of the lord in the rights of toll and stallage permitted no transaction of bargain and sale in any kind of commodity but openly at a market or a fair and more anciently still with the addition of witnesses also before the magistrate or the priest which knew of no commercial principle but that of putting in every instance the grower the maker or the importer native and foreigner alike at the mercy of the consumer and for that purpose prohibited every intermediate profit and every practice by act by word or by writing that could enhance the price by which if the dragging of the mouldering records into day be not a mere robbery of the moths and worms should a gentleman encourage fishermen brewers and bakers to settle on his estate it may be pronounced a forestallage of the next town and a silk merchant should he ask too much for his raw and organzine the unfortunate lombard in the assizebook only asked he did not get it from the poor silkewemen may be punished by a heavy fine which cannot now be partially in force against one set of dealers and abrogated by disuse with regard to all others which if generally applied for a single term without the interposition of that wisdom of parliament over which this resort to the common law is by some regarded as a triumph would more effectually clog distress and ruin our foreign and domestic commerce in all its branches than a confederacy of the whole world against us in many years  be the late convictions however what they may in legal merits their practical effects have been much to be deplored gross minds distorted them into authorities to prove that there was plenty in the land and that the arts of greedy and unfeeling men alone intercepted the bounty of providence meetings were called nonconsumption agreements were signed to fix a compulsory price and associations were formed chiefly in cities and great towns to prosecute those without whom cities and great towns can never be regularly fed there is no weak no wild no violent project which did not find countenance in some quarter or other the fall of the market immediately after the harvest and the subsequent rise though the natural effects of obvious causes increased the public agitation and the multitude began to pursue their usual course of providing in the shortest way for their instant wants or of terrifying or punishing those whom they had been taught to consider as their oppressors unconscious or unconcerned that they were thus only preparing for themselves a tenfold aggravation of their own future sufferings the eyes of all were now turned toward parliament not for a train of judicious measures which if it be possible may hereafter again equalize the production with the consumption of the country but for an immediate supply as if the omnipotence of parliament could restore a single grain that has been injured by the most contemptible insect  at such a juncture however unfavourable it may be to the popularity of this little tract the publication of it was felt to be a duty he who wrote it ever set that consideration before him as the first motive of all his actions while he lived he never ceased publicly and privately to warn his country and her rulers against every danger which his wisdom foresaw he now gives to her and them this solemn warning from his grave  thoughts and details on scarcity of all things an indiscreet tampering with the trade of provisions is the most dangerous and it is always worst in the time when men are most disposed to it  that is in the time of scarcity because there is nothing on which the passions of men are so violent and their judgment so weak and on which there exists such a multitude of illfounded popular prejudices  the great use of government is as a restraint and there is no restraint which it ought to put upon others and upon itself too rather than on the fury of speculating under circumstances of irritation the number of idle tales spread about by the industry of faction and by the zeal of foolish goodintention and greedily devoured by the malignant credulity of mankind tends infinitely to aggravate prejudices which in themselves are more than sufficiently strong in that state of affairs and of the public with relation to them the first thing that government owes to us the people is information the next is timely coercion  the one to guide our judgment the other to regulate our tempers  to provide for us in our necessities is not in the power of government it would be a vain presumption in statesmen to think they can do it the people maintain them and not they the people it is in the power of government to prevent much evil it can do very little positive good in this or perhaps in any thing else it is not only so of the state and statesman but of all the classes and descriptions of the rich  they are the pensioners of the poor and are maintained by their superfluity they are under an absolute hereditary and indefeasible dependence on those who labor and are miscalled the poor  the laboring people are only poor because they are numerous numbers in their nature imply poverty in a fair distribution among a vast multitude none can have much that class of dependant pensioners called the rich is so extremely small that if all their throats were cut and a distribution made of all they consume in a year it would not give a bit of bread and cheese for one nights supper to those who labor and who in reality feed both the pensioners and themselves  but the throats of the rich ought not to be cut nor their magazines plundered because in their persons they are trustees for those who labor and their hoards are the bankinghouses of these latter whether they mean it or not they do in effect execute their trust  some with more some with less fidelity and judgment but on the whole the duty is performed and every thing returns deducting some very trifling commission and discount to the place from whence it arose when the poor rise to destroy the rich they act as wisely for their own purposes as when they burn mills and throw corn into the river to make bread cheap  when i say that we of the people ought to be informed inclusively i say we ought not to be flattered flattery is the reverse of instruction the poor in that case would be rendered as improvident as the rich which would not be at all good for them  nothing can be so base and so wicked as the political canting language the laboring poor let compassion be shown in action the more the better according to every mans ability but let there be no lamentation of their condition it is no relief to their miserable circumstances it is only an insult to their miserable understandings it arises from a total want of charity or a total want of thought want of one kind was never relieved by want of any other kind patience labor sobriety frugality and religion should be recommended to them all the rest is downright fraud it is horrible to call them the once happy labourer  whether what may be called moral or philosophical happiness of the laborious classes is increased or not i cannot say the seat of that species of happiness is in the mind and there are few data to ascertain the comparative state of the mind at any two periods philosophical happiness is to want little civil or vulgar happiness is to want much and to enjoy much  if the happiness of the animal man which certainly goes somewhere toward the happiness of the rational man be the object of our estimate then i assert without the least hesitation that the condition of those who labor in all descriptions of labor and in all gradations of labor from the highest to the lowest inclusively is on the whole extremely meliorated if more and better food is any standard of melioration they work more it is certain but they have the advantage of their augmented labor yet whether that increase of labor be on the whole a good or an evil is a consideration that would lead us a great way and is not for my present purpose but as to the fact of the melioration of their diet i shall enter into the detail of proof whenever i am called upon in the mean time the known difficulty of contenting them with any thing but bread made of the finest flour and meat of the first quality is proof sufficient  i further assert that even under all the hardships of the last year the laboring people did either out of their direct gains or from charity which it seems is now an insult to them in fact fare better than they did in seasons of common plenty  0 or  0 years ago or even at the period of my english observation which is about    years i even assert that full as many in that class as ever were known to do it before continued to save money and this i can prove so far as my own information and experience extend  it is not true that the rate of wages has not increased with the nominal price of provisions i allow it has not fluctuated with that price nor ought it and the squires of norfolk had dined when they gave it as their opinion that it might or ought to rise and fall with the market of provisions the rate of wages in truth has no direct relation to that price labor is a commodity like every other and rises or falls according to the demand this is in the nature of things however the nature of things has provided for their necessities wages have been twice raised in my time and they bear a full proportion or even a greater than formerly to the medium of provision during the last bad cycle of twenty years they bear a full proportion to the result of their labor if we were wildly to attempt to force them beyond it the stone which we had forced up the hill would only fall back upon them in a diminished demand or what indeed is the far lesser evil an aggravated price of all the provisions which are the result of their manual toil  there is an implied contract much stronger than any instrument or article of agreement between the labourer in any occupation and his employer  that the labor so far as that labor is concerned shall be sufficient to pay to the employer a profit on his capital and a compensation for his risk in a word that the labor shall produce an advantage equal to the payment whatever is above that is a direct tax and if the amount of that tax be left to the will and pleasure of another it is an arbitrary tax  if i understand it rightly the tax proposed on the farming interest of this kingdom is to be levied at what is called the discretion of justices of peace  the questions arising on this scheme of arbitrary taxation are these  whether it is better to leave all dealing in which there is no force or fraud collusion or combination entirely to the persons mutually concerned in the matter contracted for or to put the contract into the hands of those who can have none or a very remote interest in it and little or no knowledge of the subject  it might be imagined that there would be very little difficulty in solving this question for what man of any degree of reflection can think that a want of interest in any subject closely connected with a want of skill in it qualifies a person to intermeddle in any the least affair much less in affairs that vitally concern the agriculture of the kingdom the first of all it is concerns and the foundation of all it is prosperity in every other matter by which that prosperity is produced  the vulgar error on this subject arises from a total confusion in the very idea of things widely different in themselves  those of convention and those of judicature when a contract is making it is a matter of discretion and of interest between the parties in that intercourse and in what is to arise from it the parties are the masters if they are not completely so they are not free and therefore their contracts are void  but this freedom has no farther extent when the contract is made then their discretionary powers expire and a new order of things takes it is origin then and not till then and on a difference between the parties the office of the judge commences he cannot dictate the contract it is his business to see that it be enforced provided that it is not contrary to preexisting laws or obtained by force or fraud if he is in any way a maker or regulator of the contract in so much he is disqualified from being a judge but this sort of confused distribution of administrative and judicial characters of which we have already as much as is sufficient and a little more is not the only perplexity of notions and passions which trouble us in the present hour  what is doing supposes or pretends that the farmer and the labourer have opposite interests  that the farmer oppresses the labourer and that a gentleman called a justice of peace is the protector of the latter and a control and restraint on the former and this is a point i wish to examine in a manner a good deal different from that in which gentlemen proceed who confide more in their abilities than is fit and suppose them capable of more than any natural abilities fed with no other than the provender furnished by their own private speculations can accomplish legislative acts attempting to regulate this part of economy do at least as much as any other require the exactest detail of circumstances guided by the surest general principles that are necessary to direct experiment and enquiry in order again from those details to elicit principles firm and luminous general principles to direct a practical legislative proceeding  first then i deny that it is in this case as in any other of necessary implication that contracting parties should originally have had different interests by accident it may be so undoubtedly at the outset but then the contract is of the nature of a compromise and compromise is founded on circumstances that suppose it the interest of the parties to be reconciled in some medium the principle of compromise adopted of consequence the interests cease to be different  but in the case of the farmer and the labourer their interests are always the same and it is absolutely impossible that their free contracts can be onerous to either party it is the interest of the farmer that his work should be done with effect and celerity and that cannot be unless the labourer is well fed and otherwise found with such necessaries of animal life according to it is habitudes as may keep the body in full force and the mind gay and cheerful for of all the instruments of his trade the labor of man what the ancient writers have called the instrumentum vocale is that on which he is most to rely for the repayment o hss capital the other two the semivocale in the ancient classification that is the working stock of cattle and the instrumentum mutum such as carts ploughs spades and so forth though not all inconsiderable in themselves are very much inferior in utility or in expense and without a given portion of the first are nothing at all for in all things whatever the mind is the most valuable and the most important and in this scale the whole of agriculture is in a natural and just order the beast is as an informing principle to the plough and cart the labourer is as reason to the beast and the farmer is as a thinking and presiding principle to the labourer an attempt to break this chain of subordination in any part is equally absurd but the absurdity is the most mischievous in practical operation where it is the most easy that is where it is the most subject to an erroneous judgment  it is plainly more the farmers interest that his men should thrive than that his horses should be well fed sleek plump and fit for use or than that his wagon and ploughs should be strong in good repair and fit for service  on the other hand if the farmer ceases to profit of the labourer and that his capital is not continually manured and fructified it is impossible that he should continue that abundant nutriment and clothing and lodging proper for the protection of the instruments he employs  it is therefore the first and fundamental interest of the labourer that the farmer should have a full incoming profit on the product of his labor the proposition is selfevident and nothing but the malignity perverseness and illgoverned passions of mankind and particularly the envy they bear to each others prosperity could prevent their seeing and acknowledging it with thankfulness to the benign and wise disposer of all things who obliges men whether they will or not in pursuing their own selfish interests to connect the general good with their own individual success  but who are to judge what that profit and advantage ought to be certainly no authority on earth it is a matter of convention dictated by the reciprocal conveniences of the parties and indeed by their reciprocal necessities  but if the farmer is excessively avaricious  why so much the better  the more he desires to increase his gains the more interested is he in the good condition of those upon whose labor his gains must principally depend  i shall be told by the zealots of the sect of regulation that this may be true and may be safely committed to the convention of the farmer and the labourer when the latter is in the prime of his youth and at the time of his health and vigor and in ordinary times of abundance but in calamisous seasons under accidental illness in declining life and with the pressure of a numerous offspring the future nourishers of the community but the present drains and bloodsuckers of those who produce them what is to be done when a man cannot live and maintain his family by the natural hire of his labor ought it not to be raised by authority  on this head i must be allowed to submit what my opinions have ever been and somewhat at large  and first i premise that labor is as i have already intimated a commodity and as such an article of trade if i am right in this notion then labor must be subject to all the laws and principles of trade and not to regulations foreign to them and that may be totally inconsistent with those principles and those laws when any commodity is carried to market it is not the necessity of the vender but the necessity of the purchaser that raises the price the extreme want of the seller has rather by the nature of things with which we shall in vain contend the direct contrary operation if the goods at market are beyond the demand they fall in their value if below it they rise the impossibility of the subsistence of a man who carries his labor to a market is totally beside the question in this way of viewing it the only question is what is it worth to the buyer  but if authority comes in and forces the buyer to a price who is this in the case say of a farmer who buys the labor of ten or twelve laboring men and three or four handycrafts what is it but to make an arbitrary division of his property among them  the whole of his gains i say it with the most certain conviction never do amount any thing like in value to what he pays to his laborers and artificers so that a very small advance upon what one man pays to many may absorb the whole of what he possesses and amount to an actual partition of all his substance among them a perfect equality will indeed be produced  that is to say equal want equal wretchedness equal beggary and on the part of the partitioners a woeful helpless and desperate disappointment such is the event of all compulsory equalizations they pull down what is above they never raise what is below and they depress high and low together beneath the level of what was originally the lowest  if a commodity is raised by authority above what it will yield with a profit to the buyer that commodity will be the less dealt in if a second blundering interposition be used to correct the blunder of the first and an attempt is made to force the purchase of the commodity of labor for instance the one of these two things must happen either that the forced buyer is ruined or the price of the product of the labor in that proportion is raised then the wheel turns round and the evil complained of falls with aggravated weight on the complainant the price of corn which is the result of the expense of all the operations of husbandry taken together and for some time continued will rise on the labourer considered as a consumer the very best will be that he remains where he was but if the price of the corn should not compensate the price of labor what is far more to be feared the most serious evil the very destruction of agriculture itself is to be apprehended  nothing is such an enemy to accuracy of judgment as a coarse ditcrimination a want of such classification and distribution as the subject admits of increase the rate of wages to the labourer say the regulators  as if labor was but one thing and of one value but this very broad generic term labor admits at least of two or three specific descriptions and these will suffice at least to let gentlemen discern a little the necessity of proceeding with caution in their coercive guidance of those whose existence depends upon the observance of still nicer distinctions and subdivisions than commonly they resort to in forming their judgments on this very enlarged part of economy  the laborers in husbandry may be divided  st into those who are able to perform the full work of a man that is what can be done by a person from twentyone years of age to fifty i know no husbandry work mowing hardly excepted that is not equally within the power of all persons within those ages the more advanced fully compensating by knack and habit what they lose in activity unquestionably there is a good deal of difference between the value of one mans labor and that of another from strength dexterity and honest application but i am quite sure from my best observation that any given five men will in their total afford a proportion of labor equal to any other five within the periods of life i have stated that is that among such five men there will be one possessing all the qualifications of a good workman one bad and the other three middling and approximating to the first and the last so that in so small a platoon as that of even five you will find the full complement of all that five men can earn taking five and five throughout the kingdom they are equal therefore an error with regard to the equalization of their wages by those who employ five as farmers do at the very least cannot be considerable   dly those who are able to work but not the complete task of a daylabourer this class is infinitely diversified but will aptly enough fall into principal divisions men from the decline which after fifty becomes every year more sensible to the period of debility and decrepitude and the maladies that precede a final dissolution women whose employment on husbandry is but occasional and who differ more in effective labor one from another than men do on account of gestation nursing and domestic management over and above the difference they have in common with men in advancing in stationary and in declining life children who proceed on the reverse order growing from less to greater utility but with a still greater disproportion of nutriment to labor than is found in the second of these subdivisions as is visible to those who will give themselves the trouble of examining into the interior economy of a poorhouse  this inferior classification is introduced to show that laws prescribing or magistrates exercising a very stiff and often inapplicable rule or a blind and rash discretion never can provide the just proportions between earning and salary on the one hand and nutriment on the other whereas interest habit and the tacit convention that arise from a thousand nameless circumstances produce a tact that regulates without difficulty what laws and magistrates cannot regulate at all the first class of labor wants nothing to equalize it it equalizes itself the second and third are not capable of any equalization  but what if the rate of hire to the labourer comes far short of his necessary subsistence and the calamity of the time is so great as to threaten actual famine is the poor labourer to be abandoned to the flinty heart and griping hand of base selfinterest supported by the sword of law especially when there is reason to suppose that the very avarice of farmers themselves has concurred with the errors of government to bring famine on the land  in that case my opinion is this whenever it happens that a man can claim nothing according to the rules of commerce and the principles of justice he passes out of that department and comes within the jurisdiction of mercy in that province the magistrate has nothing at all to do his interference is a violation of the property which it is his office to protect without all doubt charity to the poor is a direct and obligatory duty upon all christians next in order after the payment of debts full as strong and by nature made infinitely more delightful to us puffendorf and other casuists do not i think denominate it quite properly when they call it a duty of imperfect obligation but the manner mode time choice of objects and proportion are left to private discretion and perhaps for that very reason it is performed with the greater satisfaction because the discharge of it has more the appearance of freedom recommending us besides very specially to the divine favor as the exercise of a virtue most suitable to a being sensible of it is own infirmity  the cry of he people in cities and towns though unfortunately from a fear of their multitude and combination the most regarded ought in fact to be the least attended to upon this subject for citizens are in a state of utter ignorance of the means by which they are to be fed and they contribute little or nothing except in an infinitely circuitous manner to their own maintenance they are truly fruges consumere nati they are to be heard with great respect and attention upon matters within their province that is on trades and manufactures but on any thing that relates to agriculture they are to be listened to with the same reverence which we pay to the dogmas of other ignorant and pesumptuous men  if any one were to tell them that they were to give in an account of all the stock in their shops that attempts would be made to limit their profits or raise the price of the laboring manufacturers upon them or recommend to government out of a capital from the public revenues to set up a shop of the same commodities in order to rival them and keep them to reasonable dealing they would very soon see the impudence injustice and oppression of such a course they would not be mistaken but they are of opinion that agriculture is to be subject to other laws and to be governed by other principles  a greater and more ruinous mistake cannot be fallen into than that the trades of agriculture and grazing can be conducted upon any other than the common principles of commerce namely that the producer should be permitted and even expected to look to all possible profit which without fraud or violence he can make to turn plenty or scarcity to the best advantage he can to keep back or to bring forward his commodities at his pleasure to account to no one for his stock or for his gain on any other terms he is the slave of the consumer and that he should be so is of no benefit to the consumer no slave was ever so beneficial to the master as a freeman that deals with him on an equal footing by convention formed on the rules and principles of contending interests and compromised advantages the consumer if he were suffered would in the end always be the dupe of his own tyranny and injustice the landed gentleman is never to forget that the farmer is his representative  it is a perilous thing to try experiments on the farmer the farmers capital except in a few persons and in a very few places is far more feeble than commonly is imagined the trade is a very poor trade it is subject to great risks and losses the capital such as it is is turned but once in the year in some branches it requires three years before the money is paid i believe never less than three in the turnip and grassland course which is the prevalent course on the more or less fertile sandy and gravelly loams and these compose the soil in the south and southeast of england the best adapted and perhaps the only ones that are adapted to the turnip husbandry  it is very rare that the most prosperous farmer counting the value of his quick and dead stock the interest of the money he turns together with his own wages as a bailiff or overseer ever does make twelve or fifteen per centum by the year on his capital i speak of the prosperous in most of the parts of england which have fallen within my observation i have rarely known a farmer who to his own trade has not added some other employment or traffic that after a course of the most unremitting parsimony and labor such for the greater part is theirs and persevering in his business for a long course of years died worth more than paid his debts leaving his posterity to continue in nearly the same equal conflict between industry and want in which the last predecessor and a long line of predecessors before him lived and died  observe that i speak of the generality of farmers who have not more than from one hundred and fifty to three or four hundred acres there are few in this part of the country within the former or much beyond the latter extent unquestionably in other places there are much larger but i am convinced whatever part of england be the theater of his operations a farmer who cultivates twelve hundred acres which i consider as a large farm though i know there are larger cannot proceed with any degree of safety and effect with a smaller capital than ten thousand pounds and that he cannot in the ordinary course of culture make more upon that great capital of ten thousand pounds than twelve hundred a year  as to the weaker capitals an easy judgment may be formed by what very small errors they may be farther attenuated enervated rendered unproductive and perhaps totally destroyed  this constant precariousness and ultimate moderate limits of a farmers fortune on the strongest capital i press not only on account of the hazardous speculations of the times but because the excellent and most useful works of my friend mr arthur young tend to propagate that error such i am very certain it is of the largeness of a farmers profits it is not that his account of the produce does often greatly exceed but he by no means makes the proper allowance for accidents and losses i might enter into a convincing detail if other more troublesome and more necessary details were not before me  this proposed discretionary tax on labor militates with the recommendations of the board of agriculture they recommend a general use of the drill culture i agree with the board that where the soil is not excessively heavy or incumbered with large loose stones which however is the case with much otherwise good land that course is the best and most productive provided that the most accurate eye the most vigilant superintendance the most prompt activity which has no such day as tomorrow in its calendar the most steady foresight and predisposing order to have every body and every thing ready in it is place and prepared to take advantage of the fortunate fugitive moment in this coquetting climate of ours  provided i say all these combine to speed the plough i admit its superiority over the old and general methods but under procrastinating improvident ordinary husbandmen who may neglect or let slip the few opportunities of sweetening and purifying their ground with perpetually renovated toil and undissipated attention nothing when tried to any extent can be worse or more dangerous the farm may be ruined instead of having the soil enriched and sweetened by it  but the excellence of the method on a proper soil and conducted by an husbandman of whom there are few being readily granted how and on what conditions is this culture obtained why by a very great increase of labor by an augmentation of the third part at least of the handlabour to say nothing of the horses and machinery employed in ordinary tillage now every man must be sensible how little becoming the gravity of legislature it is to encourage a board which recommends to us and upon very weighty reasons unquestionably an enlargement of the capital we employ in the operations of the land and then to pass an act which taxes that manual labor already at a very high rate thus compelling us to diminish the quantity of labor which in the vulgar course we actually employ  what is true of the farmer is equally true of the middle man whether the middle man acts as factor jobber salesman or speculator in the markets of grain these traders are to be left to their free course and the more they make and the richer they are and the more largely they deal the better both for the farmer and consumer between whom they form a natural and most useful link of connection though by the machinations of the old evil counselor envy they are hated and maligned by both parties  i hear that middle men are accused of monopoly without question the monopoly of authority is in every instance and in every degree an evil but the monopoly of capital is the contrary it is a great benefit and a benefit particularly to the poor a tradesman who has but a hundred pound capital which say he can turn but once a year cannot live upon a profit of  0 per cent because he cannot live upon ten pounds a year but a man of ten thousand pounds capital can live and thrive upon   per cent profit in the year because he has five hundred pounds a year the same proportion holds in turning it twice or thrice these principles are plain and simple and it is not our ignorance so much as the levity the envy and the malignity of our nature that hinders us from perceiving and yielding to them but we are not to suffer our vices to usurp the place of our judgment  the balance between consumption and production makes price the market settles and alone can settle that price market is the meeting and conference of the consumer and producer when they mutually discover each others wants nobody i believe has observed with any reflection what market is without being astonished at the truth the correctness the celerity the general equity with which the balance of wants is settled they who wish the destruction of that balance and would fain by arbitrary regulation decree that defective production should not be compensated by increased price directly lay their axe to the root of production itself  they may even in one year of such false policy do mischiefs incalculable because the trade of a farmer is as i have before explained one of the most precarious in its advantages the most liable to losses and the least profitable of any that is carried on it requires ten times more of labor of vigilance of attention of skill and let me add of good fortune also to carry on the business of a farmer with success than what belongs to any other trade seeing things in this light i am far from presuming to censure the late circular instruction of council to lord lieutenants  but i confess i do not clearly discern its object i am greatly afraid that the enquiry will raise some alarm as a measure leading to the french system of putting corn into requisition for that was preceded by an inquisition somewhat similar in it is principle though according to their mode their principles are full of that violence which here is not much to be feared it goes on a principle directly opposite to mine it presumes that the market is no fair test of plenty or scarcity it raises a suspicion which may affect the tranquillity of the public mind that the farmer keeps back and takes unfair advantages by delay on the part of the dealer it gives rise obviously to a thousand nefarious speculations  in case the return should on the whole prove favorable is it meant to ground a measure for encouraging exportation and checking the import of corn if it is not what end can it answer and i believe it is not  this opinion may be fortified by a report gone abroad that intentions are entertained of erecting public granaries and that this enquiry is to give government an advantage in it is purchases  i hear that such a measure has been proposed and is under deliberation that is for government to set up a granary in every market town at the expense of the state in order to extinguish the dealer and to subject the farmer to the consumer by securing corn to the latter at a certain and steady price  if such a scheme is adopted i should not like to answer for the safety of the granary of the agents or of the town itself in which the granary was erected  the first storm of popular phrenzy would fall upon that granary  so far in a political light  in an economical light i must observe that the construction of such granaries throughout the kingdom would be at an expense beyond all calculation the keeping them up would be at a great charge the management and attendance would require an army of agents storekeepers clerks and servants the capital to be employed in the purchase of grain would be enormous the waste decay and corruption would be a dreadful drawback on the whole dealing and the dissatisfaction of the people at having decayed tainted or corrupted corn sold to them as must be the case would be serious  this climate whatever others may be is not favorable to granaries where wheat is to be kept for any time the best and indeed the only good granary is the rickyard of the farmer where the corn is preserved in it is own straw sweet clean wholesome free from vermin and from insects and comparatively at a trifle of expense this with the barn enjoying many of the same advantages have been the sole granaries of england from the foundation of it is agriculture to this day all this is done at the expense of the undertaker and at his sole risk he contributes to government he receives nothing from it but protection and to this he has a claim  the moment that government appears at market all the principles of market will be subverted i dont know whether the farmer will suffer by it as long as there is a tolerable market of competition but i am sure that in the first place the trading government will speedily become a bankrupt and the consumer in the end will suffer if government makes all it is purchases at once it will instantly raise the market upon itself if it makes them by degrees it must follow the course of the market if it follows the course of the market it will produce no effect and the consumer may as well buy as he wants  therefore all the expense is incurred gratis  but if the object of this scheme should be what i suspect it is to destroy the dealer commonly called the middle man and by incurring a voluntary loss to carry the baker to deal with government i am to tell them that they must set up another trade that of a miller or a mealman attended with a new train of expenses and risks if in both these trades they should succeed so as to exclude those who trade on natural and private capitals then they will have a monopoly in their hands which under the appearance of a monopoly of capital will in reality be a monopoly of authority and will ruin whatever it touches the agriculture of the kingdom cannot stand before it  a little place like geneva of not more than from twentyfive to thirty thousand inhabitants which has no territory or next to none which depends for it is existence on the good will of three neighboring powers and is of course continually in the state of something like a siege or in the speculation of it might find some resource in state granaries and some revenue from the monopoly of what was sold to the keepers of publichouses this is a policy for a state too small for agriculture it is not for instance fit for so great a country as the pope possesses where however it is adopted and pursued in a greater extent and with more strictness certain of the popes territories from whence the city of rome is supplied being obliged to furnish rome and the granaries of his holiness with corn at a certain price that part of the papal territories is utterly ruined that ruin may be traced with certainty to this sole cause and it appears indubitably by a comparison of their state and condition with that of the other part of the ecclesiastical dominions not subjected to the same regulations which are in circumstances highly flourishing  the reformation of this evil system is in a manner impracticable for first it does keep bread and all other provisions equally subject to the chamber of supply at a pretty reasonable and regular price in the city of rome this preserves quiet among the numerous poor idle and naturally mutinous people of a very great capital but the quiet of the town is purchased by the ruin of the country and the ultimate wretchedness of both the next cause which renders this evil incurable is the jobs which have grown out of it and which in spite of all precautions would grow out of such things even under governments far more potent than the feeble authority of the pope  this example of rome which has been derived from the most ancient times and the most flourishing period of the roman empire but not of the roman agriculture may serve as a great caution to all governments not to attempt to feed the people out of the hands of the magistrates if once they are habituated to it though but for one halfyear they will never be satisfied to have it otherwise and having looked to government for bread on the very first scarcity they will turn and bite the hand that fed them to avoid that evil government will redouble the causes of it and then it will become inveterate and incurable  i beseech the government which i take in the largest sense of the word comprehending the two houses of parliament seriously to consider that years of scarcity or plenty do not come alternately or at short intervals but in pretty long cycles and irregularly and consequently that we cannot assure ourselves if we take a wrong measure from the temporary necessities of one season but that the next and probably more will drive us to the continuance of it so that in my opinion there is no way of preventing this evil which goes to the destruction of all our agriculture and of that part of our internal commerce which touches our agriculture the most nearly as well as the safety and very being of government but manfully to resist the very first idea speculative or practical that it is within the competence of government taken as government or even of the rich as rich to supply to the poor those necessaries which it has pleased the divine providence for a while to withold from them we the people ought to be made sensible that it is not in breaking the laws of commerce which are the laws of nature and consequently the laws of god that we are to place our hope of softening the divine displeasure to remove any calamity under which we suffer or which hangs over us  so far as to the principles of general policy  as to the state of things which is urged as a reason to deviate from them these are the circumstances of the harvest of      and      with regard to the harvest of      in relation to the noblest grain wheat it is allowed to have been somewhat short but not excessively and in quality for the seven and twenty years during which i have been a farmer i never remember wheat to have been so good the world were however deceived in their speculations upon it  the farmer as well as the dealer accordingly the price fluctuated beyond any thing i can remember for at one time of the year i sold my wheat at   l a load i sold off all i had as i thought this was a reasonable price when at the end of the season if i had then had any to sell i might have got thirty guineas for the same sort of grain i fold all that i had as i said at a comparatively low price because i thought it a good price compared with what i thought the general produce of the harvest but when i came to consider what my own total was i found that the quantity had not answered my expectation it must be remembered that this year of produce the year      short but excellent followed a year which was not extraordinary in production nor of a superior quality and left but little in store at first this was not felt because the harvest came in unusually early  earlier than common by a full month  the winter at the end of      and beginning of      was more than usually unfavourable both to corn and grass owing to the sudden relaxation of very rigorous frosts followed by rains which were again rapidly succeeded by frosts of still greater rigor than the first  much wheat was utterly destroyed the clover grass suffered in many places what i never observed before the ryegrass or coarse bent suffered more than the clover even the meadowgrass in some places was killed to the very roots in the spring appearances were better than we expected all the early sown grain recovered itself and came up with great vigor but that which was late sown was feeble and did not promise to resist any blights in the spring which however with all its unpleasant vissicitudes passed off very well and nothing looked better than the wheat at the time of blooming  but at that most critical time of all a cold dry east wind attended with very sharp frosts longer and stronger than i recollect at that time of year destroyed the flowers and withered up in an astonishing manner the whole side of the ear next to the wind at that time i brought to town some of the ears for the purpose of showing to my friends the operation of those unnatural frosts and according to their extent i predicted a great scarcity but such is the pleasure of agreeable prospects that my opinion was little regarded  on threshing i found things as i expected  the ears not filled some of the capsules quite empty and several others containing only withered hungry grain inferior to the appearance of rye my best ears and grains were not fine never had i grain of so low a quality  yet i sold one load for   l at the same time i bought my seed wheat it was excellent at   l since then the price has risen and i have sold about two load of the same sort at   l such was the state of the market when i left home last monday little remains in my barn i hope some in the rick may be better since it was earlier sown as well as i can recollect some of my neighbors have better some quite as bad or even worse i suspect it will be found that wherever the blighting wind and those frosts at blooming time have prevailed the produce of the wheat crop will turn out very indifferent those parts which have escaped will i can hardly doubt have a reasonable produce  as to the other grains it is to be observed as the wheat ripened very late on account i conceive of the blights the barley got the start of it and was ripe first the crop was with me and wherever my enquiry could reach excellent in some places far superior to mine  the clover which came up with the barley was the finest i remember to have seen  the turnips of this year are generally good  the clover sown last year where not totally destroyed gave two good crops or one crop and a plentiful feed and bating the loss of the ryegrass i do not remember a better produce  the meadowgrass yielded but a middling crop and neither of the sown or natural grass was there in any farmers possession any remainder from the year worth taking into account in most places there was none at all  oats with me were not in a quantity more considerable than in commonly good seasons but i have never known them heavier than they were in other places the oat was not only an heavy but an uncommonly abundant crop my ground under pease did not exceed an acre or thereabouts but the crop was great indeed i believe it is throughout the country exuberant  it is however to be remarked that as generally of all the grains so particularly of the pease there was not the smallest quantity in reserve  the demand of the year must depend solely on it is own produce and the price of the springcorn is not to be expected to fall very soon or at any time very low  uxbridge is a great corn market as i came through that town i found that at the last marketday barley was at forty shillings a quarter oats there were literally none and the innkeeper was obliged to send for them to london i forgot to ask about pease potatoes were  s the bushel  in the debate on this subject in the house i am told that a leading member of great ability little conversant in these matters observed that the general uniform dearness of butchers meat butter and cheese could not be owing to a defective produce of wheat and on this ground insinuated a suspicion of some unfair practice on the subject that called for enquiry  unquestionably the mere deficiency of wheat could not cause the dearness of the other articles which extends not only to the provisions he mentioned but to every other without exception  the cause is indeed so very plain and obvious that the wonder is the other way when a properly directed enquiry is made the gentlemen who are amazed at the price of these commodities will find that when hay is at six pound a load as they must know it is herbage and for more than one year must be scanty and they will conclude that if grass be scarce beef veal mutton butter milk and cheese must be dear  but to take up the matter somewhat more in detail  if the wheat harvest in      excellent in quality was defective in quantity the barley harvest was in quality ordinary enough and in quantity deficient this was soon felt in the price of malt  another article of produce beans was not at all plentiful the crop of pease was wholly destroyed so that several farmers pretty early gave up all hopes on that head and cut the green haulm as fodder for the cattle then perishing for want of food in that dry and burning summer i myself came off better than most  i had about the fourth of a crop of pease  it will be recollected that in a manner all the bacon and pork consumed in this country the far largest consumption of meat out of towns is when growing fed on grass and on whey or skimmed milk and when fatting partly on the latter this is the case in the dairy countries all of them great breeders and feeders of swine but for the much greater part and in all the corn countries they are fattened on beans barley meal and pease when the food of the animal is scarce his flesh must be dear this one would suppose would require no great penetration to discover  this failure of so very large a supply of flesh in one species naturally throws the whole demand of the consumer on the diminished supply of all kinds of flesh and indeed on all the matters of human sustenance nor in my opinion are we to expect a greater cheapness in that article for this year even though corn should grow cheaper as it is to be hoped it will the store swine from the failure of subsistence last year are now at an extravagant price pigs at our fairs have sold lately for fifty shillings which two years ago would not have brought more than twenty  as to sheep none i thought were strangers to the general failure of the article of turnips last year the early having been burned as they came up by the great drought and heat the late and those of the early which had escaped were destroyed by the chilling frosts of the winter and the wet and severe weather of the spring in many places a full fourth of the sheep or the lambs were lost what remained of the lambs were poor and illfed the ewes having had no milk the calves came late and they were generally an article the want of which was as much to be dreaded as any other so that article of food formerly so abundant in the early part of the summer particularly in london and which in a great part supplied the place of mutton for near two months did little less than totally fail  all the productions of the earth link in with each other all the sources of plenty in all and every article were dried or frozen up the scarcity was not as gentlemen seem to suppose in wheat only  another cause and that not of inconsiderable operation tended to produce a scarcity in flesh provision it is one that on many accounts cannot be too much regretted and the rather as it was the sole cause of scarcity in that article which arose from the proceedings of men themselves i mean the stop put to the distillery  the hogs and that would be sufficient which were fed with the waste wash of that produce did not demand the fourth part of the corn used by farmers in fattening them the spirit was nearly so much clear gain to the nation it is an odd way of making flesh cheap to stop or check the distillery  the distillery in itself produces an immense article of trade almost all over the world to africa to north america and to various parts of europe it is of great use next to food itself to our fisheries and to our whole navigation a great part of the distillery was carried on by damaged corn unfit for bread and by barley and malt of the lowest quality these things could not be more unexceptionably employed the domestic consumption of spirits produced without complaints a very great revenue applicable if we pleased in bounties to the bringing corn from other places far beyond the value of that consumed in making it or to the encouragement of it is increased production at home  as to what is said in a physical and moral view against the home consumption of spirits experience has long since taught me very little to respect the declamations on that subject  whether the thunder of the laws or the thunder of eloquence is hurled on gin always i am thunderproof the alembic in my mind has furnished to the world a far greater benefit and blessing than if the opus maximum had been really found by chemistry and like midas we could turn every thing into gold  undoubtedly there may be a dangerous abuse in the excess of spirits and at one time i am ready to believe the abuse was great when spirits are cheap the business of drunkenness is achieved with little time or labor but that evil i consider to be wholly done away observation for the last forty years and very particularly for the last thirty has furnished me with ten instances of drunkenness from other causes for one from this ardent spirit is a great medicine often to remove distempers  much more frequently to prevent them or to chase them away in their beginnings it is not nutritive in any great degree but if not food it greatly alleviates the want of it it invigorates the stomach for the digestion of poor meagre diet not easily alliable to the human constitution wine the poor cannot touch beer as applied to many occasions as among seamen and fishermen for instance will by no means do the business let me add what wits inspired with champaign and claret will turn into ridicule  it is a medicine for the mind under the pressure of the cares and sorrows of our mortal condition men have at all times and in all countries called in some physical aid to their moral consolations  wine beer opium brandy or tobacco  i consider therefore the stopping of the distillery oeconomically financially commercially medicinally and in some degree morally too as a measure rather well meant than well considered it is too precious a sacrifice to prejudice  gentlemen well know whether there be a scarcity of partridges and whether that be an effect of hoarding and combination all the tame race of birds live and die as the wild do  as to the lesser articles they are like the greater they have followed the fortune of the season why are fowls dear was not this the farmers or jobbers fault i sold from my yard to a jobber six young and lean fowls for four and twenty shillings fowls for which two years ago the same man would not have given a shilling a piece  he sold them afterward at uxbridge and they were taken to london to receive the last hand  as to the operation of the war in causing the scarcity of provisions i understand that mr pit has given a particular answer to it  but i do not think it worth powder and shot  i do not wonder the papers are so full of this sort of matter but i am a little surprised it should be mentioned in parliament like all great state questions peace and war may be discussed and different opinions fairly formed on political grounds but on a question of the present price of provisions when peace with the regicides is always uppermost i can only say that great is the love of it  after all have we not reason to be thankful to the giver of all good in our history and when the labourer of england is said to have been once happy we find constantly after certain intervals a period of real famine by which a melancholy havoc was made among the human race the price of provisions fluctuated dreadfully demonstrating a deficiency very different from the worst failures of the present moment never since i have known england have i known more than a comparative scarcity the price of wheat taking a number of years together has had no very considerable fluctuation nor has it risen exceedingly until within this twelvemonth even now i do not know of one man woman or child that has perished from famine fewer if any i believe than in years of plenty when such a thing may happen by accident this is owing to a care and superintendance of the poor far greater than any i remember  the consideration of this ought to bind us all rich and poor together against those wicked writers of the newspapers who would inflame the poor against their friends guardians patrons and protectors not only very few i have observed that i know of none though i live in a place as poor as most have actually died of want but we have seen no traces of those dreadful exterminating epidemics which in consequence of scanty and unwholesome food in former times not unfrequently wasted whole nations let us be saved from too much wisdom of our own and we shall do tolerably well  it is one of the finest problems in legislation and what has often engaged my thoughts whilst i followed that profession what the state ought to take upon itself to direct by the public wisdom and what it ought to leave with as little interference as possible to individual discretion nothing certainly can be laid down on the subject that will not admit of exceptions many permanent some occasional but the clearest line of distinction which i could draw whilst i had my chalk to draw any line was this that the state ought to confine itself to what regards the state or the creatures of the state namely the exterior establishment of its religion its magistracy its revenue its military force by sea and land the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat in a word to every thing that is truly and properly public to the public peace to the public safety to the public order to the public prosperity in it is preventive police it ought to be sparing of its efforts and to employ means rather few unfrequent and strong than many and frequent and of course as they multiply their puny politic race and dwindle small and feeble statesmen who know themselves will with the dignity which belongs to wisdom proceed only in this the superior orb and first mover of their duty steadily vigilantly severely courageously whatever remains will in a manner provide for itself but as they descend from the state to a province from a province to a parish and from a parish to a private house they go on accelerated in their fall they cannot do the lower duty and in proportion as they try it they will certainly fail in the higher they ought to know the different departments of things what belongs to laws and what manners alone can regulate to these great politicians may give a leaning but they cannot give a law  our legislature has fallen into this fault as well as other governments all have fallen into it more or less the once mighty state which was nearest to us locally nearest to us in every way and whose ruins threaten to fall upon our heads is a strong instance of this error i can never quote france without a foreboding sigh   scipio said it to his recording greek friend amidst the flames of the great rival of his country that state has fallen by the hands of the parricides of their country called the revolutionists and constitutionalists of france a species of traitors of whose fury and atrocious wickedness nothing in the annals of the phrenzy and depravation of mankind had before furnished an example and of whom i can never think or speak without a mixed sensation of disgust of horror and of detestation not easy to be expressed these nefarious monsters destroyed their country for what was good in it for much good there was in the constitution of that noble monarchy which in all kinds formed and nourished great men and great patterns of virtue to the world but though it is enemies were not enemies to it is faults it is faults furnished them with means for it is destruction my dear departed friend whose loss is even greater to the public than to me had often remarked that the leading vice of the french monarchy which he had well studied was in good intention illdirected and a restless desire of governing too much the hand of authority was seen in every thing and in every place all therefore that happened amiss in the course even of domestic affairs was attributed to the government and as it always happens in this kind of officious universal interference what began in odious power ended always i may say without an exception in contemptible imbecility for this reason as far as i can approve of any novelty i thought well of the provincial administrations those if the superior power had been severe and vigilant and vigorous might have been of much use politically in removing government from many invidious details but as every thing is good or bad as it is related or combined government being relaxed above as it was relaxed below and the brains of the people growing more and more addle with every sort of visionary specion the shiftings of the scene in the provincial the  became only preparatives to a revolution  the kngdom and the popular actings here ony the rehearsals of the terrible drama of the republic  tyranny and cruelty may make men justly wish the downfall of abused powers but i believe that no government ever yet perished from any other direct cause than it is own weakness my opinion is against an overdoing of any sort of administration and more especially against this most momentous of all meddling on the part of authority the meddling with the subsistence of the people  finis t gillet printer salisburysquare
