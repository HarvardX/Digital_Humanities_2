the tears of the muses in a conference between prince germanicus and a malcontent party  london printed for t ward near paternoster row mdccxxxvii  to the right honorable and publickspirited the president officers and committee of the society for encouragement of learning my lords and gentlemen lest it should be considered as a disregard of propriety when a poem of a satirical species is addressed to the patronage most distinguished for extent of humanity please to receive it as a poetical janus of whose opposite two faces the fairest and best drawn you will find to be panegyric  but on that side you were attached  and such devoted admirers of the life would with difficulty have been brought to allow a resemblance in the picture whereas on the side of the satire you could not possibly be parties concerned and were therefore best qualified to judge it impartially  yet since it is not by any merit of mine that you are so safe on the satirical quarter it was fit i should do something that might have room to expect your acknowledgment i have therefore declined any encomium on your generous society or on any of its particular members though to every reader not such it would have increased the delight of the poem  but you are such enemies to every kind of corruption that i apprehended the very appearance of an attempt at evading your judgment by engaging your generosity in my favor  in this situation there are preserved to you all the natural rights of the critic yet i am under no pain from the use you may make of that freedom for what candid writer would wish to escape a reproach where being sure of its justice he can be made but the wiser from effect of its severity and as to the more desirable reverse of the prospect no man is in danger of missing your approbation unless he has no where deserved it  the muses have used you too kindly not to expect your concern for the fate you will find em reduced to and to hear of your grief and good wishes in their behalf may from the knowledge they have of your consequence deserve to be thought little less than a balance for the neglect they are under from thousands  but to speak a plain truth without metaphor whatever advantage the poetical world would have derived from imaginary muses might be really an effect of some such confederate influence as yours in good earnest exerted  how many great and desirable changes in literate taste may we not reasonably expect from the associated prevalence of numbers united as you are upon the most generous principle in nature an unprofitable and voluntary pursuit of the benefit of others from effect of your own cost and labor  to instance in one the most obvious and easy of many how soon would our present low relish for dramatical buffoonery give way to your nobler example  persevering indeed with some necessary obstinacy to applaud and support good tragedy and comedy till what is now but mere reason might have the honor to be considered as fashion  by concurrence of your munificent endeavors but for one or two short winters  and yet what a national deliverance were this  with what effusion of unmercenary gratitude would it immortalize those generous conquerors who protecting the noblest of our youth from bad principles had by expelling meanspiritedness corruption and folly from our theaters intercepted them in their passage upward into situations whence their effects extended wider become in proportion more dreadful  whatever misconceptions have arisen with view to your more immediate and particular good purpose from its relation to the profession of a considerable body in trade whose interest may appear to be concerned not in the intention but effect of your establishment there will never i am persuaded lie any objection at all against this opener and easier road to the redemption of one branch of polite learning that stands in too visible need of your patronage  and now since all the motive i had to this distant address was the pleasure of professing in public my respect for so public a spirit you will forgive me that i withold from your knowledge a discovery of so little importance as the name of  my lords and gentlemen your devoted humble servant the author  advertisement to the reader not assuming such an air of authority as to give rules much less examples of writing the author in the following verses intended no more than an humble attempt from mere private curiosity upon an idea of satire which appeared to be new or not practiced  there is indeed something so like cruelty in the face of that species of poetry that it can only be reconciled to humanity by the general benevolence of its purpose attacking particulars for the public advantage  but methinks it gives up this end which is reformation when mistaking the means it attempts the good work with a hand either too rough or too gentle  in the first case it corrodes where it professes to cure in the second it is only sportive and wanton with what it should correct and discountenance  the medium perhaps might be found in an art like that of the painters who by opposing their shades against lights call out darkness into open distinction  so enormities which satirists would censure are but dimly and imperfectly marked till the defect admits disgrace from the neighborhood of perfection  then contempt stings more scarply in one by the compared admiration of the other besides that the censured are driven at the same time from their lat little refuge of vanity and can no longer recriminate upon the censurer his ill nature and malevolence of purpose  i am afraid there is another particular that calls aloud for the regard of the satirist and that is a reflection how far decency may make it a duty to abandon his personal self and insinuate opinions with modesty i mean from the mouth of some figurative speaker whom he ought to suppose of more consequence and whose sentiments the reader will be sure to receive with less scruple  there is a meaning in the very name of a poet that should seem to prescribe us this duty and the use and necessity of invention can never be more manifest than where the subject is so vidious as satire  who is there to say truth so unguilty of the follies of life that he dares in his own proper person stand out and justify the right he assumes of reproaching the conduct of others  reproof is too bitter a potion to be welcome from our sense of its use and the administering hand should be dear not disgustful if it would incline us to taste it with pleasure  i thought it but necessary to prefix this short note to an essay toward a new kind of satire i will not pretend to assert my own system because it is the most probable thing in the world that i should conceive a mistaken idea yet since by frequent attempts and miscarriages there are started at least some good hints he whose false steps have contributed either to the caution or direction of others may be said to have erred with good fortune  the tears of the muses a poem germanicus for love and empire born at once to govern kingdoms and adorn too good for greatness but that kings can bless too firm for fear but of his friends distress foretempring power by reasons generous plan to task the monarch meditates the man in a town grove whence dryads noise exclude and hush loud streets to sylvan solitude veiled by a verdant skreens incircling shade whose angly sides eight arching lights pervade friend to mankind their pensive favorite stood revolving previous plans of purposed good soft to his sight a female suppliant pressed in all the speaking marks of misery dressed downlookd relaxed of mien often bending low now stopping short now readvancing slow pardon she cried the intruding sighs of grief hope is the friendless wretches last relief germanicus who when distress draws nigh catches quick sorrow from the suffrers eye with gentle waft invites her backning fears and smiles the warmth of pity on her tears her while advancing heedful he surveyed chance stretched his eye to the remoter shade where dimly obvious from the bordring wood darkning the arches eight new phantoms stood all like the first thin forms of shivering woe wept all  in dumb sad solemn circly show think cried the approacher prostrate at his feet how sharp is insult and relief how sweet pity a wretched sisterhood of tears nine friendless mourners whom no comfort chears all arts were ours that polished life could gain but arts and polished life were ours in vain see what reward wished knowledge could impart where fool is fashion ignorance is art urged by derision and escaping hate we sad slow exiles seek some gentler fate to the bleak norths newrising coasts we go less cold than these amidst eternal snow glorys gay beams to whose felt warmth we run more than supply the absence of their sun there mourning merit cannot miss relief where watchful power supplants prevented grief famed for munificence thy princely hand singly absolves an unbestowing land ah save the friendless  help the wronged away too poor to go yet too unlovd to stay pay but wished passage from this cruel shore and never never will we trust it more scarce had the imploring accents voicd her prayer when the known sounds and recollected air through the false semblance natively conveyed to the charmed prince a speaking muse betrayed round while uncrediting the storied woe his curious eyes discovring glances throw the examined umbrage as he turned revealed each muse that every distant arch concealed waiting impatient for the finished tale quit your vain hope he cried by wants thin veil unhid to scape the reverence of my zeal who all your power through all your changes feel joyful he snatched the implorer from the ground then turning graceful bowed progressive round pressed their joint access undisguisd and gay and shone receptive of each effluent ray seated and circled by the beamy train their shapes resuming and themselves again tell me said he  ye soulinspiring nine ye living fires that give the great to shine who quickening regal courage into flame guide it by justice to immortal fame why would ye leave a land distinguished long for love of valor and for hate of wrong where freedom unrestrained her empire holds and legal monarchy new bloom unfolds he paused  and clio answering thus began perish pale malice  it oblitrates man where envy blasts the muse inspires in vain no human culture there extends its reign lost in malignity by civil hate virtues that clash with virtues curse a state stifled in faction arts unfriended sink or pigmyd into partial flattery shrink history must blush the wiles of spleen to pen and grace the bloodless broils of angry men smothered in self there breathes no public soul where separate strugglings general strength control there policys old generous straitness bends and shifting medium crawls to sidelong ends there fraud triumphant tempts the just to fall and every one mans gain is loss to all there love internal checking sighs that roam begins and ends all charity  at home each prayer appropriates one mans modest aim and humbly trusts to god the common claim crushed by contempt of praise exertion dies and public spirit laughed at shuns to rise thither when hope misleads the historic muse swift let her seek some scene of nobler views where guileless power no praise to graft ascribes where courage scorns deceit and duty  bribes where nervous meaning dares directly speak and crooked windings teach no truth to sneak it is found  for see  the icy pole dissolves honors new warmth with sunny force evolves there glows event there more than roman arms clash their prophetic thunders feared alarms there the pulsd public beats in every vein strong to one purpose lifts with equal strain no vile pretension there at titles aims no prideswoln lumber lazy lordship shames there shines the sword in honors guarded track no knighthood blushes on a misers back no bought emblaznings eminence efface no dirty dignity sublimes disgrace there heroes multiply and laboring fame grows busy  to record each sparkling name she ceased  the prince his patriot eyes withdrew weighed the long charge and wished it half untrue sighed at the waste domestic discord made and mourned unfriended arts by spleen betrayed then viewed the sisters reprepard to hear while erato soft sighing charmed his ear lured said the amorous muse from realms above pleased i descended on this land of love looked and approved and formed aerial schemes of heartfelt ties and hopes elusive dreams vainly proposed  each sex by each to mend and smooth the rugged paths of life with friend snatched at one sweet example new to fame urged its dear power the unhappier to reclaim misguided millions hailed the acknowledged charms and loved perfection when it blessed thy arms but ah too lost a length themselves were gone they worshipped and confessed  but still sinned on yet i vain hoper still new helps apply and ever failing would for ever try to slighted beauty would new powers impart and stretch the aided empire of the heart teach man that womans strength in softness lies teach woman why the modest charm the wise useless to either i from both remove moneys the inspiring muse of modish love over truth and passion avarice prevails all vows are venal and all sighs are sales interest and vanity and self disarm mutual esteem till neither sex can charm then blanc unnatral whims pervert desire attraction failing they exchange attire then mans laced lightness apes the ladys air and bluff big boldness masculates the fair with changing sexes loves lost motives change from wish to wish the shortlived passions range recorded constancy becomes romance and among millions two may love  by chance why should i then supporting present scorn stretch my too patient hope to times unborn when to the north where nature shines unstained confiding sexes love with faith unfeigned their native beauties in no clime excelled to rising force by conscious worth impelled while through the sparkling eye taught spirit breaks and the felt luster of their fame partakes the lover prince unwillingly believed faults which his nobler nature scarce conceived touched for the honor of the human heart his own glowed painful with ideal smart when loftier accents from urania broke and snatched his listening soul while science spoke from heavens unsounded depth she cried i stole angelic fire and formed a newtons soul taught him the secret walks of god to tread and twixt the starry worlds his spirit led all ether opening to a mortals eyes till earth sent colonies and held the skies what king for this magnificently just blessed him in life or dignified his dust what voted honors mark the aspirers race what thinking statues emulate his face he who immortalized his countrys name beyond ten thousand conqurors bounded fame he who to lift mankind new heavens displayed and every human breather nobler made did he to public fame all nature raise and is he poorly left to private praise in such a land ah what can arts expect what claim has hopeless science but neglect o fate of wintry worth by climate crossed budding untimely to be nipd in frost newton has multiplied the suns  yet pours in vain the light of all their orbs on ours when will the incurious courts for which he found new worlds find will to trace an old one round what promised pension ships the unshaken soul to dare discovry and ungloom the pole what coasting keel indenting southern strands starts the long shores of cloudbenighted lands no annual bounty persevering kind draws the dark veil that covers half mankind what regal influnce easing learnings birth now adds new stars to heaven or arts to earth who sows munificence to root up sloth and call forth harvests of eternal growth hail to the land where war makes science room where realms from deserts rise and ruins bloom where conquest spreading to embrace distress lets loose ambition not to waste but bless there power inverts destruction into birth and the prolific sword empeoples earth there desolation fruitful in decay fades into opulence and strengthens sway there ports unnative indrawn seas confine and climbing streams over channeld mountains shine there public splendour swallows private pride and claims which all men share in all men guide there art rewarded strains excited skill till dazzling wonders widning empire fill the fierce free tartar sees the tartar taught grins at advancing rule and pants for thought then in long link new nations forward draw and the drained wilds of nature crowd to law hail promised land  all now that seems severe is  that removing hence we leave you here urania stopped and bowed  the prince whose heart inly confessed the power of cherished art nobly approving praise so justly warm smiled conscious of his inborn right to charm next rose terpsichore  melodious muse soft her first accents like descending dews sweet and slowswelling till in livelier sound gay to the ravished ear quick transports bound timed to the tuneful voice each trembling tree strained its tugged roots and labored to be free warmed through the wakning stone the sculptured ear of every starting statue seemed to hear air caught and lengthening back the mazy notes curls while the undulating music floats earth listening to inhale harmonious pain sighed it in soft vibration back again pardon a mourning muse that leaves with tears the land that loved germanicus endears but ah what toils what anguish shall thou bear what endless labor must oerload thy care ere thy lost views a taste like thine inspire and sparkling kingdoms catch thy manly fire near operas fribling fugues what muse can stay where wordless warblings winnow thought away music when purpose points her not the road charms to betray and softens to corrode empty of sense the soulseducing art thrills a slow poison to the sickening heart soft sinks idea dissolute in ease and all lifes feeble lesson is to please spirit and taste and generous toil take flight and lazy love and indolent delight and low luxurious weariness of pain lull the lost mind  and all its powers are vain hence to the realms of fame ye muses fly there to the drums big beat the heart leaps high there sighing flutes but tempring martial heat teach distant pity and revenge to meet the manly pipe there scorns the expanded shakes that wind waved nothings till attention aches there now concurring keys and chords increase the hearts soft social ties and cherish peace then trumpets answring trumpets shrill and far swell to the sounding wind the inspiring war there the roused soul in exercise grows strong nor pools to puddly foulness stopped too long strengthening and strengthened by the poets fire there musics meaning voice exalts desire there harmony not drowns but quickens thought and fools unfeeling words by notes are caught soft sighed the prince for suffering music pained and polyhymnia rising warm complained deign to be told impartial generous wise why fruitless eloquence indignant flies galled at lost time in cases vainly cleared at truths untouching and at sounds unheard blushing while oratorys laboring strains on praedecision waste derided pains and flourished periods to no purpose fine like suns in deserts without notice shine hating grave insult i disdain to stay where talk but trifles and where tropes but play if serious rhetric sweats where sneering mutes hastening the hurried question crop disputes if law sells argument yet forms must reign and custom pleading equity is vain if the dark pulpits short mysterious art lifts faith to heaven and damns the moral heart bear me dishonored god to some plain state where truth in spite of aye and no is weight where pleas of right a reasoning bench persuade and justice scorns in precedent to trade where no bold blasphemy would faith enslave but humble honest doubting works can save euterpe watchful of her sisters close snatched her sunk cadence and impatient rose pleasure she cried is mine mine the gay skill to paint the fancy and adorn the will but where dry avarice

fiery youths in whirling chariots rolled then the watched signal bad the rank disjoin and rushing wheels dissolved the breaking line strained to the expanded whips impulsive sound light leaped the exulting axles over the ground twixt crowding nations partial panting gay the praised plumed hero skimd the lessening way the smoking steeds obeyed the watchful rein and winding warlike swept the
