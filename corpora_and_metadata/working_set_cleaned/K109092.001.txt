of assize oyer and terminer in the courts literary etc etc fetterlane oct        preface as far as this interesting trial has gone it has been conducted with that rigid impartiality which so particularly distinguishes the various courts of british jurisprudence  how it may terminate can be known only to the ruler of these great events indeed from the contrariety of weighty evidence already advanced and the cloud of testimonies yet to be adduced it would be highly indecorous to indulge even a conjecture upon the probability of its decision  the court have wisely resolved to sit without further adjournment in order now to receive at their bar the evidence of the first political and literary characters against whom exceptions were so ingeniously taken by council but which however have all been most constitutionally overruled these being gone through the sage and learned polonius in person will sum up the whole evidence and after delivering a solemn and eloquent charge from the bench receive from the grand inquest that verdict which no doubt will soon tend to the complete administration of literary justice by setting this great question at rest for ever  vortigern and rowena a comitragedy pending the distinguished inquest under which the fact is now trying whether the newly discovered drama is or is not from the pen of shakspeare it would be highly indecorous to hazard a single conjecture upon it  the editor therefore will content himself with merely giving a faithful transcript of all that has been successively recorded on this important subject in that fashionable intelligencer the morning herald only remarking that whatever may be the final issue of the trial the passages selected from the piece itself by the several voters pro and con must remain indelible proofs of the discriminative taste of those who have here so characteristically enrolled themselves in defense of our belles lettres  the following is the paragraphical chain by which this great literary concern has been brought into such general notice viz  paragraph the shakspeare discoveries said to be made by the son of mr ireland of norfolkstreet are the tragedy of lear and another entitled vortigern and rowena now first brought to light and both in the bards own handwriting  in the same chest are said to have been also found an antique melange of love letters  professions of faith  billet doux  locks of hair  and family receipts  the only danger respecting faith in the discovery seems to be from the indiscretion of finding too much if poor chatterton had contented himself with drawing literary treasure in moderation from the monkish chest of rowley his own inventive genius had probably remained unknown  another mr irelands tragedy of vortigern whether sterling or fictitious is to go to drury lane mr sheridan says it is the finest play that shakspeare ever wrote  not that he has had leisure yet to read it  but he had it from an authority as classical and unquestionably as his own judgment viz the solemn assurance of the great lord salisbury himself a critic only six removes by lineal descent from mr sheridans own immortal burleigh  for the morning herald mr editor your shakspeare correspondents know but little of what is going forward in the mine of discovery lord sir if they wish to get at the whole truth they must dip deep into the old chest as the ancients did into the pierean well  indeed they are not correct even in what they have stated for instance  the precious lock of hair how comes it they were so ignorant as not to know that mr justice colic the first hair merchant in the universe has critically inspected it and regardless of the sacred head of fiction from whence it was shorn he as a man of business could only be brought to say that if the whole string were as good as the sample it was worth no more in the trade than  s  d an ounce  the pointed distich on the envelope however as his grace of leeds declares is worth a million  here it is ere age with twinge your nerves does shocke catch love like time by the forelocke by which our annotators will no doubt tell us that the warwickshire wag quaintly inculcates the youthful libertinism of  catch as catch can  among the more recent treasures are a motheaten under petticoat an undoubted original mr malone who with all his ability knows but little about petticoats says this could be no part of the paraphernalia of the immortal bard  but mrs piozzi and the whole blue stocking club are decidedly of a contrary opinion and that for the best of all feminine reasons viz because miss hathaway when she became mrs shakspeare never failed to wear the breeches  we have also mr boswells authority for this amongst other domestica facta of the poet the next curiosity for the amateurs is a love valentine surrounded according to ancient usage with hearts cupids doves and darts and in the center a typifying figure of a cock without a comb according to antique spelling with this inexplicable anagram if to my arms you will fondlye roame despighte of dadde i will cut your comb w s  from this some of the inspecting literati are cruel enough to infer that shakspeare must have had an intriguc with the daughter of his ancient enemy john a coombe  the undoubted ancestor of the present opposition alderman who has the honor of bearing that distinguished name  the last morceau i shall treat you with at this time is selected from the receipts viz a recipee how to make a goodly plumbe pudinge  even mr steevens admits the unquestionable authenticity of this valuable addendum to the cullnary art by declaring that shakspeare could not endure the stones of plumbs which from setting his teeth on edge were called jar raisins and literally gives an appropriate citation of the following passage from the poets own words which will certainly be received as the best glossary to his own plumb pudding sylvus  put dates enough into the bag but dearest chuck i prithee make me geldings of the plumbes  you shall have further documents equally important and authentic in a few days from mr editor  yours a modern antiquarian  paragraph we have it from high authority that the merits of the great question respecting the originality of the newly discovered play are put into a train of investigation before a literary court of enquiry which cannot fail of the most candid and judicious decision  it will be managed under the auspices of an illustrious personage who fortunately unites in his singular character all the critical and judicial talents requisite for so solemn a disquisition  march  0 to correspondents  the procession on opening the literary court to try the important question whether vortigern and rowena is or is not from the pen of shakspeare is intended for tomorrows herald  paragraph march    vortigern and rowena it is with much concern we announce that the procession preparatory to opening the literary court of inquest to try whether this drama is or is not written by shakspeare was obliged to be suspended till wednesday by an unpleasant accident signor delpini that man of mighty mouth who was to have walked as champion to a prodigious courtier unfortunately dislocated his jaw bone in practicing an aristocratic grin in compliment to his illustrious patron  however the sieur follet almost equally great in the happy distortions of the human countenance has kindly undertaken this interesting part and to be ready in it that day at noon when this introductory spectacle will certainly take place and our readers be no longer kept in a state of anxious expectancy  march    for the morning herald vortigern and rowena a comitragedy yesterday morning at eleven oclock the several officers and other great personages assembled at the hum mums in covent garden and from thence marched to the literary court in norfolkstreet in the following state procession viz  four mutes with their fore fingers placed on their lips  a bronze of signor delpini  in his happiest style of face  the lock of hair  of miss hathaway afterward the happy  mrs shakspeare  borne by mr justice colic hair merchant  his train supported by an unlicensed hairdresser dishevelled and without powder preceded by a banner dedicated  to wiggism  the chief cook of the crown and anchor tavern with cheeks a la blaze carrying  on a trencher  the book of family receipts six trunk makers two and two  the antique trunk  covered with assskin still perfect but surcharged with moth black beetles and cobwebs  the flappets of the covering supported by the six senior annotators on the immortal bard and their train upheld by an equal number of farce writers  a banner following inscribed  sacred to fiction  the prompter of drury lane gagged  the dramatic faith of mr sheridan  delicately concealed in a snowdrop  and borne by mr kemble riding on an elephant  over whom waved a streamer displaying the word management  a groupe of spirits  blue red black and gray  a waxen semblance of  the mighty burleigh  his banner advanced before displaying  three dried neats tongues  the family arms with their motto  eloquence  the danish chamberlain polonius  with his white wand of office and his train supported by  three opera eunuchs  the sieur follet  in the armor of hamlets ghost bearing the  club of hercules as his champion  an embossed moneybag  with licenses at any price  inscribed in golden characters  six fiddlers with broken bows  six female singers weeping  banner  sacred to harmony  sir fretful  carried in torture on his own wheel  the bluestocking club  slipshod and garterd below knee  vortigern  represented by mr kiddy davis as the only gentleman of either theater skilled in the etiquette of saxon dignities supported by the under harlequin os drury  mr davis making it a special request that his trainbearer might be one who well understood trap  dramatic performers  walking in pairs after the antique fashion of  entering noahs ark  scenters etc etc etc  the august procession entered the court about one when the commission was opened in due form the interesting particulars of which we hope to record on friday next  first days trial vortigern and rowena a comitragedy as soon as the court was opened with all due formalities the danish chamberlain lord polonius arose and gracefully made an obeisance to himself in a spacious mirror which was instantly returned by a figure of similar dignity from this state reflector dexterously placed in the front of the chair that his lordship might have the judicial advantage of seeing what he himself was about which no other person in the court could ever know or possibly divine  the sieur follet as chamberlains grand champion then gigantically advanced and after throwing down his gauge and thrice brandishing his herculean club affixed a written proclamation to its butt when placing the smaller end on the bridge of his nose the following preliminary challenge became visible to all around viz if any one present dare gainsay that the lord polonius is the most witty most wise most valorous most eloquent most disinterested most beloved most puissant most chaste let him come forth and i the unworthy champion of that mighty lord will tell him that he lies in his teeth and from my furious wrath the lord deliver his miserable carcass    here an enraged musician indignantly advanced with an intent as was supposed to take up the glove but was prevented in being humanely knocked down by one of the beefcaters  a nod mandatory was now given from the chair as a cue to the principal harlequin who waving his dagger of lath over a richly inlaid tablet a pair of folding doors of ophir flew open and discovered an irradiating glory of ethereal blue and gold darting its transcendent beams on the title page of an antique volume in quarto curiously filligreed and fretted with moths and earwigs and entitled vortigern and rowena  on harlequin waving his lath a second time a light colored cloud gently descended to a soft strain of aeolian measure which opening displayed a scrowl with this inscription  ye of the school of nature as of art draw near and faithful verdict give between the sacred memory of your immortal bard and his accusers by whom he now stands charged as the villifier of his own fair fame in penning the comitragedy now before you peruse therefore this dramatic record and your several judgments pronounced thereon by selecting severally a passage from the same which shall be enregistered in affirmation or negation of that literary fact which the majority of your suffrages must finally decide approach   the instantaneous pressing forward of the literati cognoscenti diletanti etc etc of both sexes to inspect the record was so great and violent that it reached even the chair of state like an electric shock when polonius rising up in dignified dismay signified to his officers by the pale vibration of his nostrils that it was his mighty pleasure the court should be adjourned this was effected by the talismatic sword of harlequin as soon as possible but not till a few pushing characters of the literary jurors had fixed on the following passages and enregistered their votes thereon viz  passages selected as suffrages on the first days trial viz i  lady chapter c  b  ll  look what a shape limbs fondly fashioned

comical disfigurements  page     not guilty second days trial on resuming the grand literary court on saturday order was happily restored by an emanation of that official wisdom with which the lord polonius is so peculiarly gifted a golden padlock it seems had been most delicately affixed that morning to the antique clasps of the comitragedy this at first naturally excited a little surprise but it was soon dispelled by the very graceful delivery of the following state paper from the courtly hand of mr kiddy davis of the theater royal covent garden whom the manager has kindly lent as saxon representative in waiting of the heroic vortigern  copy  by authority  it is ordered that no person of what rank quality or degree soever shall presume to take any part share or interest in or give any public opinion on the sacred drama of vortigern and rowena until such person shall have been first duly invested with a two guinea stamped license under our hand and seal on pain and peril of being prosecuted with the utmost rigor as a vagabond under the wholesome statute entitled the vagant act so wisely instituted for the correction of such state abuses  signed polonius counter signed follet g c  this was allowed by all the knowing ones present to be a thou ht of the most profound polity and equal to any thing recorded of the sagacious house of burleigh it naturally branched itself into a twofold good viz   as a touchstone of insurance as to the qualification and ability of voters   dly  which his lordships liberality must mark as the principal consideration  it instantly made the literary inquest more select tended to expede the proceedings of the court and thus patically expose the endless duration of hastings impeachment licenses were accordingly taken out by those who were prepared for this voluntary levy and those who were not were very decorously kicked out of court  another decree of a subordinate kind likewise passed viz to change the suffrage annexed to the chosen passages from guilty and not guilty to genuine and  not genuine  the vulgar repetition of the sound of guilt etc being sometimes observed to raise a demiblush of confusion on the official cheek  the solemn business of the day then commenced  the following is the list of licenced voters and their selected passages enregistered at this sitting which we are promised in time for tomorrows publication viz   marg ans  h   earl h  we   hon mrs st  n  pe   mrs fiiz  t   lord ch  r  0 marquis tow  d   the clerk in court has directed us to make an frratum in our first days report on the

the tagus write washed his fair in the tagus to admire it in its glass etc   this emendation is unquestionably due to common decency as well as common sense the word facre as a saxon derivative unfortunately signifies sallow it cannot therefore be supposed by those in any habits with the worthy member for yarmouth that a gentleman naturally conscious of so fair a face himself could have selected a passage thus personally repugnant to his own taste and feelings  vi  marg  ne of an  p  chapter oh she would enacte you from earliest youth scenes to bewitche mens eyes and ears and hearts
