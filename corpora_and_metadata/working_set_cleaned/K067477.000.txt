the battiad  canto the first  london printed for g smith near temple bar price sixpence mdccl  the battiad canto the first awake my muse whatever thy name may be or sprung from heavenly seed or low degree whether thou equalst garths majestic rage or crawlst like blackmore through the drowsy page much it imports the business to explain that shook the puny state of warwick lane then thriceinvokd expand thy ravens wing vast is the task for thou have much to sing  ok to thee i dedicate my lays though no degree thy equal merit raise yet shall your skill to latest times endure like graduates often you kill like them you sometimes cure twas now the day when fellows fellows meet to talk of weighty matters then to eat mean while the patient from his tyrant free inhales fresh health and lives without a fee first battus came deepread in worldly art whose tongue never knew the secrets of his heart in mischief mighty though but mean of size and like the tempter ever in disguise see him with aspect grave and gentle tread by slow degrees approach the sickly bed then at his club behold him altered soon the solemn doctor turns a low buffoon and he who lately in a learned freak poachd every lexicon and published greek still madly emulous of vulgar praise from punchs forehead wrings the dirty bays but who is that whose gogling eye balls scowl like the full orbs of the cecropian fowl hail pocus hail  ye midwives sound his fame ye nurses sing in lullabies his name it is his to ease from pangs the laboring wife and tug the little offspring into life as blind tiresias on a luckless day lost his first sex as ancient poets say so purring pocus once scarce known to fame of an unskilful leach a matron grave became him granta saw and bade her learned vest bind his broad shoulders and embrace his chest yet never quaffd he of her sacred stream no muse inspiring waits his morning dream the scarlet robe its heavy wearer mocks so sits a racers saddle on an ox as he passed by a numerous tribe succeeds thick as in standing corn the purple weeds names you could hardly think did ever exist but that you see them in the college list slowfooted the epithet swiftfooted given to achilles who was famous for slaying mankind is by being reversed a most high compliment on the learned gentleman to whom it is applied ad  ms hobbled in the throng and d  d a giant spectre slouchd along then br  n marched onward deep in physic leer and chattring ch  ny wriggled in the rear each aesculapian sage assumes his seat when battus thus forestalls the promised treat ere yet we on the choicest viands dine ere the deep glass be died with generous wine think think my friends what mischiefs threat our state now ruin perches on our collegegate there graduate schomberg for his answer stands examined thrice his entrance loud demands but by yon pile where on the chisseld stone the wellwrought madman seems to live and groan here on clean straw sequestered in the  the patriot sage and bard immortal dwells i swear my soul detests the hated league and hell if heaven should fail shall second my intrigue sooner shall rivers to their springs return or warwick lane at sickly seasons mourn sooner shall roses bloom upon the main fish sport in woods nay i turn the edtor is in doubt with himself whether it should not be wig for battus is as apt to turn his wig for the entertainment of his company as his coat for his own private emolument whig again than schomberg in our college find a place this interdicting hand shall crush his race what though he claim admittance as his right the power of numbers makes a raven white our almamater shall in vain protest it is mine to make her bow her haughty crest down down with came and isis reverend schools shall we proceed on dull exploded rules now welcome those on lemans banks who feed the fat batavian and the sons of tweed these in full swarms shall all our college fill and claim an equal privilege to kill while i superior to the rest shall fit a lectrer mimic editor and wit nor ask what cause inflames my stubborn hate my settled purpose is as fixed as fate reject our claimant nor his threatnings fear ourself through laws wild maze will guide you clear till every court my deep address shall own what  are your battus arts so little known he said and paused the midwife reared his size rolling from side to side his an epithet that so much exalted the beauty of homers juno must no doubt pass an high compliment on the grace of feature of our incomparable midwife oxlike eyes and while the scarlet heroes he addressed thick eructations half his speech suppressed by aedepol it was the custom of the roman ladies to swear by castor as the men did by hercules an asseveration by the temple of pollux was made use of by both sexes and therefore aptly put in the mouth of the midwife aedepol my battus here i swear i undismayed with thee will greatly dare with thee i will misinterpret meanings strain or wade through miry roads of deep chicane as hounds together in one couple tied as pope and devil sitting side by side as mountebank and quaint jackpudding join so ever mix thy friendly name with mine nor think i have idly slept you know my trade is natures dark recesses to invade through alleys groping lo i set to view the affidavit of an halfstarvd halfstarvd jew pocus by his great skill in the occult sciences found out a jew in a certain corner of the town and got him to make an affidavit that schomberg was born abroad which was true in fact for he never saw england till he was two or three years old and in consequence of not being a native was incapable of being admitted fellow at least this was the joint opinion of battus and pocus jew and did not i my critic skill display see my epistle upon o and a while schomberg was carrying on his bill of naturalization an anonymous letter was written to the sp  r of the h  e of c  mm  ns purporting that schomberg intended to impose upon the par  t for whereas he of late spelt his name with an o he or his father used formerly to write it with an a the midwife is for many reasons suspected to be the author of this letter for among others two witnesses are ready to depose upon oath that he can write o and a man haughty man indebted to the brutes assumes that name which best his nature suits heroes are lions in an human shape a fox the statesman and the beau an ape then to reward the yearnings of my soul salute your midwife by the name of mole nor think i will ever from your banners fly i schomberg hate nor know the reason why perhaps too often his busy sire i meet that cursed chariot rolls through every street perhaps  i know not what inflames my rage but youthful ardor thaws my frozen age sleepless i lie i foam i toss i rave mad as the priestess in apollos cave let heberden his views by truth direct let reeve oppose an obstinate elect let leatherland be stubborn to his trust fainthearted wretch who dares not be unjust ourselves sit here above the dread of law each powerful fellow is a grim bashaw though when from hence he drives his painted wain he shrinks into his nothingness again then hear your pocus my associates dear drive schomberg hence nor yield to idle fear so childs and batsons shall your triumphs tell and every parish toll her passing bell then gentle brethren give your kind assent he ceased the rabble roared content content loud was the din  thus prouling out for food the cackling mother leads the waddling brood if ought disturb them all together cry and the hoarse clangor echoes through the sky goose answers goose with dissonance of voice and sarums steeples catch the grating noise the end of the first canto shortly will be published the battiad canto the second
