proceedings in the house of commons on the slave trade and state of the negroes in the west india islands with an appendix  by philip francis esquire  house of commons may         resolved that from and after the first day of january      it shall not be lawful to import any african negroes into any british colonies or plantations  london printed for caroline ridgway yorkstreet st jamesssquare       may  0      it was thought desirable by some persons who have the cause of the negroes seriously at heart that these proceedings should be speedily published they have therefore been collected hastily in the midst of many pressing avocations the substance of what passed is carefully preserved the form if that were of any moment may be mended hereafter  proceedings in parliament etc house of commons monday april         in a committee of the whole house  mr wilberforce moved that the chairman be instructed to move for leave to bring in a bill to prevent the farther importation of slaves into thebritish colonies in the west indies  in the course of this debate  mr francis said he should have contented himself with giving his vote for the motion but for some considerations which were personal to him and by which he thought himself particularly called upon to deliver his opinion on the present occasion not implicitly by a vote but expressly by declaration he believed he was not very likely to be suspected of receiving with special favor and partiality any measure introduced and recommended from the other side of the house that in his own situation in private life every motive by which the conduct of men is usually determined was united on one side and powerfully pressed upon him to engage him to take part this night against his opinion connections of every sort friends who were dear to him and who thought their fortunes were at stake solicitations the most urgent from persons to whom he was bound by many ties and possibly the prospect of advantage to himself or to his family at a future day to be forfeited or preserved all these were in one scale and nothing in the other but the justice of the cause and the protection of creatures who would never know that he had endeavored to serve them or whose gratitude could never reach him that he did not state these circumstances for ostentation or as a claim to merit but to fortify his cause by showing that his opinion was sincere sir i do not intend to go far into the general subject if the undisputed state of facts if the clear and able argument delivered by the honorable gentleman who takes the lead in this business has not carried conviction along with it i must conclude that truth and reason on this subject have no access to the human mind many gentlemen indeed have asserted what they have by no means established and what upon the whole i utterly disbelieve that this trade is profitable but no man has yet had the courage to affirm or even to insinuate that it is not criminal the question then is not whether the trade be criminal but in what degree is it a crime of the highest guilt in morals or is it in practice capable of palliation will it admit of an excuse no sir i declare upon my honor and my conscience none i pass by the traffic as it is conducted on the coast of africa the temptation you give to one human creature to make a property of another and to sell him to perpetual slavery i take no notice of the miseries it produces in that country remember only that whatever they are you are answerable for them all you create the market and it is the market that constitutes the demand and produces the supply i shall not insist on the horrors of the middle passage you do well to pass over them with disregard the most determined mind the most obdurate heart if it be human could not listen to the evidence on that subject without torture i take these creatures in that which is stated to be their best situation at their landing in the islands at their arrival in the land of promise where they are instantly to find relief from their sufferings where in return for a moderate degree of labor a tolerable mode of existence is provided for them you say you have paid for them that they subsist at your expense and that you have a right to their labor be it so on that principle let us see how they are treated in considering the state of slavery in the west indies the object that instantly strikes my mind with a force and conviction to which the evidence of special facts hardly makes an addition is the power of corporal punishment allotted as i find it i do not ask you to inquire in what manner this power is exercised but how it is disposed of and to whom it is trusted and then to determine what must be the effect of it they know nothing of the human constitution who have not observed that power of every sort of one man over another has a natural tendency to deprave and corrupt the mind the moment i hear of such power uncontrouled in any hand i conclude that the depravity is unlimited the actual exercise of it in the infliction of punishment assuredly introduces that worst and most odious of all disorders in the moral system personal cruelty the truth of these principles is acknowledged by the spirit and caution of our penal laws in every other instance by the care they take in all criminal proceedings to separate the interest from the judgment and the judgment from the execution they will not suffer such characters and powers to be united in one person nor are they united in any civilized society upon earth except in our west india islands what are the usual offenses imputed to negroes in ninetynine instances out of a hundred they are either idleness or theft they do not work hard enough to satisfy the taskmaster and why they should work at all i know not or they steal provisions the thing they can eat is the only thing worth their stealing food is the only object of theft which it is in their power to conceal or that could possibly do them any service consider the risk they run the horrible punishments they suffer when detected and then you may conceive in what manner they are fed but in the consideration of these offenses who is the offended party  the negro driver  who is the judge of the fact the driver  who awards the punishment the driver  who inflicts it the driver with his own hand but how captain giles of the army says that the punishment by whipping though with fewer lashes given is more severe and cruel than that of the army because of the size of the whip captain hall of the navy says that in barbados and the leeward islands the treatment of the negroes on the plantations was inhuman that the punishments inflicted were very shocking to persons not used to see them much more so than on board a man of war the field slaves he has seen a great many were generally marked with the whip this is the mode of punishment what is likely to be the degree of it an angry man determines the penalty an offended judge inflicts it and he perhaps by office by habit and occupation one of the lowest if not worst of our species if you cannot have an indifferent judge of the offenses of these wretches at least let there be a cold indifferent executioner it is a horrible truth that when once the lash is lifted by an angry man with despotic power over the object his rage is inflamed by every stroke he gives the cries and writhings of the creature are called resistance even his patience is called sulkiness even his sufferings are an offense the decrees of passion are executed by passion admitting the power to be necessary is there any protection against the abuse of it have the negroes any shelter have they any appeal is there a law to deter is there a magistrate to resort to  no sir none at all mr terry who was many years an overseer in grenada says that he has known slaves punished by managers severely for trifling faults that they durst not complain to the owner for fear of worse treatment that he has known them punished by the owner for so doing and sent back though their complaint was just that field slaves usually bear the marks of the whip and that he never heard that a slave complained to a magistrate of his owner manager overseer or attorney that he has known the same person both attorney manager and doctor on one estate that he never knew a planter or manager interfere with anothers treatment of his slaves that food is the general object of theft among slaves and at the hazard of their lives that an overseer on the estate where he was mr coghlan threw a slave into the boiling cane juice who died in four days he was not punished otherwise than by replacing the slave and being dismissed the service was told of this by the owners son the carpenter and many slaves on the estate has heard it often  against all the allegations and all the arguments on this subject one general answer is usually stated and supposed to be conclusive the negroes are our property we have paid high prices for them our profits depend upon the care we take of them if we are bad men at least we understand our interest too well to destroy or disable the instruments by which alone our estates are made of any value to us in the first place sir the proprietor is not in general the person who exercises the power in question if he were it might be fair to presume that the consideration of his true interest would be some restraint upon his passions i fear that in general it would not be effective many of the west india proprietors i know are men of as much honor and humanity as are to be found in any other rank of life but they reside in england concerning the management of their estates they have no other evidence but the information of their overseers concerning the treatment of their slaves they have nothing to judge by but the amount produce of their labor if the returns are abundant it is not likely that the owners should be much disposed to inquire into abuses by which their profits do not appear to be diminished they hear no complaints they live happily themselves and conclude that all is well captain hall says he believes the slaves suffered from the owners absence because it was the business of the overseer for his own credit to make as much sugar as possible to do this he must work slaves to the utmost it being no concern of his whether they died or not but i deny that the principle so assumed and relied on namely that slaves will be well treated because it is the interest of an owner to take care of his property is conclusive in this case as it would be in the case of inanimate property all the protection which you can expect from the principle and it goes no farther is that corporal punishment shall not be inflicted to the hazard of life and limb that the slave shall not be disabled from performing the task allotted to him within that limitation the lash may be inflicted with the most shocking capricious severity provided it does not essentially injure the property of the owner but to secure even that degree of protection he ought never to trust the lash out of his own hand he delegates his power to another but not the interest which you say is to govern the exercise of it still the negroes are your property so are your horses and of more value too if price and value are the same see how those noble useful animals are treated by coachmen and others every day in the streets every night at the doors of the crowded assemblies of this town before the eyes of their masters and mistresses and even at the hazard of their lives i have been often witness to these abominable scenes of riotous or passionate cruelty did you ever hear of a coachman punished or even dismissed for cruel treatment of his horses  one would think at the first view of the subject that a plantation once properly stocked with male and female negroes would supply itself without farther importation i wish it were so for then i should conclude that the condition of the negroes was tolerable at least there is nothing in the climate or soil to counteract the propagation of negroes in the islands any more than in africa where they multiply to excess in all other countries the laboring part of the people are in general the most prolific why not in the west indies excessive labor and scanty unwholesome food would be sufficient to check population any where but the fact is that the planters do not think it their interest to encourage it captain hall tells you that in the british islands breeding is not thought desirable they rather thought it a misfortune to have pregnant women or even young slaves they esteemed the charge of rearing a child to maturity more troublesome and greater than buying a slave fit for work and it was not uncommon for them to give away a child of two years old as you would a a puppy from a litter has heard an overseer of some consequence express this opinion it was in fact his system to prevent population as far as in his power and he understood this to be a general system so little care was taken of infants that mothers deemed it a misfortune to have children after the month they were sent to field labor with their child upon their backs and so little time afforded them to attend to its wants that he has seen a woman seated to give suck to her child roused from that situation by a severe blow from the cart whip  mr terry says that while a manager he never received any direction about attention to pregnant women or children has heard managers say it was cheaper to buy african slaves than to breed that they wished the children to die for they lost much of the mothers work during their infancy  captain ross says he has seen a negro woman flogged with ebony bushes so that the skin of her back was taken off down to her heels she was then turned round and flogged from her breast down to her waist and in consequence he saw her afterward walking upon all four and unable to get up  such is the treatment of women slaves and in that state too which of all others would excite pity in the most callous heart that still had one human sensation left in it but we are told that although possibly facts of this atrocious nature may have happened in the early periods of the west india settlements no such instances occur at present that the government of the islands in this respect is greatly improved that good laws have been made that they are carefully executed and that upon the whole the situation of the negroes is considerably mended and grows every day more and more tolerable perhaps it may be so on some particular plantations but in general i do not believe the assertion to be true the operation of habits and principles is permanent and uniform the check created by good laws can only be temporary and occasional until they have acted long enough to effect a change in the manners of the people it would have been natural to conclude that while these inquiries were going on in england and while the attention of the nation was so particularly directed to the subject as it has been lately some restraint would have been laid on practices which it was well known had excited universal indignation here one fact which i shall state will be sufficient to show you what you have to expect from the probable effect of these pretended laws and regulations made in the islands for the protection of the slaves it is not more than eighteen months ago that i read in the jamaica gazette an account of a female slave of the age of fifteen flogged by one of these drivers till she fell senseless to the ground in this state she was dragged by the legs to a place which they call an hospital till her mangled flesh was torn completely from her bones in the hospital she died the villain was tried for his life and honorably acquitted by twelve of his peers every one of whom i have a right to conclude and for my own part have no sort of doubt would have done exactly the same on what pretense was he acquitted  why sir it was said or pretended that the girl was his property that it could not be his intention because it was not his interest to take away her life  sir i have given you but a very slight specimen indeed of the horrors with which these books are filled i will not argue the question whether we ought to endeavor to put an end to them or not the very question is a disgrace to us in such a case i will not attempt to do that which many personal considerations would have led me to do to endeavor to compound with my duties and to compromise between extreme right and extreme wrong i give my vote for abolition i declare my opinion i would do more if i could were i to have done otherwise i do not believe that i could have enjoyed happiness in this world i am sure i should not have deserved it hereafter  house of commons tuesday march         motion for taking into consideration the report of the bill for the abolition of the slave trade at a time to be limited  sir william young  general smith  mr francis mr speaker i really had no thoughts of taking part in this debate my opinion of the slave trade is sufficiently known but i confess i have not patience to hear what i have heard this day without feeling indignation and endeavoring to express it the honorable general introduced his speech with premising that he had no property in the west indies nor any connection with those who had allow me in my turn to declare that although i have no property in the islands i once was intimately connected with some who possessed a great deal the person i allude to had no relations but in my family her personal fortune was very considerable the succession to the greatest part of it would undoubtedly have gone as in justice it ought to have done to her own relations to whom she always expressed as in common gratitude to me she ought to have felt the warmest affection why was that just and reasonable expectation on our part disappointed because i did not yield to her earnest and repeated solicitations to vote against the abolition of the slave trade or at least to be neuter i voted and spoke for it and she disposed of her fortune accordingly the honorable general says that we are very much at our ease while we are voting away the property of others that we go home to the enjoyment of our dinners and our beds without thinking on the misery and ruin we are to bring on a great body of our fellow subjects well sir of me at least it cannot be said that while i neglected or sacrificed their interests i was careful of my own i acted with my eyes open for i was distinctly threatened with the consequence and yet i went home that day with appetite to my dinner as i shall today and slept soundly that night had i done otherwise i should have lost the quiet mind without which neither can the luxuries of the table gratify the palate nor the bed of down give repose forgive me sir for speaking of myself in this manner the facts i allude to are well known to every one who knows me my object in referring to them is to obtain credit for my sincerity in the part i now take even with those who may undervalue my judgment the honorable baronet in vehement language and passionate terms complains of the enormous loss and injury which the west india proprietors and planters are to suffer by this bill without any compensation i deny it as a fact but if it were true let them begin by entitling themselves to redress before they expect that the house will listen to their complaint i answer them with the authority and in the language of english equity ever since equity was known in england do justice before you demand it non feret aequum qui petit iniquum as long as you are guilty of an enormous injustice on the very ground and subject matter of your pretended wrongs the court will not listen to you even though it were true that you had some equitable claim to compensation or relief the honorable baronet says that the preamble to the bill in asserting that the slave trade is contrary to the principles of justice and humanity is a cruel mockery of the sufferings of persons in his situation and that it adds insult to wrong the honorable general on the other hand says that it is nothing but the truth that it was true a hundred years ago and has continued so to this hour and therefore i suppose he concludes it is too trite and notorious to be worth asserting the honorable gentlemen agree better in their views than in their principles the honorable baronet says that the state of the greater part of the west india proprietors is already sufficiently distressing and in many instances deplorable that their estates are mortgaged for nearly the whole of their actual value to merchants and other monied men in this country and that this bill will annihilate the security of the mortgagees be it so the interest then is in them and from them we have had no petition the honorable baronets anxiety about the mortgagees is extremely generous i confess but if his account of the actual situation of west india property be correct the owners would suffer little or nothing even by a general foreclosure these gentlemen recommend it to us not to forget policy while we are talking of justice from which i can only collect that in their minds at least there is an evident distinction between policy and justice in mine sir they are the same if there be any circumstances of the present moment or in the actual situation of affairs in the west indies which may render it prudent or advisable not to carry the measure of abolition into instant execution his majestys ministers who have the best information on such points and who are trusted with the care of the general interests of the empire ought to tell us so i must confide in their prudence if by withholding any necessary information of fact they suffer the house to be misled they are to answer for it but as to general and fundamental principles of policy i want no instruction from any man i know that it is by justice only that great empires can preserve their greatness sic fortis etruria crevit and that by abandoning that principle they insure their ruin but when argument fails we are to be threatened if we persist the example of the loss of america is held up to us by way of warning not to provoke the west india islands lest they also should be lost to great britain if this be a speculation only i answer it with a better  that the events and issues of human counsels are at the disposal of a higher wisdom than ours and that those conclusions which we most strongly dread and deprecate in prospect are very often beneficial in the event if it be a menace i answer it with a fact at the outset of that unhappy contest the terror held out by those who promoted and those who opposed it was the loss of america by the former if we yielded by the latter if we persisted but all parties agreed that the loss of america must be the ruin of great britain america was lost yet in spite of that loss and of all that this country wasted and suffered in attempting to recover it great britain has survived and stood as firm and secure as ever nor do i know with certainty that setting aside the expenses and calamities attached to the contest great britain is essentially weakened or impoverished by the separation of america the honorable general states it as an absurdity in the councils of administration to waste so many lives and to squander such immense sums of money in expeditions to make conquests in the west indies while in effect they forbid the cultivation not only of any you may acquire but even of those which you possess of what use are the acquisitions if the importation of negroes be forbidden sir it would be improper to enter now into the policy of these expeditions that question is not before us nor is this the time for it but to the objection as it is stated the answer is obvious on our principles there is no contradiction between the policy of the expeditions and the object of the bill the two measures may be consistent at least in the judgment of persons who think and maintain as i do that the cultivation of all the lands in the west indies may be effectually provided for without a farther importation of negroes from africa the honorable baronet complains of the extreme rigor and severity of the penalties imposed by this bill my answer is that if the purposes of the law be good if the object be just and necessary the penalties must be sufficient to enforce the execution and insure the effect beyond that point i allow they ought not to be extended on this part of the subject i call on the gentlemen of the long robe to give us their advice and assistance it is properly their business and duty to watch the formaion of all penal acts and to take care that they neither violate the principles nor extend the rigor of our english jurisprudence without absolute necessity i must own i have my doubts whether there may not be some foundation for the apprehension expressed by the honorable baronet that the extreme latitude of the terms used in the first clause by which the procuring aiding or abetting the importation of any negroes is put on the same footing with the actual importation and made subject to the same penalty of transportation for fourteen years may involve innocent persons in the consequences of acts done without their participation and even without their knowledge here again i call on the gentlemen of the long robe to examine this matter and give us their advice the honorable baronet affirms and laments that by this clause men of birth fortune and education polished and improved by manners and by learning are liable to a punishment degrading as well as rigorous and to be confounded with felons and criminals of the vilest denomination i feel the force of the objection and wish to have it considered at the same time i do not think it comes with a very good grace from the honorable baronet when the sedition bill passed he took no part to oppose it he saw no objection then to the newlycreated penalty of transportation for a seditious libel on a second offense by what sort of persons could that sort of offense be committed by men of learning genius and education he saw no objection then to the penalty of transportation in company with felons of every description though possibly it might fall on such a man as mr burke or dr parr or on persons the most eminent in the kingdom for literature and science such men if they were obnoxious to government would be prosecuted in the first instance on any trifling pretense for the sake of insuring the penalty attached to the second conviction the honorable baronet has different rules and measures for offenders whose quality and character are the same but justice ought to be distributed with an equal hand to all men the class of the offender undoubtedly should be considered as well as that of the offense if in this respect the bill should be found liable to objection it ought to be corrected  bill thrown out by    to  0  house of commons monday march         mr francis rose to give notice of his intention to take the first convenient opportunity after the recess to bring forward a motion concerning the state of negroes in the west india islands that in order not to load himself with unnecessary difficulties in an attempt sufficiently arduous in itself and perhaps above his capacity by exciting groundless suspicions or provoking a superfluous disposition to oppose his intended proposition before it was understood he would now state shortly to the house not what his object was but what it was not it did not relate at all to the abolition of the slave trade nor to the manumission of the slaves now in the islands his purpose was to provide for another interest which in his opinion though certainly not neglected had never been wisely considered or rationally promoted on sound principles of advantage either to the master or the slave he meant the real interest of the proprietor himself if through that medium the condition of the slave could be improved he hoped it would not be an objection to his proposition it was true he had not till lately thought of taking an active part upon a subject which in other views had been so long debated and to so little purpose the last unfortunate vote on the slave trade had determined him to come forward on one point only he thought it necessary to make an explicit declaration in order to shelter himself from personal reproach or blame it was true that he had taken his resolution and that at present he saw no reason to think it at all likely that he should not adhere to it nevertheless it was possible that in the interval considerations might occur or be suggested to him by men wiser than himself whom he meant to consult or that insurmountable difficulties or strong prudential objections might deter or divert him from pursuing his present purpose if so the house would hear no more of it but if he persevered in his design of which at present he had no doubt the house might be assured that he would apply his mind to it with all the industry of which he was capable and with every exertion of whatever faculties he possessed  house of commons monday april         mr francis mr speaker it is hardly necessary for me to say that the sight of so numerous an attendance on the present occasion gives me the greatest satisfaction i consider it not only as a practical acknowledgement of the importance of the business of the day and of the interest it excites but as an omen of success convinced as i am of the intrinsic merits of the cause i am engaged in i cannot but rejoice to find that so many gentlemen are still disposed to attend to it the greater the number and the more they examine it the more i am assured that sooner or later it will make a deep and universal impression and finally prevail over every opposition i believe sir i may venture to assert without a risque of contradiction that including the greatest learning by which this house is at all times adorned and sometimes instructed there is no man here better qualified than i am to introduce a serious subject of any kind with a dull tedious elaborate exordium the power and the faculty being undisputed i shall not abuse it instead of tormenting you with a long preface i shall submit to the house some short but earnest requests and then instantly to my subject the first is that the house will grant me a patient audience i ask it with humility for myself but i demand it as a debt of justice for my cause on this day it is your lot to exercise a high jurisdiction over a question important to a great portion of mankind and interesting i trust even to those who think they have no concern in it if this be your office your patience is your duty my second request is that gentlemen will have the goodness and the candor to hear me out that they will not suffer their minds to travel faster than i do that they will not anticipate my conclusions and much more that they will not conclude for me the subject naturally divides into two parts the principles and object on one side the means on the other each of these divisions constitutes of itself an entire whole the merit of which if it has any will depend on the mutual relation correspondence and consistency of its constituent parts united in one view and acting together for one general purpose it cannot be fairly determined or even thoroughly understood by any consideration of particulars that detaches the materials from the composition or that values the component part without regard to its position the most irregular fragment in meeting another fragment finds the place that belongs to it but above all things i must appeal to your justice against any attempt or inclination to confound the consideration of the two general divisions of the subject by drawing objections from the means and applying them to the object the second may be eligible and practicable in its nature though possibly not by that course or through that medium which to me might appear preferable to all others if not the only one likely to be successful you may approve the purpose without admitting the means but you cannot honestly or reasonably contend that decisive objections to the means are necessarily fatal to the end sir i am thoroughly conscious of my own infirmities i cannot hope to make myself understood unless i am heard without impatience or interruption even signs and gestures are sufficient to disconcert me from that sort of distress however i hope to guard myself in some degree by observing a rule which is not so much regarded as it ought to be by fixing my eye as steadily as i can upon you sir from whom i expect nothing but what i have always experienced  kindness encouragement and protection there is no affectation in confessing that i have but little confidence in my own strength allow me to claim the benefit not the merit of this confession if you believe it to be sincere conclude for me as you ought to do that i am convinced of the strength of my cause and that i rely on it for support that i am earnest in my opinion you cannot doubt the value of it must be estimated by others on this day sir it is eminently my duty as it is at all times my interest and inclination to look round me for assistance and to conciliate if i can every class of persons and opinions into which the house has been divided on the subject of the slave trade to the enemies of this traffic a resolute and i hope an unconquerable phalanx to those who have hitherto advised and insisted on abolition i think i have some right to apply for support i have gone the full length of their opinions and given them from first to last the utmost assistance in my power and if ever they should think it prudent or advisable if ever they should see what at present i despair of a rational prospect of success in that direct pursuit they shall find me at my post and as ready as ever to second their efforts is it possible they should tell me in return as i think implicitly they would do by refusing to concur with me this night that they will not suffer any part or portion of that entire system which has totally failed in their hands to succeed in mine they may say perhaps that their principles will not permit them to negotiate with guilt or to compound with crimes as they must do if they consented to palliate or to qualify an evil which they cannot remove and much more if they appeared to authorize or even to acquiesce in its existence by contributing to reduce it to a less intolerable form neither would i if i could help it but is it true that by yielding to necessity any principles are abandoned do i renounce even their object of ultimate abolition or do i pursue it by a course perhaps more effectual though less rapid and direct than that which they have hitherto repeatedly tried without success are there no stages and gradations between complete success and absolute despair are there no expedients in practice of which prudence should avail itself to compass whatever is attainable of the objects of wisdom and benevolence have they a moral right to this extreme precision in a question of action in which the sufferings of others are instantly involved have they nothing to consider now but their own consistency is it pride or is it charity to say to a fellow creature the suffering subject of the argument and victim of the debate that you will not submit to relieve because you have been disappointed in attempting to cure from those gentlemen i have a right to expect better morals if not better logic my appeal to the planters and proprietors is of a different nature but equally intended to conciliate their good will and to obtain their concurrence of them i demand nothing but an exact consistency between their conduct this day and all their former professions they cannot consent to abolish but they are ready and desirous to regulate and to improve such has been their constant language whenever abolition has been proposed they are at all times ready to meliorate the personal condition of the negro though not to put an end to the trade  now i take these gentlemen at their word let us heartily and honestly unite our endeavors to accomplish that which they are willing to concur in which they confess ought to be done to place the negroes in the islands on such a footing of regulated service no longer at personal discretion but under a legal security that the existence of the trade itself for a farther period may possibly be endured some of the parties i am told are highly dissatisfied at my attempting to revive the subject in any shape for what purpose do you stir a question now finally settled by a resolution of the house are we never to be at rest to a complaint of this kind i might truly answer that if i were silent or if i were not in being there are others who would resume the subject with as much zeal and with greater ability who would never suffer it to perish or be forgotten on this point the gentlemen i allude to may as well resolve at once to make up their minds to their situation they may be assured that as long as the grievance exists at least in its present form they will have no repose they can never be at rest but this is not my language it would have the air of an apology which i will never make to any party or to any power for endeavoring to do one of the greatest duties incident to my station in doing it i want no shelter nor would i stoop to solicit it from any human resentment i tell them frankly that while i exist the question shall never die and though it were dead yet shall it live some years ago it was said by a member of this house respectable for his age  where he is now i know not  why cannot you be content are not we all very happy do not we enjoy good dinners and pleasant society and all manner of comforts i dare say the negroes are very well off and why cannot you let them be quiet my answer was and is that such principles and practice never ought to find peace on earth it is in vain to look for it by power and by force they may obtain a partial triumph from day to day but it must be in a perpetual struggle between active wrong and persevering right until the moral sense of justice charity and shame shall either finally prevail or be utterly extinguished in this land to any other issue the war is immortal addressing myself now to the house collectively i certainly mean to do it with the deference and submission that becomes me if i could personify the house of commons it would be my interest as well as my duty to approach so great a person with the utmost respect but respect does not exclude firmness and should not restrain me from saying that it is the function of your greatness as well as of your office to listen to truth especially when it arraigns a proceeding of your own i am not here to admire your consistency or to applaud the conduct which i am endeavoring to correct these topics do not furnish any subject for applause you have nothing like praise to expect from me unless you feel as i do that a compliment of the highest order is included in the confidence which appeals to your justice against your inclination compare the resolutions of the same house of commons in      and      against the second i plead the first the result of a longer debate the decision of a greater majority if the authorities are equal to which shall we submit contradictions cannot act together is it possible to remember the pledge that was given the faith that was engaged and really to respect a power by which both have been broken it is not for me to qualify the proceedings of this house but they can not escape the records of history to save you from everlasting dishonor that leaf must be torn out there is one person left sir whose support if i really had it would undoubtedly be of more use than all the rest but whose support i disdain to solicit i will not for any purpose of this world much less for any interest of my own descend from the independence of my character or from the station attached to the duty of this day to submit myself to a capricious mean injurious enmity not the less bitter because utterly groundless not the less persevering because utterly unprovoked neither is it necessary i have a surer course to take with the right honorable person i allude to if i am not grossly mistaken in my opinion of his character i have a powerful resource in the judicial quality of his calculating mind i am not alluding now to the general purity of his morals or to his sincerity in particular without disputing his virtues i hold it to be fortunate that i am not driven to rely on them i depend on his support because i think i can put an honorable force upon his mind i know the scruples and the prudence with which he weighs and balances the specific value of profit against praise whatever you may think of him he is not a man to be driven even by a favorite passion to sacrifice a great portion of reputation for an inconsiderable advantage and still less for a gratuitous indulgence of temper i am safe then when i say that my present intention is neither to solicit or to offend but to provoke him hear hear  yes sir not to offend but to provoke provocation is not of necessity offense to inflame is not to irritate they know nothing of the language who think that these words represent the same idea i tell him frankly that the last decision of the house has left a shade i will not call it a stain upon his reputation is he not yet satiated with the possession of power and emolument is he not weary of the drudgery of his office compared to which the mere labor of a negro is in my mind a service to be endured and does he think it possible that the country that any rational being should give credit to a proposition so extravagant and so monstrous that the allpowerful minister of the crown with all his eloquence and with all his influence and with the accession of thirty voices from this side of the house should not have been able to engage more than seventy votes on a favorite question of his own if in earnest and bona fide he had desired to carry it is there nothing in his mind to elevate him for a moment above the level of his station does he never look forward to a time when the merits of his character will be canvassed by posterity and is it possible for him to endure the thought of passing for an      mr secretary dundas rose to call the honorable gentleman to order he spoke of his right honorable friend as a member of parliament only and it was the established rule of the house to presume that no member ever delivered opinions or expressed sentiments in which he was not in earnest that to assert or insinuate the contrary was unparliamentary and a high breach of order  mr francis i submit to correction though i really do not think that i said any thing to deserve it certainly what i meant was not to express a suspicion of my own concerning the right honorable gentlemans sincerity but to indicate to him the impression which the fact as it stood seemed likely to make on the general judgment of mankind at present and hereafter i have no time now to debate a point of order nor is it necessary the full idea which i meant to give may be conveyed in another form instead of a comment allow me to tell you a short story from good authority but whether it be true or not is immaterial it will serve to illustrate an obscure subject without the risque of giving offense a member of this honorable house was asked how he voted on the last question of abolition sir i voted with my friend the minister how so i thought you had divided against the bill  very true i certainly divided against the bill but i voted with my friend the minister at the moment when the secretary of state called me to order i was going to make an acknowledgement in favor of the right honorable gentleman and to pay him what i never refuse even to hostile merit an honest tribute of applause what judgment i possess is a good deal governed by impression i cannot calculate the value while i feel the effect i have not forgotten that illustrious night monday  d april       when all the powers of his eloquence were summoned to the service and exerted in the defense of justice and humanity  when he took the house at a late hour exhausted with watching and wearied with debate  when worn out attention revived at his voice  when he carried conviction to our hearts  when reason in his hand seemed to have no office but to excite the best of passions in our breasts  then sir was the time if he had nothing to consider but his own glory then was the moment for him to have chosen to retire from parliament perhaps from the world he had arrived at the pinnacle of parliamentary honor and at the summit of his fame and there he should have quitted the scene from that moment and from that station in my judgment he has done nothing but descend if the effort i allude to was no more than the imitation of an action we may find such imitations still better represented in books or as well acted on the stage where reality is not in question i do not suspect his sincerity on that occasion but whether that was an imitation or not mine is a real action or if it be an error it is i who am the dupe of it i well know the dilemma in which i am to stand this day if the motion i have in view succeeds i shall then be driven to submit to a continuance of the trade if it fails the whole existing mischief receives another confirmation but on the other hand if i succeed a great immediate good is done progressive in its nature and inevitably leading to final abolition if i fail one material advantage will be gained by it that the pretenses set up by those who say they cannot yield to abolition will be unmasked and that with respect to them at least we shall know what we have to trust to such is the perpetual mixture of good and evil that embarrasses the choice and balances the event of human councils we cannot command the issue let us make sure of the intent the first question that will naturally occur to all parties is to ask me what is your general intention you say you do not now propose to abolish the trade do you mean to emancipate the negroes in the islands in effect sir i have answered that question already it cannot be my intention because it is not in my power nor would i venture it if it were before i discharged them from their present evil condition i should be bound to provide for their subsistence and security in a better otherwise their freedom unprepared and unprovided for might be their instant destruction they must be furnished with the means of subsisting on the spot and instructed to make use of them liberty like all other human advantages and enjoyments has difficulties of its own which he who has been bred in slavery will not suddenly know how to contend with in some cases the planters are ready enough to make their slaves free that is to turn them adrift when from age or infirmity they are past their labor and leave them at liberty to shift for themselves for this proof of the liberality of planters the house i imagine will give them but little credit the same principle operates through all their conduct their sole consideration is the profit or the loss the negro in every stage of his existence is some way or other the subject of cruelty or injustice of which the final effort when it can exact no more is to refine upon all the rest and at last to set him free i do not say that such conduct has been universal undoubtedly some planters are wiser and more humane than others but that the practice i allude to has prevailed i affirm from the best evidence from the laws of the islands which declare the fact and pretend to put a stop to it but for what reason is it because justice or humanity forbid that these helpless wretches should be let loose to starve and to perish at the period of their service no sir no such thing the laws interpose avowedly for no purpose but to destroy a nuisance to remove an eyesore or to discourage theft these immoral beings it seems are determined to eat if you will not give them food they take it by stealth the appropriated rights of nourishment are invaded by these free negroes no edible property is secure from them and is that an evil to be endured for a moment by an enlightened legislature  no sir it is not my design to give such freedom on such terms nor will i leave it to the master to dissolve the relation between his slave and himself just whenever he pleases the next question i expect is  do you mean to give the negroes equal rights with the white inhabitants that would be a direct emancipation what i would do immediately if i could would be to place them in a state equivalent to that of voluntary service that step will follow in due time but it must be preceded by other gradations to abolish service in society is in fact to abolish man you have heard of fanciful definitions that man is an animal bipes et implume that man alone makes instruments to act with but there is no distinction perhaps more striking more prominent and characteristic than that he alone of all created beings makes use of the service of creatures of his own species but service is not slavery it is the free mans calling in effect slavery is the reverse of service instead of bad slaves i would make the negroes good servants i am sure that the masters profit on the whole would grow with the freedom and that even his morals would be minded by it a good master makes a good servant and vice versa a good servant makes a good master the principles act and react on each other but we are yet at too great a distance from this humble state of improvement i do not aim at it immediately then what is it you propose i mean sir generally in the first instance to allow the negroes every benefit and advantage compatible with a rational and profitable demand on their service to mend their actual condition to prepare them gradually for a better situation and to make them capable of higher improvements the course and the power shall be stated in their place but first of all let us inquire and consider what is the actual state of the negroes in the islands i mean to represent it fairly on both sides in a printed tract called a true state of the question drawn up with great artifice under an air of simplicity i find the following passage which the author evidently means should be taken for a general and candid account of the negroes in the plantations they have a house and garden for nothing clothes found them food found them both good and sufficient the best doctors in the country to attend them when sick their wives and children provided for and all without any expense the parson who lived there three years says this is the general state of the negroes on all the plantations he saw and that in a great many parts they catch by means of springes or snares abundance of wild pigeons and guinea hens undoubtedly sir if the negroes are really furnished with all these conveniences and amusements there is no occasion to tell us that it must be without any expense to them they land naked and they cannot acquire to say that they have them for nothing is only to assert that their labor is of no value but does any man in his senses believe the statement to be true if it be the fortunate islands were never discovered before grenada and st kitts are the real hesperides a sugar plantation must be a perfect paradise be it so i take these gentlemen at their word in asserting the fact they allow the right to affirm that such is the practice already is to confess that such it ought to be their allegation is an admission almost all that i contend for is acknowledged to be right and in effect if they speak truth already granted and enjoyed enforce your practice compel those planters if there be any who neglect or refuse to follow your benevolent example confirm your own custom by some legal sanction and make it binding on all parties the rights which are held at discretion may be capriciously resumed and even while they are possessed can hardly be enjoyed you cannot answer for the justice and humanity of your successors it is not absolutely certain that your virtues will descend with your estates since in effect you give the substance for what reason should you refuse the security your negroes will not work with less diligence when they know that their industry and obedience are the certain tenure of their happiness as long as they have nothing to lose they are not properly within the reach of good government at least it is worth trying whether the fear of forfeiture may not be full as effectual as the dread of punishment i must call upon you now sir to attend to the opposite side of this flattering representation  after looking at the picture to turn the frame and examine the canvas very different indeed is the view which i shall endeavor to give you of the condition of these slaves but it is that which i most conscientiously believe to be true the reality of the case as i shall state it is founded in the strongest probability and rational presumption on general principles is supported by direct evidence and above all things is demonstrated by unavoidable inference from the laws of the islands my chief reliance is on the last because though not in its nature so direct as oral testimony it is the only sort of evidence which it is impossible for any adverse party to contradict or dispute at the same time sir i desire it to be understood that what i state on this subject is stated generally i do not mean to deny that some plantations are better managed than others that in some places very prudent and humane regulations have been established and particularly that when proprietors who commonly reside in england have visited their estates their occasional presence has been a blessing to their slaves knowing and esteeming many of them as i do and living in friendship with others i should betray my cause as well as my honor if i did not much more than admit if i did not contend that a great part of the miseries suffered by the slaves is in fact owing to the constant absence of the proprietors and would probably be removed or alleviated by their presence had it been my lot to have possessed an estate in the west indies by gift or inheritance  such property assuredly i never would have acquired by an act of my own  i should have thought it my duty in the first instance against every motive of personal reluctance and dislike to have visited my estate to have examined the condition and treatment of my negroes with my own eyes and before i allowed myself to think of any thing else to give and insure to them at least as much comfort and happiness as might be compatible with the demand of a reasonable and a fixed proportion of the amount produce of their labor what more i would have done in the same pursuit may be collected more usefully from the scheme which i am gradually unfolding to the house than from an abrupt declaration of it at present speaking generally then and not without exception of the actual situation of negroes in the west indies i say it appears to me from all the evidence to which i have alluded that they are a collection of human beings existing together but not in a state of society  that they are under no law but that of arbitrary will  that they know of no government but the whip  that they have no effective protection in laws or in magistrates against personal cruelty on the part of those white men who exercise the offices too often united in one person of managers overseers and drivers nor any shelter whatsoever from the severest punishments but in the prudence or humanity of those officers  that there is no bond of marriage among them  and finally that in this state they neither have nor can have nor in fact is it intended that they should have any idea of morals or religion if this be generally their condition it follows of course that even if the propagation of negroes in the islands were not directly discouraged as it is by the planters they could not increase and multiply as beyond all doubt they would do if they were to partake of the common benefits of society or even if they were sure of protection from outrageous wrongs the cause is proved by the effect they who affirm that the contrary is true that propagation is really encouraged and protected are bound to show why they have not succeeded in the course of a century and why a continued importation of adult negroes from africa is still necessary if you trust to their experience of the effect of their own measures the necessity can never cease you must perpetuate the importation i wait with curiosity to hear with what arguments and proofs they support so extraordinary a proposition they will find it a difficult task and they may be sure of my attention to every thing they say not a word of it shall be lost but until i receive new lights on this part of the subject i must continue in my present conviction that there is no marriage among the negroes by which i do not mean a casual cohabitation but a real bond of union because there is no protection to marriage and that without marriage there can be no certain propagation or care of the infant for what reason should a negro marry that his wife if she has any personal attractions may be at the mercy and disposal of the driver who whips them both that his children if they are suffered to live may be slaves like himself and do these people expect us to believe that the productive power of mere animal instinct if in fact it were protected and encouraged is sufficient to overcome the moral order of nature and the dispensations of providence promiscuous cohabitation is generally adverse to increase but in the case of the negroes though birth were not prevented death must follow what care do you think is likely to be taken of the mother or the child when children are considered as a loss and a burden to the estate  do you mean then to impart directly to the negroes now in the west indies the immediate benefit and enjoyment as far as a state of servitude is capable of it of law and government of morals and religion no sir that is not my intention i know too well that they are not in a state to receive these benefits or to profit by them you might as well attempt to sow wheat upon a marble table or on a gravel walk and expect a plentiful crop in return before you plant you must prepare the soil otherwise the expense is wasted and the labor thrown away something must be done in the first instance to raise their degraded minds and to excite their faculties before you attempt to make them productive what idea can they form of a government or how can they regard it from which they experience nothing but punishment how can they confide in laws which place no confidence in them and from which they derive no protection what conception can they have or would it be possible to give them of moral obligations as long as they exist without a social relation of any kind not only to the whites who to them are a distinct order of beings but even to one another many wellmeaning persons i know have wished and endeavored to impart to the negroes some notion of a deity and some sense of religion without blaming the intention i lament the misapplication of a pious principle and the inutility of a virtuous attempt again i entreat the house most earnestly on this point not to anticipate my argument not to conclude hastily either for me or against me my language on this subject may be offensive to vulgar ears or to superficial observers but examine it well and you will find that it proceeds from the deepest sense of the truth and reason of religion these serious considerations are not foreign from my purpose the legislator who leaves religion out of his scheme of government whatever it may be knows nothing of human nature and but little of his office but in all the operations of human contrivance gradation and order are essential to success it is only for the hand of the creator to act by instant institution universally and at once the negroes in their present state are incapable of the benefits of religion because they are not prepared to receive them to give them as they are a confused idea of a power and providence above them which is the utmost you can do would be much worse than useless and ineffectual i say it would be dangerous in failing you only waste your time i dread nothing but your success expose if you will the aweful rites and ceremonies of your religion to mockery and profanation baptize your dogs baptize your horses these animals you caress they feed from your hands and above all things they do not know that they are your slaves but beware of the last act of human impiety beware of persuading the negro of the existence of a being of whose power and attributes he can know nothing but in the miseries it inflicts or permits to be inflicted upon him in his present state do you expect him to listen to religious instruction or to understand it if he does be it so you have taught him to believe or to pretend to believe what he does not understand the existence of a providential power above us in what manner is he likely to be affected by that belief or what conclusion will he draw from it his simple reason will tell him in effect that to him it is an abstract proposition that whether true or false he has no manner of concern in it or that if there be a god he is not the equal protector of his creatures that all the benefits of existence are reserved for the whites and nothing for his color but degradation slavery and stripes is this the impression you wish to make by your instructions whatever you may intend the untutored mind of the negro is incapable of any other what then is it my purpose to keep the negroes as they are without a sense of the truth or a share in the blessings of religion god forbid my intention is directly the reverse i have consulted the book of wisdom and shall follow the precept as it is written he who reads that book without emotion in my mind has no feeling he who reads it without relish has no taste begin with yourselves do not intercept all the goodness of providence in its passage let some portion of its benefits escape from your grasp and descend to your fellow creatures by degrees the negro will conceive without envy that it is your lot to occupy an order of existence above him consistent with his happiness and possibly the medium through which he is to receive it give him benefits and he will return thanks give him hope and he will pray why should he be grateful now or for what purpose should he pray despair never prays extreme guilt rarely the publican hid his face you have heard of the parable of the sower and the seed from a man whose life has been wasted in the pursuit of business or of pleasure and perpetually traversed by disappointment in detail though successful in the result these things may have more weight perhaps than if they came directly from the temple and the teacher the only seed which brought forth fruit was that which fell into good ground the good ground is that which is duly prepared without cultivation the richest soil produces weeds and nothing else if then you seriously and rationally mean to give religion to the negro prepare his mind to receive it by what means by direct information by positive instruction no give him a footing on the ground though it were but a point give him a station in society even the lowest that can be found at present he has none he belongs to no order give him some tenure in the earth if you mean to exalt his thoughts to any thing above it his mind is elastic as well as yours but it must have something solid to act upon these are the premises then what is the conclusion in one word give property to the negroes what property to a slave to a being who is not the master of his own actions who is not the owner of himself yes i say property to a slave i mean a property in the soil the best for their use the most convenient for yourselves qualified and limited on one side and accompanied on the other with time and means to cultivate and security to enjoy without those conditions the mere grant of property would be nominal and nugatory i am not alluding to goods and chattels but to a real though inferior tenure in the land to that sort of property in all its degrees cultivation is the origin of right antecedent to laws and even to society but if that proposition be true how peculiarly powerful is the inference in favor of the negro the moment you forced him to work you gave him the claim and much more than i contend for to some participation at least the labor and the right are inseparable i say that the protection of property is the cause and foundation of society in that single and simple principle is involved and out of it will gradually unfold the benefits the orders and the improvements of social life in that acorn the whole oak is included give it time to take root give protection to the plant let it thrive and flourish the ornament and the use will pay you hereafter the branches as they expand will shelter you from the storm the majestic stem itself even when it falls will be devoted to your service from this single act of giving property to the negroes the improvement of their faculties and character as well as of their condition will gradually and necessarily proceed or on this stock it may he grafted the cultivation of the earth is not merely the source of nourishment or comforts or personal enjoyments but of order laws art and science of every thing that is most refined and most purely intellectual in the human system even eloquence music and poetry though last in succession are the progeny of the earth morality and religion undoubtedly derive from a higher source but this is the medium through which they are conveyed to us prima dedit leges cereris sunt omnia munus you may not believe in the inspiration of poetry but i am sure you will listen and submit to the wisdom of a king you have it from royal authority that truth shall spring and flourish out of the earth what can that sentence mean but that human knowledge with all its illustrations in society was intended to originate from the clod broken by the spade or turned by the plough and that the labor bestowed upon the earth is the first step to the cultivation of the mind before i proceed to specify the sort of property in which i wish the negroes to participate i am bound to show generally that rights of property are not incompatible with a state even of absolute slavery and that in fact they have existed together under governments which in other respects exhibited no sign of lenity or even mercy to their slaves it was the practical wisdom or policy of those states which only in this respect and for a public purpose prescribed a limit to the power of the master though in all other instances utterly arbitrary and uncontrouled by the custom of rome if not by positive institution the slave might acquire by extrawork or by savings on his allowance of grain a peculium or private property which the master could not take from him though he might dispose of his person i do not know that the peculium was provided for by the laws of the twelve tables but it was considered as a customary right and protected by the praetor this money with their masters permission they laid out at interest or purchased with it a slave for themselves from whose labor they might make profit they might buy out their liberty and have their names inserted in the censors roll by which they obtained some of the advantages attached to the condition of a roman citizen though the relation between the freedman and his master was not entirely dissolved even while the bond continues the allowance of or the connivance at petty profits by the slaves tends of itself to soften and efface the impression of slavery and to convert it gradually into the condition of voluntary service the essential difference between slavery and service is that one is forced the other is voluntary montesquieu says that in germany the labor of the mines in itself severe and odious beyond all others was maintained by the encouragement of little privileges perquisites and profits to the miners that they were even brought to love their condition and to live happily in it from this fact he concludes that there is no labor that man can execute which may not be performed by freemen my conclusion from it is that the more of freedom you can impart to a slave the more he will labor provided it be accompanied with a gradual accession of profit cupidilate peculii nullam conditionem recusant durissimae servitutis in society or in contact with society i hold that the possession of property of some kind and to some degree is more necessary to a slave than to a freeman it tends to give him not only comfort but protection and necessarily prepares him not only for social benefits but for personal improvement the savage is satisfied with his liberty instead of stationary labor he ranges for subsistence and having little or no idea of property has still less of laws or settlement in society a free man may do without property because he is free his liberty is his freehold without acquisition he may have enjoyment but in some way or other he must serve or he must labor so mast we all though in different senses or in opposite directions the many cannot govern the few nor do they desire it but is there a rank in society including the highest in which the master in effect is not very often more a servant to his servants than they are to him from my own experience though on a little scale i can affirm it to be true but the relations between the different classes of mankind to be usefully maintained for any must be reciprocally observed by all in the lowest situations of life the people know as well as we do that wherever personal industry is encouraged and property protected there must be inequalities of possession and consequently distinction of ranks then come the form and the order by which the substance is at once defined and preserved distribution and limitation prevent confusion and government by orders is the natural result of property protected by freedom take care that you adhere to it where the few possess all and the multitude have nothing there is no government by orders every thing is in extremity and nothing in gradation it is ignorance or calumny to say that if the poor man was allowed his humble share in the allotment he would feel any disposition to invade the portions of the ranks above him equality of condition is impossible they who talk of it to the people mean nothing but to deceive them the very act of justice and good government which secures to every man his respective right excludes the idea of positive equality the roman slave had some rights of personal property though he had no other that example however is but little to my purpose compared to the condition of the helots under the tyranny of sparta my general wish and object is to make the service of the negroes as much as possible a real service by attaching it to the soil and as little as possible a personal service the negroes in our islands are equally subject to both or may be capriciously transferred from one to the other the horrible barbarity with which the helots were treated was the deliberate policy of the state not the indulgence or result of personal cruelty the spartans were far outnumbered by the helots the security of the few was thought to be incompatible with common justice or even with common mercy to the many one crime produced another the first violation of right in reducing a free people to slavery could only be supported by a perpetual outrage to humanity such at least was the principle and practice of that extraordinary government in which every thing was original and unexampled in another instance directly applicable to my present purpose they departed boldly from all the vulgar rules of human prudence and yet they acted wisely they renounced the uses of property for themselves and in effect gave the lands of laconia to the helots to be cultivated by them on the sole condition of returning to their masters a fixed and certain tribute in kind equivalent to a quitrent which could never be increased to every other intent of use and profit the helots were in fact proprietors of the lands the amount of the demand on the produce of their labor being once made unalterable a vigorous and general cultivation followed many years ago i endeavored to inculcate a similar principle on the english government of bengal i said then and i say now leave the lands with the natural owners the zemindars and fix your demand of a certain portion of the produce at once and for ever subject as it is to a foreign dominion much heavier in detail than that of a single despot bengal cannot exist with security of any kind to the natives or with permanent advantage to the governing power on any other principle the effective right of property was inviolable in the helot though subject in his person to a cruelty at once deliberate and capricious and though his life was never safe he still held a middle rank between the freeman and the domestic slave the helots were commonly enrolled in the spartan armies and though seldom rewarded for their courage or fidelity their condition was mended at least as long as the war lasted the life of a soldier with all its fatigues and dangers is undoubtedly preferable to that of a slave we are told that the negroes on our plantations are always ready to take up arms for their owners and to fight in their defense and this is advanced for a triumphant proof of their attachment and consequently of the mildness with which they are treated in some cases it may be so i have no wish or occasion to overstate any thing to the disadvantage of the planters but generally speaking the fact does not prove the proposition all it proves with any certainty is that in the army the negroes are sure of food and clothing and exempted from field labor and arbitrary punishment how were the armies of lewis the fourteenth recruited in the latest of his wars the distress and misery of every other condition of life drove all men into the army where alone it was possible to subsist how often have we been told that the wonderful facility with which the french have been able to keep their forces complete in the present war proves nothing but the general desolation of the country and that all the bread that existed was reserved for the army this example of the helots sir is direct and powerful to my immediate purpose they were slaves and they had landed property or an equivalent to it in the use and enjoyment in our own ancient history the first estate or tenure superior to downright slavery but inferior to every other condition was that of a villan regardant whose service was annexed to the manor or to the land and who could not be separated from it to a state resembling this i would in the first instance raise the negro the planters should be obliged to furnish every adult negro as they say they do at present with a cottage and a small portion of land for his own use with implements of tillage and a fixed allowance of time for cultivation the entire produce to be his own in some of the islands this allotment may be made with greater ease and convenience than in others but no plantation should be so overstocked with negroes no more than a farm with cattle as not to leave room enough for the production of subsistence ground food is the only nourishment in which the negroes have any pleasure the house will observe that i mean to confine myself to the general principles and outlines of a plan the detail of which will appear before you more distinctly in another form if i should be permitted to proceed in the manner i propose marriage must be encouraged i mean a real bond of union between the sexes a certain participation in the usufruct of the land however limited and qualified is the first encouragement to marry the marriage must be contracted with some ceremony and recorded in some form and then it must be seriously protected by the laws of some of the grecian states if a master violated the wife of his slave the husband and the wife were instantly free leges pudicitiae sunt juris naturalis direct force or violent compulsion of any kind employed against a negress should be punished with death corruption of the wife should make the husband free it is shocking to human nature to think that personal protection even to this amount would constitute in itself a state of improvement but once granted and secured it would of necessity lead to greater i know that according to the actual laws of the islands in which you will find that principles are for ever deduced from practice the difficulty of convicting a a white man of any crime against a negro is little less than insurmountable the negroes are not supposed to be moral agents against a white man no evidence of theirs is admitted the laws if they were good cannot act for want of proof the hand of the magistrate though disposed to punish is disarmed or suspended the most shocking acts of cruelty are encouraged by impunity and in the midst of horrible sufferings there is no complaint by mending the positive existence of the negro you will gradually raise him to a moral character sufficient at least to make his evidence admissible without it he can have no protection from the laws his credit and estimation will grow with the interest you give him and keep pace with the advantages in which you suffer him to participate in no case should the negro be removed against his will from the spot which he has cultivated much less from the estate they should always descend or be transferred together in no case should wives be separated from their husbands or children from their parents in these institutions i lay my foundation particular regulations will follow in their place there should be a general limitation by law of the hours of labor according to age and sex indulgence to weakness or infirmity must still be left to the discretion and benevolence of the master every negro should have the privilege of applying the petty profits of his industry to the recovery of his freedom by buying out the remainder of his slavery or some part of it at a price to be fixed by law fathers and mothers who have brought up a certain number of children should be rewarded with premiums and the mothers exempted from labor no man should be deemed capable of the office of overseer or manager of an estate who was not of a certain age and married the superintendance of the female slaves would naturally devolve as it ought to the care of his wife i need not paint the cases in which the sympathy of a woman and a mother would be a source of comfort and relief to these creatures the sufferings appropriated to the sex demand the office and allot the department i am not sir so weak or inexperienced as to expect that if laws were ever so judiciously framed to accomplish all these salutary purposes they would execute themselves and especially in the west india islands without the concurrence of other establishments undoubtedly there must be special courts and magistrates and officers to receive complaints to prosecute and to punish there must be a judge conservator of the negroes in every island with an advocate and attorney to plead and act for them appointed by the king and dependent solely on the crown with sufficient salaries and no way interested in the property or produce of the plantations under the principal judge and by his deputation there should be itinerant inspectors with some of the powers of a justice of peace who should travel occasionally and not at stated periods in circuits through the islands give notice of their arrival at convenient stations and wait there a sufficient time to receive complaints in petty instances to give redress in graver cases to institute a more serious proceeding before the superior court i have another measure in contemplation materially connected with the general object of relief for which i am contending though it be not to operate immediately in the islands i know that in the circumstances to which i am compelled to submit it could not fail of producing many salutary effects and yet i cannot mention it without a deep sensation of regret with or without it the general plan might proceed but if the plan fails the measure i allude to is indispensable i shall submit it to the consideration of the house as i received it from a gentleman who possesses a considerable property in antigua and with whom i have the happiness to be united by personal friendship as well as by alliance as it is still permitted to be the will of parliament that this infernal trade should continue let us endeavor to mitigate if we can the horrors that belong to it there ought to be commissioners stationed at the principal places of traffic on the coast of africa with salaries sufficient to engage men of character to accept the office and with legal powers to examine the accommodation in the ships to superintend and regulate the purchase of negroes to act as magistrates of the market to prevent or put a stop to treacherous or fraudulent transactions to see that iniquity and injustice are at least conducted fairly on their own pretended principles and without unnecessary aggravations surely the substance of this traffic is enough of itself to satisfy the most savage or brutal mind above all things it should be the care and duty of such commissioners to prevent the separation of families  not to suffer the wife to be divided from her husband the sister from the brother the infant from its mother the sales in the islands should be governed by the same rules a multitude of other duties and offices with which the commissioners should be charged will occur upon reflection that a case should exist with the consent of an enlightened government in which such an institution should be wanted is shameful is intolerable i am sure it is an opprobrium to the name of england in the treatment of the negroes in our islands of all its evils the most grievous and afflicting remains to be considered as long as it exists i know that general institutions laws and magistrates will avail but little in their defense the arbitrary power of the whip committed to men without feeling to be exercised in anger and unchecked even by the interest of an owner in the wellbeing of the object is not in its nature capable of regulation or subject to control to limit the number of stripes to interpose between the naked helpless wretch  a pregnant woman perhaps  and the uplifted hand of the driver would be an unjust invasion of necessary authority and possibly in its consequences might hazard the crop for a mischief of this kind there is no partial remedy in the place of a despotic power of punishment entrusted to a single person i would substitute a form of trial not less effectual to insure the reasonable demand on labor and equally safe to the only interests which the planters seem to think of i would give jurisdiction to the negroes in every plantation over one another the whole gang of males adult should constitute the panel out of which a kind of jury should be formed by lot or by selection with a right of challenge on one side to the offender and on the other to the master or to his representative who should superintend and regulate the proceedings and mitigate or remit the sentence if he thought proper gentlemen who are fond of justice may apprehend perhaps that a black tribunal would rarely if ever inflict sufficient punishment on a negro i for my part am confident that as soon as they understood their office and were sensible of the trust reposed in them they would rather lean to severity and that the overseer would often find himself obliged to restrain it on this principle the discipline of our armies in india is effectually maintained an honorable gentleman general smith near me can give you better information on this subject but i know enough of it to be able to assure you that no sepoy can be punished but by the sentence of a court martial composed of native officers who have all been taken from the ranks and with an european officer to act as judge advocate and that i never heard the justice of their proceedings disputed as long as they are tolerably well treated they are attached to their officers and will follow them as far as the best british troops a remarkable instance of this attachment and of their disposition to do even more than justice on offenders of their own cast occurred a few years ago captain ewans an officer generally beloved at the head of his battalion was murdered by a sepoy who suddenly went out of the ranks and shot him without notice or complaint or any provocation that could ever be discovered the whole battalion saw the fact the grenadiers on the flanks immediately wheeled without orders and surrounded the assassin the difficulty then was to prevent their tying him to a horses tail and dragging him to death without a trial the british officers insisted on his being regularly tried and executed in the usual military form i need not however have gone so far from the islands for a successful instance of practice founded on the same principle i have not the honor of knowing the gentleman whose example i am going to appeal to i mean sir philip gibbs but i know his character and what his conduct has been in the management of his estate in barbados the former is eminently humane the latter equally judicious his virtues are to me a proof of his wisdom he gives his negroes land and stock with time to cultivate he feeds and clothes them well he encourages marriage among them and allows of no punishment but by the sentence of a jury of negroes the consequence is that his slaves do double the work of others because they are better able and more willing the instructions he has given to the managers of his estate are a model for imitation the success and the profit have corresponded with the benevolent design before i quit this first division of my subject i owe it in justice to an honorable person lately a distinguished member of this house as well as to my cause not to conceal the lights i have received from him and to avail myself as far as i can of the concurrence of his authority on a subject of this nature there cannot in my opinion be a greater i mean mr burke divided as we are by an irreconcilable difference of opinion on another important subject and separated in private life as long as that unfortunate question continues i still hope and believe that the bond of personal friendship and good will between us will never be dissolved as soon as i had determined to take an active part in this business i went to mr burke as wiser men have done before me for advice and information i know how little i am qualified to occupy his station on any subject and that i have undertaken a task which eminently and peculiarly belonged to him to form and to digest a complete and perfect code of laws on a subject so extensive and so full of difficulties would be a work appropriated to the powers and compass of his mind his industry and perseverance alone could carry it into execution on a transcendent question such as this of morals implicated with policy the eminence of his mind extends his view and gives him an horizon which vulgar vision can reach to i have not strength to sustain or vigor to wield the armor of achilles if mr burke were here  for his own happiness i cannot wish it  this would be his office how gladly would i resign it to him  non foret incertus tanti certaminis haeres  i have not seen the plan which he drew up some years ago and which he then communicated to a right honorable gentleman high in office in ireland mr pelham and since to a right honorable friend on the other side mr windham  nor would i avail myself now of his permission to see it because i soon perceived that it went to an extent and embraced a multitude of objects which i knew it was impossible for me to manage to force them on my mind without capacity to receive them would be only to embarrass or utterly to discourage me perhaps too i might differ from him on the most prudential course of proceeding yon will not suspect me of setting my judgment in competition with his if it were possible for him to lead the cause himself i should hold myself ready for any subordinate part in it and to be guided by his judgment but if i am to act i must act upon my own i am not thoroughly convinced of the advantage of forcing a great variety of institutions to march together and in front or possibly it would be more honest to say that i consult my own infirmity in leaving as much as i can to the gradual operation of those simple principles and limited institutions which i am more able to comprehend to arrange with effect and apply to practice  the house sir is now in possession of the general object and principles of the plan which i meant to lay before you there are some persons undoubtedly whose hearty concurrence i am not sanguine enough to expect but i do not believe it possible that any man will directly and openly assert that such an object if it were attainable is not to be desired  that such a plan if it were practicable is not fit to be encouraged no human resolution will go that length i know as well as they do on what ground they are prepared to meet me and for what question the strength of their opposition is reserved admitting the measure to be eligible in itself they ask me now by what means do you propose to carry it into execution what course would you pursue what power would you employ i shall not keep these gentlemen in suspense my answer i see is waited for with an impatience which indicates the certainty and anticipates the triumph of immediate victory they exult in the practical difficulties inseparable from every attempt to do good in this world and which they trust are insurmountable in the present instance well sir i am ready to gratify their desire and prepared as i think for all the objections that can be rationally urged against me this part of the question is not new to me what i know of it is derived not only from study and reflection as deep as i am capable of giving to any subject but from the wisdom of great men whom i have known and from the experience of events which have happened in my own time though too young to take part i was old enough to observe and i had access to some of the greatest sources of instruction how far i may have been able to avail myself of these advantages must be determined by others the power which i mean to resort to for carrying this plan into effect is that of the british parliament over the colonies of great britain no man is fairly at issue with me who does not distinctly deny that power is there a statesman in this house is there an individual of any rank or consideration here who will take it upon himself directly and plainly to maintain that denial or in other words to affirm that in no case whatever has the british parliament a right to make laws to bind the british colonies i cannot believe it but if there be let him come forward and declare himself on that question inconsiderable as i am and bold as it may appear i am ready to meet him in front to show that he knows nothing of the principles of legislation of the policy of states or of the duties of government and to make him for his ignorance at least the scorn and contempt of mankind if he admits that cases may possibly exist in which the power may be necessary and the right undisputed i then shall have nothing to prove but that this is eminently a case in point in which the application of the unquestionable power of parliament must be resorted to because no other power on earth is equal to the purpose i am as ready as any man to allow or to contend if it were necessary that the transcendent power of parliament to make laws for every part of the british empire where it has not been formally relinquished is not in prudence to be used on ordinary occasions when the subordinate powers of legislation can act with equal effect in their several departments it is a right reserved for great emergencies to say that it ought to be so reserved is to acknowledge that it exists without evident necessity i would neither urge the case nor agitate the right occasions vary and prudence must be consulted but rights are not given to lie dormant for ever they have relative duties attached to them according to the occasion the right is to be exercised and the duty to be performed necessity alone if the thing must be done and if there be no alternative conveys a right or stands in the place of it to act for the general welfare or for the public safety i shall show you hereafter how little is to be expected on this subject from the power even if it concurred with the disposition of the colonial assemblies and that by their means a real and effective alteration in the condition of the negroes can never be accomplished but i have first another argument to maintain and better ground to stand on in a former debate the example of america was held out to deter us from acts which might alienate the west india islands and drive them to look elsewhere for protection if not to resistance at that time nothing was in question but the abolition of the slave trade this night you may be sure of hearing the same argument repeated or rather of seeing the same weapon uplifted to awe your deliberations let the question be what it may they are equally ready with it if the west india islands would not submit to abolition how will they endure the interposition of the legislature in any thing that touches their internal government such is the language of englishmen sitting among us to the legislative authority of their country let us see with what reason they resort to the example of america i am as ready to appeal to it as they are i know where that fatal question originated no part of the argument which divided this country on the merits of the stamp act or of the events which followed it have escaped me with all those transactions in my view i declare now on the principles and in the language of lord chatham that i rejoice that america resisted if this be a concession these gentlemen are welcome to it i do not believe it will avail them i rejoice that america resisted with success because it was a triumph of unquestionable right over outrageous wrong of courage and virtue over tyranny and force  because the issue of that contest has provided a refuge and left us an asylum when existence in europe perhaps even in england can no longer be endured the nations crushed by taxes for the support of powers that oppress or of wars that destroy them have still the consolation of knowing that peace and freedom and plenty are to be found in america and that there is still a country in the world where every man enjoys in security the fruits of his industry and the produce of his labor who is there who can pronounce with certainty that a period is not approaching when no other refuge may be left us  on what ground did the americans first dispute the general legislative authority of the mother country did they assert that a british parliament had no right to bind or to regulate a british colony by its laws in any case whatsoever did they ever maintain a proposition so absurd and so monstrous as that protection gave no claim to obedience that those duties were not reciprocal that a nation sub tutela owed no submission to the tutelary power by which it was protected that the ward owed nothing to the guardian the pupil to the tutor the child to the parent  that such offices were merely nominal and gave no right to act even for the benefit of the pretended objects of their care no sir america had too much wisdom for herself as well as too hearty an attachment to england to hold such foolish language or to maintain such dangerous doctrines see how she has lately acted to some refractory dependencies of her own the moment such principles prevail there is an end of all unity of government in the world in an extended empire every distant province may set up for itself every one of your islands may be an independent state if i aimed at their destruction they should have my consent to be so you would soon see them at your feet with supplication to you to resume your station and never to relinquish your authority over them that authority was not disputed by america until it was extended to purposes unconnected with general regulation and exercised on principles which if once they were admitted left no security to the americans for any thing they possessed the claim which they resisted was that of direct taxation by a house of commons in which they were not represented they asserted truly that taxation and representation were inseparable  that the right grew from the fact and could not exist without it in private life the guardian regulates the conduct and even disposes of the property of the pupil for his maintenance for his service or for his education but it does not follow that he may take any part of it for his own use or benefit the first may be a duty the second would be a robbery the protecting power has a claim to obedience not to money to prevent any further question on this subject all claim to lay taxes on the colonies was formally renounced in the year      the act of the   th of his present majesty commonly called governor johnstones act declares and enacts that the king and parliament of great britain will not impose any duty tax or assessment whatsoever payable in the colonies except such duties as it may be expedient to impose for the regulations of commerce the nett produce of such duties to be always paid and applied to the use of such colonies  this surrender on the part of great britain is specific all the other general rights of the mother country remain unaltered the concession by which one particular point is given up amounts in fact to a reaffirmance of the rest the question then is whether the measure i propose and particularly that part of it by which the planters would be obliged to allot some portion of their land with a cottage to their negroes be or be not an act of taxation i desire to confine myself to this point at present because i do not mean to insist that a provision for the salaries and establishments of magistrates advocates and commissioners may not properly be the subject of a different consideration what i am now speaking of is the allotment of a share in the usufruct of the estate to the service and benefit of the estate itself and to no other purpose whatsoever nothing is taken away from the owner nothing is applied to the uses of government the tenure of the villan regardant was in its nature usufructuary and was never understood to limit or impair the right of the proprietor to the property of the soil now i affirm that it is essential to the character and definition of a tax that the amount shall be taken from the contributor and applied to the service of the crown or of the public to appropriate and allot an existing fund whether in land or money is not of itself an act of taxation but if it were so what pretense have these gentlemen to appeal to the case or to quote the rights which justified the resistance of america is there any resemblance between the two situations the americans resisted taxation because they were not represented in parliament the folly and injustice of this country by persisting in a claim of right which never could have been essentially exercised and which at last was relinquished drove the americans to the necessity of asserting much more than their original pretensions amounted to they began with petition and remonstrance  they appealed to the sword and established their destined independence long before its natural and inevitable period before they themselves had foreseen or desired it in the fullness of time and in the maturity of their state separation and independence must have been the lot of america the herculean infant would necessarily have burst its cradle and broken loose from its leading strings but then the union of the two countries would have continued unimpaired the mutual relations of kindness and friendship would not have been dissolved affection and attachment would have occupied the places of authority and dependence between the case of america and that of the west india islands there is no similarity nor are the same consequences possible is it true in fact that the property of the west india islands is not represented in the house of commons of what sort of persons does that party consist which on the subject of the slave trade carries every thing before it in this house why sir it is one of their allegations when it suits their purpose that the property of the islands is vested in great britain that is in the hands of resident owners mortgagees merchants and creditors they are all on the spot to represent the interests and to defend the right of the islands they at least are the subjects of great britain they at least may be compelled by the power of parliament if they are not your subjects what are they the americans on the contrary resided on their own continent at a distance which made communication impracticable and not only without representation but not even in contact and much less in sympathy with the power that pretended to tax them the progress of their population had no limits an unbounded territory expanded to receive it the islands have their boundary fixed for them by nature the number of their white inhabitants cannot increase beyond a certain point and must always be inconsiderable in comparison with the negroes and people of color of some superior power of some protecting dominion the islands must for ever be the colonies or the dependencies in the nature of things they never can he independent states their representatives in this house talk boldly of separation and even intimate resistance i would not drive them to that issue if they can make out their right i would never put them to a trial of their strength their arguments and their power are pretty much upon a footing they know that if they were unconnected with us tomorrow and if it were possible for them to maintain their independence against france and america the great market for their produce is in the consumption of these kingdoms and that to this market they must bring it on any terms which parliament should think fit to prescribe to them  i have already intimated that it is not my intention to propose any thing that should really trench on the question of taxation or furnish a pretense to cavil or to quarrel with the general views and purposes of the measure i need not argue about privileges which i have no thoughts of invading if the sums required to pay the salaries and to support the establishments made necessary by this or any other plan were to be raised in the islands by the direct authority of parliament the objection would then be in its place and proper to be considered that point is not in question and need not be debated if the colonial assemblies cannot be prevailed upon by a recommendation from the crown or any other means to provide for such expenses the charge must be borne by great britain and may easily be assessed upon objects unquestionably within the disposition of parliament i am ready for my part to contribute to it by a perpetual rentcharge on my estate to a greater amount than can be reasonably stated as the just proportion of any individual  waving now sir all farther consideration of the strict right of parliament to act legislatively for the general benefit of the west india islands i know there is another important question to be resolved since the different islands have colonial assemblies or inferior parliaments of their own why do i not prefer some course of application to those assemblies and try whether all the useful purposes of the bill which i am endeavoring to recommend to the house of commons may not equally be effected through that medium the question is fair and i shall answer it frankly in the face of experience and against all our knowledge and observation of the principles character and proceedings of these assemblies let us suppose for a moment that a general disposition did really prevail among them to impart to their negroes some share in the natural rights of human creatures laboring in their service and a legal security for the possession of them within these few years since questions on this subject have been warmly revived and repeatedly agitated in england they have had opportunities and incitements enough to indulge their benevolence and to take the business into their own hands but neither have they discovered such an inclination nor do i think it was in their power to have concerted a general plan or to have pursued it with effect partial alterations might possibly have been attempted in the several islands without system or connection according to the accidental temper or prevailing discretion of the different assemblies some would have granted less than others very little i believe would have been yielded by any of them but were it otherwise in point of disposition their number and their distance from each other would have made it impossible for them to deliberate in concert or finally to concur in a uniform conclusion the colonies of north american were in contact with each other and were capable of acting under one direction for a general object the islands have no union of views no common bond of interest to engage them to agree in a general resolution much less have they a union of power to enforce it so much the more necessary is it that there should be somewhere a superior indifferent tribunal and a binding power paramount to them all no authority adequate to the purpose can exist but in parliament if one of the provincial legislatures presided with sovereignty over the rest it might possibly be sufficient to form the plan the difficulties of the execution would still be insurmountable but let their capacity be what it may the principal disqualification lies in their rooted aversion to the measure and in their contempt of the objects of it such is the invariable influence of arbitrary capricious power to vitiate the human mind  to make us hate when we have injured and despise when we have degraded a great deal it is said may be expected from the virtue and prudence of the colonial assemblies let us try the value of that expectation by the test of experience to judge of what they will do let us see what they have done i place no confidence in professions unsupported by conduct i have examined their laws with care and attention i have read them with patience with weariness and disgust i do assure you sir it is not easy for an english mind to conceive that such a code as this could be the result of debate and deliberation in a senate of any sort their utter ignorance of every rational principle of legislation is only to be paralleled by the unfeeling cruelty that dictates and prevails through all their resolutions i shall not weary the house with details or recitals from this book my honorable friend william smith esquire near me has kindly undertaken that task if the house should be disposed to call for it i believe it will be sufficient if i give you a sample of the principles on which these assemblies have proceeded you may take it safely for a specimen of the whole first of all let the personal injury done to a negro be ever so atrocious the assemblies have taken special care to make conviction impossible suppose that all the negroes on any plantation should jointly and severally attest that the overseer had maimed defaced mutilated or cruelly tortured a negro the common language of these laws their evidence would avail nothing the party would be at liberty to purge himself on his oath that is they have established impunity by law for crimes in many cases worse than murder they talk of conviction perpetually and of penalties to be attached to it to deface to maim or to mutilate if by any means the fact can be proved is to be punished with imprisonment not exceeding three months and a fine of a hundred pounds currency to be paid into the treasury of the island for the public uses thereof but in what form or by what testimony conviction is to be obtained in this or any other instance against a white man where there is no white evidence which must generally be the case is no where specified white overseers and drivers will not often bear witness against one another they have a fellow feeling on this subject or they can easily take care not to act in company an act passed in dominica in the year      for the encouragement protection and better government of slaves i am told is greatly relied on as a proof of the justice and humanity which prevail in the islands this act does certainly admit that it is just and proper that the slaves should be protected in their persons from the violence and inhumanity of such white persons and free persons of color who may have no lawful authority over them the admission is important observe the date and then consider what sort and what length of antecedent practice is proved by it but this act is remedial i wish it were possible to bring the whole tenor of it into your view one example will be enough to show you the spirit that runs through it the   th clause declares that the inferior crimes of slaves cannot always be conveniently brought before the cognizance of the magistrates and therefore enacts that every slave who shall disobey orders or who shall be guilty of neglect of duty or absence from labor etc etc shall be punished at the discretion of the owner renter manager or overseer by confinement or flogging on the bare back provided the number of lashes does not exceed thirtynine trial and conviction are avowedly out of the question but if the punisher shall inflict any punishment not prescribed by this act  what then he shall be subject to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds current money of the island to be recovered by bill plaint or information in any of his maiestys courts of record who is to complain who is to inform  suppose he repeats the thirtynine lashes after a short interval that case is not provided for most of these lawgivers seem to think it reasonable that if any violent injury be done to the person of a negro compensation should be made for it by an act of st vincents past in      it is provided that if any white person shall castrate or dismember any slave familiar cases he shall upon conviction and if the prosecution be commenced in one year after the offense pay double damages and costs to the party grieved by the   th clause if a slave in pursuit of a runaway shall be only maimed or much hurt proportionable allowance shall be made by the public now who do you understand to be the party aggrieved to whom some compensation and allowance ought to be made  the maimed or mutilated negro no sir in the eye of the law the owner is the only sufferer he suffers in his property he loses the labor of his slave if he be reimbursed the justice of the island is satisfied by a law of the bahama islands passed in      it is enacted that any person who shall apprehend a runaway negro dead or alive shall be paid twenty pounds then comes the trial of the runaway before two magistrates and three freeholders who on conviction shall order execution unless it shall appear to them that such slave has received such cruel usage from his or her owner as to have been the cause of his or her running away observe that the reward is given for taking dead as well as alive that is for shooting a slave who might have been driven to run away by that cruel usage which they say would save him from punishment if he had been taken alive redress compensation or protection to the negro is never thought of  in other islands the proof of innocence or freedom is always put upon the accused negro if he cannot prove affirmatively that he did not commit the fact or that he is not a slave conviction follows of course the laws of montserrat take special care of provisions a negro who steals any to the amount value of twelve pence shall upon due proof thereof before the governor and council suffer such death as they shall think fit to award again if flesh of any sort shall be found in the house of a negro unless he or she can make it plainly appear they come by it honestly such negro shall undergo a whipping and have one of their ears cut off  i ask pardon of the house for dwelling so long on such odious examples of deliberate legislative barbarity it was necessary in order to show you what sort of legislators you are referred to into what hands you are to delegate your justice and your mercy and how fit they are to be trusted to establish the necessity of a direct recourse to the power of parliament and the injustice of resorting to any other one general consideration of the subject remains to be stated and with that i shall conclude the population of the islands consists of the many who are black and of a few who are white the few legislate for the many without their consent or knowledge the negroes i take it are not represented in the assemblies whose authority however would not have been disputed if it had been exercised with any tolerable regard to justice reason or humanity the nature of the case requires that there should be somewhere a compulsory power over both parties the highest attribute of parliament is to compel the guilty and to protect the innocent the station and the trust are inseparable renounce your office or perform your duty  with the assistance of a near relation whose studies i hope will be successful as long as they are directed by generous principles to honorable ends a bill for the purposes which i have submitted to the house is in some degree of forwardness i am glad i did not foresee the uncommon difficulties that belong to it and the extent of the labor i was about to undertake i fear it would have deterred me from attempting to do any thing supposing i were at liberty to proceed as i thought fit my desire would be to have leave to bring in the bill to read it once to have it printed and to let it lie over till the ensuing session even they who might wish to promote the objects of the bill by other means would find some advantage i hope from having the bill before them they might take the materials and make a better use of them though i should not have a seat in parliament i shall be ready to devote my time and my labor to assist any man who will undertake to prosecute the measure  with this act i am content to close my parliamentary life i set out with a fixed principle and have adhered to it faithfully without looking to the right or left for advantages i am not conscious of having pursued any interest at the expense of any duty i saw my way and i knew where it would lead me for profit or preferment i should have taken another course for honor and happiness i shall not think that i have lived in vain if at the period of my existence i should be able to look back as i do in this place to a life of unrewarded service and to end it with an act of benevolence to mankind  i move you sir that leave be given to bring in a bill for the better regulation and improvement of the situation of the negroes and other slaves in the colonies islands and plantations in america and the west indies belonging to his majesty his heirs and successors  appendix no i to philip francis esquire april        sir it affords some satisfaction to the friends of humanity to observe that notwithstanding the recent rejection of the bill for abolishing the african trader the subject is not yet wholly abandoned but that on the contrary it will be revived in a manner much more likely than heretofore to insure eventual success the little attention that has been paid to conciliate the good will or to allay the fears of those who were most interested in the event were but too sure indications either that the measure proposed was not intended to be carried or that the promoters of it however sincere in their intentions were strangely ignorant of the means likely to effect their purpose is it possible that mankind are yet to learn that the happiness or advantage of any one class of society can never depend on the misery or misfortunes of another it is by uniting the real interests of different classes of men in one measure and not by placing them in opposition to each other that any permanent reform is reasonably to be expected  in attempting to engage the british parliament in meliorating the condition of the slaves in the west india islands you will perhaps incur the displeasure of those who in the high language of unbending virtue disdain to regulate oppression or compromise with guilt but the sedate observer of human nature will see that violent changes in the moral world are not less dangerous than those of the natural and that although a storm or an earthquake may at times purify the atmosphere yet that this change is much more desirable when effected by a less violent operation human misfortunes and human crimes require human remedies and that fastidious delicacy which cannot bear the loathsomeness of an hospital or the distresses of a jail is not likely ever to render any important services to mankind  from the west india planters you will probably meet with a more formidable opposition and it is not unlikely that they may oppose you in the first stage of the business by contending that as each of the islands has a legislative body of its own they are exclusively competent to judge of such regulations as are necessary for their internal safety and advantage and that the interference of the british legislature in making laws which do not affect themselves but affect a different body of men with different sentiments and different interests is preposterous and unjust  this objection would certainly be well founded were all the inhabitants of the west india islands in such a state of information and equality as to concur in making laws for themselves and to bring out in result a general opinion but the fact is not so these islands are inhabited by two bodies of men the great majority of whom are in a state of slavery to the rest in claiming therefore the right of making laws for these subordinate classes of society the planters arrogate to themselves the very privilege which they contend to be tyrannical and unjust viz the right of making laws by which others are governed without their own consent whilst these two classes of men exist the interference of the british government is rendered necessary by that very circumstance whilst these islands remain a part of the british dominions it is not only the right but the indispensable duty of that government to watch over the interests of the humblest classes of the community and not to consign over the happiness and existence of thousands to the passions or the prejudices of those who blinded by mistaken ideas of their own interest and too often depraved by long habits of superiority are generally the least qualified to judge even where the question relates to their own advantage the result of the slave carrying bill the good effects of which are now generally acknowledged has however afforded one useful lesson to the supporters of african slavery and i hope the regulations which you purpose to introduce will ere long afford them another  it may be stated as an incontrovertible maxim that whenever any portion of the human race are placed in a fair and reasonable situation and supplied with the necessary articles of life they will continue to increase their species had this not been the fact the human race would long ago have been extinct nor has it ever been pretended that the natives of africa are less prolific than those of any other quarter of the earth to what cause is it then to be attributed that after a constant supply for upwards of two centuries the present negro inhabitants of the british west indies bear so small a proportion to the number from time to time actually imported or whence arises this continual waste of life which is the foundation of the african trade certainly because they are not in a fair and reasonable situation and have not those advantages which are necessary to enable them to fulfill even the first law of their existence to improve that situation  to admit them if i may use the expression to the rank of human beings  to give them a station and a known place in society however low that place may be is the immediate object and duty of that government on whom and on whom only they have claims for protection as their numbers increase as their moral powers improve they will make further advances in the scale of civilization their progress will be from slaves to vassals attached to the land from vassals to husbandmen and from husbandmen some may perhaps rise by their own merits to a higher class and form a sort of yeomanry of the british plantations the necessary power for cultivating these plantations will then he obtained on the spot the example if advantageous will be followed by other nations and the trade for slaves to africa will be abolished without a struggle not as unjust but as unnecessary  that the parent state and not the local legislature is properly charged with the performance of this duty is evident from the first measure which it appears necessary to adopt the planters when called upon by the british nation to mitigate the distresses of their slaves have replied by their able advocate mr bryan edwards  it is for you if sincere to set us the example by a repeal of the british statutes which subjects slaves in the plantations to be taken in execution and sold for the debts of british creditors and is the most cruel and oppressive regulation under which these people groan the remonstrance is just this statute is a perpetual bar to the happiness and improvement of the negro and till it be repealed all attempts at further regulations are useless that a creditor under the sanction of a british act of parliament shall seize upon a body of men women and children as on a herd of cattle that he shall be empowered for no crime or misconduct of theirs to tear them from their habitations to separate the wife from the husband the mother from her children and disperse them to different masters in different islands is a reproach to this country which ought effectually to prevent its upbraiding the planters with severity to their slaves even in the most unfavourable situations of society the common sympathies of human nature will at times be felt and frequent intercourse may excite and has excited an attachment between the slave and his master or between the master and his numerous and dependant family but what pity can exist in the bosom of a creditor resident in england whose only object is the recovery of his money and who considers the unfortunate victims of his rapacity as the subjects of a legal distress  the opposition to the repeal of this cruel statute will not arise from the planters but from those powerful capitalists in great britain who advance them money on stipulations which often return an enormous rate of interest but it will not be difficult to show that such a regulation whilst it is injurious to the planter is not favorable to his creditors and has no better tendency than to excite a contest among them who shall be the first to tear his property in pieces when the negroes are thus carried off the estate to satisfy the demand of a single creditor what is to become of the mortgagee of the real property whose security is thereby rendered unproductive or of the other creditors who have no resource but in the imprisonment of an insolvent to deprive a planter of the instruments by which alone he can extricate himself from his difficulties merely to gratify an avaricious or resentful crediditor is the height of injustice to the rest let the negroes then be attached to the estate and disposed of or retained with the inheritance the planter will thus be enabled to exert himself with confidence and if he should eventually prove unsuccessful the sale of his whole property together will be more advantageous to his creditors than the suffering it to be dismembered by contested claims by these regulations the planter will be essentially benefited the negro will have a fixed residence will become domesticated and attached to the soil and the creditors at large will have a security against preferences by a partial transfer the admission of which is equally impolitic and unjust  next to the repeal of this obnoxious statute it would appear advisable that the situation of the slaves in the different islands should be assimilated to each other  according to the present laws of those islands the negroes are in some of them considered as real property descendible to the heir and in others as personal property which vests in the executors and are liable to be sold from the estate that which has been found advantageous or tolerated in one island cannot prove injurious to another and it may therefore be presumed that no great objection would be made to a regulation which should declare that the negroes shall in all cases descend with the estate and shall not be devisable from it even by will being thus placed on the same level they would become the equal objects of any regulation which might hereafter be proposed for their benefit which in their present precarious situation it is impossible should be the case this would also prevent any person not possessed of an estate from acquiring a property in a slave and would put an instant period to the inhuman and incrceasing custom of purchasing slaves in order to hire out their labor to those planters who will pay the highest price  were the foundations thus laid such further improvements might be introduced as would soon answer the great ends which i presume you have in view but considerations of this nature would lead me beyond my limits and i have scarcely time to dispatch this letter by the post so as to have a chance of reaching you in london before the discussion takes place i have however taken the liberty of transmitting you a small pamphlet published in the year      at the close of which you will find some hints toward a bill for the gradual abolition of the african trade and the final emancipation of the slaves and i shall be truly happy if any effort of mine can in the least degree contribute toward so great and desirable an event  it has justly been observed that arguments deduced from general principles are equally valid from whatever quarter they may come and this might have been my apology for suppressing my signature but i like not an anonymous address and as i have a full confidence that in expressing a wish to be unknown to any person but yourself my purpose will be fully answered i beg leave to subscribe  with great respect etc       st jamess square april         sir i did not receive the favor of your letter of the  th instant till yesterday about an hour or two before i went down to the house of commons with my mind as you may imagine tolerably well filled with my subject i did not venture to read more than three or four pages of it for a reason which at first sight may appear extraordinary the first part of this excellent and in my judgment incomparable performance suggested to me a very important hint of which i saw i could avail myself in the course of the debate but i was really and seriously afraid to expose myself to that force and necessity of taking more which i was very sure the remainder of your letter would impose upon me the reason of this fear was founded upon a just and prudent distrust of my own capacity i dreaded the consequence of receiving more than i might be able to digest even of food of the best quality i have now perused the whole of your letter with the same continued attention which the first lines of it excited and with perfect satisfaction it appears to me and i say it with a grateful sentiment of honest pride that if we had concerted our principles and agreed upon a plan together it is hardly possible to conceive a more exact concurrence of principles views and opinions than that which exists between yours and mine with respect to the act of george ii or to that part of it which you so justly and ably reprobate it was certainly my intention to have moved at a proper time for a repeal of it that is if i had been suffered to take the first step of all without which you must be sensible that i could not have a point to stand upon i am afraid the case is now desperate when abolition is proposed you hear of nothing but a wonderful readiness to accept of regulations and with or without a law to carry them into effect when regulations are proposed they have another remedy to resort to   the parliament of great britain have no right to legislate for the west india islands particularly if any act of that power should involve the effect of taxation though the produce or the effect should operate solely where it was created that is in the islands themselves and no way to the benefit of great britain   you who dare to stir such a question at all are an incendiary and a traitor  sir i very much wish that you would leave me at liberty to make what use i may think proper of your letter under the condition if you desire it of carefully concealing your name  i am with the sincerest respect and esteem  sir your most obedient and most obliged humble servant philip francis   to philip francis esquire april         sir i beg you to accept my grateful thanks for your communication of the debate on your motion and for your very kind letter which has relieved me from the apprehension of which i could not divest myself of having unseasonably and perhaps unnecessarily intruded on your time  it is in some degree fortunate for those who have been accustomed to interest themselves in the welfare of their fellow creatures as well white as black that they are not in these times very susceptible of the pangs of disappointment the repulses they have met with on all occasions have blunted their feelings to that anguish the keenest perhaps of any not derived from conscious criminality which results from the defeat of a great and disinterested attempt and the failure of your motion is only another example of those outrages against truth justice and humanity which have of late so frequently disgraced this age and country after the miseries which mankind have recently suffered from the shock of extreme opinions it might have been expected that he who should raise the standard of moderation would not find himself in want of volunteers  but the case is otherwise and whatever may be the justice of his pretensions and with whatever candor and perspicuity they may be enforced he will find that with a great majority of his hearers the welfare of others is an object of much less importance than the gratifying their own particular notions thus the man who disdains to stoop to regulate an iniquitous abuse becomes the accomplice of him who contends that the abuse ought not to be corrected and forgets that most important maxim   sunt certi denique fines quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum there is however one great man who when the interests of humanity are at stake is superior to the gratification of a personal feeling whose enlightened mind can perceive the wisdom of doing what good is in his power in the expectation of preparing the way for more who if he stoops for a moment from the known dignity of his principles does it only to rise with a greater effort and who when he cannot promote the interests of virtue will at least take care that he is not seduced into the ranks of her enemies the approbation and support of such a man and of the few who have on this occasion followed his example will to your own mind be a sufficient compensation and may safely be taken as a decisive proof of the rectitude and necessity of your measures in opposition to the mixed majority of overvirtuous and overvicious who by different roads met in monstrous alliance at the same part of the circle and equally contributed to overturn a measure calculated to produce the utmost degree of practicable at least if not of possible good  i cannot sir conclude without again expressing my thanks for your indulgence to my hasty remarks of which i am the more sensible as i perceive from your address to the house how little you stood in need of them i shall not however regret the few hours devoted to them as they have been honored with an approbation with which i cannot but be highly gratified and have afforded me an opportunity of expressing the thorough sense i have of the rectitude and firmness of your public conduct both on this and former occasions  i can have no objection to your converting my remarks to any purpose in which they can be in any degree useful but as my name can give them no additional weight i must beg you will permit it to remain unknown  i am etc   no ii p    peculium cest le fonds que celui qui est en puissance dautrui comme un fills de famille ou un esclave peut acquerir par sa propre industry sans

and worn out negroes from infesting the towns streets and highways of this island   preamble whereas it has for some time past been the cruel practice of some persons possessing negroes who from their old age and infirmities are incapable of further service to their inhuman owners to drive them from their plantations to beg steal or starve which said unhappy objects are daily infesting the public streets of the several towns in this island greatly to the annoyance and nuisance of the inhabitants thereof  to prevent such inhuman practices for the future so disgraceful and dangerous to the country be it therefore enacted etc that the owner or owners of any distempered maimed or worn out negro etc suffering such distempered negro etc to infest the towns streets lanes public highways or avenues leading to the several towns of this island upon notice or summons acquainting the owner with the nuisance the public sustain thereby the said owner of such slave not removing the same within

maimed or worn out slave or slaves to be immediately removed and conveyed to the owner or owners of such slave or slaves or to his her or their habitation or place of residence and pay the charges and expenses thereof with or out of the said penalty of five pounds one third of the overplus if any be of the said sum to be applied to the use of the constable or person who shall apprehend such distempered maimed or worn out slave or slaves and the other two thirds to be placed in the public treasury etc  n b by the prudent provisions of this act the nuisance is removed out of the streets like a dunghill or a carcass but what becomes of it the living negro is apprehended as a criminal and sent back to his cruel and inhuman owner as to the penalty of five pounds the constable receives one third the remainder goes to the treasury but not one penny to the distempered maimed worn out and starving slave  the practice for which this remedy is provided seems to have been taken from the

that whereas many heinous and grievous crimes such as murder etc are many times committed by negro mulatto mustees or indian slaves or are many times maliciously attempted by them to be committed in

wilfully maim kill and destroy horses cattle sheep or other things of the value of six shillings or above or are accessory to the committing of such crimes as are beforementioned which several

compensation therefore and the person or persons so killing as aforesaid is and are hereby indemnified of and from any fine forfeiture or punishment for so doing unless it can be made appear that such slave or slaves so killed or wounded was or were known to the person or persons so killing and wounding not to be run away or that such killing and wounding was wantonly done and that there was no resistance in either of such cases then the inference is that the owner of the slave killed or wounded would be entitled to recover a compensation from the party killing or wounding but the party really injured the hunted persecuted wounded destroyed slave is in no better plight his fate is at all events matter of perfect indifference to these humane legislators they do not condescend even to

not provide sufficiently for their slaves or allow them time to plant and provide for themselves contrary to law and yet the safety of this island requires that such slaves should suffer or otherwise they would commit the greatest outrages and their masters and owners be encouraged in their neglect at the public charge be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid that the justices at the same time of trying any slave accused of robbery shall inquire by witnesses examined on their oaths how the owner or owners of such slaves was provided with provisions and other necessaries and what
