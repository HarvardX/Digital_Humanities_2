the family instructor in three parts i relating to fathers and children ii to masters and servants iii to husbands and wives   the second edition  corrected by the author  london printed for eman matthews at the bible in paternoster row       the preface the first edition of this work was so ill printed and by reason of the authors absence from the press was so uncorrect that it stood more than ordinarily in need of the help of a good introduction yet it is hoped the work has not dishonored the reverend person who did it the favor to give it the first recommendation  the usefulness of the subject and the honesty of the design has prevailed to give it a good reception in the world and notwithstanding the casual imperfections of the first part some good men have been pleased to accept the performance to usher it into the world much to its advantage and to recommend it as well from the pulpit as from the press  the unworthy author earnestly desired and to his utmost endeavored to be for ever concealed not that he was ashamed of the work or sees any reason yet to be so professing to have a firm belief that he was not without a more than ordinary presence and assistance of the divine spirit in the performance but being fully satisfied with the prospect of doing good by it he desired his praise might not be of men but of god  to this end he took such measures at first for effectually preserving the secret and for his entire remaining in the obscurity he desired that for some time after the publication he continued unguessd at and he flattered himself for a while that the author would be no farther enquired into but satan hindered  the success of the work and the many testimonies given to the good effect it has had in families notwithstanding their knowledge of the author has fully delivered him from the discouragement he was under on that occasion and this alone has prevailed with him for a second edition which he had for sometime resolved against it was not without reason that he had great apprehensions least some men suffering their prejudices to prevail even over their zeal for public good might be tempted to lay the imperfections of the author of this book as a stumbling block in the way of those who might otherwise receive benefit by it and so the good effect of his labor might be in part obstructed  but god who as before he firmly believes directed his hand in the work has given his visible blessing to it and has thereby from heaven owned the author to his inexpressible satisfaction and joy to his name be all the praise  after this let who will reject him or his book it is not possible to give him the least disturbance  after this if any man will rob himself or any one else of the good this work might otherwise do at his door be the sin  the present edition is more carefully corrected and the errors of the press are so few and of so small consequence that an ordinary judgment will correct them in the reading  the author in revising it has made no additions thinking his first design fully exhausted and also esteeming it injurious to those who have bought the first to make a second edition vary so much from it as to make them think their money lost and to oblige them to buy it over again  some few things are omitted indeed but not considerable and those principally in the notes from the mere sense the author had of the comments being less beautiful than the text and that others are able to make better annotations than himself  the whole work being designed both to divert and instruct the author has endeavored to adapt it as much as possible to both those uses from whence some have called it a religious play  it would more have answered that title had the authors first design been pursued which was to have made it a drammatick poem but the subject was too solemn and the text too copious to suffer the restraint on one hand or the excursions on the other which the decoration of a poem would have made necessary  as to its being called a play be it called so if they please it must be confessed some parts of it are too much acted in many families among us the author wishes that either all our plays were as useful for the improvement and entertainment of the world or that they were less encouraged  the same reasons which obliged the author to conceal his name at the first publication prevails with him to forbear it now so that though he neither declines owning the work or being known by his name yet referring it to providence he leaves the discovery to go no farther than others think fit to carry it  the familyinstructor part i the introduction to the first part catechizing of children and instructing them in the principles of the christian religion has been a practice in the church as ancient as religion it self and besides the nature of the thing which requires it was deduced from that strict injunction laid upon the children of israel deuteronomy     and thou shall teach them diligently unto thy children speaking of the laws and statutes which god then commanded moses and again deuteronomy     but teach them to thy sons and thy sons sons  it is not the design of this undertaking to give a list of authorities in scripture for catechizing and instructing of children or the commendations and testimonies given there to those that did instruct their children in the knowledge and practice of religion that eminent text is sufficient to this being the blessed character given to abraham from god himself i know abraham says the lord genesis       that he will command his children and his household after him etc  but we live in an age that does not want so much to know their duty as to practice it not so much to be taught as to be made obedient to what they have already learnt and therefore i shall take up no time in proving this matter to be a duty there is hardly a wretch so hardened but will readily acknowledge it  but we are i say arrived at a time in which men will frankly own a thing to be their duty which at the same time they dare omit the practice of and innumerable arts shifts and turns they find out to make that omission easy to themselves and excusable to others  one part of this work is pointed at such if possible to make them blush at their unacountable rashness and to shame them out of such a fordid inconsistent course as that of living in the allowed omission of what they acknowledge to be their duty  the way i have taken for this is entirely new and at first perhaps it may appear something odd and the method may be contemned but let such blame their own more irregular tempers that must have every thing turned into new models must be touched with novelty and have their fancies humored with the dress of a thing so that if it be what has been said over and over a thousand times yet if it has but a different colored coat or a new feather in its cap it pleases and wins upon them whereas the same truths written in the divinest style in the world would be flat stale and unpleasant without it  if then after all the pains which have been taken by ministerial labor and instruction and by the pressing exhortations and moving arguments of eminent divines even of all opinions in their writings on this subject this mean and familiar method should by its novelty prevail this will be a happy undertaking but no reproach at all to the labors of others  in the pursuit of this book care is taken to avoid distinctions of opinion as to church of england or dissenter and no offense can be taken here either on the one side or the other as i hope both are christians so both are treated here as such and the advice is impartially directed to both without the least distinction  if those who call themselves christians and protestants will not instruct their children and servants here they will find their children and servants instructing them and reproving them too and both they and their children may here meet with instructions together  the father represented here appears knowing enough but seems to be one of those professing christians who acknowledging god in their mouths yet take no effectual care to honor him with their practice that live in a round of religion as a thing of course have not the power of godliness nor much of the form a kind of a negative christian a godithank thee pharisee found in knowledge but negligent in conversation orthodox in opinion but hetrodox in practice and that i have found out such a person is to signify that let him be where he will and who he will this work is calculated to reprove and admonish him  the mother here represented is likewise a formal looseliving christian a protestant professor of religion without the practice of it but yet she is a professor one that knows how to talk of religion and makes a show to belong to it but  alas for the rest the consequence will appear in the book in which i doubt a great many may see their own picture drawn may the sight of it have the same healing convincing efficacy as appears upon the persons here whose story is therefore brought for an example to them  may they see it and blush like the father here mentioned like him may they be ashamed of their likeness may they see it and like him effectually reform the dreadful practice this would completely answer the end and design of the author of this book and rejoice the hearts of all serious christians in the nation  the child who is here made the inquirer has no questions put into its mouth but what are natural and rational consistent with principle and as near as could be are such as are proper even to a child none but what the author wishes every body would put seriously to themselves as often as they look about them in the world and none but what even a child is capable to enquire into the author has endeavored to produce the questions with an air of mere nature innocence and childhood yet such as being naturally adapted to the general state of things may be apposit and direct such as being the mere product of the most common reasonings and even of the understanding of children a childs understanding may justly be supposed to have proposed them  though much of the story is historical and might be made appear to be true in fact yet the author resolving not to give the least hint that should lead to persons has been obliged to leave it uncertain to the reader whether it be a history or a parable believing it may be either way adapted to the sincere design which is   to reprove those parents who neglect the instruction of their children and   to direct young persons in their first reflections guiding them to enquire about themselves their original their state their progress in this world the reason of their being born into it their passing out of it and which is the main cogitation their condition beyond it  the method is new as is said above but perhaps may be more pleasing any thing or any method if we may but bring the main end to pas viz to bring young and old to set earnestly and heartily about the great work of serving glorifying and obeying the god that made them  the child is supposed to be come up to such years as to be thinking and inquiring suppose about five or six years old and as nature is always prompting the soul to be searching after something which it did not know before so that inquisitive temper is in some sedater than in others however our little child asks but very little of his father but what a child at that age may be very capable of asking  the scene of this little action is not laid very remote or the circumstance obscure the father walking in a field behind his garden finds one of his children wandered out all alone under a row or walk of trees sitting upon a little rising ground by it self looking about and mighty busy pointing this way and that way sometimes up and sometimes down and sometimes to its self so that the father coming unperceived pretty near found the little creature very busy about something he could not tell what when the father after much observation and some surprise discovering himself asks the child what he was doing and so sits down by him which question begins the first dialogue  i was looking up there says the child pointing up in the air  fath well and what did you point thither for and then point to the ground and then to your self afterward what was that about   child i was a wondering father   fath at what my dear   child i was wondering what place that is   fath that is the air the sky   child and what is beyond that father   fath beyond my dear why above it all there is heaven   child who lives there father my nurse talks of heaven sometimes and says god is in heaven is that the place up there   fath yes my dear   child why father does god dwell there sure it is a fine place how do we know that he dwells there have you been there eather   fath no my dear but we know it two ways   the scripture tells us heaven is his throne that he has spoken from heaven and has been seen come down from heaven and the son of god was seen to ascend into heaven besides   child he made heaven for his eternal habitation and the making of and preserving all things is a token of his being and of his being god   child but dear father my nurse tells me that god made me too and that was it i was pointing to my self about if god made me how did i come from thence hither father i was a wondering for it is a huge way   fath child god made you by the course of nature having made the whole world at first and all the things therein he gave a command and with that command gave a power to nature to grow and increase by virtue of that command every thing increases and every creature is produced by its own kind but at first all was made by his infinite power who made the whole world   child why father did god make all those creatures we see about us this grass and the trees and these cows and horses and the dogs and cats and every thing   fath yes my dear he made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is as you read in your commandments child   child and what a creature am i father i ant like them i can speak they cannot speak father   fath no child you are not like them god has made you a rational creature and given you a soul   child a soul father what is that   fath it is a part of his own image stamped upon you and the breath of an invisible power by which you can think of things to come and remember things past reflect argue and know both your self and him that made you   child why dear father cannot the horses and cows do so too   fath no child not at all   child why has he made me a better creature than they   fath yes he has and has given them to you for food and service dont you see that we eat them and ride upon them and the like   child i am glad i am made a better creature than they i would thank him for it if i knew how should i not do so father   fath indeed you should child   child but you never told me so before father as i remember   fath not so often as i should have done my child but remember it now my dear  and kisses him child so i will but how must i thank him for it father   fath you must pray to him to bless you child and then give thanks to him for your creation and preservation   child do you do so father   fath yes child   child o ho because i never heard you do so father   fath well but you have been taught   child yes my mother and my nurse taught me to say my prayers but i dont see a word there that thanks god for making me a boy and not a horse or a cow or giving me a soul father   fath but it is included child when in the beginning of your prayers you say our father for god is a father in giving you a soul as well as a creator in making your body   child but may i not say so in my prayers then   fath yes child if you were taught   child indeed i can say that without teaching sure i can thank god for giving me a soul and making me better than the horses and the cows without my nurse i wish i had known it sooner father will not god be angry that i never thanked him for it yet   fath i hope not child since you did not know it   child dear father will not god be angry with you that you never told me before   fath indeed he has reason   child dear father why did you not tell me   here the child cries and the father blushed or at least ought to have done so fath well child do not cry come take care you thank god for it now you do know it   child indeed i will thank him for it for my heart jumps within me to think he has made me better than other creatures   fath my dear child   the father is moved with the childs expressions and kisses him child but dear father if god should be angry with me for not thanking him will he not take this soul away again and turn me into a horse or a cow   fath no child god does not punish that way it is true god may take away the use of it take away the reason or the speech or the senses and leave you in some kind worse than if you had no soul at all he may do all these things and more   child then should not i when i say my prayers remember to pray that god would not be angry that i never thanked him for it before   fath your nurse will teach you to do so   child indeed father i will do that whether my nurse teaches me or no sure if god made me i may pray to him not to be angry with me if you was angry with me father i dont want my nurse to teach me to come and say my dear father do not be angry besides if god has made me so much better than other things will not he teach me to thank him for it   fath i hope he will child   child but dear father wherefore has god made me better than other creatures had he not some reason for doing so   fath no reason child on thy side   child but does not god expect then that i should do something that the cows and horses cannot do is there not something for me to do for it   fath yes indeed there is child   child what is that father for i have been wondering what my business is in this world as well as how i came hither what am i to do here   fath you are to live here to the glory of him that made you   child how is that father   fath you must fear god and keep his commandments   child what the ten commandments father   fath yes my dear   child truly if god has made me and made me better than the rest of his creatures and can take away from me as you said father all that he has given me and make me worse than the cows and the horses sure i should do what he commands me   fath that is true child   child but may not i do more than that may not i love him too father for sure he loves me or else he would not have made me so and given me all this   fath yes child you must love him too   child but father that is not in my commandments will not god be angry with me if i should love him   fath no child to obey god and to fear god is to love god for to fear him as your father and to serve him as your father is to fear and serve him as a child and that is to love him dont you love me my dear   child yes dear father   fath why do you do what i bid you and why do you cry when i am angry with you   child because i love you dear father   fath so if you fear god and serve god as your father and as his child that is loving him for they that love him keep his commandments   child indeed i think it need not be put into my commandments for sure when we know what he has done for us to make us souls and not make us like the horses and cows we must needs love him dont you love him father   fath yes my dear   child and do not every body else love him father   fath no child a great many wicked children and wicked people dont love him   child and has he given them souls too father and made them better than the beasts as he has done for me   fath yes child   child but sure they do not know it then   fath they do not think of it as thou do my dear   child t may be their fathers and mothers never told them of it father as you do me now   fath they dont so much as they should nor so soon as they should   child i wish you had told me of it sooner father   fath i hope it is not too late now child   child but father if those wicked children do not love god nor thank god for giving them souls and making them better creatures than the horses and cows is not god angry with them for it   fath yes my dear child god is very angry with them   child but why does he not take away their souls again and turn them into horses and cows or take away the use of their reason and leave them worse than the beasts as you said he could do father sure god is not angry with them at all   fath yes my dear god is angry with them for all that but he lets them go on sometimes till they amend and repent and turn to god again and then he forgives them other times he lets them run on and grow worse and punishes them for all together at last   child that is a sad thing father sure god is very angry when he lets them go on and takes no care of them father is nt he   fath yes indeed it is a sign of his severest anger when he lets them go on and does not punish them till last for it is a signal that he has no thought of mercy in store for them   child and when god leaves them so are they not sorry for it father   fath no no they always grow worse and worse till they grow mere reprobates and hardened against him that made them   child they are sad folks indeed but father does not god destroy them at last   fath he does worse child he punishes them everlastingly in hell   child dear father dont let me make god angry with me as they do will not you tell me what i must do to save me from gods being angry   fath yes i will child   child but you never did yet father i am afraid he is angry with me already for i am almost six years old and never thanked him nor loved him nor feared him nor nothing father he has let me alone and let me go on just as you say he does the wicked folks i am sure he must be angry with me and he will punish me everlastingly in hell as you said father o what must i do   here conviction works in the child the child weeps fath why child did you not do all this   child dear father i never knew what god was or what he had done for me you never told me a word of him in all my life till now i never heard you pray to him in all my life i know nothing of him how should i father   fath but child your nurse and your mother taught you that god made you   child yes but they never told me what god was and what he had done for me and what i was to do again i thought nothing not i father i lived just as i saw you live father i never prayed to god in all my life father   fath why child did not your mother teach you to say your prayers every night and morning   child yes father i said the prayers over but i never thought a word what they meant i only said them by rote sure god does not take notice of that does he father if he does our parrot can pray as well as i   fath true child god requires the heart and regards no prayers but what the heart joins in   child you say i may pray to god for what i want and i may thank him for making me and for making me better than the horses and cows   fath yes i do say so   child but father am i to do nothing else did god make me for nothing have i no other business now i am made what do other folks do that are made as i am   fath yes child you were made to serve him  you know your catechize   child what is that the questions and answers my nurse taught me   fath yes the questions and answers there you are told your business here is to serve god   child dear father did god make me to serve him   fath yes child he made you to serve him   child and do you serve him father  what is it to serve him how must i do it i would fain serve him because he has made me and made me better than the horses and cows   here the father weeps and speaking to himself with a sigh says lord how this child is made to sting my soul to the quick god knows i have neither served him nor taught these dear little creatures to do it as i should have done the father was so struck with the childs question viz  do you serve him father that he gives no present answer and the little inquisitive creature goes on again  child dear father may not i be taught how to serve god   fath yes my dear says the father   child will you teach me father   fath yes child   child why you never did yet father may be i bent big enough yet when shall i be big enough father when i am a man   fath you may learn to serve god though you are a child   child does my brother know how to serve god father he is a great boy and i never saw you teach him  can you teach me father   fath god will teach you himself child   child god teach me himself how can that be   fath he has many was of teaching child viz by his word his ministers and his spirit   child what are they father you said just now you would teach me   fath i may teach you too child but the word of god is given to teach you ministers are sent to instruct by that word and parents are ministers of god to instruct their families and children and the spirit of god is given to seal the instruction and make it effectual   child do the fathers teach their children   fath yes it is their duty to do so   child and be they ministers to their families   fath so far as to instruct and teach their children they are my dear   child and when will you be a minister father that i may be instructed how to serve god   fath my dear i am so much a minister at any time   child i wonder   fath what do you wonder at my dear   child dear father you say the fathers are to teach their children and are ministers to their families and you are a minister and yet i was never taught i wonder what all this is for i have never been taught any thing but to play and sing the song my nurse teaches me and read in my sisters songbook   fath well my dear you shall not want teaching   child will you teach me to serve god father   fath yes my dear   child i am glad of it i would fain serve god father for i conviction of sin thus working up to a love to god a fear of god and a desire of serving god which is holiness may be very well allowed here to be an appearance of converting grace in the heart of a little one the father takes notice of it as such love him already dearly   fath that is a true principle to begin to serve god from my dear for god accepts no fear but what is founded in our love to him pray then my dear that he will increase your love to him that you may serve him acceptably   child but dear father you say god dwells up there in heaven how can he hear what i say i cannot speak loud enough to be heard so far and then though god could hear me how does he know when i speak as my heart means   fath yes child god can hear and know for he is infinite   child what is that father   fath why child it takes in all the attributes of god   child i dont know them hard words father pray who is god and what is he cannot you tell me father so as i may understand it   fath it is very hard to give a description of god to thy understanding my dear   child and that is the reason you never said any thing of him to me father is it not must not i know who god is till i am a man father   fath yes child the scripture says remember thy greator in the days if thy youth   child but dear father how shall i remember him i never heard any thing of him you never told me a word of him yet may be i ant a youth yet i long to be a youth father then you will tell me who god is that i may remember him father will not you   fath dear child you ought to have been told who god is before now indeed i have neglected to instruct thee as i ought to have done but i will tell thee now my dear   child int it too late father o why would you neglect it father was you angry with me and would not instruct me father what if god should let me go on now and punish me ever lastingly as you said i wish you had not neglected it father   fath no child it is not too late as you shall know by and by   child tell me then father what is god i would fain know god cannot i see him to be sure i should know him if i could see him   fath no child you cannot see him no mortal eye has seen god at any time   child how shall i know then what he is   fath you must know god by the scripture by reading and by meditating on the revelation he has given of himself there you must read of him in your bible   child but father i cannot know him by reading my book i have read my book often but i know nothing about god cannot you tell me what god is father   fath no words can express his being or describe him   child how shall i know then by reading father   fath i mean child no words can express it fully but the spirit of god expounds the word of god to us and by that spirit he teaches us the knowledge of himself   child but you can tell me something of him father you say he dwells up there what is he like father   fath god is one infinite eternal incomprehensible invisible being the first cause of all things the giver of life and being to all things existing prior and therefore superior to all things infinitely perfect great holy just wise and good   child these are all hard words father how shall i understand them what do you mean by that word infinite for i see you put that in among the rest over and over   fath why child infinite is a word to signify something beyond all that is known and can only be described in thought and those thoughts only describe it by acknowledging that they cannot describe it but thus much you may understand by it  that god was before all things and shall continue after them that he had power to make all things and by the same power preserves and maintains all things and at last will put all things to an end of the particulars you may understand thus that he is infinitely great signifies that he has made thee my dear and all the people in the world that he is infinitely wise signifies that he knows every thought in the heart and that implies that he hears every word that is spoken and sees every action that is done though never so secret that he is infinitely holy and just signifies that he hates all that is evil and will punish it that he is infinitely good signifies that he loves every good action and will reward it that he is infinitely powerful signifies that all other powers move and act by him for by him we live and moe and have our being do thou know him child by this description   child i am wondering father i dont say i know but i wonder i am afraid i tremble father sure god is very dreadful   fath he is so child   child does he never speak father cannot i hear him speak   fath his voice is terrible and he is a consuming fire thou can not hear him speak my dear   child my nurse said father that when it thundered it was god spoke what is the thunder and lightning father is that god   fath no my dear it is the work of god as all the rest of the creation is his work but no otherwise the voice of god is compared to thunder indeed but god speaks to us in another kind of voice than that   child what voice is that father   fath the voice of the gospel and the voice of his creatures   child what is that father i never heard it may i hear that voice i would fain hear god speak father for i would do what he bids me and never make him angry   fath the gospel is the word of god the message of life sent from heaven revealed in the scriptures and preached by his servants the ministers this is the voice i mean child   child i dont understand it father   fath why the bible is the word of god it was dictated by the inspiration of the spirit of god when you read the bible you are to believe that god speaks to you in the words you read this is his voice   child why does god speak to me when i read my book father   fath yes my dear   child but then what if i do not understand it then it is nothing to me how shall i do to know what i read   fath you should be taught my dear   child who should teach me will not god make me understand what he says when i read my book   fath indeed i should have taught thee my dear that is true   the lord pardon me i have too much neglected it says the father aside and turning away his head cannot refrain tears child dear father tell me what does my book say what shall i learn there of god   fath you will learn that god is from the beginning and to the end from everlasting to everlasting has created all things and knows all things   child knows all things that is strange father does god know all things   fath yes my dear   child if god knows all things he knows how old i am and that all this while i never thought of him nor served him and never knew any thing of him till now and he knows father you never told me any thing of him before now sure he is very angry and will punish me what must i do   here the child weeps again fath but god is merciful too child   child what is that father   fath why to those that repent of their sins past and reform their lives he is merciful that is upon their repentance he forgives them for the sake of jesus christ and is reconciled to them as though they had not sinned against him   child jesus christ father who is that   fath he is god   child why father you said god was one first being is there more gods than one is there two firsts my commandments say there is but one god   fath no child there is but one god yet jesus christ is essentially god though in a second person he is god co equal coeternal that is the same in being nature and attributes god manifested in the flesh sent from heaven to redeem a lost world   child i dont understand a word of all that father what does it mean   fath why child you are to understand that when the first man and woman in the world was created god having made a covenant or agreement of holiness and life with them and in them with all that should be born of them they broke that covenant and so involved all their posterity in their guilt the punishment of which was eternal death but god who as i told you child was infinitely good though provoked utterly to destroy the whole race for that sin and being under the engagement of that covenant to do it yet in the mere operation of his own goodness determined to recover sinful men from the gulf of death to make this adequate or suitable to his own infinite justice and holiness he incarnated by a miraculous birth the divine nature into the humane and caused this blessed conjunction to appear in the world in the likeness of sinful flesh so being infinite god on the one hand and man on the other he became capable of being a complete sacrifice for satisfaction of gods justice and afterward suffering the divine wrath made peace for us by the blood of his cross was crucified dead and buried as you say in your creed rose again is ascended into heaven sits at the right hand of power and shall come again to judge us all and this child is called our savior the son of god and is indeed god himself   child i dont know how to understand all this father   fath you must understand it gradually my dear a little at a time you can understand this that we are all under a sentence of death for the first mans sin by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin romans        child that is a strange thing father what are we all condemned to suffer for that mans transgression   fath the scripture is plain in it by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation romans        child but father you said just now god would be reconciled to me if i repented and was sorry for my sins   fath yes child i did so   child but how can that be when you say i shall be condemned for another mans transgression   fath it is very plain that the effect of that first mans sin is a corrupt taint which we all bring into the world with us and which we find upon our nature by which we find a natural propensity in us to do evil and no natural inclination to do good and this we are to mourn over and lament as the fountain of sin from whence all our wicked actions do proceed and this is called indwelling sin   child have i this in me father   fath yes child did you not say how should you do this or that for you were not taught you can be a naughty boy without teaching to sin is natural but you must be instructed and labored with to be a good child to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i know not in me that is in my flesh dwells no good thing romans        child what will become of me then father if i was wicked when i was born   fath this my dear is that which i named jesus christ for   child why what will he do for me   fath he will deliver thee from this body of death who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through or for jesus christ our lord romans           child how can he do this   fath he has delivered us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us and whereas we are not able to perform any thing he has fulfilled all righteousness for us if we believe in him for being justified by faith we have peace with god and so as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners so by the obedience of one christ shall many be made righteous romans        child but father will jesus christ answer for me for that first transgression and take away the sentence you say i was under for if he does not i am undone to be sure i cannot do it my self   fath yes my dear the blood of christ cleanses from all sin as well of nature as of life and there is now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus romans       child and now we are all saved again by this new saviors satisfaction ant we father   fath no child not all we cannot say all are saved but all those who are saved are so saved viz by the satisfaction of the blessed redeemer being chosen from eternity by the mere grace and good will of god to whom after they come into the world god of the same grace gives repentance and faith sanctifies and justifies them and then accepts them for the sake of the savior of the world   child so there is none saved but such as god has chosen again out of the rest   fath we have no warrant to say any other are saved and yet we dare not say who shall not be saved   child but who are they then that are chosen father dont you know their names   fath no child god has left that uncertain to us   child but dear father i would fain know if my name be among them for what will become of me if i should not be one of them   fath i hope thou art child god has not let us know who are shut out but by their shutting out themselves   child but is there no way to know father   fath why child it may be presumptively known by this that since to all that god has thus chosen he by his spirit gives faith and repentance sanctification in heart and justification of person whoever the spirit of god works this faith and repentance in have a very good assurance that they are in the number the spirit witnessing with their spirit that they are the sons of god romans        child but how shall i know if i have faith and repentance what are they father i never heard of them in my life you never told me a word of them before   fath repentance child is a sense of and sincere sorrow for sin in all its parts as well original as actual and this sorrow must be always attended with a sincere desire of pardon and sanctification and earnest endeavors after reformation and amendment and faith child is a fidutial fillial confidence in the promises of god and consequently in god himself thereby humbly realizing and appropriating to our selves the whole purchase of the death of jesus christ with a relying upon his merits resting on him and adhering to him for life and salvation   child i shall never remember all this father how did you come to remember it did your father only tell it you as you do me are there no books that teach it me if not will not you write it down for me father you know i can read   fath it is all written down already child and you have it every word in your bible   child i do remember something father of adam and eve there were they the folks that sinned first father   fath yes child and have not you read of jesus christ   child yes father but i do not understand a word of him no body ever taught me besides i have heard my brother cry o jesus and o christ at his play and nurse chid him for it and said it was a naughty word   fath your brother is a naughty boy and should be whipped when he uses those words   child who should whip him father you dont   fath but i shall if i hear him say so again   child but why father if jesus christ be god how is it a naughty word   fath it is a naughty profane thing to name his name on slight occasions that name should only be named with fear and reverence and on a serious occasion as we use it now my dear your commandments say you must not take the lords name in vain that is upon common occasions such as passion play imprecation profane cursing swearing and the like   child but who is this jesus christ father i have never heard any thing of him before but only his name   fath he is god manifested in the flesh and the son of god sent down from heaven to die for sinners and to save us from eternal death here the child is silent and tears fall from its eyes    fath dont cry my dear why do cry   child i must cry dear father there is something bids me cry i cannot tell what you say at all father but my heart beats i am frighted die for sinners jesus christ god god and yet die and die for sinners what is all this am i a sinner   fath yes my dear all of us are sinners   child what and did god die for me jesus christ die for me   the child trembles and cries the father weeps too and kisses it moved to see the spirit of god visibly working in the heart of the little creature fath yes my dear and will save thee i hope for he is thy redeemer   child then god is not angry with me for my fault in not knowing him sooner   fath no my dear he is reconciled by jesus christ who died to bring thee to god to make peace for thee by the blood of his cross and procure pardon for all thy faults   child how does he do it   fath he gives repentance and remission have you not read in your bible of repentance my dear   child i dont know i believe i have but no body told me any thing what it is and i do not remember   father is all that in my book too   fath yes my dear i will show it thee there and explain it to thee thou shall not want teaching any longer if thou will but learn   child indeed i will learn it father with all my heart shall i know what god is and what jesus christ is if i learn my book father   fath yes child all that i have told thee and a great deal more is there my dear and you must read the bible and there you will learn it all   child did you learn it all there father   fath yes my dear   child but did your father never show you where to find it and tell you what it meant for i have read a deal in that book father but i never knew what it meant and you never showed it me father you know it was not my fault dear father was it you know i am but a child   fath that is true child you will understand it better when you are a man   child but father could not i understand it now if i were showed i begin to understand a great deal of what you say that i am born with a wicked heart and that if i do not repent and believe in christ god who is angry with all sinners will judge me at last and punish me everlastingly and father i understand now by what you said before that god has been very good to me and has made me a better creature than the horses and the cows and given me a soul father and all this makes me love him and you say it is lawful for me to love him and i am sorry i have not loved him before and afraid he should be angry with me that i have not thanked him before for what he did for me and would ask him forgiveness if i knew how now father you say this faith and repentance is to be learnt out of this book but should i not have somebody to teach me the meaning of it and may i not be taught the meaning of it father though i be not a man what if i should die and never be a man what will become of me then father dear father will not you teach me the meaning of this book before i am a man   fath yes child i will teach it thee now as far as i can but you must read your bible too my dear   child what is this book father that i call my bible who made it   fath it is the word of god written by himself   child what did god print it for us himself father   fath no child god did not print it or write it on the paper that is not the case it was first written by holy men of god but it was dictated to them by the immediate inspiration of the holy ghost   child the holy ghost father what is that   fath why that is god   child dear father you said first there was but one god then you said jesus christ was god now you say the holy ghost is god are there three gods i remember my commandment says thou shall have none other gods but me   fath no child there are not three gods god is but one infinite and undivided being but the godhead is received and understood by us in three persons the father the son and the spirit and these three are one god the maker and judge of all   child i wonder   fath what do you wonder at child   child when you speak of god i can do nothing but wonder i cannot think of god he is a great something from whom i am and for whom i am and to whom i am but i cannot tell what god is i wonder   fath he is incomprehensible child you cannot by searching find out god but in this book the bible you may learn enough to save you and bring you to him   child may i father then i will get it all without book   fath it is not so much the getting the words by heart child as getting the word of life wrought in your heart   child how is that father   fath why child to have the spirit of god which wrote that word print it in your mind and give you understanding both to read and obey it   child and will he do that for me father then i shall not want you to teach me but how if he will not teach me father   fath you must pray to god to open your understanding and give you the teaching of his spirit for he has promised in his word that he will give his spirit to those that ask it   child has he promised that then i will read the bible every day shall not i father   fath yes child by all means   child and every time i open the book should i not pray for the teaching of his spirit to instruct me   fath yes child and to guide and keep you in his way   child why can the spirit do that too father   fath do that child the spirit of god is god and therefore can do all things but it is the peculiar work of the spirit in this case the spirit is your sanctifier it is the light of your paths it works faith and gives repentance it puts every good thing into you and works every good work for you it gives a saving efficacy to every ordinance it brings you to christ to rely on him for salvation and he brings you to god the father whose acceptance in christ is your life   child and will this spirit be had by praying to god for it   fath yes child for you cannot pray to god in faith without the help of the spirit and when the spirit works in you a disposition to pray it cannot but answer its own image and the breathings of the soul which its self has created for the longing soul shall be satisfied   child but father you say the spirit of god has given the word which you say is the bible for my teaching and yet you say the spirit teaches what do they both teach the same thing   fath child the bible is your rule of life though the spirit is the secret instructor the scripture is the key of instruction there you are to learn how god is to be worshipped how to order your conversation aright how to perform your duty and what it is the lord thy god requires of thee there you have an historical account of the whole world of its creation the fall the first condemnation of it to a general deluge typical of the great deluge of gods wrath which shall drown all ungodly men for ever there you have the history of gods church from the beginning to the fullness of time and the fullfilling old testament types and old testament promises there you have the history of our savior of his miraculous conception and birth holy life wondrous doctrine stupendous miracles his death passion resurrection and glorious ascension there you have an account of the first mission of the holy ghost and at last the whole doctrine of the gospel of truth founded upon the redemption purchased by christ there you have the whole mystery of godliness unfolded the great wonder of wonders the immortal to die and the eternal to begin the great destruction of sin the condemnation of the devil and the salvation of the world  all this is to be seen in the bible which being the word of god you are to read it with reverence regard it with faith as the word of god and obey it as your rule   child and to pray for the spirit to help me to do so must i not father for you told me i could not believe or understand it without the spirit to assist me   fath that is true child   child but father are you sure that the bible is the word of god   fath yes child very sure of it   child and that the spirit of god can only teach us to understand it   fath yes child   child why dont the minister understand it and teach folks to understand it what do they go to church for   fath the ministers are called ministers of the word that is expounders of the scriptures and the preaching of the gospel is one of the ordinary means as the reading the word is another by which the blessed spirit of god instructs the hearts of his people and turns them to himself reading the word written that is the bible and hearing the word preached that is the sermons preached by gods ministers are the common methods appointed by which the knowledge of god is conveyed to us   child then i must go to church and hear the minister preach as well as read the bible   fath yes child   child why father my mother has carried me to church a great many times but i thought i was carried there only to show my new coat and my fine hat i dont know what the man said when i went   fath but you were a naughty boy then you should have minded what he said you were not carried there to show your fine clothes   child why father i thought so for when it rained and i could not wear my best clothes my mother would not let me go out or when the wind blowed the powder out of my hair my mother would not let me go and i heard you say father last sunday that you could not go to church because the barber had not brought your new perriwig home and another sunday for want of a pair of gloves you staid at home and played with me all sunday long or lay down on the couch to sleep i thought father i had gone thither for nothing but to show my fine clothes   fath no child there is other work to be done there   child what father to remember what fine clothes other folks have on is not that it i know my sisters go to church and they do nothing but look about them to see how every body is dressed and when they come home my mother and they you know father take up the whole night in telling one another what every body had on and they do it so well i wondered father and i thought i would try if i could do so too but i could not remember half of it   fath they might have been better employed my dear   child what my mother indeed father i thought it had been all they went for and i could not think any thing else you know when my mother did so too i am sure my mother would not have done so if it had not been good for it is my dear mother and i love her dearly and i am sure she would not do a naughty thing   o see here the mischief of evil examples in parents fath well child thou will know better in time the business of going to church is quite of another nature it is to hear the word of god expounded and preached and it is hearing for thy life it is a duty in the ministers to preach they were first sent by our savior himself who appointed apostles and prophets for the work of the ministry and gave them their errand in his command gapreach the gospel to every creature and it is a duty in us to hear and to hear diligently and not toforsake assembling our selves together   child why father you seldom go your self it is only for little boys to learn then is it   fath no child it is every ones duty to hear the word preached and to mix it with faith in the hearing   child then you will let me go to church will not you father for sometimes my mother will not let me go to church if it be but a little ill weather and if a little wind does but blow and if god requires me to go and my mother will not let me what must i do will not god be angry with me for not going to hear his word preached   fath if your mother will not let you go then child it is none of your fault   child but will not god be angry with my mother dear father for not letting me go that is all one   fath well child be not troubled at that thou shall go to church every day and not be hindered  come my dear thou will catch cold to be so long out let us go in to your mother   the father as may be well imagined warmed with the various thoughts that occurred to him upon this surprising discourse was willing to get the child away that he might give vent to his own mind and bringing the child in walks out again till he was gotten to a retirement and then breaks out in a most passionate manner upon himself giving full vent to his convictions in such a manner as this  what an ungrateful creature have i been to the goodness and bounty of god that goodness and bounty which has given me so much advantage and so many ways to glorify him and honor him in the world and to whom i owe my life my being and well being in the world and how has god reproved me in this little dear creature   wretch that i am how have i lived as without god in the world and in my family that i have not so much as told my children who made them or let them know or guess by my behavior that there is such a thing as a god in the world or that any worship is due to a sovereign almighty being how has this little lamb complained to me that he has never heard me pray to god in all his life and it is but too true how did it reproach me when i spoke to it of jesus christ to hear the little creature say who is that father and of the holy ghost who is that father and of serving god do you serve him father  what a life have i led good lord what have i been doing how shall i account to thee for the souls committed to my charge that i should have the blessing of children given to me and my children have the curse of a prayerless uninstructing father to them    tears followed the parents speech and he prays earnestly to god to forgive him the neglect and omission of his duty to his children and family and enters into a secret engagement between god and his own soul that for the future he will set up the due and daily worship of god in his family and will diligently and carefully instruct his children teaching them the knowledge of god and how to serve him and walk in his ways  after some composure of mind upon this resolution a new trouble breaks in upon him he had elder children than this and he had lived in a continual neglect of his duty either in teaching them the knowledge of god or showing them a religious example these children had contracted a profane habit both in words manners and constant practice had little inclination to religion less knowledge and no thoughts at all about their souls and began to be too old and too big to be wrought upon by instruction or persuasion much less by violence and correction  when this reflection came upon the parents thoughts after the convictions he had met with from the little enquirer aforesaid this brought a second flood of tears from him and he breaks out thus  lord what will become of my poor wretched family my other children my uninstructed unreproved children what an instrument have i been in the ruin of their souls how does it all lie upon me as a weight never to be removed they are grown up yet they know nothing of god but to take his name in vain they neither call upon him nor have i taught them to do so if this poor lamb reproaches me with having never prayed with it or for it and too true it is god knows what may these say to me that have let them go on thus far in a loose profane ignorant irreligious life and have neither reproved or instructed them either by word or example prayed with them or taught them to pray for themselves merciful god why have i not been removed and in mercy to them as well as in judgment to my self been snatched from them that some other person might have been set over them more for the good of their souls  upon these convictions the man prays earnestly to the lord to pardon the heinous offense of his neglecting his duty to his children that god would supply by the teaching of his blessed spirit that great want of familyinstruction in his children which he has been the cause of that he would work convictions upon them and would continue to stir him up to his duty in the future directing teaching and governing his family  but what a hard task he has with his other children and how difficult a work it is to bring children to a sense of god and religion after their green and tender years are past in which they are molded like wax to a seal to receive such first impressions as the persuasion and example of parents are apt to make will be apparent in the following dialogues  end of the first dialogue notes on the first dialogue the observing reader will see here that the author to observe a just equality between all opinions and in order to make this work generally useful and acceptable to all denominations of christians and to all among them who seriously apply themselves to the great business of their eternal salvation has kept himself in the answers to this little childs enquiry to the plain general principles of the christian religion wherein he has neither prescribed himself in method or in words to the catechisms of either the church of england the assemblys catechism or any other but laid down the principles of religion consonant to them all as plainly as he could as they are deduced from the holy scriptures and as they agree with the several confessions of faith and doctrinal articles as well of the church of england as of all the protestant churches and congregations in europe who profess the same faith believe the same god and hope for eternal life through faith in the same ever blessed intercessor and redeemer  if any particular christians opinion may carry them further or not so far as the author has expressed himself here in the doctrines of original sin election of grace repentance and faith in christ he prays that while they can allow what is laid down here to be orthodox in the substance they will extend the same charity to his design as he does to their opinion viz to leave room for further explanations to judge the best and to consider that as this part is spoken to a child and is for children to read for their instruction it requires to be plain and concise and so be it that it be essentially right the more adapted it is to the meanest understandings the better it answers the design of this undertaking  some may think the child here is brought in too often falling upon the father with a charge of not instructing him and not praying with him and not telling him these things sooner but to such it may be sufficient to say that as this is one of the great designs of this work and is not spoken so directly to in any other part it required to be more than ordinarily pointed out here especially because that upon these iittle reprehensions of this infant are grounded the several most considerable parts of the dialogues which follow in the first part as particularly the convictions wrought by it upon the father mentioned at the end of the dialogue where he is brought in retiring himself to give vent to his soul in reflecting on the breach of his duty and in prayer to god also the concurring convictions wrought by the same method and by the same instrument upon the mother as in the second dialogue and more especially the resolution of both to reform themselves and to do their duties more effectually in their families  these appearing as is observed to be the main design of this first part and indeed something of this running through the whole course of the work it could not but be needful to let those little sharp reproofs innocently expressed by the little child in the first dialogue be often repreated especially where the sense brought them in with a kind of natural unconstrained innocence in the expression as is generally carefully ordered wherever those reproofs are to be met with nor indeed could the expressions of the parents either in their private ejaculations or mutual conversing upon that part one with another have been consonant to the rest of the work or the cadence of things preserved if this had not been laid as a foundation  these notes are not designed to talk over again the whole subject of every discourse if the parts deserve any comment every considering christian will make it to themselves as they go but where the case is particular a word may be said which in the dialogues would have been digresling too long and have made it tedious  from the enquiries of the child may be observed how naturally the connection of gospel truths one with another appears i mean those essential to our salvation how bright a chain and how closely hanging one upon another in a climax that cannot but be admirable to observe is the great mystery of mans fall and recovery sin entering into the world death by sin nature corrupted by the fall sanctified by redeeming grace by the offense of one man many made sinners by the obedience of one many made righteous justice offended by sin eternal death denounced as the punishment justice satisfied by a redeemer eternal life the consequence no condemnation to them who are in christ these things lie so plain so natural and in so exact an order that nature seems to direct the child who knows nothing of them to force them from the father by the power of the most innocent uninstructed enquiries  how unaccountably to blame are those parents who let their children know nothing of these things till their own little innocent enquiries extort it from them  how naturally does the discourse of this little child reprove parents for their neglect of the sabbath days work viz of attending the public worship of god and how could the child but suppose that going to church was only a light matter since his father very seldom went himself and stayed at home upon the most frivolous occasions  the childs discourse about going to church only to show his fine clothes and his mother and sisters being chiefly employed there to observe the fashions and dresses of their neighbors with the conversation they have of those things after they come home needs no enlargements here the consciences of most young people in our own families will teach them to apply that part to themselves and the author is content to leave it out if it is not generally acknowledged to be a needful reproof the child is brought in here several times saying to his father when he speaks of serving loving and praying to god do you do so father this puts me in mind of a story not improper to be related a wicked boy that had been addicted to swearing and ill words was reproved by his father with more seriousness than usual and his father toid him that god heard him the father it seems was a man of no religion or atleast of very ill morals himself but what he happened to say to the boy struck him so deeply that it was a means of conviction to the child but ignorance having been the boys greatest unhappiness when he came to consider of what his father had said he asks one of the family whether god could see as well as hear when he was answered yes that god was infinite and could hear and see all things he told them he could not believe it for my father was drunk last night says he sure he would not have been drunk if god could see him else why did he tell me i should not swear because god could hear me  if parents knew or at least considered the influence their evil examples have upon their children and how fatal an encouragement to sin it is to any children to be able to say my father does so himself the presence of their children would be a greater restraint to conscientious parents even in things in themselves indifferent much more in things really sinful than it is possible the presence and awe of the parent can be to the children it is enough that religious parents have to struggle with in the perverse and wicked inclinations of their children but they will find those liberties their children take from the encouragement of their parents example will be ten times more difficult to restrain afterward than those they have from their own inclination or the example of others it ennervates all the exhortations of a father takes the edge off from their reprehension makes their resentment seem unjust and unreasonable and makes the child rather apt to retort the practice of the parent upon themselves than receive patiently and meekly the admonition  i humbly recommend this thought to those parents who indulge themselves in any vanities or excesses such as in passion in hasty expressions in expenses in waste of time in ill words in gaming nay or any of those things which the world are apt to call lawful and innocent if such things must be indulged and you will allow your selves in them upon a presumption that you can do them innocently at least then conceal them from your children lest what you can use with moderation they fall into with excess and justify the practice from your example  it will be a very uncomfortable reflection and will fill the mind with bitter reproaches if ever god pleases to try such parents when they shall see the introduction to their childrens ruin formed and begun in their  the parents example nor will it be any alleviation to their sorrow to say i used those diversions moderately and kept my self within compass it was but very seldom that i used an ill word i played at cards but very moderately and never for much money i seldom drank hard and the like our moderation in diversions shall introduce our childrens excess and if the apostle rather than offend a weak brother would wholly abstain even from part of his necessary sustenance viz eating of flesh how much more should parents refrain their excesses nay even their lawful diversions rather than lay a foundation of the ruin of their children and prompt them to sin by giving them a pretense from or encouragement by their fathers example  from the whole of this dialogue parents may see besides their duty to god what they owe to their children in timely and early instructing them how much instructing our children is a debt to them and how unjust and injurious we are to our children in omitting to instruct them what moving expressions of the child to the father are these dear father says the child why would you not tell me of it before was you angry with me father and what if it should be too late now will not god punish me everlastingly now because i have not known this sooner how cutting must it be to a parent that has any sense of eternity to think that his dear children should be lost by his example or remain blind by his omission  these and many other observations might be made here from the particulars of this first dialogue but it is hoped the reading the dialogue its self will cause many of them to occur and the brevity of this work admits not our notes to be too long  the second dialogue this dialogue begins upon the following occasion the next day after the former discourse with the father the child was carried to church and the minister happened to be preaching upon the death of our savior his text was god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son etc and the minister giving some historical account of the death and sufferings of christ and making some practical improvements of it in his discourse the child when he came home was found crying in a room by its self and the mother being called begins the dialogue thus  moth child what do cry for  after some difficulty the child answers the minister made him cry   moth how so why what did he say   child he said that god was dead   moth child he did not say any such thing you have forgot what he said   child no i have not mother i am sure he said jesus christ was dead and my father told me yesterday that jesus christ was god   moth but child jesus christ is risen again   child i know that he said so too but he was dead first and the wicked jews killed him sure they were sad folks mother why did they kill him   moth you will read it in your bible my dear   child but mother the minister says he died for us and my father said he died for me did the jews kill him for me mother   moth he died for thee my dear and me and every body else that believes in him   child why did he die for me mother i dont know what you mean tell me dear mother did i make him die   moth my dear he died to save his people from their sins and i hope thou art one of them   child why mother have i any sins what are they mother   moth we are all sinners child sin is offending god in thought word and deed at which he is angry   child when i do a fault is god angry for that is that sin mother   moth every fault you do my dear is not a sin against god   child when did i make god angry then   moth when you break any of gods commandments then you sin against god as when you take gods name in vain when you disobey your father and mother and the like these are sins against god and these he is angry at   child i never take gods name in vain mother nor never disobey you mother i love you dearly and do every thing you bid me dont i dear mother   moth well my dear and i hope god is not angry with thee be a good boy then i am not angry with thee my dear   hither the mother speaks coldly and makes slight of the thing and having no other view at first than only quieting the child was for going away at which the child cries again moth why do cry my dear i tell thee i am not angry with thee do not cry   child god may be angry with me for all that mother   moth no no god is not angry with thee do not cry my dear   still the mother is insensible of the work of god in the heart of the child and takes all this for common talk but she soon sees with other eyes child why mother will god never be angry with me but when you are angry i am afraid god is angry with me though you kiss me and be friends with me and love me   moth why so my dear   child why dear mother my father told me yesterday that god has done a great many things for me and given me a great many good things and i never thanked him nor loved him for it yet nor served him nor prayed to him yet and is not god angry with me then   the child weeps moth that is very true my dear but i hope god is not angry do not cry my dear   child but should not i have thanked god for all that is it not a fault mother   moth yes my dear you should have thanked him prayed to him and praised him   child but how should i have done it mother i did not know and the mother was but cold and indifferent all this time but now she found herself tovchd and was confounded with the childs discourse and taking the child in her arms she kissed it and wept but could not speak to it a great while at last she said with great tenderness you never told me and my father never told me nor showed me how will god be angry that i did not thank him when i could not tell how to do it   moth my dear child it is not thy fault it is our fault it is my fault and it is thy fathers fault we have not shown thee nor taught thee nor given any good example to thee how thou should thank god or serve or know god   child yes my father did it last night   moth alas poor child thy father and i too should have done it many nights and years ago more shame for us that we have neglected it till thou should reprove us for it thy self   child but my father said it was not too late now mother   moth i pray god it be not but that is no thanks to us my dear thou may have cause to blame us here the mother finds the heart of the child is touched and it immediately entered into her thoughts that she might be made a temptation to the child to despair and cast off conviction this allarms the mother on the other hand and therefore she adds to thy dying day   child but is it too late for me then mother   moth no my dear god forbid the sin has been ours not thine but it is never too late to pray to god   child what must i do when i pray to god   moth you must confess your sins to him pray to him to forgive your sins to bless you and sanctify you and preserve you you must pray to him to give you your daily bread and keep you from all evil you must give thanks to him for all his mercies and all the good things he has done for you   child must i thank god when i pray mother how can i do so is that praying   moth yes my dear praising god for mercies received is part of the duty of prayer as well as seeking to him for mercies we want for so god has commanded in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving making our requests known unto god   child but if i have made god angry how can i ask him forgiveness will god forgive me   moth yes my dear he will forgive thee he is a merciful god it is his nature and property ever to have mercy and to forgive   child how do you know it are you sure mother that god will forgive me my fault if i ask him forgiveness   moth he has promised to do so my dear   child how mother i never heard him speak did he tell you so mother   moth my dear he has promised in his word it is in your bible which is the word of god   child o i am glad if it is there my father told me that god speaks to me and i hear him speak when i read my book show it me there mother   moth there it is my dear   here the mother shows the child the several texts following whosoever confesses and forsakes shall find mercy if we confess and forsake our sins he is just and faithful to forgive us our sins the blood of christ cleanses from all iniquity child the blood of christ mother what is that  interrupting her moth why my dear this is that the minister made thee cry about jesus christ is that great savior which the minister told thee shed his blood for our sins died and was crucified to save a lost world   child but dear mother my father told me christ was god can god die   moth my child christ was god eternal one with the father but christ to fulfill the great purpose of mans redemption according to the eternal council of god before the world began in the fullness of time became man took upon him not the nature of angels but of the seed of abraham and this he did that he might be godman and therefore be a mediator between god and man partaking of the nature of both and laying his hand upon both to make peace for us through the blood of his cross   child i cannot understand this it is all wonderful a wonderful mystery   moth it is so my dear this is the great mystery of godliness god manifest in the flesh   child and did this godman die for me mother how is that   moth he died for the sins of all that believe on him   child but what is it you mean by dying for sin and dying for me mother i do not understand it   moth sin my dear is offending god or making god angry and this sin or this anger of god would end in death for the wages of sin is death but god in his own original love to us sent his son to die in our stead that whosoever beleiveth in him might not perish but have everlasting life   child and so if i sin i must die mother   moth yes my dear   child and must you die if you sin mother   moth yes my dear   child but you never sinned i hope then   moth alas my dear i am a great sinner   child why you must not die mother you shall not die mother shall you   the child weeps moth we must all die my dear but this is meant of eternal death going to hell child dying for ever this is that which is the wages of sin   child must all that sin go to hell mother   moth no my dear this is what i was saying before that god being thus angry with sinners and the wages of their sin being death this blessed son of god this godman the mediator came into the world and taking on him our nature died for us there it is my dear in your bible romans     that while we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly and there again   timothy      this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance that jesus christ came into the world to save sinners and in abundance of other places   child let me see it mother for my father said god spoke in my bible and i shall be sure it is true if it be there   moth i will turn the leaf down at it my dear that you may find it again   the child reads again  died for the ungodly and looking up to its mother asks this very affectionate question child dear mother did jesus christ die for me what for me i did not know him i have done nothing to make him die nor i have done nothing to please him i never loved him how should he love me and love me so as to die for me why for me mother   moth this my dear is the great thing for which we should praise and love and adore god and jesus christ that all this should be done for us before we had either done good or evil as thou have said my dear thou have done nothing to please him nor have loved him it is all his own love to us not our love to him   child why would god love me whether i loved him or no mother   moth yes my dear see in your bible john      for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life and again   john    0 herein is love not that we loved god but he loved us and sent his son to be a propitiation for our sins   child but may not i love god now for all this love to me mother   moth yes my dear his love to us moves us to love him   john      we love him because he first loved us   child indeed i will love god sure i must love him if he will not be angry though i sin against him dont you love him mother   moth i desire to love and fear and serve him as long as i live my dear   child and may i not do so too mother   moth yes my dear   child and did you do so before mother   moth i hope i did my dear   child but i have not done it before mother was not that a fault in me mother and is not god angry at that   moth well child but you have heard that jesus christ died to turn away gods anger for that and all other sins   child indeed dear mother i did not know i must love god and fear god before i never heard any thing of it in my life   here the mother is stung again and reproaches herself with having neglected the instruction of her child and weeping says to the child moth my dear that is my sin and thy fathers sin and not thine we ought to have taught thee long ago and we have reason to mourn for it and repent of it as long as we live   child but may i not love god now mother   moth you must love god and love jesus christ and serve and fear him this is one end of your creation   child how can i love jesus christ now mother you say he is dead can i love him now he is dead   moth he is risen again child from the dead   child risen again mother how is that   moth my dear as i told thee before it was necessary for him to be man as well as god that he might in our nature satisfy divine justice so likewise it was necessary he that was to be a mediator should be god as well as man that he might justify us before god and interceed with god for us for ever   child how is this i wonder at it but do not understand it how is it mother dead and alive again and risen and intercede what is it all i do not understand it   moth as man he could die child but as god he could not remain dead   child is this in my bible too mother does god say this there too   moth yes my dear look here acts      whom god has raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible he could be holden of it   child but is he risen again for me too   moth yes my dear he has both died for thee and is risen again for thee too   child show me that in my book mother   moth here it is child romans      who was delivered for our offenses and is risen again for here the child in a little ecstasy of soul moved by the blessed spirit of god grasps the book and kisses the leaf eagerly clapping it to its breast at which the mother surpised says our justification   moth why do thou do that my dear   child i love him dear mother i love him   moth do thou know why thou love him my dear   child i love god dear mother that has loved me so much before i knew him and i love jesus christ because he has died for me and is risen again for me may not i love him dear mother for though i love him i am afraid for my father told me he is a dreadful god   moth it is true he is a consuming fire to sin and the workers of it but to those who love and fear him he is a faithful creator and a merciful redeemer   child then i may love him for that   moth may my dear you not only may but must matt          jesus said unto him thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment   child will he not be angry mother if i dont love him   moth yes my dear for he has commanded you to love him john      continue ye in my love and g      he says the fruit of the spirit is love and he has promised a blessed return to those that love him john       he that loves me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest my self unto him   child i wish i could love him more dear mother   moth you will my dear as you grow up   child how mother   moth why the longer you live the more you will know him and the knowledge of god and the experience of his goodness will increase your love   child how shall i know him more   moth i hope he will fill thy heart with knowledge according to the promise of the covenant of grace   child what is that mother   moth it is the blessed declaration of god in his word wherein he has engaged himself and his faithfulness to his believing people both to be their god and to preserve them in his fear   child and has he promised me that i shall know him mother   moth yes my dear   child is that in my book too mother   moth yes my dear here it is jer       and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them says the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more   child and what shall i do when i know him   moth knowing him you will believe on him and believing you will have life through his name john  0      child when shall i do this mother   moth as thou growest up my dear   here some family occasions calling off the mother the second dialogue ends notes on the second dialogue first observe of the childs being carried to church that by the word church or going to church in all these dialogues is to be understood the place and going to the place of public worship whether in the church of england people to their parish churches or in dissenters to their several meeting houses the particular distinguishing it one way or another being studiously avoided here the subject as the author humbly conceives being not at all concerned in our diversity of opinions sects or separate assemblies but equally instructing to all who call themselves christians and especially protestant christians he believes it would be very much wrong to lay a stumbling block at the threshold and to put any prejudice in the minds of the serious readers which also might prevent by partiality to opinions the benefit which may otherwise be universal to christians of all opinions whatsoever and this latitude in his charity and in his design of doing good to all he hopes none will be offended at  the father and mother of this little child appear here to be no ignorant persons in the principles or duties of christianity but as to the rest it may be observed   what a wretched irreligious life some of those who have the greatest share of knowledge in matters of religion do lead especially in their families   what regret it brings upon their minds when they are convinced of their wickedness in the neglect of their families and when as in this case much of it may be too late to be retrieved    what bitter reproaches such children oftentimes cast back upon their parents when they  the children come to find what they have lost for want of a godly religious education and early instruction either good children or bad  if the children prove sober and religious without the helps of instruction for the spirit of god is not confined or constrained to these outward helps how are they ashamed of and a shame to their parents and how must the parents blush when they may upon any occasion be told that the knowledge the piety the fear of god which is found in their children is no product of their planting no fruit of what they had sown religious children of profane or negligent parents are a double testimony to powerful invincible grace but a dreadful reproach to the parents  this may be a thought worthy the consideration of any christian parent that having neglected the instruction of their families and neglected teaching and praying with or for their children what a just contempt will those children naturally have for those parents especially if ever god comes to enlighten their hearts and open their eyes as he sometimes does without the help of paternal instruction when the children come to reflect how their parents totally neglected the salvation of their souls compared to which the provision made for their bodies was but of little value the disgust at the omission of the former will be too apt to take off all the gratitude and affection due for the latter  nothing but mere duty can be supposed to preserve the childs respect and even common civility to its parents when he comes to be sensible how unnaturally they abandoned his immortal part how unchristianly they exposed his better his intellectual part to eternal destruction as if the duty of a parent had ended or been restrained within the narrow compass of the office of a nurse or a schoolmaster and that they had no obligation upon them to regard the eternal happiness of that part of their posterity which can never die  such parents are certainly the most unnatural and may justly be reproached by their children not with neglect of their duty only but with their being without natural affections and consequently can by no means expect suitable returns of affection from their children when they come to be made sensible of the treatment they have received from them if they show them common respect as above it must be all owing to that very grace which in spite of the obstructions of a godless education has been planted in the heart by the powerful influence and invincible operation of the spirit of god  for parents to pretend love to their children and natural affection as they are the fruit of their bodies and as is vulgarly expressed their own flesh and blood and at the same time neglect to instruct them or educate them either in human learning or religious knowledge is just as if when their children are taken sick they should employ themselves in mending or making them clothes or dressing up fine banquets or entertainments for them and wholly omit the necessary cordials or applications for the recovery of their health only with this difference that the soul to the body has infinitely a greater disproportion than the health and the daily food  but our case extends yet farther viz that the defect complained of here is not the want of education and instruction from the ignorance or incapacity of the parent for this had been the hand of god immediately in bringing forth the child from parents that knew not god but the case here is yet more aggravated in that this happens in families where the parents have the knowledge and have the capacity and know and acknowledge it to be their duty to instruct their children and yet entirely neglect it which adds to the crime in the parent and will be ground of astonishment and reflection in the children if they ever come to the knowledge of god without the due assistance of their parents nor will the reflections of the parents be less bitter on themselves than those of their children as will be more lively represented in the other dialogues of this part  but this subject may also be of present use to children who have not the blessing of godly parents to instruct them and for this it is also designed and these as well as those whose parents neglect the great duty of instructing them are desired to consider from the example of this little child these few things    that the most plain most natural and mosteasie questions that it is possible a child can ask will lead them to know both their creator and their duty to him such as who made me what was i made for what am i what business have i here how came i hither whither am i going what is my end what is good what is evil   the little babe here represented infers by the mere power of natural reasoning   that he was made better than the brutes   that it was the goodness of his maker which distinguished him so   that fear service love and obedience were natural returns for that goodness thus the meanest capacity and the youngest child may supply the defect of education if they think but a little seriously of themselves and the original of their being     it is also observable that as soon as ever the soul is but able to enquire rationally about its self nature and reason concur to lead him to the knowledge of a god a first cause a chief good and an ultimate end of whom and for whom and to whom are all things and these impulses go on till natural religion joined with revealed religion discover christ and god in christ reconciling us to himself not imputing our trespasses which is the sum and substance of the christian religion  this is the great end of these dialogues as they respect children viz that they may where perhaps familyinstruction has been wanting guide themselves to the knowledge of god and of their duty by these familiar steps which nature it self will be most certain to concur with as they respect parents their end is plain viz they are a satyr upon their neglect of duty and a reproof to them in order to amendment  the third dialogue the mother of this pretty infant sensibly affected with the discourse she had had with him in the last dialogue and in teaching her child being particularly taught how she had neglected her own duty appears under a great and more than ordinary concern her husband was under the same convictions and each were very desirous to unbosom themselves to one another though utterly ignorant of the respective circumstances this occasions the following dialogue or discourse between the husband and the wife the rest of the family being withdrawn the husband perceived his wife melancholy and that she had been weeping and being a very tender loving husband begins with her thus  husband my dear what is the matter i believe something troubles thee   wife i cannot deny it and if i did you see i cannot conceal it   wife weeps and is backward to tell the occasion but her husband presses her to tell him husb tell me my dear what afflicts thee if it be in my power to relieve it you have no reason to doubt but as in duty i ought so in affection i am inclined to give you all the comfort all the advice and all the assistance i am able   wife alas you cannot assist in my case no nor any one in the world and the reason why i am backward in telling it is because when i do you will perhaps be so far from easing my grief that you will add to it by falling into the same your self for my affliction equally concerns you and my self   husb my dear there is no affliction can befall thee but either i must have an equal share in it be wanting in affection to thee which i never was yet or want a concern for my own happiness since ever since we have been one by consent or by contract i have but one interest one wish and one desire with you and this not by duty only but by inclination   wife i have a full experience of that and thought my happiness always complete in it and the more in that i have not been able to charge my self with the least breach on my part to render that affection less pleasing to you or less satisfying to me but we have hoth been wanting in one thing and i fear have nothing to excuse or to accuse one more than another and this is my present grief   the husband touched before answers with blushes in his face husb i know not what you can mean unless it be want of performing some duties which we owe to god and our children   wife o you have touched it there it lies and if you had had such a messenger sent from god to reprove you for it as i have had to day i question not but it would have touched you as nearly as it does me   husb i know not what thou have had to day but i had such a lecture preached to me yesterday by a little dear infant even our own youngest child that has almost broke my very soul within me and you may know part of it by this that you know i slept not a wink all last night   wife o my dear the same is my instructor he has certainly been sent from god to me   husb and to me too whether it be for a blessed restoring end or for judgment and the terrible part of conviction he only knows   here they repeat to one another the circumstances of the former dialogues with the child and the effects which the surprise of it had upon both their minds severally husb it is impossible to express to you how the little creature moved me it was a dagger struck into my very heart to hear the dear lamb ask me father will not god be angry with me that i have not thanked him and loved him and prayed to him before and how should i know it father you never told me when i told him he must pray to god was it not cutting me to the heart to hear it say do you pray to him father and when i told him yes to have him say i never heard you father i was not able to bear it i was fain to stop and turn away from him   wife i believe we may both say as the disciples at emmaus did not our hearts burn within us when he talked to us by the way for my part i am amazed when i look upon the child but when i look in and reflect how i have neglected the great duty of instructing not this child only but all my children i am confounded and not able to hold up my head how justly may my children reproach me not only with omitting to teach them to do good but with abominably encouraging them to vanity and neglect of god by my example o i have ruined all my children   husb no no you have not ruined them it is i have ruined them for it was my duty to have exercised the authority of a father and of a governor of a house to have set up the worship of god in my family to have prayed with them and for them and instructed them to pray for themselves they could not have asked me then whether they might pray to god or whether ever i prayed to god or no   wife and i have been a great cause of your neglecting that part too for i have slighted it and ridiculed it in others and thought it mere ostentation and form as if none but persons of higher quality should have prayers in their family and thought it looked too big for us   husb ay but my temptation has been of another kind i have thought it a solemnity i was not fit for i have questioned my own performance i have often thought if i was a nobleman i would keep a chaplain but i was ashamed to pray in the hearing of my servants and children as if that was dishonorable and mean which was my natural duty or as if i was ashamed to own that which was the glory of a christian viz to worship and call upon him that made him as if nature which dictates to the least child to call and cry to its father and mother for bread when it is an hungry did not dictate to me and to every rational creature to worship that god in whom we live and move and have our being   wife and what course shall we take now   husb there is no difficulty in resolving what course to take with this little infant he is taught from heaven and the spirit of god is visibly working in him if we do not instruct him he will every day instruct us and reprove us too but what shall we do with our other children who are grown up and have imbibed a course of vanity and levity without any restraint there will be our difficulty   wife and who are very likely to be impatient of restraint and perhaps not so easily to be governed now for my part i do not think i shall ever be able to break my daughter from her foolish habit such as playing all night at cards going to the playhouse wearing patches reading foolish romances singing idle songs taking gods name in vain and an intolerable looseness of behavior which i have too much given her a liberty in and encouraged her also from my own example   husb i shall have as hard a task with my elder sons that have got a habit of company of ill words and of idleness it is impossible to reclaim them they are gone too far what shall be done they are lost through my neglect and justly may they lay their ruin at my door both body and soul   wife my dear we are in a sad condition and mine is worse still for i have not only neglected my duty to my children and praying with my children but my duty to god too i mean my private duty for ineither prayed with them nor for them nor by my self nor for my self the common going to the public worship excepted which i have passed over as slightly and unconcerned also as if it were only a thing of course   husb this touches me too my dear for it was my duty not only to have prayed with my children and with my family but in private with you and for you and we both ought mutually to have assisted encouraged and exhorted one another in and to our duty i ought to have watched over you and moved you and persuaded you to your duty and you me both as to private and family worship it all lies at my door and at my hand will god require the souls of those he had put under my roof   wife i have been as guilty as you for i have shown a general contempt of this duty i have never encouraged you to it or shown you in the least that i desired it or would be willing to join in it on the contrary you have always seen me as wild and as vain as if i was not a mother of a family but a single person without any relative obligations on me   here both husband and wife not able to refrain tears from the power of their conviction the discourse breaks off for a time till the husband reviving it goes on husb well it must be done however difficult however seemingly fruitless and to no purpose by how much the greater it has been a sin in us both to neglect it by so much stronger is the obligation upon us both to undertake it the poor children are wellnigh undone already it is never too late who knows but god may bless instruction though begun at an unseasonable time it may be we may yet meet with success in the way of our duty if not we must leave that to god we must begin and must go on for as we both know it is our duty our children may be still lost notwithstanding our endeavor but we are sure to be lost if we wilfully neglect it   wife alas what can we do where can we begin now which of our children will mind what we say how will they humble us by throwing our own example in our way and object our former practice as an answer to all our future instructions i think verily it is too late now it will be all to no purpose to go about it it will have no effect at all   husb my dear you say you are sensible it has been a sin that you have not encouraged me in it and joined with me in it before it must be therefore still a sin to continue to do so and a greater sin than before by how much we are convinced now that it was our sinful neglect before   wife nay i will not obstruct it god forbid i only say i fear the event will not answer and i am at a loss which way to go about it   husb i will tell you my dear which way we will go about it let us first join together sincerely to god in prayer acknowledging with a deep humility and hearty repentance our great sin in neglecting his worship in our family as well as in private and our dishonouring him in our conversation imploring for the sake of jesus christ our only mediator and advocate pardon for those our past sins of omission and commission seeking his blessing upon our resolution of amendment and begging that our instructing our family and children however late and long omitted may yet be successful and have a double effect to the salvation of the souls of our children and to the glory and honor of sovereign grace   wife my dear however doubting i am of the success yet i will join with you with all my heart in that and in every thing else that i can which may serve to reform reclaim and restore our poor children whose danger is so plainly occasioned by our neglect   husb as to my family i will tell you what i purpose to do i desire you to let your daughters know that we are resolved to reform several practices which we do not like in their behavior that their father dislikes their general conduct expects they use more modesty in their dress and conversation will have them wear no more patches go to no more plays spend no more precious time at cards nor walk out in the park or fields any more on the lords day but on the contrary that they apply themselves to reading the scriptures and to think of worshipping god after a different manner than they have hitherto done and i shall take care to do the same by my sons   wife i will do all i can with them though i fear their compliance   husb then as soon as they come home next sabbath day from the sermon i will call them all together and to the best of my capacity tell them their duty in general both to god themselves and their parents and that where as i have thought they have taken too much liberty for the time past because i have not restrained them and showed them their duty they shall have no reason for the future to make that excuse from me but that from this time i resolve to oblige all my family to serve god both publicly and privately as much and as well as i can that they may both incline to pray to god themselves and know how to do it i shall besides the public worship of god which i shall expect they constantly attend always have proper times set apart for worshipping god together in the family will pray with them and for them as i am able and having said thus i will begin with reading the word of god to them and then as well as i can will go to prayer with them my self   wife my dear i will be glad of this with all my heart and rejoice at the thought of it but o my soul trembles for the poor vain creatures our children especially our two eldest son and daughter i am certain they will but laugh at it and despise it they are run on too far we should have begun this when they were young i know it by their temper and carriage in other things   husb my dear it is our duty to do it and it is our duty to make them observe it and though they are too old to correct yet i assure you if i dont find a ready compliance with it i shall find ways to show my resentment for we have too long dallied with our duty already and as god will not be mocked by us so we must not be mocked by our children   wife my dear i am most desirous of the thing only my heart fails me in the case of success   husb we must do our duty if god will bless us in doing it he will bless the work too and will cause such an awe of his majesty to go with the performance as that they shall not dare to despise it or to show any contempt of us for it   wife the god of heaven give it such a blessing if it be his will i go as willingly about it as you but with many discouraging thoughts for the event but however i will do all my part according to your direction   end of the third dialogue notes on the third dialogue what a great deal of work have those people behindhand who do not begin to instruct and restrain their children till they are too big for correction folly that is bound up in the heart of a child says solomon is driven thence by the rod of correction but when it remains in the child and neither the rod of correction or the voice of instruction is made use of to drive it out till the child grows up to be a man it is very hard nay impossible but by a supernatural assistance to drive it out at all what this folly is needs no description here other than an allowed custom in doing evil a natural propensity we all have to evil with this we are all born into the world the soul is originally bent to folly this bent or inclination must be rectified or driven out either by instruction or if that proves insufficient by correction and it is to be done while the person is young while he is a child and then it may be done the child may be wrought upon nature like some vegetables is malleable when taken green and early but hard and brittle when condensed by time and age at first it bows and bends to instruction and reproof but afterward obstinately refuses both  the temper of a child misled by vice or mistake like a dislocated bone is easy to be reduced into its place if taken in time but if suffered toremain in its dislocated position a callous substance fills up the empty space and by neglect grows equally hard with the bone and resisting the power of the surgeons skill renders the reduction of the joint impossible  the heart of the tender youth by forbearance of instruction grows opinionated and obstinately embraces the follies he has been indulged in not being easily convinced of the criminal quality of what he has been so long allowed the practice of by his negligent parents and this renders late instruction fruitless then as to correction the heart being hardened as before by opinion and practice and especially in a belief that he ought not to be corrected the rod of correction has a different effect for as the blow of a stripe makes an impression on the heart of a child as stamping a seal does upon the soft wax the reproof even of words on the same heart when grown up and made hard is like striking upon steel which instead of making an impression on the metal darts back sparks of fire in your face  as this whole work is chiefly designed to convince parents of the necessity of beginning early the great work of instructing and managing their children so two things will run more visibly through every part of it    for their encouragement the examples of the easiness and advantages of early instruction will be seen how soft how pliable the minds of little children are how like wax they lie ready to be molded into any form and receive any impression that the diligent application of parents thinks fit to make upon them from whence also parents are warned to be very careful that by their example or negligence those first softened circumstances of their childrens minds are not passed over without suitable applications to forming them a right filling them with learning and knowledge and with just principles both religious and moral above all that they receive no bad impressions from the practice of their parents whose example especially in evil takes such deep root in their children that nothing is more difficult to remove    for warning and serious caution by letting them see the dreadful effects of the neglecting their children when young what work it makes for repentance in both what breaches it makes in families when necessity drives them to begin that work late what treatment they are like to meet with from their children how these will think it hard to be instructed when grown up count it imposing upon them in their parents reject the arguments their parents shall use despise and contemn their reproof think themselves past correction and turn their backs not only upon all the methods their parents shall take with them but even upon their parents themselves when they attempt by government and discipline to retrieve the error they have committed  in this last dialogue the husband and wife appear sensible of their mistake this way and the difficulties they have before them in retrieving it justly appear terrible almost drive them to despair of the success and to give over any thoughts of the attempt in the subsequent parts of this work we shall find they were not mistaken in the prospect they had of the difficulty before them or of the obstinacy and opposition which they should meet with from their children  as to their being so discouraged as not to make the attempt the husband argues wisely that it is not less their duty for its having been delayed that it must be set about let the difficulty be what it will and that therefore he is resolved to attempt it and if possible to go through it leaving the success to god  this is a wise and christian resolution and argues that the convictions the parent was under were sanctified by the spirit of god and carried on to effectual conversion for all conviction of sin that do not go on to reformation and effectual application to our duty are ineffectual convictions like waking in a dream while the heart is asleep when slumbering on we fall into the same dream again  for the encouraging parents to pursue these convictions and to hope for some success in their work though begun late and under some weighty discouragements the following part of this work will show how far he met with success in his family reformation and instruction as well as what obstruction he met with from his eldest children for all were not alike obstinate and refractory as the eldest were and the mother was but too true a prophetess of the consequence from their obstinacy  from the discourse between the husband and wife under their convictions may be seen something of the duty of such relations    to communicate to one another their griefs and most inward afflictions of mind as well as their common disasters and troubles of the world this is one part of the duty of husband and wife to one another though understood by few meant and included in that phrase an helpmeet and it is observable that when such near relations do affectionately communicate to one another their souls concerns in such a manner as i speak of now god is often pleased so variously to act in the minds of such by his spirit that they shall in their turns be mutually able to assist comfort direct and counsel one another this if it were well observed would be very useful and encouraging to christian relations in their most serious and reserved reflections where they might take notice how that party that is discouraged and dejected to day and receives support and encouragements relief and direction from the counsel and comforting assistance of the other shall be restored and comforted and perhaps enabled the next time to give the same encouragement counsel advice and comfort to the other who may in like manner be sunk under his own fears and temptations  this i thought fit to recommend in the most earnest terms and from just experience to the consideration of christian relations as a useful observation in hope it may be improved by the experience of others to the glory of god and their own comfort    the duty of parents may be seen here as it respects the necessity of setting about the great work of familyreformation however late and whatever the discouragements may be the father here expresses this affectionately to his wife our children says he may be still lost notwithstanding our endeavor but we are sure to be lost if we continue to neglect it  from these considerations the father resolves to set about the work and immediately gives his wife an account of the method he proposes to himself to go upon in which method like a prudent man and good christian he proposes a serious mutual humiliation to his wife for their former neglect of their duty and a fervent praying to god for his blessing upon their endeavors in their familyreformation  hence is intimated and seriously recommended to parents and heads of families the great work which is so much neglected or rather so little regarded of a family joining in confession of those sins i mean of husband and wife which they have joined in the committing would husbands and wives join seriously in humbling themselves together before god for those familysins which they have joined in the guilt of familyreformation would be set about with much more earnestness and application than now we see it is and many obstructions to it which happen by our willingness to excuse our selves would be removed  from the manner of the husband and wifes discourse here may be noted that where thorough conviction works in the mind both parties are as it is here forwardest to accuse themselves whereas in most familycases the heads of families seem always forward to shift off the fault from themselves though they acknowledge the error see plainly the defect and the consequences of it also in the ruin of their children yet they are diligent like adam and eve in throwing the guilt of it off from themselves either upon one another or upon accidents and circumstances which they think may serve to excuse themselves but if they were thoroughly touched with the thing it self with the guilt of it upon themselves and the fatal consequences of it upon their children they would mutually own the first and deprecate the last as our two penitent parents do here oh i have ruined all my children says the mother no no you have not ruined them it is i have ruined them says the father i have neglected my duty to them says the father but i have been the cause of your neglecting your duty says the mother  here is a complete view for parents both of the error the repentance and the reformation the disease the effects of it and the manner of the cure and as these are the foundation of what follows so the following dialogues are an exemplification of most of the things contained in these discourses of the two parents and the connection of them will be taken notice of throughout the whole work  the fourth dialogue for the better understanding this discourse it is to be understood that the father and mother according to their resolution in the last dialogue had set effectually about the reformation of their family and about proper methods for reducing their children to an obedience to and sense of their duty  their children were most of them grown up and had run a great length they had been indulged in all possible folly and levity such as plays gaming looseness of life and irreligious behavior not immodest or dishonest that they were not yet arrived to but they were bred up with gayety and gallantry as being of good fortunes and fashion but nothing of religion more than just the common course of going to church which they did because it was the custom and fashion rather than with any other view and being thus unhappily educated we shall find the instruction they were now to bear met with the more opposition in them and we shall see how it had a various effect according to the different temper and constitution of the children  their eldest daughter was about eighteen years old and her mother it seems began with her first her mother found it a very difficult matter to deal with her for when she came to tell her of laying by her foolish romances and novels of which she was mighty fond leaving off her patches and playbooks refusing her going to the park on the sabbath days and the like she flew out in a passion and told her mother in plain words she would not be hindered she was past a child she would go to the park and to the play and the like ay that she would  but the mother whose resolutions were too well fixed after such an occasion as has been said to be conquered by her daughter having tried softer methods to no purpose took her roundly to task and told her that as she took those measures with her for her good only and that she could not satisfy her own conscience to see her ruined body and soul together so she was resolved to be obeyed and that since she would not comply by fair means she would take another course this course it seems besides other things which will appear in the following part of this dialogue was particularly that it being then sabbath day after they came home from church when her mother began this discourse her daughter called for the coach to go to the park as their custom it seems had always been but her mother would not suffer her to stir out and upon their being a little stubborn or resolute had used some little violence with her in showing her resentment and threatened her with worse as will appear presently  upon this repulse she flings up stairs into her chamber where she sat crying when her elder brother whom the father it seems d not yet begun with came to her between which couple begins the following dialogue  brother sister what in tears what is the matter now  she cries on but makes no answer   bro dear sister tell me your grievance i say tell me what is it troubles you   and pulls her by her clothes sist i will not dont trouble me i will not tell you let me alone   sobs and cries still bro prithee what is the matter sister why you will spoil your face you will not be fit to go to the park come i came to have you go out we will all go to the park   sist ay so you may if you can   bro if i can what do you mean by that i have ordered thomas to get the coach ready   sist it is no matter for that i can assure you he will not do it   bro i will cane the rascal if he dont and that presently too come do you wipe your eyes and dont pretend to go abroad with a blubbered face   sist i tell you thomas will not obey you he is otherwise ordered you will find that neither you nor i are to go out to night   bro who will have the impudence to hinder us   sist i have been hindered already and my mother has told me in so many words i not only shall not go to night but never any more of a sunday though i think i shall fail her   bro what does my mother mean by that not go to the park i must go and i will go as long as sermon is done what harm is there in it i warrant you we will go come get you ready and wipe your eyes   sist you will find your self mistaken in my mother i will assure ye i told her i would go as you do me and she was in such a passion with me she struck me which she never did in all her life before and then read me a long lecture of the sabbath day and being against her conscience and i know not what things i never heard her talk of in my life before i dont know what ails her to be in such a humor   bro conscience what does my mother mean by that why have we not gone every sunday to the park and my mother always gone with us what is it against her conscience now and never was against her conscience before that is all nonsense i will warrant you i will go for all this new bustle you make about it   sist i would go with all my heart but i tell you she is in such a passion you had better let her alone it will but make her worse   bro prithee dont tell me i will go to the park if the devil stood at the door what shall not i have the liberty to go out when i please sure i am past a boy ant i   sist i tell you my mother is very positive and you had better let her alone you will but provoke her you may do as you will   bro not i i will not provoke her at all for i will not ask her i will go without her   sist then you will go without a coach too for i assure you as i said before you will not get thomas to go   bro then i will take a hackney and go to the mall   sist come brother we had better let it alone for once my mother will be better conditioned another time i hope this will be over   bro nay i dont care come let us read a book then have you never a play here come i will read a play to you   sist ay what will you have   bro any thing   she runs to her closet for a playbook and finds her plays novels songbooks and others of that kind taken all away sist oh thieves thieves i am robbed   bro robbed what do you mean sister   he runs to her sist all my books are gone they are all gone all stole i have not a book left   here you may suppose her taking gods name in vain very much and in a great passion bro what all your books   sist every one that are good for any thing here is nothing but a bible and an old foolish book about religion i dont know what   her brother looks bro i think as you say they are all gone no hold here is a prayer book and here is the practice of piety and here is the whole duty of man   sist prithee what signify them to me but all my fine books are gone i had a good collection of plays all the french novels all the modern poets boileau dacier and a great many more   bro what is the meaning of this   sist i will lay a hundred pound this is my mother   bro i believe so too i wish my mother be not mad this is horrid what can my mother mean   sister falls in a great passion of crying the second brother comes up to them and the father had been talking to him  d bro what is the matter with my sister what is she not well    st bro i dont know what is the matter very well but my mother has been ruffling her a little and put her out of humor     bro what has she done     bro why she will not let her go to the park and when she said she would go my mother struck her and we find she has taken away all her books i cannot imagine what the meaning of this is i think my mother is mad     bro no no brother my mother is not mad if she is mad my father is mad too you will not want long to know what the meaning of it is for you will hear of it quickly too your self that i can assure you     bro i hear of it what from my father     bro yes from my father he has told me his mind already and the reason and occasion of it and i know he is enquiring for you to do the like     bro he may talk what he will to me but i will do what i please for all that     bro hark you are called just now you will be of another mind when you come back i will warrant you   the eldest son is called to come to his father   bro never as long as i live   goes out   bro if my fathers reasons do not persuade him i can assure him his authority will for he is resolved upon the thing   sist what thing is it brother what is our father and mother a going to do with us for my part i cannot imagine what they mean     bro why really sister i find they have begun with the youngest first for my father has been upon me and my mother has begun with my sister betty but you will have your turn too   sist i think my mother has begun with me already for i was but humming over a new song this afternoon though church was done and all over and every body come home but my mother was in such a passion with me that i never had so many words with her in my life she would not let me go to the park and had much ado to keep her hands off of me     bro i heard she was angry with you but it seems you answered her rudely   sist i said nothing but that i would go to the park     bro well but you told her you would go whether she would or no   sist why was that such a crime and so i would say again     bro well but if you did you would not say it was well done would you and as it seems she told you then so i can satisfy you now she will not take it from you nor none of us as she has done   sist it may be so and i have found it otherwise already     bro what has she not taken some books out of your closet   sist some no she has only taken all my books away     bro i warrant she has left your bible and prayer books and such as those   sist ay those what does that signify she has taken away all my plays and all my songs and all the books that i had any pleasure in     bro yes i heard of it   sist but i will have them again or i will lead her such a life she shall have little comfort of me     bro truly sister you may fancy you may have them again but i can satisfy you most of them are past recovery for i saw them upon the parlourfire before i came up   sist the fire i will go and pull them out before her face   here she is raging and in a violent passion at her mother and makes as if she would run down stairs   bro come sister you had as good be easy for i find both our father and mother are agreed in the thing and i must own i begin to see they have reason for it for my part i am inclined to submit to all their measures for i think in my conscience we have all been wrong and if my father and mother see reason to have me alter my conduct and especially when i am convinced it is for the bettertoo i think it is my part to submit   sist i will never submit   the sister cries again   bro perhaps you will be persuaded when my mother talks a little calmly to you i believe my sister betty is of another mind already   sist i have had talk enough already my mother tells me i shall not go to the park nor to the play house nor patch nor play at cards i think this is talk enough what does my mother think to make a nun of me     bro no i dare say she does not   sist no and if she does she will be mistaken for i shall not be hindered of my innocent diversions let my mother do what she pleases     bro but sister i do not think you will find my mother unreasonable in what she desires if you will but allow your self leisure to think of it a little   sist unreasonable in her desires prithee can you tell me what it is she does desire for i cannot imagine what my mother would be at     bro as for my mother i cannot be particular but if you are willing to hear me i will tell you what my father said to me   sist you may tell me if you will though i dont much care i will not be made a fool of what i ant a baby to go to school again     bro why look you sister you may stand out if you will a great while but i warrant you must be content at last for i do not see how you will help your felf   sist i warrant you i will help my self     bro then you must renounce your father and your mother and leave the family and i do not see what good that will do you for i am satisfied my father is resolute   sist resolute in what prithee what is it my father would have does he think to make us all fools what is it he talks of     bro i was going to tell you the short history of it if you would have patience early this morning before we went to church my father called me up into his chamber and after enquiring several things of me about my learning my company and my behavior in the world to which i made as good an answer as i could he told me with a great deal of tenderness that he loved me very dearly that he intended to do very well for me that he had a particular kindness for me and thathe had but one thing he desired of me and that this was for my own good too and desired to know if i was disposed to comply with him i told him i was very willing to do any thing to oblige him who had been so good a father to me he told me all he desired of me was this he had observed that his family in general was running on into all kind of levity and looseness which he was satisfied would be their ruin that he had been remiss in his duty of instruction and reproof to his children but that he begged god pardon for that omission and would do his best to make us all amends he concluded with asking me whether i had rather be a rake or a sober man i answered i hoped he did not expect any reply from me to that and that i hoped i had not gone so far as to make him doubt in the least that i did not design to be a sober man why son replies my father you have no other way to do this but to conclude that if there were no divine law no future state no rewards or punishments yet regarding the honor and character which you expect in the world you ought to be sober if it were only to preserve your reputation he told me that i knew he had designed me for the practice of the law that though he would do what he could for me yet as he had a great many other children i must expect to live or at least to advance my self by my own merit and industry and that a lawyer like a virgin having once lost the reputation of his virtue or sobriety no body will meddle with him i not only listened very attentively to my fathers discourse but looking steadily upon him i thought i saw more than usual tenderness and affection in him all the while he was speaking whenever he mentioned his having omitted his duty to his family i thought i saw tears standing in his eyes and to hear him say he begged gods pardon for the neglect of it brought tears into mine when he told me he would make us all amends for the future it suggested to my mind that my father supposed that this want of more early instructing us who are his children was our loss as well as his fault and that we were not such children as we should have been if we had been better taught i must own to you sister these thoughts have since made a great disturbance in my mind i thought i saw the two young ladies at next door and their brother too looked quite another sort of people than we did they appear so modest so sober and yet so decently and genteely affable and pleasant that i think they live quite another lite than we do they never swear nor use lewd and profane words in their discourse they never sit up all night at cards or go a visiting a sundays nor do a hundred foolish things that our family makes a trade of and yet they live as merrily comfortably sociably and genteely as we do   i must own to you though i have often laughed at them and ridiculed them before yet my thoughts often told me they lived a more rational life than we did and when i heard my father talk thus it presently came into my thoughts that if my father took the new course with his family as he talked of we should begin to be like them and i thought that would be very well for us all  well after my father had gone on thus and paused a while i suppose to hear whether i would say any thing to it or no i told him i would be glad to do any thing to answer his end and desired to know what it was he expected of me my father said the chief end of his discourse was then to convince me of the reasonableness and necessity of an alteration in my life and of the advantages of a religious family and of a sober religious education and for the rest if i was first satisfied of the general he knew it would be easy to bring me to comply with all the measures he should take to bring it about    we had a great deal more such discourse but i told him i was very well satisfied that he designed nothing but our good and i should be ready to observe all the injunctions he should lay on me and truly sister now i begin to reflect upon it i find a great deal of satisfaction in it for upon my word i think we have lived very odly all along whether it were my fathers fault or our own i dont enquire but if we knew no more none of us of the town than we do of religion we should be a very unfashionable family   sist prithee dont fill my head with all this canting stuff i dont value it a farthing     bro why sister have you no manner of inclination to live religiously and like a christian or to listen to what your father may say to you   sist i think i am religious enough in all conscience and i dont intend to disturb my thoughts with any more religion than needs must     bro you talk wildly now i hope you would be a good christian   sist a christian why what do you take me for a mohammedan i think i am a very good christian     bro why suppose that too yet if it were no more than that my father desires it and says he resolves to have it so you will hardly persuade your self not to submit to him you know besides that he is our father and we ought in duty to obey him and not only that but he has been the kindest tenderest obligingst father in the world to us and it would be very ungrateful to show your self rude to such a father as it would be wicked to disobey him i am sure you would not be a christian if you should   sist dont tell me i think my self as good a christian as any of you but i will not be made a fool of for all that i had as live you should think me no christian as you should think me a fool sure i am past my horn book     bro and what because you are past your hornbook do you think you are past teaching have you nothing to learn but your a b c   sist no no i will learn any thing too but i will not be taught to be a hermit if they have a mind to breed me up for an abbess let them send me to a monastery i would as live be in a real cloister as be cloistered up at home use none of your new cant with me i tell you brother my mother may ruffle me as much as she will i will have my own way still     bro sister sister you may talk and huff and flounce about as much as you will but you will have the worst of it at last for if both father and mother set upon it as i find they are both of a mind they will conquer you at last and perhaps it may mortify you more than you think of   sist i am not so soon conquered as my father may think if they will not let me be quiet at home i will take another method i am not so much to seek     bro pray sister dont be angry with me for my good will i am not threatening you nor my father by me   sist no no i will not be threatened neither sure i am too old for correction     bro but not for advice i hope sister nor for instruction and if my father should think you deserved correction do you think there is no way for him to show his resentment but laying his fingers on you   sist you may all do your worst i will not trouble my self about it it is in vain to threaten me     bro nay sister i think you are so above my fathers threatening you that you talk as if you were threatening him would you be willing my father should hear you   sist you may tell him if you please     bro though that is very disobliging sister yet i love you too well to go of that errand or to obey a command that would be so much to your prejudice   sist i care not a farthing if you did     bro it is a satisfaction to me that i know you will be of another mind hereafter   sist not i i defy you all i will go as far as my legs can carry me before i will be confined or made a fool of     bro wherever you go i would have you take this hint with you that you leave your reputation behind you and especially the christian will be left behind you   sist dont you trouble your head about that i shall take care of my own reputation     bro while it is in your own keeping i hope you will sister but you talk foolishly enough of going away from your father if you once go out of your fathers doors take my word for it your character is at every bodys mercy   sist for what pray     bro why should you ask for what pray what will you say or what would you have said to any that shall ask you or ask us why you are gone away from your father you will not venture to say that you came away because your father was about to reform his family that you came away because you would not submit to be instructed by your father that you came away because your father and mother would have you more religious than you were before and if you will not say that pray what can you say or what can any body say for you   sist i warrant you i shall have enough to say and as for what you or others shall say you may say your worst of me i dont care     bro truly the greatest misfortune will be that when we say the worst we shall say the truth and that when we say the truth we must say the worst of you that can be spoken and upon that account i hope you will consider what you do when you think of going from your fathers house though it were to the best friend you had   sist indeed if they put hard upon me i shall make no scruple of it     bro i cannot tell what you will say then to bring your self off pray what do you call putting hard upon you will you call my fathers desire to reform your life a putting hard upon you i hope you will first prove that he designs to press you to some wicked thing some forbidden unlawful course but to call my fathers desire to regulate your conduct and reform your life i say to call this putting hard upon you every body that hears it will reflect upon you   sist no matter for that i will not be confined not i     bro not from the worst wickedness do you mean you will not be confined so   sist i desire no wickedness i dont know what you mean i have never exposed my self yet to be charged with any wickedness     bro but you will do it now it seems because your father requires you to be sober   sist prithee what do you mean by sober i thick i am sober enough and want no more reforming than any of you what would you have     bro i am no way taxing your sobriety but should be very glad you would increase the stock and improve it and i believe my father means no other   sist cannot i be sober as well with all my books my mother has taken away as without them what can you tax me with that is not sober that here is such a rout about it     bro dear sister i do not find that my father or mother is inclined to tax you in particular any more than all of us but all of us together nay even our father and mother themselves have been negligent godless and graceless and if they now resolve to repent and turn and to carry it after another manner and to have us do the same pray what taxing can you call this does not my father say he confesses he has been negligent and has not done his duty as well as any of us and what is all he desires of us but only that as he begs pardon of almighty god for himself so we should ask the same for our selves that as he resolves to reform the practice so we should do also that so at last we may be a sober family a reformed family and may serve god for the future after another manner than we have done pray where is the hardship of all this   sist well you may go on with your reformation and confessions and all that if you have a mind for my part i will have nothing to do with it i will let you all go your own way     bro well sister i am sorry for you if you hold of this mind we are like to have a foul house with you quickly for i know my father will go through stitch with what he has begun   sist my father may go on with what he will i shall not hinder him he may let me alone and reform the rest of you cannot he i need no reformation as i know of     bro i am not so sorry for the difficulty my father will meet with as for the hazard you will run for your self and the breach you will make in your own happiness but here comes my sister betty i see by her looks she has something to say upon the same subject    d sist how long have you too been together    d bro a great while     sist i suppose i know something of your discourse at least i guess at it by your looking so grave pray how long have you been here     bro i told you a great while but since you would be answered particularly i believe we have been here just as long as you have been with my mother for i know she has been talking to you     sist that is true my mother and i have been talking     sist talking do you say or fighting     sist fighting what do you mean sister do you think i fight with my mother     sist no but it may be your mother may fight with you why not with you as well as with your elder sister     sist my mother never struck me in her life and i never gave her any cause that i know of     sist that is more than i can say and yet i think i never gave her any more cause than you did     sist if my mother has struck you certainly you must have given her more cause than i have done for every body knows she loves you to a distinction above every child she has     sist i dont believe a word of it nor do i desire such love     bro well sister but you may tell us a little how you like things and what discourse my mother has had with you for we all know the subject already     sist my mother said nothing to me but what i like very well and am very willing to comply with     bro i am very glad to hear you say so i wish we were all of the same mind     sist i hope we shall i think what she proposes is so rational and the reasons of it so unanswerably good that i see no room to object against it in the least nor do i see any thing designed in it all but what is for our good     bro i am perfectly of your opinion and am glad to find you of mine but here is my sister mary quite of different sentiments from us all     sist and with a great deal of reason for she has not been treated with the same kindness that you have been treated with     sist wherein pray     sist why i suppose my mother has not been in your chamber and rifled your closet and taken all your choice books and your plays and your songs and your novels etc and carried them away and thrown them into the fire     sist no no my dear for what my mother said to me was so affecting so fully convincing and so unanswerable that i immediately fetched them all down my self and put them into the fire with my own hands before her face     sist a pretty complying easy fool i warrant she kissed thee and called thee dear child and cried over thee for thy pains did she not my dear     sist i am ashamed to hear you talk so of my mother sister sure you have not lost your manners and duty as well as respect and religion sister i beseech you what is the matter with you     sist and have you really burnt all your plays to please a humor     sist indeed i have burnt them but not to please a humor i have done it to oblige the best mother in the world and i have done it from a sense of its being very fit to be done     sist a fine child and are not you a deal the wiser for it do you not repent it already     sist no sister so far from repenting it that i never did a thing in my life that gave me more satisfaction and if it were to do again i should now do it with ten times the pleasure i did it then and if god give me grace to keep my resolution i never design to see a play or read a play more     sist pretty child thoroughly reformed at once this is a mighty sudden conversion and may hold accordingly i suppose as most such hasty things do     sist it will hold i hope longer than your obinacy against it     sist when it has as good reasons i may think so too     sist i shall debate that with you hereafter when you have heard the same reasons for it that i have heard     sist well but come pray let us have a few of your reasons just now if you can spare them pray what harm is there in seeing or reading a play is there any sufficient mischief in them to justify your burning them and to justify my mothers using me about them as she has done     sist in the first place sister the time we have before us compared to the eternity that is to be prepared for is so little and so short that if it be possible to employ it better there is none to spare for what has so little good in it as a play     sist i have learnt a great deal of good from a play     sist but might you not have learnt more from the scriptures     sist it may be not     sist you would have been a bad scholar then     sist well and what is next     sist in the second place the little good which you can pretend is to be found in them is mixed with so much evil attended with so much lewd vicious and abominable stuff that no sober person will bear with the wicked part for the sake of the good part nor can any one justify it that the good part is such or so great that so much hazard should be run for it     sist very well so you are afraid you should be tempted when you go to the play i suppose that is because you are so tempting your self     sist no sister i am in no more danger i hope than another but sure if i am to pray to god as in the lords prayer lead me not into temptation i must not lead my self into it     sist and is this all you have to say for throwing the best collection of plays the whole town had into the fire     sist i have many more reasons which i shall bestow on you when you have answered these but there is one more which i will bestow upon you now which you may give an answer to before the rest if you please viz that it is my mothers desire and resolution that i should do so and that she declares it is against her conscience to permit me the use of these things as formerly and therefore desires and in one kind commands that i should do thus and i am bid in the scripture many ways to obey children obey your parents in all things etc     sist that is the best reason you have given yet     sist i think not neither for the other reasons are better as they are drawn from the nature and authority of god and this but from the authority of my mother which though it is great and ought to be very prevalent with me and ever shall be so yet not quite equal or up to the authority of him that made us all nor will my mother think hard that i say so     bro sister indeed i think my sister betty has fully answered you there     sist yes yes you are two fine new converts     bro which i hope we shall never be ashamed of     sist well and pray what said you to her about going to the park a sundays had you nothing to say about that     sist yes yes my mother showed her dislike of it and said it was a plain violation of the commands of god i mused a little while about it and being convinced that it was so i presently resolved never to go any more     sist so and you had not a box on the ear then as i had     sist i gave my mother no occasion for that sister as i understand you did     sist no no you are a mighty good obedient thing     sist i am not ashamed to own that i obey my mother and am willing to do so in every thing especially every thing that is right more especially in every thing that is for my own good and most of all where my duty to god joins with it if you think it below you to do so i am sorry for it i cannot follow you in that example for the scripture says expressly children obey your parents in all things much more where the command of god and the command of our parents concur together as it does in this case     sist you preach nicely sister you shall marry a parson and when you turn quaker you shall be a speaking sister     sist any thing rather than a rebel to god and my parents break the commandments of the first and abuse the tenderness of the last     sist you are mighty mannerly to your sister     sist much more to you than you to my mother i love my sister very well but i know neither brother or sister when they rise up against my mother and that such a mother as ours is who i must tell you sister deserves other things at your hands and unless you behave better you will find the whole family against you as well as i for every body says you treated my mother very rudely the very servants speak of it with abhorrence and of you with contempt for every body must despise you if you carry it so to your mother     sist with all my heart if every body despises me i will despise every body and so i will be even with you all     sist you will be soon tired of that     sist if i am i will bear my affliction with patience     sist you are like to be a martyr in the worst cause that ever saint suffered in no doubt but you will suffer for conscience sake two excellent points in divinity you maintain viz contempt of god and rebellion against your parents i wonder what evil spirit is your instructor     sist you are very pert madam and show abundance of affection and respect     sist i follow your own example still sister but i will be very honest to you i will neither have respect nor affection to you or any body that shall carry it to my mother as you have done i would not load you or add to your sorrows but no body in this house can do otherwise who have such a father and such a mother as we have     sist i have no sorrow about it and am resolved i will have none     sist i think the best way to deal with you is to leave you your crime will be your sufficient punishment but i must tell you before i go which i should have told you at first that my business was not to visit you now but to call you to my father and mother who want to speak with you in the parlour and where i suppose you will hear more of it     sist i will not go     sist as you ploase sister for that i have delivered my message     sist and you may carry that for an answer     sist no sister i will have no hand in your misfortunes besides i believe here comes another messenger from them   a servant comes up stairs and tells the eldest lady that her father and mother waited to speak with her   sist i am indisposed tell my mother i cannot come i am upon the bed   servant if you will not go madam i doubt they will come to you     sist go you and deliver your message     sist and are you so resolute against your self sister can nothing persuade you to your own good certainly you will be wiser     sist what would you have me do what is the matter with you all     sist nay sister i am not fit to give you advice who are my elder sister but methinks you do not want advice to go down to your father when you are sent for     sist i will not     sist what shall i say to them i dare not say you will not for your own sake     sist tell them i ant well cannot you that i am upon the bed and have shut my door and will not be spoke with tell them any thing dont you see i ant fit to be spoke to     sist as the maid said i am certain they will come up to you for they know your distemper i would fain have you go down i dare say you will be treated very tenderly and kindly perhaps better than you can expect especially if you do not force them to treat you ill     sist yes after they have burnt all my books robbed me of what they knew was my delight refused me the liberty of going abroad and given me a blow in the face for nothing now they will treat me kindly will they i desire none of their kindness i will not go     sist well sister then they must wait upon you i suppose     sist if they do i will not speak to them she cries vehemently or open the door     sist i hope you will alter your mind i will leave you to think of it   the second sister withdraws and the other claps the door after her this dialogue needs no observation save on the different temper between children dutifully submitting to familygovernment and affectionately complying with their parents just desires and on the other hand children obstinately adhering to the dictates of their passions and this will appear to every common reader besides much of this first part being historical and the family known i forbear farther observations on the particular conduct of the persons the design of this work being rather to instruct other families than to reproach those who may think themselves concerned the author leaves these dialogues therefore without particular remarks and leaves room for abler hands to annotate upon them hereafter when the persons concerned may be gone off the stage and then it may rather appear as a general reproach to those that are guilty than a patticular satyr upon persons or families and this he conceives will also tend more to the usefulness of the work  end of the fourth dialogue the fifth dialogue the last dialogue is a kind of a sketch or draught of the whole family we are speaking of the eldest son and daughter as their father and mother had suggested being grown up in a long allowed course of looseness in behavior all manner of liberties having been given them without any familyrestraint without government and rather encouraged by their parents than limited either by example or command proved as might well be expected very obstinate and refractory especially the daughter who being hot and insolent her mother at the first attempt was so provoked as to use her somewhat roughly the other children who were grown up being also a son and a daughter are not only brought to submit to the reformation proposed by their parents but embrace it with willingness and cheerfulness and make their duty be their choice to the great satisfaction of their parents  the following dialogue is between the father and mother with their said sons and daughters respectively and apart which are the same that are referred to in the former discourses  the mother it seems began with her eldest daughter upon something in her behavior about breaking the sabbath and this by the imprudence of the daughter ended rougher than she  the mother designed it  the father began with his second son and finding him very tractable proceeded to his eldest son but met with great difficulties and discouragements in him  the mother found the second daughter sensibly affected with her discourse and cheerfully willing to submit to her instructions which was a great comfort to her and encouraged her to deal the better with her obstinate sister  their other children were younger and rather to be governed by authority than persuasion the dialogue with the eldest daughter began thus after sermon every lords day it had been their custom to walk abroad or go to the park or a visiting and so to wear off the evening and then come home to supper but the case being now altered the father had let the servants know they must all stay at home and had told his younger son with whom he had discoursed in the morning that he would have no more going to the park on the lords day but the daughter had not yet heard of it nor the eldest son or if they had they did not believe their father was in earnest so that according to their usual custom they were preparing to go abroad and the son had bid their coachman get ready to carry them out the mother perceiving the daughter to be putting on her gloves calls to her thus  mother what are you dressing for child   daughter to go to the park madam   mo i would not have you go to night my dear   dau why madam   mo i have a reason which i had rather tell you another time   note the mother having designed to have a serious discourse with her daughter did not think fit to enter into particulars now but her daughters carriage forced her to it dau i must go madam i have appointed company   mo well however disappoint them for once at my desire   dau it is impossible madam i cannot do it   mo o the impossibility is not so very great as you make it i warrant you you can excuse it   dau i never did such a thing in my life it is rude madam to the last degree i cannot look my lady lighthead in the face   mo lay the fault on me my dear i will bear the blame   dau i will even lay the fault on no body nor ask any body pardon but go my self   mo i wonder child you should force me to the necessity of telling you that you must not go   dau why madam i must go i cannot put it off   mo but i tell you mistress since you will be put off no other way you shall not go   dau shall not i   mo no you shall not   dau but i will go   mo i never thought to have had such language as that from you daughter and i assure you i shall not take much of it   dau why should not i go out then as well now as at another time   mo why daughter since i must come to particulars with you i assure you that you shall not only not go to the park to day but never any more of a sabbath day as long as i have the troublesome office of being your mother   dau what have i done to be used so   mo nothing more than the rest nor was i blaming you but you have been all guilty of profaning the lords day and to the best of my power you shall do it no more   dau why have not you done it your self and have you not always gone with us   mo though that is very unnatural and unmannerly in you to reproach me with it yet i confess it is but too just upon me and i deserve it however i pray god forgive me that i have done it and especially that i have let you all do it well may you upbraid me with it and i desire to be ashamed that you have had my example to encourage you to it but it is the more my duty to reform it and i expect your compliance with the more willingness   dau i see no harm in it not i   mo what not on the lords day   dau no as long as sermon is over and church is done   mo why does not the commandment say remember the sabbath day to keep it holy and therefore god blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it   dau why dont i keep it holy enough dont i go to church every sunday   mo well and do you think that the sabbath day is over when you have been at church   dau over why what would you have us do after we have been at church   mo i shall take a time to let you know what is your duty on the rest of the day but i did not design to talk of that now nor of this neither if you had not moved me to it by your undutiful language   dau i dont trouble my self about it   here the daughter turns away and with a kind of a humming low voice sings the tune of a new playhouse song mo unsufferable insolence have i been telling you of the command of god to keep holy the sabbath day and of my resolution to do it my self and to cause you to do it and do you despise god and your mother at this rate it is not to be born with   she first apparently laughs at her mother and turning awayfrom her sings on mo your contempt of your mother i place to my own account but for your contempt of your maker takes that on gods account   strikes her a box on the ear dau ha is it come to that   the daughter flies away in a rage and goes up stairs toward her chamber mo only take this with you in your fury that i will have no going out of door   dau but i will for all this   mo i advise you to provoke me no farther   dau you have done your worst   the mother provoked highly by her tongue follows her and goes into her chamber but she had gone into another room and the mother seeing the closetdoor open in her chamber goes in and takes away all her books plays songs etc leaving only her bible prayerbooks and two or three good books in their room mo these are the cursed roots from whence this blessed fruit grows up here her sabbath days study and the bait to all her pleasures these shall be the first sacrifice to the bessed resolution i have taken of reforming my family   the mother brings them all down stairs and after looking over the particulars threw them all into the fire the daughter going afterward into her chamber and finding what her mother had done occasioned the dialogue already set down between her and her eldest brother this little adventure being over and the mother having composed herself she sends for her second daughter about fifteen year old and begins the following dialogue with her  mother child where are you what are you bespoke to night too    d dau no madam who should bespeak me   mo why your sister to go to the park     dau no indeed madam i know nothing of it and if she had i have no inclination to it   mo how so     dau i dont know but i never cared for it a sundays but when you go and every body and then i must   mo dear child dont cut me to the heart by telling me of my going your sister has upbraided me with it just now in her fury but your innocent way of telling me of it sinks deeper still     dau vpbraid you madam it is impossible i hope my sister is not gone mad sure you will not call my speaking so upbraiding you with any thing i abhor it   mo but my dear i upbraid my self with it     dau god forbid i should do it dear mother u t was there any harm in your going   mo only the wickedest thing in me that i was capable of doing especially as it was an example to you my dear and to your brothers and sisters     dau but if it was a wicked thing mother it was so in me too was it not   mo most certainly     dau i cannot tell what it was but i had always some uneasiness when i was out at the park or a visiting on the sabbath day but i considered my mother was with me and sure it could not be wrong then and that carried me on but dear mother do not call this upbraiding you with it it would break my heart to have you think so   mo i dont my dear but i cannot help upbraiding my self with it though no body in the world was to upbraid me with it for i have run the risque of ruining thee my dear and all the rest of my children both soul and body and i am afraid some of them are quite ruined already     dau i will not be one of them mother i will do any thing you shall direct me to   mo i would be glad to direct you for the best my dear but the work has been so long neglected i am almost discouraged and know not where to begin or how to hope for success     dau why dear mother i hope i am not so hard to be instructed or so backward to learn i am sure i am willing to change my course of life for a better not only out of obedience to you as you are my mother but out of mere inclination and choice for i have often thought we were not in the way to do our selves good and that the life we led was not as it should be   mo i thank god for that foundation laid in thee my dear and hope the rules for amendment will be the more agreeable     dau dear mother all your rules shall be agreeable to me but more especially such rules as shall deliver me from the evil of an irregular life sure i cannot be so ungrateful as to neglect the directions you shall give so much to my own advantage   mo my dear it is true that bare amendment of life is not all the duty that is before us it is not enough that we forbear the follies which we have so long committed but we must perform the duties we are commanded a christians life consists as well in discharging commanded duties as in avoiding forbidden evils both must be done and both submitted to cheerfully     dau i have been uneasy a great while at the life we live i always thought it was not right but i did not know what course to take to alter it nor what i ought to do or not to do besides i thought if i should refuse going to the play and refuse going abroad on the sabbath day i should anger you madam for i always found you were for them and yet i cannot say i took any pleasure in them but saw other families did not do so and i thought they looked soberer and lived better than ours i thought my self in heaven last winter when you let me stay at my aunts a few weeks   mo and yet these are the very things your sister calls the pleasure of her life     dau much good may they do her   mo and puts so much value upon them that she will affront her mother at any time rather than deny herself the least satisfaction of that kind     dau she shall have all my share in the pleasure at a very low price   mo indeed she provoked me just now to the highest degree when i saw her preparing to go to the park and desired her to put it off she told me twas impossible and her honor was engaged because forsooth she had made an appointment to meet the young lady lighthead     dau her honor engaged what her honor engaged to break gods commandments sure madam you did not tell her as you do me of the fourth commandment remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day   mo yes i did several times and when at last i added my own authority and told her she should not go she told me flat and plain she would go     dau i am amazed   mo nay i ought not to wonder for when she had laughed at its being a breach of gods command how could i expect she would lay any weight upon mine     dau it is impossible certainly she could never do it in contempt of the commandment she must rather pretend it was lawful and that it did not break the command   mo no my dear no body breaks the commandments of god avowedly and obstinately as gods command no body is so abbsurdly wicked as to say i will break gods commandments in defiance of him but she pretended there was no harm in it because sermon was done as if god who hallowed the sabbath day had only hallowed so much of it as was taken up in the public worship and no part of the sabbath was to be kept holy but the sermon time     dau that is the divinity of the day madam   mo nay and which is still more ridiculous as if one part of the day being dedicated to the best things the worst were to come just in the heels of them i must own i think people had better open their shops as soon as sermon is done and fall to their business every sabbath evening for sure it would be less sin to spend the day in lawful employments than in sports and recreations worship and diversion is putting the two extremes next to one another and it seems a contempt of the day to set one piece of it apart for the best things and the other for the meanest for recreation is the meanest lawful thing that can be done but your sister thinks her pleasure the reason of her life and the endfor which she was born     dau then she seems to be born for very little purpose i hope i am born for something else madam   mo yes she thinks seeing and reading plays company visits the park and the mall such material points of life and so essential to her happiness that she will not only contradict my authority but gods command rather than not enjoy them     dau i know plays and romances have been too much my sisters study and mine too but i confess i see nothing in them now so diverting as i have thought of them but if i did if i thought it was displeasing to you mother more if i thought it was an error or an enemy to religion and virtue i would soon let you see what my real value for them is   mo how dear they are to your sister you will know to her just reproach when you come to hear how she treats me for taking them from her and how dear they are to me you may guess by my having put them into the fire just now     dau i am sorry for my sister and especially dear mother that you should meet with so much affliction in your children but depend upon it madam you shall meet with nothing from me to add to it and as to playbooks and novels i hope if they were no way offensive on a religious account i could sacrifice them all to give satisfaction to my mother   mo my dear can you do so   the mother weeps for joy   dau i will soon put you out of that doubt madam if you will have patience till i fetch them   she runs up stairs to her closet mo well how said my husband to me that if we bgan this work heartily it would perhaps be blessed and succeeded from above beyond our expectation how does this dear child close cheerfully with the very first notion of a reformation who knows but god in time will mollify the obstinacy of her sister this shall however encourage me to go on with my work to continue instructing and exhorting her and not despair of a blessing though the difficulties by reason of a long delay and neglect have been doubled upon me   the daughter returns with a servant and their laps both full of songs plays novels romances and such like stuff and throws them down on the table   dau here madam is the willingst sacrifice ever i made in my life   mo and do you do this freely my dear     dau with more pleasure madam than ever i read them and i resolve them to the fire   moth i think my dear thou art the only qualified person to be trusted with them because if there be any such thing as good in them which i will not say there is thou alone art able to pick it out without touching or being tainted with the bad of tasting what has any relish without being soiled with the dirt or infected with the disease of the other     dau well madam but were i so capable i am not above being enticed and besides other of my brothers and sisters may my example their rule or may claim to use them though in my possession i had rather have them follow my sisters and therefore make it my desire madam in order to put an argument into your mouth from my example that i may put them all into the fire with my own hand   she throws them in mo the blessing of thy father and mother be upon thee my dear child thou have made my heart rejoice that was almost sunk before for fear lest all my children were irrecoverably lost by my neglect of their more early instruction     dau my dear mother i am happier in that blessing than in all that ever you gave me before   mo what will thou say my dear to thy sister when she hears of it     dau nay madam what will my sister say to me when she shall know that i have heard how she used my mother for a few ballads and playbooks   mo she will mock and flout at thee my dear     dau then i will pity her madam for i am sure she is in a worse condition than i i have your blessing and affection madam which i value above all the world and she has a heap of plays and novels in the room of it   mo my blessing my dear alas what is that may he be thy blessing whose blessing makes rich and adds no sorrow to it if god gives thee grace to go on thou will be a blessing to me rather than i to thee for i have been the ruin of you all and have brought you into the danger of being never recalled for want of instructing you before     dau dear mother do not load your self with that i hope it is not too late for us to learn now   mo it is very late my dear very late and what would have been easily taught and easily learnt before will be hard now both ways i fear my dear you do not see what other things are necessary to be done     dau what things are they madam   mo why my dear on our part thy father and i we must set up a familygovernment entirely new we must be angry now at what we were pleased at before and pleased now with what we were angry at before what we laughed at and made a jest of in our children before we must now mourn over and correct them for what we not only allowed to be done but even did our selves before we must forbid now what we accounted pleasant before must be frightful now and what we delighted in before must be dreadful to us now in short every part of our government or of our childrens obedience must be altered o the task that i have to go through o the difficulty of a late reformation in a family     dau i cannot understand what all this mighty change must be madam or wherein there will be so much difficulty sure none of the family can be backward to listen to such directions as you will give them will any of my brothers and sisters be against being made better or render your task difficult when it may be made so easy and when so much for their own good i am sure i will not mother   mo i know the mortification must be great on your side too i mean all of you it is not an easy thing to bring children off from their levities and pleasures which are become so natural to them by a long uninterrupted allowance of their parents and governors nay it is not easy for children themselves to bring their humors and inclinations fancies and passions off from the pleasures of life which perhaps they have as all mine have had an unrestrained enjoyment of the work is very hard my dear     dau i believe it will not be half so hard to me to deny my self any or all of those diversions and criminal enjoyments you speak of mother as to guide my self to those things which are necessary to be done or engaged in afterward   mo my dear a religious conversation is not the easiest thing in the world     dau but i believe it is the pleasantst thing in the world mother   mo child i wonder to hear thee say so for thou have never seen any thing of it at home     dau it is true i have not at home but i have abroad madam when you sent me to my aunts where you know i was nine or ten weeks i thought i was in heaven there to what i was at home every thing there was so sober so pretty so grave so exact and so regular and yet so cheerful so pleasant so innocently merry and withal so pious and so religious that i thought nothing so happy in my life nor did i ever spend so many weeks so well in my life   moth child your aunt is a dissenter you know     dau but madam my uncle is a churchman and let them be which they will i see no difference in their conversation they all agree to be a religious sober pious family the children are all under such government do all things so prettily and their behavior is so agreeable they love one another so entirely and enjoy one another so perfectly that i believe they are the pattern of all the town my uncle every night and morning calls them all together to prayers my aunt takes all her daughters together once a day and makes one of them read a chapter and then she says any thing she finds occasion to say to them by way of reproof or direction and i observed when i went up stairs at night not one of my cousins would go to bed till they had retired into their closets to their prayers by themselves   mo poor child that was a strange way of life to thee i believe     dau i thought it strange indeed at first but i was soon able to recollect my self and was ashamed to let them know that i thought it strange much less that i did not do so my self   mo poor child if thou had been taught as well as they thou would have done so too     dau indeed madam as i was almost left alone i could not but say my prayers too and this kind of life began to be so pleasant and agreeable to me that i never enjoyed my self like it in all my life   mo and did thou not think thy fathers family a kind of hell when thou came home again my dear     dau no madam i confess it was odd at first when instead of a regular family i came home to all manner of looseness and liberty but it soon began to be natural to me again and i forgot my good aunts instructions ay and my uncles too who used to say a great many good things to me and give me a great deal of good advice   mo how seldom is good instruction lost or thrown away i am persuaded the little good advice they gave thee was the foundation of that willingness to be governed and reformed which appears in thee now my blessing on her heart for doing thee so much good     dau i believe it has done me no harm madam   mo how then would good instruction have wrought upon thee if i had begun it ten or twelve year ago     dau dear mother i hope it is not too late   mo well my dear how do they spend the subbath at your aunts not as we do i dare say     dau no indeed madam after quite another fashion the young ladies are obliged to be down stairs half an hour after nine in the morning ready dressed then my uncle calls to prayers and soon after they go all away either to the church or to the meeting house but whichsoever it is they are almost sure to meet together after sermon sometimes at the very door and then children and servants not one stirs from home in the evening my uncle calls them all together reads to them in some good book and then sings psalms and goes to prayers when that is over they go to supper then they spend an hour perhaps or two in the most innocent and the most pleasant discourse and conversation imaginable it is always about something religious and then every one retires to their appartments and the young ladies spend their time in their closet devotions till they go to bed  the sons you know madam are grown up and those young gentlemen are the very picture of their father sober virtuous religious and modest and yet are really gentlemen and behave themselves as much like gentlemen as any men do dear mother when i came home and heard my brother damn the coachman and curse the maids when i heard the noise the clamor the profane words that our servants have in their daily conversation it amazed me i thought at first all gentlemen had been like my brother but i was soon convinced when i had been a while at my aunts   mo all this my dear is the consequence of the difference of education and all signifies my dear that your aunt has done her duty and i have not done mine nothing else has made the difference indeed gods grace excepted     dau dear mother do not afflict your self with what is past sure none of us will be such refractory creatures as to resist your good design of reforming us now   mo o it is too late to bring your brothers to any government now   mo i hope not madam if they are grown up and thereby may think themselves past government yet sure they are not past persuasion they may want judgment when little and are then rather to be taught by compulsion and correction but as they are now masters of more reason so they will the sooner submit to the affectionate persuasions of a tender father and mother especially in a thing so apparently and convincingly for their own good soul and body   mo i have a great deal of reason to fear the contrary as well in your sister as in your brothers     dau i think my sister is passionate and very fond of pleasure and gayety but madam time and your authority i hope will prevail upon her to reflect upon her own interest as well as duty   mo go to her my dear and see if you can work any thing upon her     dau alas madam i shall be a very simple instructor to her who thinks her self so wise she reckons me but a child fitter to come to school to her   mo a less child than you my dear has been my instructor why may not you be hers     dau i will visit her madam but i question whether she will speak to me for i know she is in a great passion   mr well go and bid her come down into the parlour here is your father a coming tell her your father and i want to speak with her     dau yes madam   she goes up to her sister this dialogue chiefly discovers the difference of two families one religiously educated faithfully instructed and taught both by the care and example of the heads of the family the other abandoned to the gust of their own inclinations and let loose in the pursuit of their pleasures without any regard to their present duty or future happiness  the benefit the young lady received in the religious family of her aunt and the effects of it show us   how pleasant a religious life when duly conformed to and willingly complied with appears to be and   what convincing force it has in it even upon the minds of those who have no part in it themselves  end of the fifth dialogue the sixth dialogue while the mother was thus managing her daughters the father was as much engaged with his two sons and his hardships were every jot as great as the mothers and his encouragements the same too  it is to be observed here that the difficulty in this part of education of children does not lie so much in the question what to teach them and what principles of the christian religion to go upon as to bring them by reasoning and argument to be teachable to persuade them that they have any occasion to learn or that any are capable of teaching them and to cause them to submit to instruction in general  the father called his second son up to him on a sabbath day in the morning before he came down stairs and taking him into his closet began this dialogue with him the son you are to suppose had been bred a gentleman and a scholar was about seventeen years of age and was newly come from the university  the father begins thus  father son i suppose you know what day this is   son yes sir   fa but perhaps you do not know that not you only but all the family my self not excepted have never taken a due notice of the sabbath day or of the manner in which we ought to behave on that day the duty appointed for the day has been too much neglected above all the great duty of setting it apart for the worship and service of god and keeping the sabbath day holy   son i remember the fourth commandment sir   fa yes we can all repeat the commandments by rote and do every day at church say them over and over but the little regard we have shown to them in the week is too plain a proof of our thinking but little of what we say for god knows in my house there has been little difference between a sabbath day and another day unless it be that the sabbath day has been spent the worst of the two for excepting our just going to the church which also is made a mere diversion and a kind of entertainment all the rest is spent in mere revelling feasting visiting and either riding abroad or mirth and gayety at home and this is so notorious more in my family than in any other that i am sensible it is high time to put a stop to it and i design to tell you all my mind this evening that the reformation may be effectual i hope none of my children will oppose their own good   son i hope not sir   fa nay if they oppose me never so much i am resolved of this if they will be foolish and wicked they shall be foolish and wicked for themselves not for me or for any body else for my part when i look back upon my family and consider how we have lived hitherto i wonder that the judgments of god have not distinguished my family and made us as public and as much the amazement of the world for our punishment as we have been notorious for our sin and therefore if it were only for the fear of the hand of heaven though i hope i act from another principle too i think it concerns me to set about a family reformation with all possible diligence and application   son indeed i never considered it sir till of late but for some time past i have begun to see we have not been right it is true we do not live as other families do and i have often thought so but perhaps not with so much concern as i should have done   fa well child my design of altering it will be so much the more agreeable to you then when you come to practice it   son if it were not sir it shall be the more agreeable to me if it is your command   fa i would not command any thing that should not be agrreable if it were not absolutely necessary but in things indispensibly our duty the humors of any side are of no weight at all the duty must be considered rather than the inclination of those who are to perform it   son i am not only inclined to obey it for its being your command sir but my own inclination concurs to set about any thing that will rectify my life and teach me to govern my self according to my duty   fa what you say child is very obliging as it relates to me and as i have always showed you by my own conduct in your education that i have entertained a particular affection to you more than to the rest of your brothers and sisters so this return is so very pleasing to me that i cannot but tell you i will not forget to show it you and that i think my self very highly engaged by it to distinguish you in my affection and in my concern for you as you have distinguished your self in your duty and regard to me on this occasion but the readiness you show to this work of reformation from an inclination to the thing it self is a particular which i rejoice in and love you for with an affection which i was not master of before but tell me child whence came this inclination how first came any thoughts into your mind about it i am sure i have never before spoken a word about religion to you in my life   son i will not say so sir   fa ay but i have too much cause to say so and i am convinced i have not only failed of my duty for which i heartily beg pardon of almighty god but have been injurious to you child and to all my children in not furnishing you with the knowledge of your duty when you were young and giving you early instruction by which much of the follies of your lives might have been prevented all the time you have now misspent had been saved and you had all been long ago what now i doubt you will not obtain without great difficulty to me and your selves   son i am sorry to see you afflict your self sir about that i hope it shall not be too late still   fa but if not too late the work is double the task hard the attempt almost desperate and the success very doubtful   son dear sir you shall have no difficulty with me i am entirely resolved to be guided by your instructions to follow your rules obey your dictates and submit wholly to your direction let the difficulty be what it will to me and therefore i only desire to know what the first steps are you would have me take   fa the first steps my dear are the breaking off the ill practices of our family and the regulating the house by the rules of virtue sobriety and a christian life things we have all been strangers to here   son this sir is that which i told you before i had an inclination to formerly and it is with a great deal of pleasure i shall close with all your schemes of that kind because it is some time ago since i have seen and observed that as i thought we did not live like christians but rather like heathens and that other families were quite another sort of people than we and i could not but be in love with them and weary of ours for i cannot but think that nature it self dictates to a man of sense that a life of virtue and sobriety is more agreeable to us as men than a vicious wicked profligate course which ever not only ruins the estate the conscience the health and the good name of the person but even his reputation as to the world also   fa i was asking you before what first raised these just reflections in you my dear for as i acknowledged then i say again i own thou art not beholding to me for them   son the first hints i had of this kind sir were a great while ago from some accidental conversation with mr  our neighbor when we were little children   fa what the old gentleman   son no the young and afterward with his mother when after our usual recreations he carried me home to their house   fa how was it child for i long to hear the story if any good person has helped me to do my work or done it for me i shall be very thankful   son no sir not much of that but when i first began to play with that young gentleman some years ago his mother heard me use some ugly words such as i was but too much given to then and sending her son away the old lady took me into her parlour and gave me sweetmeats and asked me a great many questions   fa what questions   son she asked me if ever i was taught to swear i answered no she asked me if my father would not chide me if he heard me swear i told her no but i was sorry for it sir for i presently thought that to say so reflected upon my father whether it was true or no and that i ought to have said yes he did though it was not true   fa dear child the sin was mine and the shame of its being true ought to be mine and shall for ever be mine i am glad thou did not speak a false thing to her what said she then   son she did not say much to me the first time but only she told me twas a sad thing that a pretty boy as she said i was should be ruined and i thought i saw her weep   fa did you see her again after that   son yes sir she got me in again the next day and gave me more sweat meats and asked me several questions about god and heaven and i was sadly ashamed i could answer her to nothing at all for i knew nothing of it but what i had heard by chance or learned by rote she asked me if i was willing to know any thing for my own good in another world and i told her yes with all my heart she told me if i would come and visit her son every day she would use me like her own child but she desired me to promise her one thing before hand i said i would promise her any thing she pleased then she said i must promise her not to swear nor take gods name in vain she told me that i was a gentleman and my father and mother were persons of distinction that it was not only a sin against god but below me as a gentleman to swear and use ill words that if i should swear when i grew to be a man it would spoil all my education and no sober man would keep me company that if i would not leave off swearing and taking gods name in vain she must not let her son play with me for she should be afraid her son should learn such words too and then he would be undone   fa and did you promise her my dear   son yes sir i promised her but i could not forbear crying and when i got away from her i could not help crying a great while by my self   fa what did you cry for when you came away   son i cried for shame to think i should do any thing that wanted such a reproof and that it should be counted scandalous or dangerous for any children to be permitted to play with me   fa and did it not make you angry with the lady that had reproved you and hate her   son no sir it made me love her and ever after that to this day i have at several times gone to her and made her long visits   fa and does she continue to talk to you so child still   son yes sir to this hour and calls me her son and but that i would not dishonor my mother i should call her mother too for she has been better than a mother to me   fa how did she go on with you   son when she had gained my promise against swearing she brought in all the wicked words i had learned among our servants and made me promise to leave them all off sometimes she would persuade me otherwhiles give me money and other good things after that she asked if i used to pray to god i told her i saidmy prayers but my dear says she do you know what prayer means i told her yes but gave her so weak an account of it that she told me very affectionately she would tell me what prayer was and after having explained the meaning of it she gave me a few short directions what i should say when i prayed and then told me i ought to pray to god every morning and evening as the jews offered up their morning and evening sacrifice and that god expected such a worship and after she had for two or three times talked so to me she made me kneel down by her and she stood up and prayed a short time over me   fa this blessed woman what does my family owe her and what did thou think of it child   son truly it made my very heart turn within me when i heard a stranger so earnest in her prayers to god for me who did not belong to her and some of her expressions cut me to the heart   fa what were they child   son i fear they will trouble you sir if i mention them   fa well let me hear them however   son she prayed that god would supply the want of instruction to that poor neglected child and teach him by the powerful influence of his spirit that he would give the knowledge of himself to me and reveal christ in my heart that being taught of god i might believe in him and believing might have life through his name she prayed that god would bless her endeavors to instruct me though i were not committed to her charge and that i might be convinced of sin and then converted unto god   fa how can thou remember all this   son it is written so deep in my heart dear father i can never forget it while i live   fa what effect had it upon you child   son why sir the effect was of many kinds first i entirely left off all the ill words i had used according to my promise and i went about mighty pensive and sad for some time musing and considering what my condition was that i was prayed for as one neglected and abandoned and what she meant by the teaching of the spirit and what by tue work of conviction and conversion and the like   fa and how were you informed   son i was then as impatient to be with her every day as she was to have me and i continually harrassd her with questions and importunities and she opened and explained every thing to me in such a manner that i soon became able to understand the most difficult points in religion   fa and what effect had it upon thee child did thou not lose it all when thou came home to thy fathers wicked family   son no sir not at all i began from that time to read the scriptures to pray by my self and to consider to what purpose i was born and what was to befall me in a future state   fa and how long did this last child   son i thank god it is not wrought out yet sir   fa and is it possible my dear child has there been such a thing as a child of mine praying to god has there been a creature that has thoughta word of heaven and his maker in my uninstructed prayerless family   son little enough sir   fa and how comes it to pass neither thy brothers or sisters ever heard of it and that i never heard of it   son i knew they would but laugh at me and mock me and think me a fool and they have done so as it is when i would not go with them to plays and to their sabbath day rambles   fa why my dear was it you that refused to go i always thought they slighted you and did not care to take you with them and have been angry with them for it   son no sir they would always have had me with them but i durst not go i abhorred it   fa how came thou to be against it   son my new mother always persuaded me against it told me the many judgments of god that attended sabbathbreaking and how many miserable lives and deaths took their beginning at a neglect of the sabbath day she persuaded me too not to go to plays and balls and bade me if i wanted diversion when my brothers and sisters were gone to the play i should come and see her and that when my brothers and sisters went out to the park or a visiting on the lords day i should come thither and see how they spent their time or go up into my chamber and pray to god   fa and did you do so   son yes sir i went to her almost every sabbath day evening   fa what and no body know it   son no every body thought i had companions of my own to be merry with   fa and so thou had blessed be god for casting thy lot in such company when thy fathers house has been a nest of profaneness and abominations but how did they spend the sabbath day child when you were with them   son very well sir for they are all good people before supper they were all called down to prayers mr  their father read a sermon and every one of the children read a chapter and then sung psalms and then all kneeled down to prayers   fa and did you learn to pray there my dear   son yes sir madam  my new mother used to take me and let me kneel down just in her hand as it were and when there was any word spoken that she thought i should remember particularly she would touch my cheek and then after prayer was over she would tell me why she did so and how that sentence was proper for me to remember and to make use of for my self   fa she has been a mother to thee indeed a truer mother than she that bore thee and has acted a truer parent to thee than either thy father or mother ever did god that inclined her heart to pity my children double the blessing of it upon her own i will go and thank her for it and acknowledge how little i have done my duty and how much of my work she has done for me but my dear how long ago was this   son eight or nine year sir   fa and how long did you do so   son all along sir till you sent me to the university for a year and a half and then i could not you know   fa and have you been to give her thanks for her trouble since you came home   son no indeed sir but i have even given her new trouble for i go to her still every time i can get out not to be seen and as often as i can find her at leisure   fa still my dear why what does she teach thee now   son o sir i find more occasion of her the more i go to her she has taught me all the first principles of religion and i hope has put me in a way how to increase and go forward in knowledge and experience piety and virtue till i come to be more able to instruct my self without help she is a most excellent person and all her family are like her   fa indeed they are another kind of family than ours is well go on my dear and the lord that has found out an instrument to do thee good be himself thy instructor as for me how i am ashamed when i look into my own house and see what a soil i have had to plant in and have neglected to cultivate it what children would these have been if i had begun betimes to instruct them well go my dear it is late we will talk more of this another time   note the father was so affected with the circumstances which his son had discovered to him that he could not contain the surprise but retired to give vent to his passions he found that god had taken his children as it were out of his hand and had supplied the defect of instruction by good people in the neighborhood as if he had not been worthy to be the instrument of their good and this affected him deeply as will farther appear in the next discourse between the husband and his wife when they come to talk about it  end of the sixth dialogue the seventh dialogue the father had not been so happily surprised in his discourse with his second son in the morning but he is as unhappily mortified with the rencounter he meets with in his eldest son in the afternoon the young gentleman was above stairs with his eldest sister as noted in the fourth dialogue when his father called for him and being a little ruffled in his humor with the ill usage as he thought it that his mother had given his sister he came down with a grave discomposed look and appeared not very respectful in his behavior his father who knew him to be hot and fiery in his disposition was not willing to have been angry and designed to treat him as will appear very kindly but he takes up the case first and began with his father  son sir did you forbid thomas letting us have the coach   father i ordered in general that none of the servants should stir out to day   son i thought so and told the dog that i was sure you had not forbid him i will break the rascals head this minute   offers to go out fa hold george i must speak with you first   son i will come again sir immediately   offers to go again fa no no i must speak with you now sit you down i will have no bodys head broke to day dont you know it is sabbath day   son better day better deed sir it is never out of season to correct a rascal   offers to go a third time fa george sit down i say and be easy perhaps you may be better satisfied presently if you can have patience   son sir i am satisfied from your own mouth that the villain not only refused when i ordered him to get the coach out but told me a lie and said you forbid him which i then told him i did not believe and promised to cane him if it were not true and i must be as good as my word   fa well well but let it alone for the present i say   son i must and will beat the villain by    swears softly yet so that his father overhears him fa the coachmans usage is not so rough to you but i think yours is as rude to your father   son why sir what do i say i dont speak disrespectfully to you sir but i speak of this same fellow   fa i heard what you said sir and what you might be sure i did not like and wherever you use such language if you had any respect to your father you would not take that freedom where i am   son if it had not been in respect to you sir why did i speak softly   fa that was a seeming respect indeed but you took care i should not be ignorant   son i did not design you should have heard i intended no disrespect   fa well sit down here then and suspend your foolish passion about the fellow at least for the present   son i suppose you dont keep servants on purpose to affront me at that rate   fa if my son had as much patience with his father as he obliges his father to have with him he might have had an answer to that before now but you are too hot for your father to talk with you it seems   son no sir i am not hot but it would provoke any body to be used so by a servant   fa then you must turn your anger this way and quarrel with your father for the fellow has done nothing but what i commanded him   son why you said sir you did not bid him refuse me   fa you must have every thing nicely explained to you it seems i tell you what he said to you was the natural consequence of what i ordered though perhaps the fellow did not give you the true reason but in general i had bid him stay at home   son he might have said so then   fa no perhaps i had commanded him otherwise too   son i find i am not to know how it is nor what it means nor do i care whether i do or no   fa in time you may   son as you please sir   fa well in this it shall be as i please then but if you had thought fit to have come to talk with me with less heat in your temper and waited a little till i had spoke what i had to say to you all your fury at him and your indecency to me might have been spared   son i did not know what you sent for me for   fa and did not design to know it i suppose for you gave me no time to speak   son i only told you of the treatment of the coachman i have no more to say   fa then i may take my turn i hope i shall tell you then that i send for you as i purpose to do for all your brothers and sisters to tell you that whereas we have lived in an open professed contempt of gods commands profanation of the sabbath day and omission of all religious duties it is high time to take up a new course that i was convinced of what was my own duty as a father and a master of a family that hitherto the sin lay too much at my door but for the future i would discharge my self better that if my children would go on it should no longer be through my omission but their own to this purpose i began with my servants who as soon as i came from church i commanded to be all at home and that i would have no going abroad then i resolved to tell my mind to my children who i expected would not give me the trouble of commanding or using the authority of a father or governor with them but that i might with reason and argument persuade and with affection and tenderness invite them to a thing which must necessarily so far convince their consciences as to leave them no room to question but it was infinitely for their advantage and for their general good both soul and body   son i knew nothing of this sir   fa well that is true but as i said you might have known it before if you had had patience or had thought fit to have given me time to speak to you   son nay i do not understand it now i do know it   fa your ignorance shall serve you but a short while you can easily understand this part of it that without troubling you with any more of the reasons of it i will have none that are under my roof children or servants stir out of my doors on the sabbath day after church is done   son you will take it ill perhaps if your children should ask you the reason why they must be so confined and your children will not fail to think it hard to be confined so and not know the reason of it   fa i might with much more justice insist upon my undoubted right to govern my own family without giving an account to my children of what i do also in a case so plain as this methinks they need not seek for a reason for such an order but since they pretend ignorance let them read the commands of god to keep holy the sabbath day   son those commands were as strong before as they are now and yet we never were thus confined before   fa the worst of that is mine son and all that can be said for an answer to that is that before i was to blame and neglected my duty now i resolve god willing to do my duty and neglect it no longer and if it be otherwise they that are guilty shall be to blame not i   son every body may do their own duty for themselves   fa but it is my unquestioned duty to make all that are under my command do their duty   son i do not desire to be confined   fa my desire or my design was not to confine you but to persuade you to confine your self by the rules of your christian duty but you have pushed it farther than i expected and if you will not do it your self i must do it for you   son i hate to be confined or to confine my self   fa that makes it more my duty to confine you and since i think your business is to obey and not to dispute i desire no more of your arguments but expect to see my orders observed since i know they are founded upon both religion and reason   son you may oblige us to stay within but you cannot oblige us to be willing   fa then i must be content with as much of your obedience as i can get   son and i hope will expect it no longer than while we cannot help it   fa but will take care that you shall not help it while you call me father for i will not bear the title without the authority   son liberty is a native right the brutes seek it not a bird will be in a cage if it can be free   fa liberty to do evil is an abandoned slavery the worst of bondage and confinement from doing evil is the only true liberty but to cut this discourse short i can give liberty no longer to any under my roof to break gods commands or profane his sabbath it is not in my power if you will not submit to my government you must quit my dominions and as i foresee you will be forward enough to carry it high you are mistaken if you think i shall wait to be told by you that you will go abroad or that you will not stay in the family for unless you will submit to regulate your life after a different manner than you have done and to receive advice from your father for your conduct flatter not your self with your fathers affection i will love none that hate god nor shelter none of his rebels my doors shall be open to let you out when you please   son i care not how soon   fa that is what i expected from you my answer shall be very plain you shall be at liberty to go this hour son before the next but take this with you whenever you go that if ever you set your foot without the door on this account you never get leave to set your foot within it again but upon your knees and with the humblest repentance and submission both to god and your father for i am not in jest with you   note no wise father ought to suffer himself to be threatened by his children with going away from him but rather to make their being thrust from their parents be the greatest punishment they have to fear  the father goes out of the room but returns again immediately fa i did not expect this treatment at your hands son   son i do not know what you would have me do   fa what i would have you do is very plain and is nothing but what your duty to god requires viz to submit to the regulations and orders which i shall give in my family for the worship of god and for regulating our morals and our way of living and especially for restoring a general face of religion and virtue upon our conversation that we may according to the scripture live soberly righteously and godly in the present evil world and not be eminent in the place we live in for the loosest and most profligate family in the whole neighborhood   son i think we are religious enough what should we do more than we do   fa i think my first work is to let you know what you should not do for if this cannot be obtained viz to refrain from what we do that is wrong how shall we come to ascertain what is right and if we know not what evils to refuse how shall we know what duties to perform   son i know nothing we do that we ought to leave off   fa that is the reason why i bewail so much your want of instruction and education and that i am so willing to retrieve the loss i can soon tell you what you should leave off viz you should leave profaning the lords day in sports diversion visiting riding to the park company and the like and spend it as it was appointed to be spent viz in acts of religious worship in hearing and reading gods word and in other duties proper to that purpose next you should leave off the play houses and reading plays as not only introductory to vice and an extravagant mispender of time but as they lead to engaging in such society and bad company as will be destructive to any sober character in the world thirdly that a general sobriety of behavior be fixed upon the whole scheme of your conversation free from passion ill words swearing blaspheming gods name and from drunkenness and all other excesses these are the main heads of the negatives which i speak of and which i desire to be observed and this is so just so easy and so equitable that i cannot but expect especially considering how many children are circumstancd a ready compliance with it i shall direct you to positive duties afterward   son i know not how we are circumstancd or what you would have me understand by that word   fa i find your temper is such that i am rather to let you know what i expect than to hope for your observing it and that you will put the hardship upon me of doing all with you by force this is a treatment i think very disingenuous and unlike a dutiful son i am willing to indulge you in every thing that is reasonable and just but as i am convinced what i desire is not only your duty but your interest to comply with i therefore cannot indulge you to your own ruin and for that reason if you will oblige me to use violent methods to restore you and to restore my family although i shall be sorry for it yet as it is my duty i must do it and i let you know therefore very plainly my resolution and the reason of it if you can give better reasons why you should not comply with these things i am ready to hear them   son what signifies giving reasons against what you resolve to do   fa it might take off the scandal of disobedience from you when you pretend to oppose your practice to my directions   son i dont concern my self about scandals not i   fa you fortify your self against every thing a wise man ought to be concerned at and that by a general negligence of god and man as if you were unconcerned for conscience or reputation i hope you dont desire to be known by such a character   son i dont see that i do any thing that deserves reflection   fa well come examine a little is your lords day conduct to be justified do you think you keep the sabbath day as you ought to do   son why sir do i not go constantly to church   fa where do you find in gods law that going to church is the sum of the sabbath day duties if you can show me that in the scripture then i am put to silence   son i see no harm in taking the air a little after sermon time   fa if sermontime be the whole of the sabbathday you are in the right but then you must prove that the fourth commandment should have been translated thus viz remember that thou keep holy the sermontime on the sabbath day   son i think there is no need of so much strictness   fa god and your father are of another opinion or else neither the rules of one or the discourse of the other are to be credited i see all your arguments against these things are only in general that you do not think thus or you do not see that but have you any just objections against the express commands of god if you have let us hear them   son i do not object against the commands of god but i do not see on the other hand that i break the commands of god in taking a turn in the park or visiting a friend on a sunday after sermon   fa i will lock up all argument on that side against you thvs if you can prove that taking your pleasure on the sabbath day is keeping it holy you may justify your self if not you cannot and for that read this text is       if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day etc there is the word of god directly against you would you have any further authority   son i cannot dispute of these things   fa they that cannot dispute should not contradict however i think it my duty to let all of you know that as i have no reason to doubt but the command of god is clear and that i ought to see it obeyed i join to it my own command viz that in my family i will have no more profaning the lords day no more going to plays no more swearing drunkenness or immorality whatsoever if i can help it and i expect to be put to as little trouble as possible in having this order of mine submitted to   son i suppose you may find some opposition besides what you think i shall make you have more children than me   fa you have the less need to make my task harder and join with them however i am speaking now not of their obedience but yours   son perhaps i may obey as much as they but i suppose i may bear the blame of their standing out   fa if you do well you are sure to be accepted if not sin lies at the door if you are an encouragement to their disobedience you take your share of the guilt whether it be by words or by example my business however is not with them now but with you and i desire to know your mind having now told you what i expect   son i know not what you would have me say you say you will be obeyed then i must obey i think i know nothing else to be said if you will make the house a monastery i must turn monk i think but nothing is more certain than that we shall all think it hard and think we are not used kindly   fa the commands of god are not grievous nor are my resolutions hard or unjust and that makes the opposition which you make the more unnatural however since you are not to be wrought upon to think it reasonable i must content my self to take your outward compliance whether willing or unwilling though i think your behavior highly disobliging and shall always let you know i resent it as such   son you will find all your children will think it hard as well as i   fa that cannot be true for i know some of them to whom god has given more grace   son i am sure then others have not   fa yes i know your sister has shown herself much to the disgrace of her good breeding as obstinate as your self and has been very insolent to her mother and i hear she talks at a rate of her mother that does not become her i shall assure her it shall not be born with   son i think my mother used her very ill   fa i find you are too partial to be judge of it and therefore ought to let it alone what has her mother done to her   son she has taken away all her books of value and not only ruffled her with hard words but even struck her with very little provocation   fa you have a truer account of the fact i find than of the provocation as to striking her i regret that she had not done it sooner and repeated it oftener her sauciness to her mother and her contempt of god were unsufferable it was her good fortune that i was not there and as to taking her books i have had the mortification to look them all over and with a great deal of affliction to think that any children of mine should spend their time in such foolish filthy and abominable books   son what do you mean the plays   fa yes i do mean the plays songs novels and such like which made up her whole study were they fit for a young maids contemplation   son i must own i think them very fit   fa then your sin is come up to a maturity very fit for a public reformation and it is high time you were begun with wherefore i tell you very plainly i shall cause you to pass the same trial with your sister and if i find any such like books in your custody you may be sure they shall all go the same way   son then you will put me to the expense of buying more for i cannot be without my plays they are the study of the most accomplished gentlemen and no man of sense is without them   fa no man of vice you might say is without them but i am positive against plays as before and i had rather have you not accomplished than that the other inconveniences of plays should be your lot but i can show you many accomplished young gentlemen who are no ways concerned with them   son what who never see a play   fa no never   son it is impossible   fa no no far from impossible   son i can never promise not to go to the play   fa then you and i shall differ to the greatest extremity   son this is intolerable i had as live you would turn me out of your door i will be content to go to the west indies or be a foot soldier or any thing rather than be made such a recluse why was i not bred like a priest then you might have sent me to a monastery and i might have been used to a cloister life but to breed me up for a gentleman and then confine me as no gentleman is confined this is exposing me and making me look like a fool among all company   he flies out in a rage fa i had rather see you a foot soldier or any thing than listed in the service of the devil but here is no need of these desperate resolutions here is nothing required of you but what becomes a gentleman very well and as much a gentleman as any body can you pretend you cannot serve god and be a gentleman that you cannot live a virtuous life and obey the commands of god and yet be a gentleman this is a reproach upon the very name of quality and such a slander on a gentleman as no gentleman in his senses will allow however this in short is the case son and if confining you from unlawful pleasures and from ruining your own souls will make you desperate and you will be a foot soldier or run away to the west indies you must i cannot help it i suppose you will be weary of it quickly   son i care not what i do or whither i go   he walks about in a great passion fa unhappy foolish youth had i extorted obedience to any unreasonable unjust thing had i put you to any hardships had i exposed you to any dangers or deprived you of your lawful pleasures these things might have been alleged and you might have had some pretense for talking thus to your father but all this for laying before you your unquestionable duty for requiring nothing of you but what your great maker commands nothing but what is equal just and good this is a deplorable instance of the woeful depravity of your judgment and corruption of your nature however though i heartily pity and grieve for you yet the thing i desire is so just so reasonable so necessary so much my duty to command and your interest to obey that i cannot i will not go from it or abate one tittle of it and therefore you may consider of it and act as you will you know my resolution and fall back fall edge i will have it done so you may take your choice for god or the devil   father goes out and leaves him son you may be as resolute as you will you will never bring me to your beck what must i forsake all my mirth and good company and turn hermit in my young days not i i will go to the galleys rather i will seek my fortune any where first not go to the park nor see a play be as demure as a quaker and set up for a saint what shall i look swears aloud like  i will not be a mountebank convert not i i hate hypocrisy and dissimulation i have too much honor for it well i will go up to my sister she is an honest resolute girl if she will but stand to me we will take our fate together what can my father do sure we are too big for his correction we will never be made fools on at this rate   the father had sent for his eldest daughter and she had refused to come as before and the servant had just brought word she would not come  father returns fa will not come   serve she said she would not indeed first but afterward she said she could not sir   fa go to her again and tell her from me if she does not come immediately i will come and fetch her   serve sir she was laid upon the bed and said she was indisposed and could not come   fa well go back then and tell her her mother and i will come to her   serve indeed i told her that i thought you would do so   fa well and what said she   serve she said sir she was not fit to speak to you i believe she is ill for she has been crying vehemently   fa i suppose you and she have conferred notes   son i told you sir you would have more opposition to your design than from me   fa perhaps by your means   son if that could be without my knowledge something might be but i said before i should be taxed with it whether guilty or no   fa i will deal with it let it be where it will   the son as soon as he could get away from his father goes up to his sisters apartment it seems the father though he had resolved to talk to his daughter had deferred it for some time and did not go up to her chamber presently  being then in some passion at his sons behavior and withal being preparing for the great work which he had resolved to begin that evening he was unwilling to discompose himself and make himself unfit for what was before him the rest of the conduct both of the son and daughter and also the history of the fathers management at his first beginning his family reformation will ll be largely set down in the next dialogue  end of the seventh dialogue the eighth dialogue being between the eldest son and eldest daughter her brother going directly from his fathers discoursing him as in the last dialogue up to his sisters chamber and calling at the door begins thus  brother sister where are you were you not sent for by my father   sister three times in vain and ever shall be so till they shall treat me in a better manner or invite me by a more pleasing message   bro but i bear all the weight of those refusals my father says they all lie at my door and angrily suggests that you are all made rebels but by me   sist i know no rebellion in it i do not understand what they would have   bro they would have you come down and be instructed   sist i sent them word i was indisposed and they cannot but believe it when they know how they have used me besides i know their business and desire no more of their instruction at least of the kind they have already given me a taste of   bro i have had a long discourse of it with my father   sist well and what does the good reformer preach i suppose it is much the same with what i had from my mother   bro exactly kick and cuff excepted and truly though he kept his hands off from me he has not spared abundance of threatenings and other positive testimonies of his patriarchal authority   sist well but what is the sum of the matter what is the course we are to take   bro i know not in the least i have heard a great deal of stuff of reforming the family living after a new fashion serving god and i know not what i wonder who my father thinks we have been serving all this while   sist and does he not say we shall not go out a sundays   bro ay and a great deal more than that we must go to no more plays or operas nor have any of the plays brought home to read and a new family government is to be erected i dont know of what kind   sist well and when are we to begin when are we to be cloistered for the first time will not he give us a week to our selves before we begin   bro not an hour   sist nay then i shall break the first commandment he gives me for i have made an appointment you know to be at the play to morrow with my lady lighthead and it is impossible to put it off   bro ay and i will go too or i shall think it very strange let him say what he pleases to it   sist i suppose i shall have another slap of the face for it but i must venture it for once for i will not be worse than my word to my lady   bro what do you talk of venturing it once as if this was the last time and we were never to go to a play again do you think i will be abridgd of so dear a liberty no not i let my father depend upon it though i never come into his doors again as he has threatened me   sist very well what did he threaten to turn you out of doors then   bro no not directly but i told him i would be a foot soldier before i would be confined so and in return he told me if i went out in a huff at this i should never come in again and a great deal more such as that   sist would i were a man as you are if i was i would try him what need you care whether you come in again or no you know you have an estate left you by your uncle which my father cannot hinder you of you can live without him i wish i could   bro ay that is true but i suppose we shall not come that length   sist it may be not with you but i know not how far it may go with me for i hear they are mighty hot and angry with me which i care little for and am resolved they shall not conquer me whatever comes of it i suppose they think i cannot tell where to go or how to live without them   bro they may be mistaken perhaps in that too   sist nay though they were not mistaken in it i will go as far as a pair of shoes will carry me before i will be made a nvn of nay i will go to service first   bro you need not go far you have friends enough you will be very well received at my aunt  s house and if they push these things to extremities i would even have you go thither   sist and what will you do where will you go   bro o i will do well enough i warrant you i will not go for a foot soldier whatever i said to him i will take me a lodging at westminster take my pleasure and never trouble my head with it   sist agreed then but shall not we go abroad to night shall we be balked at this rate and let them think they have conquered us already   bro why it is too late now to go to the park my lady lighthead is gone to be sure besides we cannot have the chariot and there is no going in a hack   sist i will tell you what we will do then i am for putting the case to a trial and see what my father will do when he thinks we have gone in spite of him and yet we will be able to come off of it too at last if we find him furious   bro that is well contrived if it can be done but how will you go about it   sist i will tell you let you and i go out through though garden and take a walk in the close behind under the limetrees when my father calls for me my maid shall say we are gone to the park if he bears it quietly well and good we will let him remain in the belief of it that it may serve another time if he flies out furiously we must come in again with good words and tell him where we have been and that we have not been any farther than the close behind the garden   bro admirably well thought of let us go immediately for my father and mother both will be here with you presently and if you are not gone it will spoil all the contrivance   they prepare to go down stairs and the young lady talks thus with her maid mstress pru   maid madam   mist here take the key of my chamber and stay in it till somebody comes to look for me from my mother   maid what answer shall i give them madam   mist tell them my brother and i are gone out together you may say you suppose we are gone to the park   maid shall i say madam that you said you were gone to the park   mist no no say you do not know whither we are gone but that you suppose we are gone thither do not we use to go thither you fool you   maid if they should be very inquisitive they may ask me what reason i have to suppose so   mist is not that a good reason for you to think so because we used to go thither always on sunday night without saying that we told you so   maid yes madam i think it is for indeed if you had said nothing to me i should have thought you had been gone thither and have told them so of my own accord   bro this is a clear thought my dear but now we must do it quickly for i find we are to have a general conference here this evening and i suppose we that they call children too are to be tutored before all the servants   mast pru if you find my father and mother make a great stir for us slip out through the garden and perhaps you may find somebody at the back gate to tell you where we are and then you may come and bring us intelligence   maid yes madam   they go out together a back way through the garden bro come we are far enough here they are walking under a row of trees just where the father found his little child in the first dialogue we are quite out of sight of the house and if your maid comes we shall see her at the garden gate well enough   sist now i cannot but laugh to think what a fright my mother will be in when she misses me   bro as bad as if you were run away with a chaplain   sist she has not been without some whims of that kind in her head too but she need not i am not so fond of a preaching husband   bro i doubt we shall discompose them for their new devotion which they are setting up to night   sist pray brother have you learnt what they are to do they treat me so odly they will have me comply with i know not what i want to know what their design is and what they pretend we are to do or to be it is all a heap of nonsense to me   bro o they talk of a great familyreformation and we must submit to such rules and such orders as they shall please to give us and as i told you we two were to be called down all together to be talked to among the rest of the children   sist what are we to turn babies again and say our catechize   bro i dont know but my father as i hear intends to make a long discourse of his new schemes for the management of his family to give them all new rules and tell them what shall be the standing orders of his house for the future   sist we have preaching enough at church i hink cannot he let us alone at home   bro i cannot tell what to say to it but he will do it and even let him go on in his own way let him make a school of his family turn pedagogue himself and make all his people school boys let him but let me alone i care not what he does   sist why that is what i said before the servants are here to day and gone to morrow if he cannot get a parcel of fools this time he may another and in time perhaps he may get a whole house full of good pious creatures that will say as he says and do just as he bids them there is my brother will and pious betty they are grown mighty good things already and for the little children they may make them do what they please but as we are grown up to be past it they may even use the rod and the frown where it is fit to be used and let us answer for our selves i think they cannot in reason deny us this   bro besides had they done this gradually and begun it sooner we might by degrees have been brought to have liked it or at least to have born with it but to be driven headlong into a thing of this kind and forced at once to a whole change upon every part of our lives this is the foolishest thing what shall we look like in the world   sist what indeed i am in a fine case already i can say nothing to my lady lighthead but make a lie and send her word i was not well   bro yes you may say you are but a child and your mother boxd your ears for being a naughty girl and would not let you go abroad   sist yes and you may say to my ld  when he asks you why you disappointed him that you are but under government and your father would not let you stir out of doors   bro to be sure i shall affront all the persons of quality of my acquaintance and shall look always like a schoolboy when i am in company they will ask me how iscapd out if i have given my governor the slip and if i have played truant when i am for breaking off at night and not willing to stay they will mock me and tell me i must go home to familyduty and go say my prayers like a good boy   sist yes and that if you stay any longer you shall be whipped or locked out of doors when you come home   bro in short i had as good be out of the world i am sure i shall be fit for no company in the world   sist i wonder my father should not consider these things he is no ignorant man he knows well enough what belongs to being genteel and has kept as good company himself as any body   bro why that is true too but he is so bewitched with this new whimsie of having neglected the education of his children and the government of his family that he is coming to confession even to us he talks of asking god forgiveness for it and i know not what a deal of such stuff i am persuaded he will bring his whole family into confusion   sist i cannot tell what to make of it all it is the oddest thing that ever i saw in my life   bro however since he will do so and we cannot help it i think it may be our best way to let him alone let him go on only let him leave us out we are past tutelage out of our minority and i think they may let us alone that is all i am for asking of him   sist i wish they would but hear reason if they would let us alone we would let their reformation go on as it will   bro but i see it will not be done my father is so over submissive in his confessions and so warm in his proceedings that i doubt he will also be obstinate for nothing is more so than these enthusiastic fits of repentance   sist what a tale is this he repents and we must perform the penance for my part brother i cannot entertain any settled thoughts of the ridiculous change of life my mother talked of there is not the least consistency in it she says she has sinned in neglecting to instruct us and therefore we must all be cloistered up upon the notion of reformation if she has sinned she must repent of it i think what is that to us we did not make her do it what can we do in it we are brought up now she cannot educate us over again   bro yes she says we should have been taught so and so a long time ago and since it was not done then it must be done now   sist what will she teach us   bro nay do not ask me i suppose she told you herself what she would teach you   sist no she did not perhaps she intended it but she flew out in a rage and her passion would not give her leave to say it out   bro she says she intended to have discoursed at large with you quietly and calmly but you provoked her and would not give her time for you began   sist indeed i was vexed that we might not go out as we used to do and i think it was reason but that was over and i was only humming to my self the tune of the last opera and she flung to me and struck me because it was sabbath day forsooth for my part i know no harm in it not i i did not sing the song out as i told you i only hummd softly it might be a psalm tune for ought she knew   bro well but come sister what shall we do next   sist we must take our measures according as the conduct of my father and mother shall direct   bro yonder is pru i warrant she brings some news she stays at the garden gate mistress goes toward her    mist well what is the matter pru   maid matter madam i beseech you come in i sear my master will go distracted and you will all be ruined   mist prithee dont tell me of that let him be mad if he pleases did they ask for us tell me the particulars   maid ask for you madam yes you may be sure of it   mist well how tell us all pru   maid why madam about half an hour after you were gone your mother sent mrs betty your sister up to your chamber for you she asked for me and i said as you bid me you were gone out she asked me whither i told her i did not know why said she she is not gone to the park is she i told her yes madam i believe she is for i heard her speak of it   mist well that was right what said betty   maid poor young lady she fell out in the greatest passion imaginable weeping and crying out for her dear sister meaning you and that you were lost and undone both soul and body   mist poor child what followed that scene   maid she went down stairs to your mother and the old lady came up immediately and soon after her came your father all into your chamber   mist very well it works as i would have it now what said they to you pru   maid first they examined me where you was then when you went out and whether you were alone or your brother with you i told them i believed you were gone together but i was not sure nor you did not tell me whither you went   mist well that was right again pru what said they then   maid your father made few words but it might easily be observed they were both very angry your mother said you would repent it and i perceived madam though your mother said most yet your father seemed most provoked he said he would not discompose himself then about it for he had other work before him but he would take a course to prevent his being insulted at this rate and so went down   mist and is that all pru   maid no no madam that is not all i assure you   mist well go on then   maid why madam my master called all the family together and    mist what and made a long preach to you all did he   maid dear madam do not mock at your father i am sure there was not a child nor a servant in the house but wept and i am persuaded had you been there you could not have refrained   mist what are you grown godly too pru   bro nay sister come dont let us jeer them to the servants neither   mist well but pru come tell us the whole matter   maid i cannot repeat particulars madam but when your father had called us all in the minister for my master had sent for him on purpose made a discourse for about half an hour about family worship and took his text in jerem  0    pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name   mist why then you have had a sermon pru what has my father set up a meeting house   maid good madam do not let me tell you any more it grieves me for you to hear you make a jest at good things and at your own father too   mist go on mrs pert you was not sent to preach too was you   maid i wish you had heard what i have heard if you had had a heart of flint it would have moved you but my telling you will do no good i fear i wish you would excuse me madam and if you love your own welfare i beseech you come in there is one step left you to save all still and but one if you miss it i am sure you are undone   mist prithee pru first tell us the history and give your advice when you are asked for it   maid i will madam if you will have patience with me the minister i told you made a discourse about family worship and directed himself chiefly to us servants he told us that our master and mistress being sensible that they had too long neglected the instruction of their children and servants and omitted the worship of god and setting up good orders in the family were resolved to alter the same and he desired the servants to consider the reasonableness of it and how much it would be our advantage and that we would all yield a cheerful obedience to such orders as should now be set up in the family and to behave our selves soberly and modestly in the house avoiding loose profane talk wicked words oaths drunkenness and the like and if we were all willing and desirous to be thus reformed he desired we would signify our willingness by standing up   mist and did you stand up pru   maid yes madam do you think i would not and every servant in the house stood up too but thomas the coachman went farther than any of us   mist what did he do   maid he stood up and making a bow to the minister he said he agreed to it with all his heart and he thanked god that he had heard such a proposal in the house and a great deal more that i cannot remember   bro he is a hypocritical rascal i owe him a caneing for all this   mist let us hear it all brother well and what then pru   maid why madam after the minister had done my master directing his speech to the minister said he thought it his duty to acknowledge with shame that he had in a great measure been the ruin of his family that he had totally neglected either the worship of god in his house or the teaching and instructing his children what he meant by what followed i cannot tell but he held your little brother tommy in his hand and lifting up the child and kissing it he said these words this little creature has been the blessed messenger from god to alarm me and convince me of the great breach of my paternal duty and has innocently reproached me with not praying to god for it or with it and with not instructing it or teaching it to pray for its self then turning to us all and said he ye have all cause to reproach me with it as well as this child and more too for he is not too old to receive impressions yet as i doubt some of you are and as appears by their absence my eldest children seem to be whose ruin both soul and body lies at my door   mist did my father say all this   maid yes madam and a great deal more that i cannot repeat   mist it was very moving i confess   maid it was so and that made me say madam i wish you had heard it as i did   mist it is as well from thy mouth pru for i see thou art affected with it and so am i a little too i think in spite of my resolutions to the contrary   maid how would you then madam to have seen your father when he spoke of you two that were absent how the tears run down his face and he was fain to stop speaking a good while do you think you could have contained i assure you madam there was not a servant in the house could refrain weeping   mist you almost persuade me to cry pru but go on   maid when he had said this madam he told us how he was resolved to live and that since we had all expressed our readiness to comply with it he was very thankful that he should have so little trouble he told us that all he expected was easy and reasonable and nothing but what every one would acknowledge was most suitable to the happiness of us all as men and women as well as christians that he required nothing uneasy nothing but that all manner of vice might be retraind and a sober and well ordered life might be our rule that the sabbath day might be strictly observed and that all his servants should attend family prayer which he resolved to have kept up every night and morning  after this the minister went to prayers and after the minister my master madam but had you heard him   mist what then pru   maid i would have gone a mile on my bare knees that you had heard him   mist heard what pru what should i have heard   maid you would have heard what you never heard in your life   mist that is true pru for i never heard him pray in my life nor no body else i believe   maid well madam i wish you had heard it now   mist what was it that would have moved me so pru   maid would it not have moved you madam to hear your dear father pray for you at the same time that you are grieving him as you do and beg of god to forgive you and reclaim you and to restore you to him that you might still be a child to him and he may have an opportunity to make up to you what injury he had done you by his neglect in your education and that your ruin may not be the effect of his omission would not this have moved you madam   mist truly pru i cannot tell but it might   maid if the words had not moved you it would have made some impression on you to have seen the rest of the family   mist what are they concerned in it   maid why they are all concerned for you two   mist for what pru   maid if you will not be displeased madam   mist no pru speak freely   maid and if my master will not be offended neither   bro no no pru let us know it all and speak your mind freely   maid why really madam they are concerned on several accounts to see such a breach in the family to see my master so grieved at it and yet to see him so resolute against you that they see plainly it will be the ruin of you both and then to think upon how unjustifiable a ground you act pray pardon me madam it is not fit i should talk thus   mist go on pru   maid why madam was it ever known that a young gentleman and a young lady the eldest branches of the family should break all to pieces with their father and such a father too and on no quarrel but that he would have them reform and serve god what will the world say i beseech you madam consider of it all the house condemn you now and all the world will condemn you as soon as you are gone   mist well pru but we are not gone yet   maid i am afraid of it   mist why so pru i suppose that belongs to the latter part of my fathers discourse   maid yes madam   mist tell us that too pru   maid why that is it which gives me the greatest concern for you madam that when my master had prayed so earnestly and so affectionately for your reclaiming and returning to your duty he went on to pray for himself that he might not be suffered to yield to your obstinacy that his affection might not prevail over his duty that if god in judgment had resolved totally to cast you off he might be able to do so too and that in the mean time he might be supported in maintaining his resolution of not receiving you again but as penitents and on good assurance of your reformation as well as repentance and this madam made me so earnest with you i think i shall break my heart for you   the maid weeps mist prithee dont grieve pru but tell us what is to be done then what did you mean by talking of our coming in i dont see what we have done that we must repent so much   maid why no madam i hope not if you will but be prevailed on now and that made me say there was one step left to save you still   mist i observed you said so pru prithee good pru what step is that i did not think things were come to such an extremity with my father   she seems to be concerned and let us fall some tears maid why madam all this and more that i have not told you is upon a firm belief which both your father and mother have that you are both gone to the park as you know you bade me say   mist that is true   maid now madam if you will give me leave to go in and say you are both of you here and have been no farther perhaps this will alter the case   mist you do not know my father pru he is not so soon altered   maid perhaps madam you may not know him neither in this case do you think if he reckons your disobedience or fault so much his affliction he will not be glad to hear that you have not been guilty   mist guilty of what pru what is the fault   maid why madam my master believes that in defiance of his command and gods command and on purpose to let him see you resolve not to regard what he has said to you you are both gone to the park to take your pleasure now on the sabbath day and on this supposition he has commanded when you come back none of the servants shall dare let you in till they call him and that though he be gone to bed he will be called up   mist nay i knew if he was angry he would be very warm   maid now madam here is a few minutes left my master may be convinced you have not been any farther than this place and you may come in the same way you went out and i dare say my master will be glad of so just an occasion not to be severe with you try him madam dear madam for your own sake do you are quite undone i am sure if you do not   mist he will not believe us now pru   maid i shall be a witness for you madam besides your brother there is in his gown and slippers and that will prove he cannot have been at the park   bro ay ay he cannot but be satisfied go pru let it be so we will follow you i would not push things too far neither sister   sist indeed we have tried him far enough for the first time well go in after her then   maid if you please to be walking a little while i will make you a signal when to come nearer   sist do so pru we will come forward till we are in sight if my father continues very angry do you open my chamber window and then we will come into the garden   bro come let us go directly in after her   sist no no let us wait a little that will look as if she had fetched us   bro i cannot think of provoking my father too much neither   sist but let us get off of this then as well as we can   they continue walking pru being come into the house makes as if she came down stairs from her mistresss chamber and meeting the mother she begins weeping pru oh madam i am undone it is i have made all this mischief   moth why what is the matter pru   pru why madam i told you i thought my young master and my mistress were gone to the park and that made my master so angry with them both and it is nothing like it it is all my fault   mo how do you know that pru i should be glad for their own sakes it was as you say and so would their father too for though he is resolved to resent it as he ought to do being master of his family yet as a tender father i am sure he would rejoice if it were not so   pru so madam do but go up stairs to our window you may see them walking together in the back close under the limetrees   mo that may be pru then they are come back   pru nay madam that is impossible too for my young master is in his gown and slippers and i dare say if you send up into his chamber you will find his clothes there   fa what is that pru says  are they come back has any the father comes of my servants let them in i assure them i will be as good as my word if they have no such servant shall stay another day in my house   mo my dear be not too rash we are all mistaken come along with me look yonder they are and pru says they have been there all this while   they go up stairs and look out of the window fa i am not to be cheated this is a feint they have their intelligence within doors and are come back and walk there to blind us but it will not do i will not be imposed upon and i hope you will not neither my dear   mo no my dear i will not be imposed upon neither but if it be really so i believe you would be glad to be satisfied and would be agreeably disappointed as well as i for i know your resentment is the effect of your duty and not the defect of your love to them   fa indeed i would be so glad to know that they were not guilty i could let out some of my blood to have it so but i can receive no satisfaction in being imposed upon i never believe a thing merely because i would have it so   mo nor i neither but pru says they cannot have been farther for they are undrest and i am going to my sons chamber to see if it be so   fa do so that may be some satisfaction   pru throws open her mistresss chamberwindow and they see the signal and come on to the garden mo the thing is plain i hope for here is his hat and sword and coat   the mother returns fa he may have come in and undressed him   mo somebody must have let him in then and you know we have had all the servants in our view besides they would not have been so weak when they had gotten in to have gone out again after hearing what orders we had given and that servant who had been so kind to have let them in would not fail to have told them of it   fa that is true i begin to hope they have not been so wicked as i feared i am sure i shall be very glad of it if it prove so   mo look they are coming into the garden it does not look as if they were guilty i consess   fa i will go and try them before they shall come within my doors for not to keep laws is all one as not to make them   they sit down together in the garden the father goes out to them fa i desire a positive answer to a plain question from you both where you have been since you went out   they stand up perceiving their father very angry son we have been walking under the limetrees sir   fa that i know my question implies where else   son my answer was so simple and plain i did not think it could have been suspected sir and therefore i did not add though it is most true we have been no where else   fa your conduct justifies the suspicion why was no servant acquainted with it that when you were called for might have answered for you   son that might be an omission but could not be a design   fa why not a design   son because it seems to answer no end or at least that i know of   fa perhaps you was willing to try me with a belief of your being gone to the park contrary to my express command i am not fond of being played with in such things as these   son it is a sign to me sir that you are very angry at something that you can suppose such a thing of me unless there were some great satisfaction in your displeasure it can be none to try whether you can be angry or no   fa i see no other end in your walking here so long   son you having expressly forbidden our going to the park i could not but think our walking here ought to be taken for a compliance with your order   fa while you disputed the reasonableness and justice of my order i had the more reason to suspect your compliance   son but if i complied when i disputed the justice of the command it would more unanswerably argue an entire obedience to it as your command only   fa i had rather you had obeyed it as gods command than as mine and then you would no more have spent your time here than at the park   son but if it be the first sir your present displeasure will remove if it was raised upon a supposition of our having been at the park   fa your absence on another account has been offensive   son but cannot be justly charged as a fault sir for i had no command except negative not to go to the park which you will easily see is obeyed   fa i must suppose it   son our dress will be evidence for us if your suspicions are not to be satisfied by the assurances of one who never prevaricated with you perhaps if i could have dissembled more as others have i might have been less suspected   fa you have much advantage you think in not being guilty this time i should have been more glad to have seen your inclination reformed too   son i do not see my inclination is vicious and am not a little surpised at the construction that is put upon my most innocent actions   fa and i do not see that what i expect is unreasonable and am as much concerned to see my self contradicted by my eldest son and daughter in a proposal to their good both for soul and body   dau i oppose nothing as i know of   fa and comply with nothing   son we had no command from you to stay within   fa i demand of you both whether you have been in no company or any where else than as you say walking under the limetrees and i expect to be answered without the least prevarication   son you may be assured sir we have been no where else   fa i am glad for your own sakes for the measures i had resolved to take would have been very irksome to me though absolutely necessary i shall say no more now it is on the condition only that your answer is literally true that i can admit you to come into my doors i shall state your duty more exactly to you in the morning and perhaps too exactly expect your compliance   the father goes away sist i never saw my father look so in my life i am frighted   bro he convinces me he is in earnest after a manner i never expected it falls out very well that we contrived this shift we should have made such a breach as would never have been reconciled i will carry the jest no farther   sist what must we do then i cannot think of being a nun and being abridgd of those liberties and pleasures i always enjoyed why did they not bring us up to it from children then it had been natural to us and we had known no better   bro i will tell you sister what i will do my father promised me i should travel i will see if i can get leave to go abroad then i shall be a little out of company and shall not look so like a fool under government as i must do now   sist and what must i do   bro ask their consent to go and live at your aunts as we said before   sist so i will then   thy go in and go up stairs and in the chamber they meet the maid bro well pru how stands matters  maid i am glad youre come in sir i trembled for fear you should quarrel when i saw my master go to you for he was in a great passion and declared when he went out to you that if he was not very well satisfied that you had been no farther than the limetrees you should not come within the doors   end of the eighth dialogue a short discourse between the husband and wife which finishes the history of the conduct of their children husband my dear we have had a hard days work but i hope it will issue well   wife alas how easily had all this been prevented if we had begun well and how great advantage have they who begin their familywork when they begin to have families   husb i have eased my heart in the public acknowledgment i have made of that omission and i hope we shall testify our sincere repentance for that sin by our exact observing our duty in time to come   wife but the difficulty of our two eldest children i doubt will every day renew our affliction   husb i must take it for a just punishment upon my past neglect but i will not for that cease to go through with my work i will not cease to pray for their reducing nor to use my endeavor as well by persuasion as by severity to oblige them to a reformed life and i have a full dependence upon gods goodness that he will restore them both to me yet though they may stand out a great while and this hope preserves my resolution to omit nothing that may reclaim them   wife i see them both so wedded to their pleasures that they think it a most intolerable burden to be abridgd of them and i find my daughter sullen and melancholy upon it she tells me she cannot appear among company and she is ashamed to be seen and desires me to let her go to her aunts and live with her a while   husb by all means let her go i think it a step of that providence to reclaim her that i was telling you i hope in for my sister will allow her or encourage her in none of her levity i am sure of that and my brother keeps just such an orderly house as i ought to have kept and hope to keep for the future   wife indeed i am very willing to it for her sister owns to me she received the first impressions of religion and serious thoughtfulness at her aunts i will even send her away   husb but what shall we do with your son for i have a secret hint given me to day that he designs to ask me leave to travel and pretends that i promised him   wife yes and i have been told that if you refuse him he will go without your consent depending upon his own estate   husb i shall be more willing to let him go now than ever because as i would have no obstruction to the resolution i have taken to reform my family so i would be very sorry to see him expose his reputation so much as to contradict me in it and appear obstinate in doing so which must embroil me with him for i shall not yield to my son especially where i am sure he is in the wrong and indeed his carriage hitherto has been a very great affliction to me if he proves impertinent i shall be obliged to resent it therefore i shall only put in one condition if he asks me viz that he take mr b  for his tutor to travel with him and he shall go when he will   wife that i dare say he will not do   husb then he goes without my blessing or consent   the daughter is sent to her aunts where having a sober religious family to converse with she begins to be less fond of her old humors and a foundation is laid there in her by the instruction and example of her aunt and her children which ends at last in her complete reformation by marrying one of her cousins a sober religious gentleman  the son travels without his fathers consent spends his estate gets a commission in the army is disbanded comes home a cripple and a beggar and though always very penitent for rejecting his fathers government and instruction yet never submits himself to his father so as to be received again and dies miserable as will be seen in the last part of this work  end of the first part part ii the introdvction the first part having historically treated of a fathers conduct with his household the foundation of his resolution to reform his family instruct his children etc i hope it may afford suitable lessons to fathers mothers masters of families etc in their duty of familyinstruction as also examples and suitable hints to children to warn them against despising and contemning the instruction of their parents from the consequences on either side which appear in the foregoing history of this unhappy yet happy family  the ensuing part will go the same length in the following cases viz   masters to servants   servants to masters and to fellow servants   companions and sociates one to another from all which may be learnt some lessons to instruct us how to fill up every relation every occasion every circumstance of life and every conversation with something useful and instructing to one another  the scene lies now among the meaner sort of people where the value of a religious family the extent of its influence and the advantage of good familygovernment as well to those who are out as to those who are in the family may be particularly observed from the remarkable conduct of some persons belonging to two or three families in a certain known countrycorporation at some distance from london  there lived in a country town an industrious trading man in middling circumstances whose employment being a clothier caused him to take several apprentices and several journeymen and who had also several children of his own he was a man of an exact upright conversation of a most devout and religious behavior but more especially in his family one that constantly maintained the exercise of religious worship in his house instructing and educating his children and servants in the fear and knowledge of god with great care and regard as well to their good as to his own duty and this with all possible modesty and caution avoiding all hypocritical shows and appearances of ostentation being a serious useful christian in every respect and his wife was in her place every way like him  there was in the same town a wealthy shopkeeper a man in great business a magistrate or alderman of the corporation who had likewise a large family of children and servants the man was bred to business drove a great trade and grew rich apace he was an honest sober man had the reputation of a very fair dealer the credit of what we call a good man that would do no body any wrong but as to religion he made no great stir about that he served god a sundays as other people did and troubled his head very little with any thing that was religious all the week after indeed he lived in a constant hurry of business so that he had really no time to think of or to spare about religious affairs  his children as they grew up he put honestly to school inquired sometimes superficially if they were good boys and learned their books and the master as superficially giving an answer that they did pretty well he was mighty easy as to their doing well in the world  as to his servants it was none of his care in the least what they did so they minded his business as to idleness he took pretty good care to prevent that by finding them constant employment in his ware houses and about his business and as to either their morals or religion he counted it none of his business except at any time some gross indecency came in his way which obliged him to find fault and then his displeasure respected the neglect or obstruction of his business or some complaints or uneasiness in the neighborhood rather than any thing of religion  it appears by the story in hand that two young lads much about the same age and pretty near the same time came apprentices to these two men the youths were very different in their behavior though otherwise agreeable to one another their conduct was as in such cases it will be suitable to the families of their parents with whom they had been educated the one a sober well inclined serious lad that had been brought up by religious parents well instructed and formed early to desire the best things the other a loose profligate profane boy perfectly wild that had been taught nothing and desired to learn nothing but his trade given to swearing lying and ill words but of a good capacity enough to learn if he had been taught in time so that he was merely lost for want of early instruction  the sober religious lad was unhappily put apprentice to the rich shopkeeper who regarded no religion but his trade and the wild profane boy was put apprentice to the religious tradesman the clothier and being neighbors the boys became acquainted it seems although there was very little suitableness between the manner of the young mens education yet their age neighborhood and opportunity of conversation concurring and other circumstances perhaps in their temper or in the time of their coming to their masters making them more agreeable to one another than ordinary they became companions and contracted an intimate friendship the consequence of which will appear in the following dialogues  the first dialogue after as is noted the two youths had contracted an intimacy so that it was grown up to a kind of affection between them they agreed in the first place to call brothers and then that every evening when their shops were shut up and their business over they would spend any time they had to spare always together either at their masters doors or walking or as their liberty would permit and as may be supposed to be pretty usual in such cases it was not the last of the questions they asked one another at these meetings how they liked their masters their employments their usage and the like in these discourses it fell out they wanted no grievances to complain of on both sides for that neither of them though they had both gone so far as to be bound liked their circumstances but it seemed that the greatest of their dislike was at their masters and the respective management of their families rather than at any thing in the trades they carried on which they otherwise liked well enough  says will who lived with the good clothier i will tell you plainly brother tom i am quite tired out with my master i cannot imagine what my father meant when he picked out such a man for me i am sure my father is none of those kind of people himself why our house is a monastery instead of a shop or a work house  a monastery will says the other what do you mean by that dont we hear your people and your servants about their business every day they dont dress cloth and comb wool in the monasteries  why no brother says will it is not a monastery so i dont mean that but we have such a world of ceremonies and religious doings among us it is enough to weary a body off their legs i am sure i shall never endure it long  tho perhaps you are sooner tired with these religious doings brother that you speak of than you would be with other things is not that it brother will speak honestly   will nay i do not know much about it i confess it dont signify much i suppose but to torment us   tho nor do you mind it much i suppose when you are at it brother do ye   will no indeed not i i take care to get a good sleep all the while if i can   tho fie upon you will   will why what does it signify to me   tho what their prayers brother   will ay their prayers why they pray for themselves not for me do they   tho no doubt they pray for you too   will i dont care whether they do or no   tho nay there i think you are wrong brother will should we not be glad to have any body pray for us i remember at church there are bills sent in for the minister to pray for folks they would not put up bills to be prayed for if it was of no signification   will ay that is when they are sick brother but what is that to me i am well enough and it is but when they desire it now i never desired them to pray for me what need they trouble their heads about me in their prayers   tho well but brother you say they pray for themselves why should you be against that   will not i but then they may do it by themselves cannot they what need they keep us up at night and raise us up in the morning cannot they let us alone we work hard enough all day they ought to let us sleep at night sure   tho why do they take up so long time at it   will ay i think it is long for us that work hard at our business all day here we are hauld out of our beds every morning by six a clock to come to prayers before we open the shop or go into the workhouse and at night we are kept up i know not how long to read and go to prayers when we might be all a bed and asleep i tell you it is a mere monastery i cannot endure it   tho well but brother i remember one thing by the by it seems this cannot be much trouble to you for you acknowledge you sleep all the while if you can so that you do not lose much of your rest   will ay that is true but that cannot be always besides every now and then they catch me at it and then there is such a noise with them  then there is our masters son he is such a religious monkey he is always a jogging a body that i cannot get a good sleep for him but this is not all brother we have abundance of strange doings of this kind besides going to prayers   tho but hark you brother will about calling you up in a morning let me hear that again you say your master calls you up by six a clock in the morning to come to prayers   will yes and that is i say just as they do in the monasteries i know it is so for i had a cousin that was a nun and made her escape out of a nunnery and she is turned protestant and she used to tell me they were obliged to rise at such hours in the night to go to prayers i wonder my master dont do so too i dont question but in a little time he will and we shall be all monks instead of clothiers   tho but brother will you must do your master justice now for if i mistake not you wrong him very much by your own account as i was going to say   will how brother i dont wrong him at all   tho why you suppose of him he takes the time he spends in those religious things out of your sleep or out of the time when you ought to be in bed and you think that an injury to you because you work hard pray what time do your hired journey men come to work in a morning   will at six a clock   tho well and do they actually go to work by six a clock   will yes why not is not that the usual time   tho yes brother but then you say your master does not call you up till six and then he goes to prayers now if he did not go to prayers he would go to work and you could not expect but to be at work who are his apprentices as well as the journeymen so that the time he spends at prayer he takes out of your working time and not out of your sleeping time and the loss is his own not yours i think there you do your master wrong brother   will what care i whose time it is i wonder what need there is for making such a pother i am as tired as a dog with it i warrant they dont do so at your house   tom our house will no indeed we are not troubled with it i never heard a chapter read or a word spoke of prayer since i came into the house and that is as much my uneasiness as this is yours   will you are very happy brother i wish i had been in such a place   tho i cannot be of your mind brother what makes you talk so wickedly   will what do you mean by wickedly i say you are happy that you are not tormented as i am   tho i ay will but at the same time all this that torments you is your master calls you up in the morning and keeps you up at night to do your duty and what you ought to love i mean to go to prayers and the like   will why ay is not that torment enough what do you tell me of their prayers and duty i desire none of it not i   tho you make me tremble will i am frighted at you   will frighted at what   tho why if i should talk as you do i should be afraid the devil would take me away alive do you know what you are talking of   will yes sure i speak plain enough   tho why is not all you complain of nothing but serving god as they are commanded to do and are we not all to do so too if we would be saved   will prithee thomas dont thou talk gospel too i bent against their serving god not i   tho but you ant for doing it your self though and you speak contemptibly of the thing it self   will i dont know what belongs to it not i what need they make such a do about it   tho about what will what about serving god   will no about their saying so many prayers   tho you are mighty uneasy methinks about saying your prayers is not that serving god i am amazed at you indeed will   will why but as i told you brother that is not all   tho no is not that all what then   will no nor half for every night in the week we must read every one a chapter and there our master tells us a long story of something or other about what we read and asks us a great many foolish questions that i can give no answer to then every sunday we are examined about what the minister said at church i never heard of such blind doings why how should i remember what he says it may be i am at play without doors or in the churchyard half the time   tho well but brother you should not you ought not to do so you know that i hope and i suppose your master puts you to remember what the minister says that you may be obliged to stay and hear him as you should do i think he is very kind to you i wish i had such a master will   will i dont value such kindness let him be kind to me in other things   tho why can any thing be kinder than to keep you from doing what you should not do i mean playing in the fields or streets or churchyard all sermon time   will yes i would fain have him let me go home every sunday to my fathers that would be kind to me but he will not let me do that   tho brother that would not mend the matter to be sure your father would take care you should go to church all the day and go to prayers again at night and you say you cannot abide that   will you are quite mistaken in my father he is none of them he goes to church himself indeed but he never troubles himself to hinder us we may go where we will for all him if he would but let me go home to my father i should do well enough   tho well nor dont your father call you to prayers at night   will no indeed nothing like it he knows better things   tho what nor a sunday night neither   will no nor a sunday night neither prayers i dare say no body ever heard my father say any prayers in his life except when his horse fell on him and broke his thigh and every body thought he would have died or must have had his thigh cut off then he sent for the minister indeed and they had a deal of prayers in the chamber i remember but as soon as that was over and my father was well again he never troubled his head any more with it what should he for there was no need of it then you know   tho for the lords sake will do not talk so   thomas starts as if he was frighted will what do you mean what do i talk   tho talk why you talk blasphemy almost you have been dreadfully educated will prithee what is your father is he a protestant   will talk blasphemy what do you mean tom what did i say   tom say why i am afraid to repeat what you said   tom looks earnestly upon him and upon the ground about him will what makes you look at me so brother you look as if you were scared what ails you   tom truly will you have terrified me i was looking at you to see if you did not begin to look pale and stagger for i wondered god did not strike you dead when you talked so horridly   will and what did you look about upon the ground for   tho to see whether it did not begin to cleave and part for i expect every moment it should open and swallow you up   will you fool you what do you mean   tho indeed i should have expected all that if i had said so   mark the tenderness of the child that was religiously educated will what did i say that you make such a stir about it   tho truly will i wish you would consider a little your self what you said or at least what you meant when you said your father knew better than to pray to god and that after your father had broke his thigh and was well again there was no need of praying to god are not these dreadful words will   will no i think not what harm is there in them i thought no harm not i   tho but are you in earnest will when you say your father never prays to god   will nay tom i did not say never i told you he went to church a sundays   tho well but never else never at home never called his family to prayer as your master you say does   will no never in his life that ever i heard of   tho why what is your father is he a heathen or a christian is he a papist or a protestant   will my father a heathen no i think not he is as good a christian as any of our neighbors   tho ay that is strange i thought there had been no christians lived so will is he a protestant or a papist   will why a protestant what should he be do you think my father a papist no indeed my fathers as good a protestant as any of you did not i tell you he went to church every sunday nay sometimes especially when it is bad weather he goes to the meeting house because the church is a good way off   tho will will i never heard the like or saw the like till i came to my master i thank god i have never been bred up among such christians or among such protestants i thought there had been no such protestants in the world nay there is a popish family lives next door to my fathers and they are constantly morning and evening and often at other times of the day too at their worship and prayers serving god in their way nay i have heard that the turks say their prayers five times a day why it is natural to pray to god will did not he make us   will i cannot dispute not i what do you call serving god is not going to church serving god i told you my father went every sunday to church i think that is serving god is not it and he may say his prayers at home too for ought i know i suppose he does not tell folks when he does that as my master does who makes all the house hear of it   tho but brother will thou talk as if thou had been bred a heathen and not a protestant prithee will did every read the bible   will yes i learnt to read in it at school   tho was that all did you never read at home what have you never a bible in the house   will yes we have a great bible in the parlour window   tho what and does no body use it   will yes my mother reads in it sometimes and my father sets down how old his children are in it there is the time when we were all born   tho but were you never used to be bid to read in it by your father or mother   will yes my mother would sometimes call me from play to come and read my book but i would not come i loved my play too well for that   tho what would not you come   will no not i   tho what not when your mother called you   will mother no what cared i for my mother   tho i never heard the like in my life why it is a sign you never read the bible   will why what if i had   tho why there you would have read cursed be he that sets light by his father or mother deuteronomy       besides will cannot you say the ten commandments   will yes i think i can   tho well and dont you remember the fifth commandment honor thy father and thy mother   will why what is that to my going to play   tho but it was something to your refusing to come and read your book when your mother called you   will what signified that i knew my mother was not angry she did not much trouble her head whether i came in to read or no   tho so indeed it is plain as you said that neither your father or your mother troubled their heads about you whether you served god or no i do not wonder that you think it so troublesome that your master goes to prayers and serves god in his family i wonder how you that have been bred so wickedly came to be put out to so religious a family as your master is   will why i heard my father say once before i came to my master that he was the willinger to put me to him because he was a good man and i might learn good things there for i had never learnt any at home   tho so that your father owns then will that these are good things though he does not practice them himself that is very strange will   will yes yes my father used to say he loved my master because he was a good man and that he was a man kept good orders in his family and one day he told me that if i was a good boy and followed my masters advice i should be made a good man better than ever my father was and that my master went to prayers and served god and such as that but i knew nothing what he meant if i had known how it was i should never have come   tho why you own that though your father did not call you to prayer himself he liked your master the better because he did why should not you too   will not i i loved to live as i had been bred   tho but you see your father owned that your master was a better christian than himself and that the orders he kept in his family was the way to make you a good man nay to make you better than your father too methinks you should believe your father   will i dont know as to that but i dont like it not i   tho you are then not for being made a good man or else you dont believe your father   will i dont see how he will make me any better than i am i tell you i dont like it at all i dare say you would not like it neither   tho would i not i wish i was to be tried will   will i wish you were i am sure you would be sick of it   tho why now brother will that cannot be for my grievance is just the contrary to yours for i have been the uneasiest boy alive i have got a master that lives exactly like your father   will my father alas my father is but an ordinary man your master is an alderman   tho i mean as to religion will it is true my master goes to the meeting house and my mistress goes to church and they serve god there after their way and we have nothing of swearing cursing or drunkenness in the house or such as that i must do them that justice but as to religion i never heard a word of it in the house since i came to it   will well now and yet every body says your master is a very good man   tho that may be   will why then brother you see you were mistaken before when you fancied a man could not be a good man without making such a pother about his praying and his religion as my master does i do not see that my master is a jot better man than yours   tho nay will it was not i was mistaken it was your own father was mistaken who you acknowledge told you he loved your master because he was a good man and that you might learn good things there and that if you followed your masters advice you would be a good man too and a better man than your father he must be mistaken in all that will   will well but i ant talking of my father they may be any of them better than my father he knows that himself but i speak of your master every body says he is a good man and a religious man and he has the best reputation in the town   tho ay will he is an honest man a very fair man he does no body any wrong but i have never been bred that way in my life i have never heard any such thing as praying to god or reading the scriptures in the house since i came hither and yet when i came to him i was told he was a mighty religious man   will why that is what i say he is counted a religious man and they say he goes to the meetinghouses too   tho so much the worse for him if he appear religious only and his practice makes him appear to be otherwise however i will not say what he is privately but this i am sure of it does not appear in his family we that are servants see nothing of it nor his children either   will why that is as i would have it be at our house he is a very good man every body says so and what need he trouble you with it i dont like this making such a show of religion cannot they be religious but they must trouble all the family with it i believe your master is a very honest good man tom though he makes no show of it as mine does   tho you talk profanely again will i am no more for making a show of religion than you but if there be no religion where there is some show of it to be sure there is no religion where there is no show at all of it but what do you call show is it not every christian mans duty to teach his household and family to serve god do you call that a show every one ought to make such a show of religion and if he does not he plainly makes a show of having very little religion himself i might give you a great many places out of scripture for this but it seems you have not read much out of the bible   will why what would you have your master do you would not have him make such a rout as my master does would you   tho i would have him serve god in his family as other religious good people do   will well but you say they all serve god a sundays   tho what is that to his family we may run about where we will for all him sabbath day or any day or night he never takes any thought for us we are but in the counting house next morning when he wants us we may serve god or the devil it is all one to him   will that is what i want now i wonder you should be uneasy at it   tho i have not been used to such a life will though you have it terrifies me so i cannot bear it   will why what would you have what is it to you what your master does   tho a great deal god has said he will pour out his fury upon the families that call not upon his name jer  0    and i am one of the family now   will well but can you not say your prayers by your self   tho truly i have no manner of convenience for that neither for we all lie together in a room and at first i used to kneel down and pray by my self but the rest of the apprentices jeered me out of it and made such a noise at me i was forced to leave it off and now i go to bed and rise like a beast as they do but it grieves me so i cannot tell what to do for i am sure it is a sin to do so and i am afraid god should show some judgment upon me for it   will why is there any danger of that tom why i never prayed to god in my life   tho then you are in a fad condition will and so am i too sometimes i think it will break my heart i think my father has put me in the devils mouth and i am going the strait road to hell i am sure he does not do so himself   will and so you have left off saying your prayers tom now quite have not you and then you live as bad as i do dont you   tho no i have not left off praying neither for if my master does but send me of an errand i pray as i go along the streets and sometimes i get up into the hayloft over the stable or any where that i can be private but this is so seldom and it grieves me so that when i come to pray i can do nothing but cry i cannot speak a word hardly   will i do not understand these things sure i am a strange creature why it never troubles me i dont know what it is to pray to god i never knew there was any harm in not doing it i wish i could learn i would say my prayers too   the boy begins to be touched with the discourse tho you have a good master to teach you i have a master will do nothing but teach me to forget all that my good father and mother have been teaching me these fifteen years   will why if what you learnt is good what need you forget it   tho why i will tell you will when i was at home and had all the encouragement in the world by the example and instruction of my father and the exhortation of my mother telling me my duty and strictly charging me never to lie down or rise without praying to god in the evening for protection in the morning for direction yet i found a wicked inclination within me often prompting me to omit my duty and now when i want these helps of example and instruction and instead of them have had so many discouragements and find it so difficult to get a retired place for it i find that wicked inclination to omit my duty increases and sometimes i am for persuading my self i have a sufficient excuse to leave it quite off and i am afraid some time or other i shall do so and so grow an atheist and then i shall live without god like a heathen just as you do will   will indeed tom i have lived like a heathen all my days i begin to see it now but what must i do how can i help it now   tho do will you must leave it off and learn to live a better life   will but brother tom how must i do that i am a poor ignorant wretch i know nothing at all i have never been taught any thing in my life if to live as i do is to be a heathen my father is a heathen and my mother is a heathen and my brothers and sisters are all heathens   tho you are in a sad condition will as i said before and i think i am in a worse   will how can that be tom   tho why you have been taught nothing and i am in a fair way to lose all i have been taught i think my condition is worse than yours   will no no you know what to do and what you ought to do you have been well educated tom i have no body to teach me any thing tell me dear brother what i must do teach me what is my first duty i begin to see something very desirable in religion that i never valued before   the first motions in an uncultivated mind generally are to see a beauty in the ways of god and to have a desire to imitate them tho why will i am but a boy as well as you and cannot teach you much but i can tell you what my father used to tell me and what he taught me to do   will do tell me that then for i long to hear   tho why he used to tell me that god made me and that being born in sin and liable to eternal death for sin jesus christ redeemed me   will all that i have heard too though i do not understand a word of it   tho then he told me i must every day pray to god to bless me to preserve me and to pardon my sins for jesus christs sake that i must give thanks to him for my life and my preservation in health and for all things that i receive that i must pray to him for my daily bread and to give me wisdom and direction in all i go about   will how can i do this   tho i remember i asked my father that very question and he answered me thus do you not come to me child when you want clothes and ask me for them and to your mother when you are hungry and ask for victuals and do you not do this without teaching   will and what did you say   tom what could i say i kneeled down every night and morning and said over the lords prayer then i got a good prayer out of a book and said that and sometimes a word or two would come into my thoughts that i would say of my own head as i thought of such things as were proper   will i shall never learn why i can hardly say over the lords prayer without book   tho i will tell you will if i thought you were in earnest i would do my endeavor to teach you but you that have led such a wicked life and cry out of your master and mistress so much about praying i dont think you mean any thing but to jest with me   will no but i do not jest now you say it is so wicked a thing and i am in such a dangerous condition that you looked for the ground to open and swallow me up why you cannot think i would be willing to have the devil take me away what ever i may say sometimes but i am a poor ignorant boy how shall i know what to do   tho truly will and i also am but ignorant as i said before and unfit to teach you i am but a boy you know but this i know and have been taught that god has made me do you believe that will   will yes sure   tho well if god made you then he can destroy you   will that is plain   tho then sure it is your interest to serve god as well in thankfulness to him because he made you as that he may not be provoked to destroy you   will but what is this serving god i thought it was nothing but going to church a sundays   tho to be sure worshipping god at church is good and our duty but we must worship god other ways than at church   will what by saying our prayers   tho nay that is not all neither we must fear god and keep his commandments   will how shall i do all that you know that i know nothing of it   tom why therefore will your first thing as the first thing my father told me i was to do was to pray to god to teach me to know him and to fear him and to keep his commandments   will how do i know what his commandments are i can say the ten commandments but i dont understand what they mean   tho why my father next directed me to read the bible which is the word of god and is given for our instruction that we may know his will   will and will that teach me to know what to do   tho reading the scripture daily and praying to god daily to open our understanding to know the will of god written in his word certainly this must be the way will   will i cannot pray i never prayed in all my life i tell you   tho you ought to tremble at the thought of that will   will i begin to be afraid indeed it may be god will not hear me now if i should pray   tho yes there is a scripture for that to encourage you let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy isaiah        will is that in the bible   tho yes and a great many more encouraging things you must read the scripture diligently have you never a bible   will no not i nor never had in my life   tho i am not capable to direct you will but i will tell you there are two things which i would have you do pray to god to forgive your sins and to teach you his will and read the bible diligently i will give you a bible will   will indeed brother tom if you will give me a bible i will read it over and over you say that will teach me i will read it and thank you for it heartily for i never had a bible to read in yet   tho but remember will i said you must pray to god to teach you when you read to open your understanding that you may understand the scriptures and to teach you that you may know your duty and then pray to god to guide you in the doing his will and your duty according to the scripture which is his own word   will what will my praying to god signify will god do this for me if i pray to him and how can i pray i dont know what praying is not i what must i say   tho it seems you do not know what prayer is sure if you remember the beginning of our discourse and how you complained you were tormented with prayers at home you will not say you do not know what it is   will dont tell me of that now dear tom i begin to be of another mind already i wish i knew how to pray for my self   tho the spirit of god teaches us to pray and helps our infirmities do you know the story of the poor publican   will no not i what was he   tho just such another as thou art will a poor wicked profane wretch that had lived all his days in wickedness and perhaps without prayer too   will and what then what became of him did he go to hell   tho why he saw the pharisees and all the great professors of religion go up to the temple to pray and being sensible of his condition he thought once to go up along with them but when he considered what a wicked creature he had been he was afraid he durst not only not go but not look toward the temple nor cast his eyes up to heaven   will that is my case indeed exactly pray what became of him   tho why he stood at a distance smote his breast astonished and amazed at his own case and with a deep sigh broke out thus lord be merciful to me a sinner luke         will well and was he heard you say he durst not go up to the temple to pray   tho heard yes one groan one sigh one look nay a heart not daring to look sending out but one sentence yet from a broken sincere repenting heart is heard in heaven beyond the long and loud pretenses and devotions of the self opiniond hypocrite the scripture says expressly this man went away justified rather than the other luke         will and do you think if i knew how to pray god would hear me and give all that teaching and knowledge you speak of to me   tho yes will i do more than think so i am sure of it   will what mean you by that   tho i have gods own word for it will and that word is the foundation and comfort of all the prayer and of all the praying christians in the world   will how is this explain your self for you speak strangely positive   tho the scripture says he will and that is my assurance and may be yours for it is his own word john       whatever we ask of the father in the name of jesus christ he will do it for us   will but i have been a wicked boy all my days that never thought of any thing of god or religion in my life as you know very well by what i have told you nor ever was taught any thing about it will god hear such a one as i if i ever pray to him   tho the same scripture says he will brother and we have no reason to doubt it for the scriptures are the word of god and as i told you the scripture says isaiah      let the wicked forsake his way and turn unto the lord and he will have mercy and the poor publican went away justified that sent up but one sigh   will ay that may be to such as sin now and then a little but i have done nothing else all my days   tho but he says in the same text that he will abundantly pardon   will but that may not reach me   tho but the scripture is full of promises and calls to as bad as you to come to him i could show you some if i had the bible here you cannot have been so wicked but you are included in them   will tell me one of them i entreat you i see you have a deal of it without book dear tom tell me one of them   tho this is one him that comes unto me i will in no wise cast out here is no exception this him is all one as whosoever   will whosoever that is a large word is there no exception   tho none at all whosoever that includes how bad soever   will what and how long soever too   tho ay and how long soever whosoever turns unto god how bad soever they are or how long soever they have been so bad yet he will in no wise or by no means cast them out   will my heart revives at that word for i have been a sad wretch you know brother i have never so much as thought of my soul or of god of his making me or his power to destroy me i have never prayed unto him or called upon him unless in wicked swearing and cursing by his name will god pardon me brother are you sure of it   tho i cannot be sure he will pardon you or my self either but i am sure it is your duty to pray for pardon and to repent of your sins and there is another scripture which says if we repent and forsake we shall find mercy   will repent what is that tom   tho repentance is a hearty sorrow for your sins already past and solemn serious resolutions to commit no more and this sorrow must proceed not only from a fear of eternal punishment but from a hatred of sin for its own evil nature and as it is offensive to the holiness of god   will i cannot understand this at all shall i learn it in my bible brother how must i learn to repent   tho you must pray to god to give you repentance too for repentance is the gift of god   will i will pray to god though i do not know how or what to say i am amazed at my self when i see what a wicked creature i have been indeed brother tom i dont wonder that you looked so earnestly at me and expected i should drop down dead or be swallowed up alive i am afraid i shall be so still   conviction of sin seizes the boy tho i am glad what i have said has made you sensible of it   will i begin to love you dear brother better than ever i did i shall be the better for you as long as i live   tho i wish you had some better instructor than i   will ay brother if i had had a religious father and mother as you have had i might have known all this from a child then all the past wickedness of my life had been prevented but you say whosoever brother dont you are you sure the words are so   tho i am very sure brother but to make you easy i will go in and fetch you a bible and show it you presently   the boy goes in while he is gone will breaks out thus by himself will what must i do to know how to pray will god hear such a wretch and what if not then i am undone lost and damned for ever o what a condition am i in but whosoever   the boy weeps but recovering prays with great affection and aloud like the poor publican in the following words lord god that has made me and have said whosoever comes thou will not cst out pardon all my wickedness   tom comes and overhears him tho what was you saying brother did you speak to me   will no no i did not speak to you   tho i heard you say something   will i hardly know what i said but my heart struck me and i cried out   tho to god i hope   will i hardly know yet i feel a secret joy in what i said   observe here conviction was accompanied with a cleaving to the promise of god and the spirit of god moves the poor boys heart to look up to god in hope first pleading the promise and then crying for pardon tho well brother if it was but like the publican it may be heard   will i know not what it was but i am trembling still is this praying brother   tho the more your affection was engaged the more likely it is to be from a true work of god   will have you brought the bible you have staid a long while   tho i have been looking some places for you   will and will you show me them   tho yes i have folded em down and here they are in the first place here is that i named to you john    0 him that comes unto me i will in no wise cast out and here is another place which is equal in its encouragements and expressly tells us that the word him is to be taken for whosoever without any exception of person as i said to you before rev       let him that is a thirsty come and whosoever will let them take of the water of life freely   will you have folded them down you say i will read them when i come home for it is too late for us to stay any longer   the end of the first dialogue notes on the first dialogue though this dialogue and indeed this whole part of the book is more a history than the rest and that the families which it points at if they happen to see it may be able to see themselves in it and to make some use of it to their own advantage if they please yet as even this history will be the same thing as a parable to the ages to come in which it may i hope be as useful now and above all as this work is designed for a general not a particular reproof i am willing to let it lie hid entirely as to persons that it may perhaps look less by that means like a history than really it is  if the persons whom it more really concerns may see themselves reproved they will make not the less profitable use of it for the civility shown them in concealing their names if they do not the author can never want opportunity to expose the folly if he sees cause  but the design of this book is of a nature above a personal satyr the errors in familyconductare the business here not the families themselves and the names and persons are so entirely concealed and the real hstory so couched that it is impossible for any body but the persons themselves to read the people by the characters  the first thing reproved here and worth observing is a good man who had carefully educated and instructed his child and who he might easily see was a sober well inclined youth knowing in good things and desirous of them yet had this religious parent forgotten himself and so far forgotten the good of his child also as to place him out with a master who had either no religion at all or which was all one to the child exercised none of it in his family nor took any care or had any concern for the souls of his servants whatever he had for their bodies  the child laments this very pathetically though in a familiar way to his comrade he is at first weary of the profane way of living and then justly afraid that the interruptions he meets with to his duty should bring him to an indifference about it and to believe the difficulties he found in his way were just excuses for him in omitting it totally at last  note we have natural hindrances enough in the way of our duty from the aversions of a corrupt nature so that at the best we shall be ofren backward in and prompted to the omission of religious performances we have therefore great need to remove all occasional obstructions lest natural inclination should plead those obstructions as a just reason for a total neglect of duty  it was not without a just reason that the poor child entertained a jealousy of himself lest he should grow cold in religious matters from the general discouragement he met with in a family where all religious duties were totally neglected and himself made a jest for attempting to do his duty  this may be a seasonable caution for such parents who have any concern for the souls of their children and have taken any pains with them in their education   not to think their duty discharged to them in the due instructing and educating them in their infancy the inspection of a parent does not end there but they ought   to remember that all that good seed which they had sown may be choked if the child comes into bad hands afterward and their son may be lost by a negligent master as well as a negligent parent   that therefore it is their duty to take care to place their children in religious families or it may be true that they had almost as good never have instructed them at all   it is very strange but too common that religious parents who have taken great care with their children when they were at home wholly neglect this and throw their children away by placing them where the duties of religion are not at all regarded and where the examples of their masters and the families they live in quite raise all the remembrance of former instruction out of the mind of the servant and they grow hardened in that neglect by the authority of their masters  it is remarkable here farther how the duty of servants is entirely neglected even in those families where they do regard religion and where instructing of children is taken care of as if the souls of servants were not under the inspection of the master of a family and were none of his charge as well as the souls of his children  note apprentices taken into our houses ought as far as it respects their souls to be reckoned as children for as we take them from the tuition of their parents if we act not the parent to them as well as the master we may teach them their trade but we breed them up for the devil  it cannot be omitted here to observe what impressions of religion what awe of god what dread of his judgments the good instructions of the father had left on the mind of this youth   in his uneasiness of being placed in an irreligious family of which afterward   his aversion to the discourse of his comrade when he talked profanely   his terrible apprehensions when the other talked blasphemously lest he should fall down dead or the earth should open and swallow him up   note though it is true that in the ordinary course of providence god does not deal so with those that blaspheme and provoke him yet since sometimes god has done so and history as well as scripture is full of dreadful examples of that kind it is not without its uses and therefore very commendable to acquaint young children with such examples and to fill their minds with a due fear of gods judgments in the like cases  here is room also for a useful remark in the complaint the poor child makes that having no retirement for performing his duty by himself when he went about it publicly the other servants mocked and jeered him out of it note   though separate conveniences cannot always be made for servants yet masters should as much as may consist with the circumstances of their families be cautious of taking away all manner of conveniences of retirement from their servants lest they furnish them with excuses for not doing their duty note   jeering and mocking a young man for his inclining to be religious is too often a means to drive such quite from it note   one of the most necessary preservations of youth is that he be fortified against the scandalous banters and insults of his companions and can learn to be jeered and yet not be jeered out of his duty   the other part of this dialogue affords a dreadful instance of a father and family wholly destitute of religion living entirely without god without scripture without so much as a form of religion the effects of this are especially two and both visible in the case here laid before us   perfect ignorance of every thing that looked like religion in the child not so much as the least sense of it or desire to know any thing about it remaining   certain and never failing bitter reproaches of the child against the parent when its eyes come to be opened   note such is the beauty of a religious conscientious life in those that practice it that those who can taste nothing of it themselves yet have a value for it in others the profane boys father told him he loved his master because he was a good man and that if he the boy would take his masters advice he would make him a better man than his father  note the aversions which want of instruction in this youth had bred in him against the religious behavior of his master and against the public exercises of religion in his family were so foolishly grounded that they would bear no weight in his discoursing it even with a child and therefore the religious youth presently objects against what he says and he himself sooner sees the folly of his own discourse and yet the author of this work is just also to the thing it self for that really our ridiculous notions in contempt of religion will admit no better argument to excuse them  aversions to religious duties grow naturally either by disuse of those duties or by the disaster of an ill education even where the poor hardened child may think no harm or design any willful rebellion against god that ignorance being the natural consequence of want of instruction  observe here when the wicked boy being convinced asks his comrade what he must do he goes back to tell him what his own father used to teach him whence note that well instructing our children makes them capable to instruct others as occasion presents and consequently their children when they come to have families of their own  from the beginning of the wicked boys convictions note that sense of danger is the first thing ordinarily that discovers it self in conviction of sin and this leads to enquiring after what we are next to do as the jailor who first came in trembling then asks what must i do  when the boy after his first conviction recollects things by himself while his companion is gone for the bible he is struck with horror at his condition but the spirit of god working graciously in him lays the promise of god as it were full in his way in order to give him hope and at the first appearance of hope he breaks out vehemently in prayer when his comrade returns and innocently inquires about what he said it appears from him that his prayer was a kind of ecstasy moved by a supernatural power in his heart that affected him in a violent manner so that he hardly could give an account of it himself but says wildly he trembled and cried out  there are no doubt such strong impressions of the spirit of god accompanying true convictions and the great regenerating work of grace in the heart as may be inexpressible even by the persons themselves yet far from enthusiastic or affected nor are these impressions to be slighted much less ridiculed perhaps this may be in part signified in regeneration being called a new birth though the main intent of that allusion be to signify the entire change of the state  from the whole of this dialogue may be observed the great duty and advantage of young men spending the hours they have to spare for conversation in religious discourses and enquiring of one another about things relating to heaven their duty here and their way thither this no doubt was enjoined in the same text where the instruction of our children is commanded deuteronomy     thou shall talk of them when thou sit in thine house and when thou walk by the way that is they shall be the general subject of your conversation and communication one with another note the advantages of religious conversation are many the present case is brought to describe them the young untaught uninstructed youth who came out of the hands of his parents to be an apprentice as perfectly naked of knowledge and instruction as he came naked into the world becomes a convert by his keeping company and conversing with a religious well instructed companion and became afterward an excellent promoter of knowledge and piety in the place where he lived  the second dialogue the young lad who was put apprentice to the religious tradesman abovementioned though he had no education from his parents was as you have heard in the past dialogue between him and the youth his comrade brought to a condition quite differentfrom what he had always been brought up in he had a full conviction of the desperate condition he was in by reason of his sinful nature and life he had received some light from the little instruction his young but pious companion was capable to give him and his conscience was thoroughly awakened his little instructor had been providentially made the instrument to lay a foundation of hope in him and to encourage him to pray to god and to read the scriptures and to believe that god would receive him would not reject him for his sinful life or for his sinful nature but would grant him whatsoever he should ask and upon this confidence in his first agony he breaks out as before into a short but vehement prayer being the first he had ever made in his life and which as it was made from a heart deeply touched with the danger of his soul so it left great impressions upon his mind as i have noted and having gotten a bible from his companion he goes away with two happy resolves   to read and   to pray  the alteration this made in the youth could not be long hid in the family where he was placed where his wicked way of living his profane tongue and his contempt of religion had made him not very well received and made his conversation so much their aversion that the master of the house and the mistress too had warned their little children from conversing with him and they had had some discourse together about turning him away finding him of a temper as they thought too refractory to be wrought upon by advice past the benefit of example and who had several times made a jest of and a scoff at their attempts to instruct him  but the boy being changed within as is noted above it could not be that such a work could long conceal it self in his conversation he appeared pensive retired and grave in his deportment was observed to sigh very often and look as if he had been crying as soon as his business was over he was never to be seen but always hid in the dark among the workhouses of which his master had several he was observed to be always ready at the times of family worship and on the lords day when his master examined him about the sermons he had heard they were all surpised at him for the ready account he gave of what the minister had preached his master and mistress who could not but observe this alteration in the boy took the more notice of him in his conversation the week after where they found him diligent at his work more than ever but nothing of the mirth and sport his fellow servants used to have with him they observed he had left off all his ill words and wicked expressions swearing cursing and the like he played none laughed none and hardly was seen to smile several of the servants and workmen that observed it also had been jesting with him and asked him what ailed him but he gave them no answers that were to the purpose so that it was hardly guessed at in the family at least not among his fellows  but his master and mistress who from his behavior as above had entertained some notion of it or being willing to hope the best had pleased themselves with some thoughts of the childs being grown rather serious than melancholy made it their business to observe him more narrowly and seeing him one evening take a candle and go up into a room over their workhouse by himself the mistress silently followed him and placed her self so as she might see him and he perceived nothing of it  as soon as he came up he set down the candle pulled a book out of his pocket and turned over the leaves folding up here and folding down there but not reading long in any one place she observed him to sigh grievously all the while and at last to throw down the book and burst out into a vehement fit of crying sitting down upon the ground wringing his hands and the tears running down his face but not speaking a word  while he was in this agony she discovers herself to have seen him and begins thus  will what is the matter with you child  the boy surpised snatches up the book hastily and puts it in his pocket  his mistress speaks to him again mist will what is the matter will tell me   will nothing   offers to go away mist come will do not be backward to tell me what troubles thee for i have seen all you have been doing what books that you had there   will no book of any harm   mist child i do not think it is a book of any harm i believe it is a good book is it not the bible will come tell me   will yes it is   mist let me see it will   will you may believe me it is the bible i hope you will not be angry   mist angry child i am glad to see you looking in the bible i am not angry i hope you are minding good things   so his mistress sits down by him will oh it is too late now   here he falls a crying again and cannot speak for a good while mist too late will do not talk so   will yes it is too late too late   and cries vehemently mist child if it be so thy too late is much sooner than my early was if it be too late for thee what will become of any of us   the mistress weeps too will that is all one to me it is too late for me   mist let me see thy bible child where have thou been reading that has put thee into this condition   will o every where every where   mist show me the book will let me see it   he shows her the book and abundance of leaves turned down but most of them at those places which had discouraged the child mist what are all these leaves turned down for and who directed you to these terrible texts of scripture child you have found all the dreadful places where god threatens hardened sinners with his displeasure but not one of those places which gave comfort to a returning penitent   she turns over to the leaves the child had folded down which were such as these romans       after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up against thy self wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgments of god who will render to every man according to his deeds isaiah     make the heart of this people fat and their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and convert and be healed and again the same repeated mark      rev      and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone rev       he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he that is filthy let him be filthy still behold i come quickly and my reward is with me   these       in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god etc who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord psalm      the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget god psalm  0    consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver matthew       depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels heb       for our god is a consuming fire isa       who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting burnings these and abundance more such as these the poor boy had folded down the reading of which had terrified him to such a degree as above  the mistress having looked them over turns to the boy mist child what are all these scriptures to thee   will all to me all to me he told me all that was said in the book was said to me   mist he told thee will prithee who told thee   will he that gave me the book my brother tom over the way he told me so and he is a very good young man and would not speak wrong i am sure it is all said to me   cries again mist well will he is a very good young man i am glad you have been talking with him and he meant well no doubt but he is but a young lad a boy a child like thy self and you may be instructed farther about it do not be cast down was this it you cried about   will yes yes this was it was not this enough   mist well but you need not be so discouraged will let me show you some other texts   will what not to be lost for ever and go to hell not be discouraged   mist but are you willing to be better instructed child   will what can instruct me is not this the word of god and is it not plain am not i such a wicked one as is described here and is not all that is said here true   mist but child you must take that part of the scripture which is a ground of hope and set it against these terrible places this is only an artifice of the devil to terrify you   will what would he terrify me for   mist that you might despair of the mercy of god and not hope in jesus christ   will what can i hope for when these plain things are said shall belong to such as i am   mist no child i hope they are not threatened to such as thee they are all to be understood of those that are impenitent in their sins and go on hardened without repentance to the last i hope you will not be found among them are you not sorry for your sins   will what does that signify now if i am   mist a great deal even so much that it takes away the edge of all those dreadful scriptures that have frighted thee so much and if that sorrow for thy sins be true and sincere the scripture is full of encouragement for thee to hope   will ay so he said but he never told me a word of all those places i have found and i cannot find the promises he told me of i cannot find one of them   mist that is for want of some body to assist thee and open and explain the scriptures to thee poor child thou have had but little teaching   will little i never had any teaching at all i never had a bible in my life never knew what it was till now and i think it had been well i had not seen it now   mist no no will do not say so it is the best thing ever was given thee in the world and i hope you shall thank god as long as you live that you meet with that honest young man that gave it you he is a godly sober young man and has shown thee what it is to be well educated he came of good parents and their instruction is seen in his very countenance every body loves him he is so sober so religious and talks so well of good things and it appears i find in his talk to thee though being but a youth he might not be so able to prepare thee for the right understanding of the scriptures when you were to read in as others may   will why he told me it was the word of god and that all that was written here was true and that it was all spoken to me and i ought to understand it so and bid me read it   mist well and you have read some of it but not all   will yes i have read all the new testament over and over for i sat up three nights last week and read all night long for i promised him i would read it   mist well and have you not found encouraging places as well as those that terrified you in this manner   will no none at all   mist how is that possible if you have read it all over   will i am sure i have read it all over three times from the first of matthew to the last of the revelations   mist then your fears have so prevailed over your hope that your eyes have been shut to your comfort and open only to your discouragement this is all from the devil will you must pray against it   will so tom said but i cannot tell how to pray i never prayed in my life but once   mist once child when was that   will that night he talked to me   mist what did you pray for then and how   will i know not how but i trembled and cried out to god to pardon my sins   mist poor child what moved thee to it then   will i felt some strange motion in my heart which i cannot describe that made my tongue speak i almost know not what for i thought it a dreadful thing to speak to god and when i cried out lord pardon my sins it set me a weeping and a trembling   mist well that was a blessed beginning why did you not go on child you should have prayed again   will my heart did but i could speak no words   mist alas child that is the prayer god delights in so may i pray all my days though i was never to speak again   will but brother tom told me i must speak too   mist yes child you may speak and it is proper for your own sake that you speak words both to express your meaning and move your affections but unless your heart joins it is not prayer god hears no words that the heart joins not in but he hears many a sigh from the heart which cannot be expressed in words as is plain from that text romans      the spirit also helps our infirmities for we know not what to pray for as we ought but the spirit it self makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered i hope it was the spirit helped thy heart to pray when thou could utter no words child therefore do not be discouraged   will i know nothing what it was or what the spirit means unless that i have served the evil spirit all my days and now i must have my portion with the devil and his angels this book says so look here else   shows her the place matthew       mist child you must not make conclusions against your self any more than for your self from the word of god till you are taught to understand it aright   will why do i not understand this place right   mist no you do not   will how shall i understand it then   mist you must take the scriptures as they explain themselves and you are bid to search the scripture that is to see how one place is expounded by another you should always pray to god to open your understanding that you may understand the scripture and the want of this makes even those very parts of the scripture which should be our comfort be our terror   will indeed the young man told me so but i did not do it   mist what did he bid you do   will when he gave me the book i thanked him and promised him to read it but he said that was not all i must pray to god to teach me to understand his word and to show me my duty and to guide my heart to do it but i did not know that i should always do this when i read the bible   mist no doubt but you may pray very seasonably for that at all times and he was a good child that taught thee to do so but it must needs be more especially seasonable to pray so when you are going to read the bible that you may be instructed to reap comfort from gods word and not terror only as you have done   will what comfort can i get from the scripture when it speaks so dreadfully of my very case   mist why there lies your mistake i say it is not your case and therefore you may reap comfort from the scripture come child let us see and examine strictly what your real case is it may be we may find reason even from this very book to make you hope that your case is not included or spoken to in any of these texts and if it should appear so would you not be very glad   will yes i should be glad but i believe that is impossible   mist no no child it is not impossible the first part of your case is this that you have been a great sinner   will as ever was born in the world   mist well suppose so though that is not true neither for poor child you have not sinned against light and against knowledge and against conscience for thou wast never taught to know god or his ways or instructed in thy duty i am a worse sinner than thou a great deal but suppose all you say suppose you are a great sinner yet you say you are sorry and if you thought god would forgive you would it not rejoice your heart   will oh if that were possible   mist and are you as willing to go on wickedly as you were before   will no i abhor and abominate it   he weeps here again mist and would you serve and obey and please god if he will forgive you   will ay with all my heart nay whether he would forgive me or no i would never be wicked again if i could help it it is the abominablest life i hate my self for it   mist but if you were assured god would pardon you what would you do   will o if that were possible   mist come child look then into this blessed book again you are a sinner but you are not an impenitent sinner you say you abhor and abominate your sins and hate your self for them you say you would not go on in wickedness nay though god should not forgive what is past you say you would serve and please and obey god with all your heart if all this be true then i tell thee child not one of these terrible scriptures which have so discouraged thee and so frighted thee are spoken to thee or meant of thee no not one of them   will why my brother tom said all that was written in this book was said to me   mist that is child if thou art so and so as these scriptures describe and if not then they are spoken to give thee hope otherwise the scriture would contradict it self and not be true which is blasphemous to imagine   will i do not understand how you mean   mist why child look here look upon the very texts you have folded down some of them explain themselves to be just as i say romans   v     after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up wrath etc now it is plain thou art not hardened and impenitent but god has given thee a penitent repenting heart i hope it is a sincere one therefore by the words themselves thou art not one of them that treasure up wrath against the day of wrath so for that scripture isaiah     thine eyes are not shut nor thy ears heavy nor thy heart fat that is rebellious and contemning god for that text is plainly spoken of such whom god judicially hardens and of no other in like manner all the other texts every one of them are expressions signifying the wrath and vengeance of god against such as die in their sins or continue perverse hardened and impenitent   will how shall i be sure that is so   mist by comparing those scriptures child with such other texts as explain their meaning as are given to encourage our returning to god and contain his promises of pardon to those who repent   will where are they i have read the whole book and cannot find them   mist look here child   john   v   if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness here it is plain though you are a great sinner yet if you confess he will forgive you and you may observe he does not say he is gracious and merciful to forgive but just and faithful implying that having before in his grace and mercy passed to us his promise of forgiveness it becomes humbly speaking a kind of demand and as he is just and faithful therefore he must and will nay he cannot fail to make good those promises to us   will but where are those promises then i can find none of them in all the bible   mist o the whole scripture is full of them prove       he that covers his sins shall not prosper but whosoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy isaiah      let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and turn unto the lord and he will have mercy and to our god for he will abundantly pardon   will that he told me of but i cannot find it   mist here it is child in the prophecy of isaiah   will is that the word of god too   mist yes and that prophet is counted the most excellent of all the prophets for these things and is therefore called the evangelical prophet   will but there are more in other places are there not   mist yes child especially in those places that speak of christ in whom all are to be saved   will let me hear them for i do not understand this being redeemed by christs death at all though tom said something of that to me   mist you understand that you have been a wicked boy a great sinner and was born in sin your father was a sinner before you   will yes i understand that too well   mist well jesus christ who is the son of god came into the world to save such as you nay and worse than you and he died to bring this to pass this you must believe   will does the scripture say this   mist yes look here romans     for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly   pet      for christ also has once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god acts      him has god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance and remission   timothy      this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance that jesus christ came into the world to save sinners matthew      i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance are not these things plain child   will but i am afraid   mist of what child   will that it is not for me i am not one of them else why was i not taught to know this before   mist here is a text for that too child mark      be not afraid only believe   will what must i believe and what if i do believe   mist the scripture is plain that we shall be saved by faith in him notwithstanding all the terrible scriptures you have found out matt      his name is jesus for he shall save his people from their sins acts       by him all that believe are justified romans  0    these things are written that ye might believe that jesus christ is the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name john     he that hears my word and believes on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not enter into condemnation romans    there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus fold all these texts down child and remember to read them over when thou art tempted to be doubting of gods mercy in christ   will but will christ receive me now   mist yes yes he has made a gracious promise to thee himself for that john     him that comes to me i will in no wise cast out   the boy starts at those words mist what do start at child   will that is the blessed place that my dear teacher told me of and that worked all and now i cannot find it   mist worked all what child   will that was the text that made my heart melt and tremble and made me pray to god and i have read over the whole book and cannot find it though i made him turn down a leaf at it i am sure it is not in the book   mist not in the book god forbid why here it is child look at it read it and god give thee comfort of it   the boy reads and tears fall from his eyes for joy as before for sorrow will ay here it is here it is i will come to him i will pray to him   he kisses the book with great affection and receives comfort from it the end of the second dialogue notes on the second dialogue the impressions of the serious discourse mentioned in the first dialogue that this young man had with his comrade were so great that they could not be concealed  note a change wrought in the heart will infallibly show it self in the conversation  the master and mistress being good people themselves received impressions of the alteration in the boy suitable to the nature of the thing but the rest of the servants dreamt nothing of it  note the symptoms of conversion are easily discovered by those who know the working of the spirit of god while they are perfectly invisible to others  by the agony the boy was in at the reading the comminations of the scripture against sin without the promisory part may be observed  that mere convictions of sin drive to despair but neither direct to nor enquire after a remedy  that comforting scriptures generally want explaining terrifying scriptures explain themselves  here may be worth observing   the benefit of religious conversation even among young children and the great duty of making our society instructing to one another   the advantage of placing children in religious families   if this poor child had not fallen in such a family as this the temptation he was under to despair might in all probability have prevailed over him and either have led him to give over his enquiry after religious matters or if god had not restrained him have driven him to extremities such as distraction and perhaps selfdestruction as is often the consequence too in like cases for a wounded spirit who can bear  observe the poor childs fear of its being too late for him to find mercy or be accepted  if it might be too late for him what have they to fear who run on to gray hairs in an impenitent state well might his mistress observe that his too late was sooner than her early and so it is with many  from the good womans applying the scriptures to him for comfort observe how the scriptures are to be read   with serious seeking god for the assistance of his spirit to open our understandings that we may understand the scriptures for without his teaching all our reading will be in vain   with a due comparing one text with another that the scriptures being their own just expositor may reconcile the truths of god as they ought to be understood   for want of this we rob our selves of the comfort of the scriptures pass over those things prepared to heal and restore the soul and fill our hearts with distracting doubts about our own state which are always harder to be resolved and removed by how much they seem confirmed by the mistaken authority of the scripture   observe the good woman finding the boy had received comfort from that blesied promise of our lord and that he was affectionately expressing his resolution to cast himself at the foot of christ crying out i will come to him and in a kind of a rapture kissing the words which she had showed him she wisely withdrew believing it was a happy juncture in which the child ought to be left alone that he might give himself full vent with fervency and earnestness to call upon god and though this causes the dialogue to break off sooner and more abruptly than it might have done yet it is conceived as much is here set down as may answer the design of it viz the instruction of others  ending these notes with this observation for the readers information that as far as this account is really historical and points at any particular family this boy or young man came to be eminent for piety and a religious life in the place where he lived and being settled in that country was a very useful instrument in the propagating christian knowledge and supporting the interest of true religion in all the country round him and perhaps is living still  the third dialogue the young lad who had been so happily instrumental in the conviction and conversion of his comrade had thereby rendered himself so agreeable to the good people who as i said before was master and mistress of the other lad that they could not but be very willing to converse a little with him themselves and to that end caused their apprentice who called him brother to bring him to their house where in time he became very intimate and they were much pleased and diverted with his pretty discourses which were always about religion and serious things  among the rest of his discourse he never forgot to bemoan himself for his being placed in a family of no religious orders without the worship of god in it and where he had neither public opportunity to serve god or private retirement for the discharge of his duty  the good people encouraged him to bear it and seriously advised him not to let the sense of his own duty to wear off or allow himself in the omission of private prayer to god whatever obstructions he met with for want of retirement and opportunity and invited him to come over to their house as often as he could at their hours of family worship and join with them  this he not only gladly accepted but constantly attended and did it so avowedly not regarding how it might interfere with his masters hours and his own conveniences that his master took offense at his being so often out of the way and not knowing the least of what occasioned his absence complained to his father of it as if it had been some wicked course he had followed telling him that his son did not behave himself orderly that he was out of his business unseasonably that he must have some bad haunts for that he generally went out every morning very early being then winter long before day and in the evenings was absent often at supper that on the lords day evening he was never to be found and the like and therefore desired his father to take some care about him for that if he went on he would be ruined he farther acquainted his father that the boy had appeared very melancholy and discontented that he had asked him often if any thing ailed him or that he was not well and he always answered yes that he had asked him if he did not like his business and still he answered yes very well so that he knew not what ailed him and desired his father to talk with him for if he carried it thus he could not bear it but must send him home again  the father who knew his son to be a sober religious child and partly knew the reason of his discontent was not at all surpised at that part of his masters complaint which related to his appearing melancholy and dissatisfied but the other part of his discourse alarmed him a little about being out of the house at unseasonable hours and giving no account of himself and therefore he readily promised to talk with his son and examine him about it that his conduct might be rectified  accordingly he finds an opportunity to talk with the lad and lets him know all his master had laid to his charge charging him to tell him the truth of the whole matter the boy not at all surpised told his father the whole case very honestly how that his master had no such thing as family worship in his house but that they lived all like heathens there pursuing the world as if it was their heaven without the least regard of their duty to god or any thing that was religious and you sir says the boy to his father having always instructed me in other things and taught me to live after another manner it was very uneasy to me as i have formerly hinted to you but i have of late made my self a little easy by getting an acquaintance in mr  s family an honest clothier who lives over against our house who are very good people and who constantly go to prayers every morning at six a clock and every evening about eight or nine and i get up every morning to go over there to prayers with their family and every lords day i go thither in the evening where the good man reads to his family and examins his children and servants and then prays with them while at our house all the evening is spent in feasting and visiting or idle discourse not at all to the business of the day and this is the whole case  when the lad had ended his discourse and the father was assured of the truth of it he took his son in his arms and kissed and embraced him very affectionately and said  the blessing of god and thy father be upon thee my dear that has made so good a use of so unhappy an omission of mine it was my sin my dear and an inexcusable error in me to put thee out in a family where the name of god is not called upon and the worship of god not regarded by which i run the venture of thy souls good and of having all the pains i had taken in teaching and instructing thee in the ways of god and in the knowledge of religion lost and abused and had it been so thy ruin had been at my door having regarded the trade and the prospect of worldly advantage only in placing thee out not the good of thy soul but since god has given thee grace to prevent the evil which might through my neglect have befallen thee the praise be to his mercy i am fully satisfied in what you have done and if your master speaks of it to you as i suppose he will i would have you tell him the whole truth as you now do to me and if he dislikes you for it offer to go back to your father and if he consents i shall as gladly take you from him as i received you from god when you was born  the child encouraged by his father thus to deal plainly with his master and being a lad very ready of speech though modest withal in his behavior resolves the first occasion his master should give him to do it effectually which his master not failing to do the same evening produced the following discourse between them  the youth it seems had been over at the good peoples house as usual during their family worship and coming in about nine a clock at night his master begins with him thus  master thomas where are you   tho here sir   ma have you been abroad to night   tho a little sir   ma how long have you been out   tho not above half an hour sir at most   ma where have you been   tho i have been no farther than at mr  s over the way   ma well but thomas i must talk with you a little i have observed it and others have observed it here in the house that your conduct is altered very much from what it used to be and you seem dull and melancholy i must know what is the matter with you if you do not like your business tell me honestly thomas though you are bound i will not keep you against your will i have a respect for you and for your father and i will not force your inclination if you are willing to go thomas you shall and therefore i would have you speak plainly what is it you dislike the trade for   tho no sir i dont dislike the trade at all but and you please to let me go i shall be very    here his master interrupts him ma well thomas but i am willing to know what the reason is too what do you dislike do you dislike your master   tho no sir not in the least i assure you i have no reason for it   ma what then has any body in the house ill used you   tho no indeed sir   ma what then   tho nothing but if you think fit to let me    ma no thomas never without a reason for it that would be to have some other reasons given afterward for it which are not true   tho if you think so sir i am very willing to stay and do my business   ma well thomas but whether you go or stay i must know the cause of your discontent   tho i will be better contented sir than i have been if i can rather than displease you   ma no thomas that will not satisfy me neither for i have some discontents as well as you thomas and if you stay with me you must remove my discontents as well as your own   tho i shall be very willing to remove any discontents you have sir if i can i hope i do not neglect your business sir   ma i do not say my business is neglected but you take a liberty to go out and stay out so very often as makes me uneasy i must be a little satisfied thomas about that   tho sir you were pleased to tell us when i was first bound that if we were in the warehouse at such and such times when your business required you cared not whither we went at other times and i never have failed your business sir nor your hours   ma but you are out at unseasonable hours thomas and that is not of good reputation to your self   tho i thought sir you did not regard that when you left us so entirely to our selves if it is offensive to you i will refrain it though i should be very sorry to be restrained   ma but i must know the occasion of it as well as of your apparent dissatisfaction also thomas sure you may be free with me come let me know the truth   tho you will perhaps be displeased with me sir if i tell you the truth or think i do not   ma if that truth be justifiable why should i be displeased if not why should i not be displeased   tho there may be reasons for your displeasure though the thing be justifiable   ma let the thing then appear to be justifiable first and if i am unreasonable we shall talk of that afterward if you can justify the thing it self why should you be backward to let me know it   tho sir as you are my master and i am your servant i was bound to give you an account of my time but the liberty you gave all your servants to go where they pleased provided they were at home at such and such times has sufficiently as i conceived justified my being abroad even without giving an account   ma but i did not take from my self the liberty of enquiring whither you went or of altering that license i had given if i saw it abused and since you have taken the liberty and refuse to give me a reasonable account of it i now recall it and expect you to be found always at home unless i give you leave   tho as i took only the liberty you gave sir i shall exactly obey you in the restraint however hard i may think it   ma but there are some other reasons why i ought to insist upon knowing where you have been and how you have spent your time at the hours you have been missing and i think it concerns your reputation to have me satisfied   tho whether it concerns my character or no sir if you command it i think it my duty to obey you i avoided it only that you might not be displeased with me   ma since you choose to obey it as my command rather than comply with it as my request you must be gratified then by telling you i do demand an account of it   tho sir all the time i have spent out of your house or out of your business except only the times i have asked you leave to see my father has been over the way at mr  s the clothier   ma what is it there you have been gone in the morning before day   tho yes sir   ma what can the meaning of that be sure you have some earnest business there and i suppose it must be something he or his wife was not to know that required you to be there with his servants every day before their master and mistress was up   tho i have told you nothing sir but the truth   ma well i shall enquire nothing of your business i know my neighbor  s is a good man and it is his business to look after his servants i shall give him notice to do so in the mean time i shall acquaint your father of your practice and let him enquire after it it is no business of mine i dont trouble my self with what courses you take but while you are with me i expect you attend your business   tho i must obey you sir though i think it hard if you will not dismiss me your business it must be as it pleases god   the master goes out and leaves him the boys father being impatient to know what would pass in the conference was come to the house though late the master finds him waiting for him and begins warmly ma how do you sir i doubt i have no very good news to tell you   fa about what sir   ma about your son he and i have had a little brush this evening   fa i am sorry for that i hope he does not misbehave himself or neglect his business   ma i cannot say much for that but as i told you formerly he has gotten some ill haunts among the neighbors servants and he is out with them every night and morning nay in the morning before day and every sabbath day after sermon i see nothing of him at least for that night and i can get nothing out of him but if i talk a little to him he is for going away and coming back to you again   fa what can this business be before day   ma nay i have nothing to do with that take him to task about it your self it is your business he is your son he is none of mine you said you would talk with him before   fa but sir though he be my son yet he is your servant though i did talk a little with him yet i said the less because i cannot be of your opinion that you have nothing to do with it is he not entirely under your government   ma ay as to business i have the government of him indeed and i am to teach him his trade and to see that he does my business and so i will while he stays with me what can i do farther   fa but sir as i put him apprentice to you i committed him to your government entirely soul and body i hope you have some little concern for your servants besides just their doing your business   ma why what can i do more than restrain them if i see them take bad courses and i have done so to yours i have forbid him going there any more   fa it is not for me to teach you sir what to do but if you will bear with me    ma ay very freely very freely you know i have respect enough for you to hear any thing may and for your son too i would do any thing i can i should be very sorry to have the boy ruined he is a promising young man enough   fa why as to that sir in particular i will speak afterward but i am first upon the general you seem to go upon this point that you think your self not obliged to take any farther concern upon you about your servants than just to restrain them if you see them take ill courses or to acquaint their friends with it and that your main care is to see that your business is done if i take you right this is what you said   ma it is so why what can i do more   fa a great deal sir and i think a great deal more is your duty as a master   ma what more can be expected of me   fa really sir if you will pardon me i think you have the whole duty and authority of a parent devolved upon you for the time and as you make your apprentices a part of your family all the duty you owe the rest of your family you owe to them both as to their souls and bodies except such as relate to estate which is peculiar to children i need not tell you your duty but i will tell you what i understood by putting my child into your hands if you please   ma well what is that   fa why i understood that i put him entirely under your government in the first place and under your care in the second that this government respected first the authority of your command which was to be a perfect supersedeas to mine even so much that if i had commanded him one thing and you another that interferd with it his obeying you was not to be counted a disobeying me for example if i commanded him to meet me at any place or time were the occasion ever so great if you commanded him to stay at home he ought to neglect my command and obey yours which contradicted it his time being yours and not mine and this i always told him and therefore charged him never to come to me without asking you leave   ma this is all very just and i believe he has always done so   fa then sir secondly as i put him entirely under your government suspending my own authority over him as a father it becomes a necessary consequence of it that i entirely committed him to your care both soul and body how could this be otherwise since as i reserved no power to command him so i had of course removed him from my inspection   ma well and do i not discharge this duty by acquainting you of his ill courses   fa no not at all sir for i may indeed take upon me to caution and advise him and show my dislike of his conduct but the power and authority of warning him instructing him reproving him restraining him and if need be of correcting him is all yours   ma those things are out of doors long ago prithee do you think i will trouble my self with my apprentices at that rate no no not i i never struck a servant in my life and if i should who do you think would stay with me apprentices now a days are not like what they were when you and i were apprentices now we get a hundred pound or two or three hundred pound a piece with them they are too high for reproof and correction   fa i know not what custom may have done sir to alter the practices of masters and their apprentices but i am sure the rule is not altered the duty of a master to servants and of servants to their masters is still the same   ma we dont trouble our heads with those things now   fa i am sorry for it you know best how then you can answer to god for the souls committed to your charge do you think every religious parent when he puts his child apprentice to you does not reckon that he commits his soul to your care as well as his body   ma i do not say but in the nature of the thing it should be so but as i told you we do not understand it so nowadays   fa i assure you i understood it so when i put my son apprentice to you and i hope you will understand it so too or else you will neither act like a friend or like a christian   ma why do i not act like both now in giving you an account of this piece of your sons behavior that you may enquire into it   fa i allow your giving me an account of it and thereby an opportunity to join my enquiry and assistance with you to reform any thing amiss is friendly but we are upon another point now which is this that you think by this you discharge your part that the duty lies upon me now and you have no more to do and this i can by no means allow   ma why what would you make of me must i be a father and master too   fa no question of it he is under your family care as to his body he is your servant but as to his soul i think he is as much your son as any child you have and i cannot acquit you of the obligation and duty of a parent to your servants do you discharge your conscience of it how you please   ma why what would you have me catechize and instruct my apprentices as if they were my children then i must turn schoolmaster i hope you have done that already and i think it ought to be supposed all parents have done that before they put their children apprentices they do not put them apprentices to learn religion but to learn their trades   fa it is true they do not put their children apprentices to learn religion but neither do they put them apprentices to lose their religion and to have all the pains their parents have taken with them sunk again there is a kind of instruction subsequent to catechisms and examinations there are kinds of instructions suited to the age and circumstances and such an instructor every master of a family ought to be to his servants as well as to his children   ma i do not understand what instruction you mean   fa why suppose your own children were grown up past saying their catechize would you think your duty of instructing them ceased is there nothing for a parent to say to his children after he has done with questions and answers   ma that may be as he sees the occasion if they take ill courses   fa why is there no previous advice to be given no cautions to avoid company no exhortations to preserve virtue and to behave soberly and modestly no pressing them to their duty to god and to avoid those sins that will ruin their souls is not this a duty upon us all to our children   ma yes but would you have me do this to apprentices too   fa most certainly especially when you take apprentices that you know were religiously educated and on whom such things are likely to make due impressions and i must own if you do not i think you do not discharge the duty of a master for a master is a parent though he is not a father   ma you have no scripture for this in the whole bible   fa suppose that were true the nature of the thing is so plain that there needed no particular scripture to command it in express terms and yet you will find scripture enough for it too in the examples of good men particularly in joshua who resolved to serve the lord he and his house and how could that be if he did not instruct or command his servants to do so david says a liar shall not dwell with him what is more plain than that he resolved to correct the irreligious behavior of his whole household as well servants as children and to turn away those who were incorrigible but the fourth commandment puts it cut of question and is express in the case of the keeping the sabbath mark the words in it thou shall do no manner of work thou there is the masters duty for himself the next part is his duty in seeing that his family shall perform it as well as himself nor thy son nor thy daughter there is his duty as a father nor thy man servant nor thy maid servant there is his hired servants nor the stranger in  is within thy gates there are his apprentices and what is the meaning of this word nor but this thou shall do no manner of work nor permit or suffer thy son or thy daughter or thy servants to do any  this commandment expressly declares that the servants are subjected to the masters command in matters relating to their duty to god and that masters are obliged to see that their servants perform it   ma indeed you have said something in this that is new to my thoughts and seems to give an authority to what you say i confess i never considered that part of it before but what can i do if i should go about this work with my servants they would laugh at me it would make me ridiculous   fa if you are to be laughed out of your duty by your servants i am sorry for it you are very ill qualified then to be a master i hope and am persuaded my son would not be one of them   ma i know not whether he would or no i find him not the most complying particularly in my enquiry about this matter which i now tell you of it was a long time before he would own where he spent his time and now he has told me i have no account of what he has been about or what his business was there at those unseasonable hours   fa this is the very thing i complain of   ma why how shall i help it what would you have me do   fa do i would have you act like a master and oblige him to do as becomes a servant viz give you an exact account of his behavior his time is yours and you ought to know how he spends it if any of his time is employed out of your business you ought to exact an account of it from him how it has been disposed of as much as you would of money that you had trusted him with how he had paid it   ma i thought this more your work than mine   fa if he was your own son and my apprentice i should think so too but as it is as i said before his time is not mine nor his own but yours and it is to you he is to give an account of it   ma but pray why do you put it off from your self you know i have a great hurry of business and cannot have time and he will be more in awe of you than of me i think it is much better for you   fa i am very far from putting it off from my self i shall concur with you most readily in the strictest examination into his behavior but i am surpised to hear you put it off from your self as if you were not concerned in it and by which if his courses are evil as you suggest he may be ruined at any time and i may know nothing of it and you must allow that this ought to give me some concern as a father whatever it does to you as a master   ma i am something of your mind now as to its being my duty to my servants though as i am circumstancd i do not see how i can perform it   fa if god gives you a sense of its being your duty i leave the sense of your living in the neglect of it to his mercy who i hope will open your eyes to the necessity of performing it it is a sad thing to be in such a circumstance as renders what is your known duty impracticable to you   ma what can i do   fa that is for you to consider not me if you are convinced of what you ought to do i have spent my time well enough   ma but what would you have me do with your son   fa do act the master with him and command him to give you an exact account of the time you charge him with where he has spent it in what company and about what business   ma if i do he will refuse it and desire me to dismiss him he does as good as do that already which i took ill from him   fa what must be the occasion of that   ma why it had been observed by all the house as well as by me that he has been melancholy and discontented a great while and i very kindly asked him the reason but he declined to tell me i asked him if he disliked the trade he said no if he disliked his master no i told him if he was uneasy at any thing though he was bound i would release him for i would not keep him against his inclination at this he seemed pleased and mighty desirous to go now what can i do if i challenge him with his going out and pretend to demand a strict account of his time and he refuses what can i do but threaten to turn him away and that it seems he desires and yet he will not tell me the reason of it neither which does not show him to have much good nature or good manners indeed i took it so ill that but in respect to you i had sent him home that very minute and now i have told you of it what would you have me do   fa i have said what i would have you do viz act the master with him and tell him in plain terms you will have an account of his behavior you may be sure he shall get nothing by complaining to me if his case be bad and if he refuses positively as i believe he will not we will enquire of your neighbor mr  s for he has the character of a very good man perhaps he may find it out for us   ma i know mr  s is a very pious religious good man and his wife is a very religious woman and it is indeed a very sober family which makes me wonder what the boy can be doing there which he should be so earnest to conceal if you will i will go and enquire of him first   fa no i think you had better talk with the boy first i am persuaded he will submit to you and i hope tell you the truth and if that truth be to your satisfaction you will be better pleased to have it from the boy than to make it more public   ma well i will have another dialogue with him to morrow and you shall hear what will be the issue   the father goes away and the youth coming to the door with him the father says thus fa thomas it seems your master has been talking with you about this matter   son yes sir   fa he is very angry and takes it very ill you should refuse to give him an account of your self and where you used to be when you go out in a morning and evening   son i did tell him where i was and assured him i was no where else   fa but it was a long time before you would tell him that   son i was so afraid he would enquire what my business was there that i could not think of telling him   fa why you must tell him still child for he is mighty earnest to know what you are there so much for he imagines it is some wicked thing by your being afraid to tell him i hope the account you gave me of it is true   son dear father i hope you do not doubt its being true i never used to tell you an untruth   fa no child i do not doubt of its being true and why then should you be afraid to tell him of it   son i am more ashamed than afraid to tell him of it i think it does not become me to make my master blush at himself   fa but here is a necessity now so that i do not see how you can avoid it let him take it how he will for it passes in the family that you have some ill correspondence or some bad company there and they will make a great deal of it if you are so backward to give an account of it and therefore to clear up your own reputation you must tell your master   son i had rather you would do it for me sir i am not fit to talk to my master about such things   fa i have prepared the way by a long dispute with your master about his duty to his servants and i am persuaded let what you say be never so course or boyish god will bless it so as to carry conviction along with it that he has not done his duty to you whatever you have done to him   son i can say nothing to him of that sir he will fly out in a rage at me   fa no no you are only to answer his questions and give an account of your self and of the reason why you go over to the clothiers house every morning and evening you can do that easily enough let the will of god be done in what shall follow one way or other   son i will do as you order me sir as well as i can   the father leaves him and the boy going in his master calls him ma thomas come hither   tho yes sir   ma well i have given your father an account of your behavior and he is very much concerned as well as i about it   tho i am sorry for it sir   ma well but that is not enough your father and i too are resolved to find out the bottom of it if you will not confess ingenuously   tho sir you speak of it as if i was guilty of some strange thing i hope i have committed no crime sir   ma it will be very well if it appears so sir however our suspicions are justified by your being so very careful to conceal your self and if this has made me resolve to examine into it you might save me that labor as i told you by an ingenuous confession   tho i never declined it sir   ma no did i not press you to it before and you declined it and your fathers coming prevented or else i suppose i had had a flat denial   tho i never denied to obey any of your commands sir in my life i only told you that i was backward because i feared it might displease you but i little thought it should be suggested that my being abroad was for any thing criminal   ma how could you expect any other   tho because being perfectly innocent i had no thought of being suspected   ma clear up all then thomas by ingenuously giving an account of your self to me now   tho be pleased sir to tell me what part you mean whether as to my being abroad or my being discontented for you charged me with both   ma begin first with your being abroad you say you were only at my neighbors over the way i have not examined into it yet but i take it for granted that you speak truth   tho indeed sir i was no where but there   ma well your business there the occasion of your going so early how you employed your self there and with who these are the questions   tho you will not take it ill sir i hope then if my answers may seem not to become me or less dutiful or respectful to you than you may think they ought to be   ma not at all so you speak truth thomas   tho i hope i shall satisfy you of that sir by the consequence you know sir i have been brought up under my father with a religious education and in his family where the worship of god has been constantly kept up and coming hither sir as an apprentice where i found you were not pleased to permit me or to let me come up when you i doubt not went to prayers and reading with your family it made me afraid either that you did not think me worthy to be reckoned one of your family or that it was a judgment of god upon me to be shut out from his worship this sir made me very sad which is the discontent you speak of but hearing of that other good family over the way and that mr  s the clothier went constantly to prayers every morning and night i got acquaintance with the young man his apprentice and got him to ask his master to give me leave to come there at those times   ma well thomas this is a well contrived story truly you want not cunning i find but what is this to six a clock in the morning thomas which at this time of the year is always before day and before he is up to be sure   tho if you please to enquire sir into the orders of his family you will find that he is up every morning in the year by six a clock and calls them all to prayers before they go to work   ma and what mean you by getting that boy to do this for you that does not hang together at all why he is the most profligate young villain that ever came into any good mans house his master was talking in my hearing but the other day of sending him to the house of correction and spoke to me for a warrant your acquaintance with such a boy as that is not likely to be for so good a purpose and this part makes all the rest unlikely and to be suspected   tho he was so sir that is true but if you enquire you will find he is another thing now gods grace has made a strange change in that boy in a few weeks past if you please to inform your self of it sir you may hear it from other hands   ma and is this the whole truth thomas has this been your whole business there   tho indeed it has sir   ma you must not think much if i enquire in order to be better satisfied   tho i cannot expect any other sir   ma i shall talk with you farther about it it is late now   the master bitterly stung with the boys account of himself puts off the rest of the discourse the end of the third dialogue notes on the third dialogue there seems to be more circumlocutions in this dialogue than in any of the rest but they will be found not useful only but necessary at least to preserve the cadence of things and introduce the substance of the real story by necessary gradations the boys shifting off so many ways before he directly tells his master the whole of his business is a mark of commendable modesty in a servant his shyness of speaking what he knew touched his masters behavior more than his own may be very instructing to servants if they please to mark it in things where their masters character may be concerned but above all it may be noted that all these things tend to bring the conviction home with the more energy and force upon the conscience of the master  the masters discourse with the young mans father contains a great many useful hints about the duty of masters to their servants   that they ought to reckon them under their care as well as under their government   that the charge of the souls of our servants lies upon us as well as those of our children the just distinction between a parent and a father is fruitful of many useful observations the last is tied by nature the first by the god of nature the last by affection the first by duty but both are tied to discharge the part of a christian parent to the souls under their charge whether servants children or relations that a servant taken into the family becomes a child of the family and ought equally with our children to partake of every part of our religious duties such as prayer exhortation examination instruction reproof restraint and correction this is farther plain from what god says of abraham genesis       that he will command his children and his household that is he will discharge faithfully the duty of a parent or guide and governor of a family which is shown in his commanding his whole house to walk in the ways of god  note how custom has wickedly of late years seemed to discharge masters of this duty   by the pride of servants who bringing large sums of money much greater than formerly seem to expect not to be so much at commands as they used to be a wicked and abominable custom which as no religious parent can be easy in it so no religious master ought to be subjected to it   by the negligence of parents who really seem less to concern themselves about the souls of their children when they put them out as apprentices than about their learning trades doing their business and the like   by the universal backwardness of masters who think as this man did that they have no concern upon them about their servants souls or any thing but just to see that their business is done and then to let them go where they please and do what they please   observe here a most ridiculous argument or excuse which the master brings viz that he was ashamed to go about instructing or praying with his apprentices and journeymen because they would laugh at him note we are easier to be laughed out of our duty than persuaded into it   from the whole masters of families may observe the duty of instructing and religiously guiding their servants lies indispensably upon them as much as that of instructing and educating their children they are parents that is guides and governors to their whole house though they are fathers only to their children  the fourth dialogue the master of the young man aforesaid now makes a visit to his neighbor the clothier who lived over against his house whether he had any doubt of the truth of what the boy had said to him and had a mind as he had said to the lad himself to find out the bottom of it or perhaps to satisfy himself farther about the alteration of the wicked boy which his own servant had acquainted him of or to please his own curiosity or directed by providence for his farther conviction is not material but here discoursing of other things with the good man and his wife he begins the following dialogue thus talking of their servants  i remember neighbor you were once complaining of a very bad servant you had and talked as if you wanted a warrant of me to send him to the house of correction   clothier yes ant please your worship i did so   note he was an alderman in the country town and so a magistrate at that time  aderman well and pray how does he behave himself now shall you want a warrant neighbor you know i shall always be ready to serve you in any thing i can it shall cost you nothing if you have any such occasion   clo i hope not now sir i think that lad is much reformed though i have had many bad servants i never had a worse than he was but he is wonderfully changed however i thank your worship for your kind offer   clo wife you are very happy sir in that part for you have very good servants   ald truly but indifferent i have had my share of trouble that way as well as you   wife i am sure you have some very good ones   ald well but i am very glad to hear that your bad one is mended   clo i thank you sir indeed he is very much mended   ald it is very rare that bad servants grow better i have often heard of good servants that have grown worse i am sure with me they do so   clo indeed sir i hope this lad of mine will prove a very good young man   ald good why you represented him to me as one of the worst wretches that ever came into your house if i remember right you said he was given to lying and swearing scoffing at religion and at every thing that was good and was himself every thing that was bad   clo indeed he was so sir   ald i doubt not you did all you could to reclaim him i know you would   clo i endeavored sir to discharge my conscience toward him but i had no satisfaction in it only so far that i had done my duty i could do no more and i was quite tired out with him indeed i resolved to put him away for i could not bear him among my children he was enough to spoil all the children in the parish   ald you have a great advantage neighbor that i have not i am in such a continual hurry of business that i cannot look after my family as i would do i have no leisure to discharge my duty to my servants you have leisure neighbor and your servants have the advantage of it   clo truly sir if i have leisure it is my loss for my livelihood depends upon my being employed as well as my servants but they that are taught to know their duty will always find leisure to do it i doubt not sir but you discharge your self better that way than i can do   wife it is seen plainly in your servants themselves that you do your duty to them sir sure never any body had such servants as you have   ald nay neighbor do not say i discharge my duty better than you god forgive me i dont discharge it at all i mean to my apprentices i take no care about them   clo wife that is then because they are so good and so religious that they need no inspection for you know sir we are to instruct our servants as well as our children   ald well i cannot say that i have made that much of my concern for our apprentices generally come of pretty good families and bring money with them and they think themselves above being talked to about such things   clo then they are among those who solomon calls fools that despise instruction and if they reject your offers to instruct them i cannot see what you can do in that case that was my very case with this boy   ald i perceive you have had a great deal of trouble with him   clo yes indeed so i have i was quite weary of him   ald he had the report of a very wicked boy   clo indeed i was ashamed to have it said such a boy was in my house i was afraid any of the neighbors children should come near him   ald indeed i have a young man i believe is not much the better for him i have been chiding him a little about it but is he really changed and reformed think you   clo indeed that he is and most wonderfully too i bless god for it   ald i question not but you have taken a great deal of pains with him but are you not deceived is he not a cheat and plays the hypocrite   clo if ever there was a true convert in the world i believe he is one   ald you are very happy that god has so far blessed your endeavors with the child   clo wife not our endeavors sir at all we were denied that blessing it comes all from you sir the blessing is from your house   ald what do you mean   clo it is a plain case sir   clo wife if i understand you right you spoke as if some of your servants had received no good from our william if that be so i know not but i am sure william has received good from some in your house   ald yes indeed i found that a young lad i have newly bound was acquainted with this boy of yours and that he was often abroad with him and it has caused some disturbance among us for knowing your lad was so wicked a boy i forbid him his company   clothier pray what do you call the lad you speak of   ald his name is thomas he is my youngest prentice   clo wife i know not what harm he may have received from our boy but i can assure you our youth has received much good from him   clo ay that is the youth that god has made the instrument he is a wonderful child   ald he the instrument how is that possible   clo with god sir all things are possible assure your self sir so it is and such a convert as this child is i neither ever saw or read of   ald why our thomas is a poor melancholy discontented boy a mere child   clo he is such a child sir as i never met with the like i find you do not know him   ald why i never thought there was any thing in him he is but young and indeed we all thought him young in every thing it is true he is a sober modest sort of a boy and talks pretty well but i never saw any thing extraordinary in him he is so melancholy and discontented we thought him distempered and i have been at the point of turning him away   clo you know sir the scripture says that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings he has ordained praise this child as you call him is an excellent christian and beyond his years capable of showing it perhaps sir you never tried him   ald no indeed not i as i said to you before neighbor i have no time to trouble my self about my prentices i mean as to such things   clo wife and as i said to you before sir you have no need for it for your prentices are fit to teach others   ald i am glad to hear it is so but i confess you surprise me with the thing how are you satisfied with the truth of these things   clo my wife can give you an account of the whole matter if your worship pleases to have patience to hear it   ald i will hear it with all my heart   here the mstress relates the whole passage and the discourse between her and the young man in the room over the workhouse ald i am amazed at this account you give but pray tell me was all this begun by his keeping company and conversing with my young man   clo yes all of it he was the general mocker of every thing that was good and began to do so in your young mans company and he was the first that reproved him for it and he did it so seriously and so effectually that it has pleased god to work on him as you see   ald then i have done that young man of mine a great deal of wrong   clo wife if you have thought any evil of him you have wronged him indeed for he is such a young man as will be a blessing to any family he comes into   ald indeed i have wronged him very much especially if you can give me satisfaction about one thing and which to be free with you was the principal reason of my coming to visit you at this time   clo we will give you all the satisfaction we can sir   ald why then i will tell you that first as said before i have had some uneasiness at my young mans keeping company as i was informed he did with this boy who i had heard you say was so wicked that ye knew not what to do with him and talked of sending him to the correction house but this was not all i found my young man grew melancholy and appeared discontented as i told you just now as if he did not like his business though we cannot say that he omits or neglects any thing but every morning before day he rises up in the dark and goes out some where or other and stays about half an hour and then comes in again and sits by himself all the rest of the time till business begins every night he is missing again till about   a clock and all the house takes notice of it when i came to examine him about it it was a long time before he would give me an account of it nay he rather desired to be put away and go back to his father than to give an account where he spent his time till at last i acquainted his father with it and threatened him i would find out the bottom of it unless he would make an ingenious confession then he gives this for an answer that he was over the way at your house here this increased my suspicion because of the hours he kept which i was sure must be in the morning before you were up and i concluded this wicked boy of yours and he spent their time together in some clandestine wickedness or other and the boy would be ruined which i was very sorry for his father being my very good friend   clo i hope sir you need not be apprehensive that he should get any ill in my house   ald no indeed neighbor i should not so far as you know of it but what could their mornings meetings be for before you or your family was up   clo wife what time is it exactly sir that you say he comes and goes   ald as i understand it he goes out about six and is back between six and seven which looked to me as if he came hither before you were up and as soon as he found you beginning to stir comes off again and would not be seen   clo that cannot be the case sir for we are all of us up every day if we are well before six and at our work presently after six   ald well but does he come at those hours in the morning and about eight a clock at night is he here as he tells me or is he not   clo yes i cannot deny but the young man is here at these hours very often   ald nay if you do but know of it i am easy to be satisfied especially if this had been his business   clo wife i hope your worship will not be angry with us for the young mans coming hither   ald not at all if you are assured what his business is   clo it is not for us to say we are satisfied he is your servant sir and if you are not satisfied i should be very sorry to have him come hither against your mind   ald i say if you are satisfied that his coming hither has been as you relate it and that he has been a means of doing the young man so much good i shall be satisfied to be sure but what need is there of his coming so early in a morning and so late at night that indeed i do not understand it seems to leave me in the dark a little and this makes me ask if you are sure of the thing   clo i will by no means deceive you sir you do not rightly understand us that our lad has been instructed and brought to a conviction and as i believe and hope to a thorough conversion by his conversing with the young man that is your servant this is true sir there is no room to doubt it but that his coming over hither night and morning is to converse with our lad william that is not the case at all sir i hope the young man did not tell you so if he did i should be sorry i can hardly suspect him of such a thing i believe he makes more conscience of his words than to say so   ald no indeed i will not do him so much wrong he did not say so but when first i asked him where he had been he told me he had been no where but here i told him if that were true it was well and i should ask no further of his business till i was satisfied about the fact it self   clo wife i should have thought it very strange if he had told you so their conversation has not been here i can assure you but as i understand it has been at your house or walking in the fields or at such times as you know youth can find enough to converse in   ald what then can his business be here   clo and your worship will not be angry   ald not i indeed i am satisfied he can have been doing no harm here and if he had i shall but dismiss him and let his father take him to task it is no business of mine he is not my son   clo you mistake me again i did not mean angry with him but angry with us   ald what should i be angry with you for   clo perhaps you may think hard of us that we should do any thing where your family affairs are concerned or speak our minds too freely i am very sure we have shown no disrespect to you in it sir in the least   ald i give you my word i will take nothing ill from you do but tell me freely the whole case the making me easy in one respect shall fully make me amends for any thing you shall say that may concern me   clo why then sir the case is this when my wife heard from our lad what she has already related to you and had examined william more fully about the particulars as how and upon what occasion he became acquainted with your young man in what manner he had discoursed with him and what principles of instruction he had laid in him william gave her a long account of the conference they had had together and how thomas gave him a bible and turned down the several promisory texts to encourage him to hope in and pray to god and    here the clothier repeats the first dialogue between the two boys so far as belonged to williams case and when we heard all this you cannot think it strange that we desired to see and speak with this young man to see what kind of youth it must be to whom god had so early given so much grace and so eminently made an instrument of to work on his companion and merely to satisfy this curiosity my wife ordered william to invite him hither which he did and brought him over with him i hope your worship does not blame us for this it was with no design at all but to see and talk with him upon serious matters and see whether there was that foundation in him which our lad related   ald i cannot take any thing of this ill i am very well pleased with it pray go on   clo after we had talked a while with him on these things he went home again we did not detain him at all but my wife invited him to come again at his leisure which he did this we hope you will not be displeased with for we are much taken with his society   ald i am not at all displeased   clo in one of these visits the young man appeared more melancholy and more reserved as we thought than usual and my wife pressed to know if any thing troubled him or if he was not well he answered he was very well but modestly declined telling what troubled him   ald why this is his case at home he appears reserved and discontented and no body can get it out of him what is the matter with him   clo well my wife got it out of him some time after when pressing him to tell her what it was that troubled him he told her his case was very sad his master was a good man and he liked his business very well but that his master looked upon him as a heathen or as some vile creature for that morning and evening when he went up as he supposed to prayers with his children he would never let him be called up or admitted among them so that he said he believed his master thought him not worthy taking any care of or else it was a judgment of god upon him for his sins and this troubled him so he could not enjoy himself and the poor child wept grievously when he had told it her now sir as this relates to your family affairs i was very unwilling to mention it least you should be angry   ald go on i have no reason to be angry at all neither at you nor at him   clo we could not but pity the poor young man and my wife exhorted him however to take care to be the more diligent in his private duty to god and not to let the want of family prayer be a means to thrust out prayer altogether at this discourse he wept again more than before and told her that he had no retreat for private prayer and that when at first he did kneel down by his bed side to pray to god when he went to bed the other apprentices would laugh at him jeer him and interrupt him so that he was forced to leave it off again that he was afterward tempted to believe that having these hindrances he was discharged from the duty and having no conveniences for it was a just excuse for omitting it and the fear that he should grow loose and willing to omit his duty entirely oppressed his mind so that he thought it would break his heart for he thought his father had placed him just in the devils mouth i am too plain sir i hope you will excuse me   ald you need no excuse pray go on   clo i was exceedingly concerned for the young man and so was my wife and we were both minded to have invited him to come over at our usual hours of family prayer and join with us but as he was your worships servant and we did not know how our hours might interfere with your business we thought it was not proper lest it might give you offense   ald well that was very obliging too but i should have taken no offense i assure you   clo then you will take the less sir at what has been done which was only this the young man finding we did not invite him which it seems he expected spoke afterward to william to ask my wife if we would give him leave when he might be spared to come over at our times of worship and join with us in praying to god then indeed we thought our selves more obliged than we were before to do it and my wife sending for him told him she had invited him before but that we thought it might give his master offense but that he should be welcome to come when he would leaving it to him to take care that he did not offend his master by being out at such times as he might be wanted withal telling him that she believed he could not be here at our morning prayer because our business requiring us to be early at work we went always to prayer exactly at six a clock in the morning in winter and at five in summer the poor young man was so glad of the liberty we had given him to come that he said he would be sure to be here by six or five if we begin so soon though he was to sit up all night and indeed we have observed that he has never mist one morning yet   ald and is all this true is this his business here night and morning   clo wife indeed this is all sir that we know of i hope it does not displease you   ald as judah said of his daughter tamar he is more righteous than i he has done his duty and i have neglected mine i am sorry i have done him so much wrong in my thoughts i shall love the boy for it as long as i live   clo but sir since you have given me leave to speak so freely to your worship and have had this long account from me which i assure you is nothing but truth will you please to give me leave to put in one word of my own in behalf of this good young man   ald what is that speak freely   clo why sir that you will be pleased to admit him to your family exercises though you do not the rest of your servants i know you have a great family and you may not think it proper to call them all up when as the young man says you do your lady and children but this is so good and so serious a child that you will be delighted in having him with you and if you should not it will break his heart and then besides he will have no occasion to come over to us or to rise at such hours as he is not used to and perhaps get cold and many things may happen to him i entreat for him purely because i see what a child he is   here the master is pincht hard and for a time sits silent at last breaks out ald alas neighbor it is all wrong the boys mistaken and you are mistaken it is i alone am justly reproved in all this for like a heathen and one that has entirely cast off god and religion i have never kept up any family worship at all i confess it to you freely and i think in all my life i have never had such a stroke to my conviction as from this poor boy i have neither been father nor master to my family but have been driving after the world as if i had no other portion i have lived as if i were never to die and i am afraid i shall die as if i had never lived the whole crime lies at my door   the alderman weeps clo i am sorry i have said so much i knew nothing how it was   the end of the fourth dialogue the fifth dialogue the discourse of the good man and his wife had such an effect upon the country alderman especially with the addition from the account he had received of the conduct of his apprentice that it caused him seriously to reflect on his family conduct and convinced him that he had been quite out of the way of his duty as a master of his family to his servants as well as in his relation of a father to his children and these convictions put him upon resolutions of altering his conduct in his family  but here as in all such cases where a religious economy is not established in the beginning insuperable difficulties appeared to him which several times discouraged him slackned his resolution and cooled his mind so as to incline him rather to go on in the neglect as he had begun believing it too late to refrain but two unexpected providential accidents surprised him into his duty the happy consequences whereof will appear for the encouragement of other masters of families in the like attempt of reforming their practice and applying themselves to set up a religious government in their households notwithstanding all pretended difficulties  the difficulties he had before him were two first he had married a lady who differed from him in opinion he had been bred a dissenter from the church and his wife had been bred in conformity to the church and continued so and as this kind of marrying however not at all unlawful is not always the greatest help to or forwarder of a religious family so he though erroneously judged his wife might not be willing to join with him in his way of family worship if he should begin it again as to his servants his apprentices and journymen several of which he had were men grown such as seemed to be past government and as they had none of them any appearing inclination to what was religious he having always indulged them in a total neglect of such things he thought they would but make a jest of him and that he should never be able to bring them to conform to any thing of family orders as to his children they were young and he did not so much consider them in the case and those that were any thing grown up were abroad at the boarding school now in both these cases he was happily disappointed providence removed both the difficulties at once so as to take from him any kind of excuse for the further neglect of his duty  it soon became known in the house that thomas and his master had had some words about his going out every morning and evening to the clothiers nor could it be hid upon what occasion he went thither and his master had spoken of it to another of his servants that the young man should not be hindered for that he was very well satisfied of the business he went about as it was known among the servants it could not be concealed from the mistress who being a very pious religious lady her self seemed not a little concerned at the thing and having observed her husband to be more than usually thoughtful and melancholy for some time she imagined something about that apprentice had disturbed him both which circumstances put together occasioned the following discourse betwixt them  wife my dear pray let me ask one thing of you have you examined any further since you and i discoursed last of it about your youngest apprentice keeping bad hours   husband yes my dear i have but i do not find there is any thing in it worth notice   wife how do you mean nothing in it it is certain he has a haunt somewhere in the town that he steals out in a morning before day and comes softly in again as if he were a thief and every evening as duly as it comes he is abroad no body knows where   husb my dear i have examined into it   wife nay if you are satisfied i do not use to meddle especially with your servants but methinks it is great pity the boy should be ruined he was a pretty sober lad when he came hither and if he takes any bad courses now even for his fathers sake as well as his own methinks something should be done to prevent it i wish you would have told his father of it that he might have taken some care of him   husb my dear there is nothing at all of harm in the boy be satisfied   wife nay i have thought so too but what can he go out so for then and at such hours too   husb i have examined into it i say and am fully satisfied   wsfe nay if i must not know the case i will say no more   husb my dear i do not conceal the case from the upon his account at all   wife well then i suppose he has promised you amendment   husb no indeed so far from that that i have approved of his doing it and have allowed him to do it and ordered none of my people to hinder him as some would have done by taking the keys of the door in   wife i do not use to meddle i say with your business but you may be sure the seeming mystery of it tempts my curiosity to know what the meaning of it can be but if you do not think fit to tell me i shall desist my enquiry   husb i cannot tell thee the case   wise cannot that is still more dark it seems it is not because you do not know it   husb no indeed my dear   wife if it is some secret i should not know on the least notice my enquiry shall cease   husb i never concealed any thing from thee in my life   wife nor did i ever discover any thing yet committed to me what have i done then that you begin now   husb i wish i had not this secret to conceal it is a burden too heavy for me   wife then let me bear some of it for thee my dear cannot i lighten the load by taking some of it upon my self i would bear any burden to remove it from you   husb this is a load no body can bear a wound no surgeon can cure   wife you surprise me with the nicety of the thing and sweil my apprehensions perhaps to a greater degree than it requires it must be something very mysterious that from the conduct of a boy can be so essential to you i entreat thee my dear tell me so much of it as is proper for me to know if any part of it be so or tell me that none of it is proper for me to know and i will cease my importunity   husb my dear it is all proper for you to know and i ought to let you know it and you both can and perhaps would assist to ease it and yet it is very difficult for me to let you know it   wife you leave me in the greatest uncertainty now in the world whether i should importune you any further or not   husb i wish you would not and yet i wish you would   wife whether would be most for your own ease and advantage for as for a mere satisfying my curiosity i lay no weight on that now   husb it would be most for my advantage to have you know it   wife then if you believe i have been faithful to you and can still be so put it in my power to relieve you i have not been insensible that some thing has a good while oppressed your mind sure if i can relieve you your remedy is easy   husb i do not say you can entirely relieve me but you may in part   wife let me do my part then   husb my part will be still hardest   wife my dear amuse me and your self no more what has this boy done   husb my dear he has done nothing which he ought not to have done and i nothing that i ought to have done he has strove to do his duty and deeply reproved me that i have not done mine   wife he has shown more honesty than manners then sure it was not his place to reprove his master   husb no my dear he has not reproved me in words he has rather used more modesty in that than consisted with truth but his actions have given me the severest and most just reproof that ever i had in my life   wife nay if you acknowledge it just    husb or else it would be an insult not a reproof no doubt it is just the case is this you know i mentioned to you once before my dissatisfaction at the boys conduct and you gave me some hints your self of his being melancholy and discontented upon which i acquainted his father with it but his father threw it back upon me to examine it my self and a long dispute we had about whose duty it was to take cognizance of the morals and behavior of prentices   wife what could you dispute of about that   husb why i alleged he was his son that i could do no more than acquaint him with his conduct and that he must take care of the rest that my part was to teach him his trade and see that my business was done but as to the rest it lay upon him and that i had discharged my self in giving him this account of his son he affirmed the contrary that i was in his place essentially that as i had a right to his time so i was obliged to exact an account of it from him as much as i would of money committed to him to pay and the like and so we fell into a long dispute about the distinction of a parent and a father he affirmed that i was a parent to the boy though not a father and that the duty of taking care of him both soul and body was mine   wife i am not capable to argue these things but i confess i must be very much of his opinion for i think when a father commits his child to us if he puts his body under our care and not his soul pray what must become of the youth must he be left without government to be ruined   husb why if that be my duty i have sadly neglected it   wife indeed my dear i have often thought so especially when i have heard you say to your prentices that you only required their constant attendance at such and such hours and that for the rest of the time they might go where they pleased i could not think young men should be left so entirely to their own disposal i am persuaded no sober father would like it i am sure if any of my sons should come to be put out i should be very sorry to put them to a master that should do so   husb i see i have been in an error but what should i have done   wife my dear why do you ask me what you should do am i fit to teach you   husb indeed any body may teach me i have been taught lately by a meaner instructor than you   wife it may be so my dear but i am none of those wives that set up to teach their husbands   husb but you may give your advice   wife in such cases there is little difference betwixt advising and teaching except in the arrogance of the word besides advice is generally asked before it is given if it be given before it be asked it is rather an admonition or reproof than an advice   husb but my dear you might abate ceremonies with me what would you have supposed to have been my duty as a master have not i enough to do to teach them their trade and see them do my business   wife if you will have it be so that i must give my opinion i must be very plain that i think you have a great deal more to do that when they are committed to your charge by their parents their whole behavior is under your care and that though serving god is their particular duty and lies upon them yet it is your duty to see as far as in you lies that they perform it and at your hands their souls will be required if you neglect your duty and indulge them in the neglect of their own   husb but my dear you must explain the words as far as in me lies that is the thing i speak of my business is their work if they neglect that i am to see it remedied but as to their morals and religion if i see cause to dislike i acquaint their parents is not that doing the thing as far as in me lies   wife i cannot say that it is you may do much more than that or else what does that signify for when a father knows of his sons wicked courses what can he do he is under your care for correction and under his fathers only for admonition for he is your servant   husb i warrant their fathers would think it very hard that i should correct one of them   wife on the other hand i believe you would take it very ill to have one of their fathers come to your shop and cane or correct one of your prentices you would say he took the work out of your hands   husb i cannot take that pains with them i will rather have no apprentices   wife indeed my dear you had better take none for it is but murdering youth and robbing their fathers to take young men and then keep them under no government   husb but youth are come to that pass that they will be under no government now   wife my dear there is hardly any young man so ill taught but if he is begun with at first will submit to government i do not say they will all be the better for it but there is a great difference hetween a young mans not profiting by instruction and refusing to submit to it   husb my dear what can i do   wife my dear you are no ignorant person you do not want to have me say what you can do you know what you ought to do it is not my part to teach you your duty   husb abate that nicety for once my dear and make no scruple to say what you think is my duty to my servants though you do not think it your part to teach me my duty you may be a means to convince me that something was my duty which i did not think was my duty before and i may learn from you what you do not set up to teach there need not be so much shyness between a wife and her husband that for fear of taking too much upon you to teach me you should omit a kind hint to me of what you think i ought to do   wife i do not refrain for that so much as that i think you know your part so well that it is perfectly unreasonable and needless for me to offer any thing besides family government is so natural a consequence to the very being and constitution of master and servant father and child husband and wife that no husband of your capacity can be ignorant the scripture is so full on the side of those who are to be governed that it cannot but lead directly to those who are the governors wives are bid to submit themselves to their husbands children to obey their parents servants to be subject to their masters all which naturally implies that the government of the whole family devolves entirely upon the head of the master who has the whole charge of them soul and body and is accountable for their miscarriages so far as those miscarriages are owing to the omission of his duty   husb so that you put the master entirely upon the fathers place and the servants in the posture of children   wife indeed i can think no otherwise especially apprentices who by their indentures are entirely subjected to the masters government   husb but my dear we differ then about the word government and how far that extends beyond my commanding them in the offices of an apprentice and their doing my business   wife indeed i think it extends to every thing else we are obliged by the fourth commandment not to suffer our servants to break the sabbath and so of every duty in the other commands and no question but it is our duty to restrain them from every evil action whereby they may offend god or wrong their neighbor i mean as much as is in our power and on the other hand we are to encourage them in all that is good viz in their duty to god and man and this by all possible methods such as exhortation command advice viz but especially example praying to god for them and with them   husb if all this be my duty i have sadly neglected it both to servants and children too   wife indeed my dear i have often thought so with a great deal of grief   husb but why then my dear would you not tell me so before now and not now without so much difficulty and a kind of violence   wife my dear i have been backward perhaps more than has been my duty lest you should think i did what it was not my place to do besides you know our opinions differ in some things and i did not know whether you might listen to me on that account   husb why my dear that very thing has been my hindrance lest my dear being of a different opinion as to the form of prayer should not like it or care to join with me in it   wife you very much wronged me then my dear i hope though we differ in opinion about religion we are not of two religions we may have differing thoughts of the manner and forms of worship but not i hope of worship it self i hope we pray to the same god and in the name of the same intercessor nor is our difference about forms such that you should refuse my prayers because of the form or i yours for want of a form that god to whom we pray certainly respects the heart and not the form so that with the form or without it we shall be equally heard if we pray in faith and equally rejected if we do not   husb and would you have joined with me my dear in family prayer if i had proferred it   wife most heartily my dear and i wonder what kind of heathen you have taken me for that you should doubt it i am sure it has often troubled me to see the family brought up with no manner of regard to the worship of god in it i was never bred so and i have had many a sad heart about it on the account of my children   husb and never would ease your mind by speaking a word about it to me before   wife that may have been a fault but i did not so much think it my duty or rather indeed did not see it likely to have effect   husb but would you rather have your children bred up without being introduced into the ways of god and religion than break in a little upon what you thought was not your place   wife i have endeavored to do my duty with my little ones as well as i could   husb and i have the reputation of that little too as you shall hear presently which i am sure and god knows i do not deserve in the least   wife alas what can a wife do in such a family as ours is it is not worth naming the worship of god in a family ought to be avowed and owned by the master of the family and performed either by himself or chaplains with due gravity and solemnity suitable to the authority of the master of the house and suitable to the authority and greatness of that god to whom it is directed and there is not a servant so wicked so profligate so profane but would reverence the practice if they did not profit by the performance   husb truly my dear one of the greatest difficulties was on your account and i have often thought it the only allay to our happiness in coming together   wife it is very hard you should think so ill of me and not try whether it was with justice or no especially when your information was so easy   husb i was loath    wife loath to come to the duty and he that tempted you to neglect that part threw this wicked thought in your way for an obstruction not giving you leave to clear up your own thoughts and my innocence by asking me the question   husb indeed i have done thee wrong but i hope the devil has had no share in it   wife my dear how was it possible such a hard thought could enter into thy heart else of me had i not a religious education and is not my father and mother still living who keep as regular a family and the worship of god as constantly performed in it as in any house in the nation and have you seen any thing in me that looks like a willingness to have my family without it as to my scrupling to join with dissenters though i think it my duty not to break off from the church yet sure i have not such an opinion of conscientious dissenters as to refuse to pray to god with them how could you think i would have married a dissenter if that had been my judgment and have you not seen me readily join in family worship at your brothers as you have done with us at my fathers surely if we have both joined with other families of either sort we could not have wanted charity so much as to have refused to do it in our own house   husb truly my dear you argue so reasonably in this that i see plainly it has been all my own crime and i have done thee a great deal of wrong which i am very sorry for   wife if my dear will reform the thing it self the wrong done to me shall never be mentioned as long as i live i have too much grief at the neglect not to bury all my complaints in the satisfaction i should have to see it rectified   husb if you knew the stinging reproof i have had another way you would say i wanted no other animadversion   wife i have interrupted you too long in that pray let me hear it out if i remember you were upon the discourse with thomass father pray go on with that   husb why my dear he threw all the work back upon me as i told you but i believe the issue was that both he and i also talked to thomas about his discontent and his melancholy and about his going out of doors   wife very well and what account did he give of himself   husb why that of his melancholy came in of course but as to his going abroad before day and the like and especially on the sabbath day in the evening he told me he went over the way to neighbor m  s the clothiers   wife what could he be doing there it must be with some of their servants then for they are very sober good people he could get no ill among them but they have a boy a young fellow their prentice that is the wickedest young rogue that ever was heard of it must be some ugly haunt he has got with him i doubt that carries him thither and if it is that the boy is undone   husb that was the very thing i was afraid of too but we are both strangely mistaken thomas is quite another lad than any of us took him for and instead of learning wickedness from that vicious boy he has been gods instrument to make that boy the greatest convert that ever you heard of   wife i am surprised it can never be are you sure you are not imposed upon   husb no no i am not imposed upon he has more grace and more goodness in him than ever i heard of in a child of his age for he is but a child he has been the greatest reproof to me in the neglect of my family government that ever i met with   wife tell me these matters more plainly for i am more curious to know them than any thing i ever heard of   husb i will my dear i will tell thee all the particulars   here the husband relates exactly the last conference he had with his prentice dial   wife how pretty and modest was that answer that you was not pleased to admit him to your family when you went to the worship of god   husb ah my dear but how bitter a reproach was it think you to me when my own heart struck me with such thoughts as these wretch that i am how innocently this child thinks as indeed it is rational to imagine that it should be impossible but that god must be worshipped in every christian family only suggesting that i had shut him out or did not think him worthy to join with us whereas the plain but dreadful truth is i have lived like a heathen all my life and never have worshipped god in my family at all   wife he saw no great appearance of it i confess i wonder how he had such a thought   husb yes my dear there was some appearance of it but not on my side as i said before that i had the reputation of what you had performed so no doubt he had seen or some of the children or servants had spoken of your calling the children into your closet with you and he supposed we might be all together at prayer i wish it had been really so   wife but my dear what satisfaction have you of the truth of all this   husb i am not easily imposed upon my dear i took little notice of the thing from him nor gave him any reason to think i believed him but told him i should talk further with him about it indeed to tell you the truth i could not hold to talk any more to him at that time   wife and how will you be satisfied cannot you enquire of mr m  the clothier or of his wife they are both good conscientious people and what they say may be depended upon i wish you had asked them   husb indeed my dear i have been there this afternoon it is there i have received the full conviction of my own neglect of duty of the wicked lads conversion and of our own boys character the particulars will amaze you if you were to hear them   wife my dear i beg you let me hear it all for the story too nearly concerns me not to have me very much moved with it and besides it is very affecting in it self   husb you shall my dear   here the husband relates the whole discourse between him and the clothier and his wife as in the third dialogue and the account of her discourse with the once wicked but now converted boy wife this is a surprising story what can there be in the boy to do all this have you talked with him your self   husb i have talked a little with him indeed i was so touched with the reproof which his discourse innocently in him for he perceived nothing was to me when he said it grieved him that i did not think him worthy to be reckoned among my family or admitted to the worship of god with me and my children that as i told you before i could not hear to stay and talk with him any longer lest he should perceive it   wife it was very cutting indeed all the parts of it considered   husb the tears stood in my eyes in spite of all my endeavors to the contrary indeed how could i forbear when i knew how i had lived and that i had never troubled my self about any such thing as the worship of god with my family though i know well enough how much it had been my duty to have done it   wife i cannot say but i am glad it has happened so though i think its coming from the boy was so odd are you sure the boy did not do it by way of jeer   husb not in the least the modesty and innocence of the boy and his backwardness to say any thing at all leave no room for such a thought   wife i wish you would talk with him again perhaps you may hear more from him that may explain it all to you   husb i intend it my dear i will go down and talk with him just now   the master goes down and going into a closet which he had near the comptinghouse hears the young man engaged with one or two of the journeymen and the rest of the prentices about the subject in hand upon which he places himself undiscovered and hears the following discourse journeyman well young man what you have been examined about your morning walks i understand i wonder your master found you out no sooner   thomas perhaps if you had told him of it sooner he would have known it sooner   jour you are mistaken in the informer though whoever it was he was much your friend   tho where did the friendship of it lie   jour where why in preventing your ruining your self when young boys like you get such haunts and go out of their masters houses at such hours privately it is very seldom for any good and quickly ruins them   tho that word very seldom implies that you believe it may be sometimes on a good account   jour ay ay sometimes but very seldom i say what good could you be doing at that time of day i wonder   tho that is bringing me to a second examination i have given an account of that to my master and to my father already and they are satisfied why should you take me to task   jour nay that is true i have nothing to do with it i care not what hours you keep or what company you keep or how you ruin your self what is it to me   tho well i am the less obliged to you for that   jour why so you are but when you say your master is satisfied i must beg your pardon for that tho i do not believe a word of that i assure you   eldest pren nay now you wrong him indeed for i assure you my master told me that he was satisfied about it and that i should not hinder him as i had resolved to do by taking out the key of the warehouse door and carrying it up to my master every night   jour nay if my master be satisfied i hadone either there must be some mystery in it then or he has told him some fine story that has deceived him the young rogue has a soft tongue   eld pr i could say more of it if i thought thomas would not think i spoke to expose him   tho your withholding it in such a manner is more my disadvantage another way for now it looks as if it were some very bad thing though i have not been forward to tell it yet i am not so shy of it as to be willing to have it thought a crime   jour i am very glad if it be no crime thomas i never wished you any ill   pren truly it is so far from a crime that if i had known before how it was i would have gone with him if they would have let me for to be free with you upon full examination it appears that he went over to mr  s the clothier night and morning to prayers and my master has examined it to the utmost and is satisfied that it has been nothing else   jour to prayers nay if that is all that is very well indeed and of that presently but you make me smile to hear you say you would have gone along with him    d prentice ay that would make any body laugh i dare say he never said his prayers in his life    st prentice it is no matter for that jonathan nor is that any thing to you if i have not there is the more need to begin now i doubt you have no need to reprove me    d prentice why so    st pr why have not i heard you ridicule all such things and banter the honest man over the way for going to prayers in the cold mornings before it was day and didnt you use to jeer poor thomas here when he came first because when he went to bed at night he would kneel down by his bed side to say his prayers    d pr why now you do as you did before charge me with your own crime did not you do so as well as i and mr m  that is the journeyman too   thomas i committed a greater crime than any of you in that part i wish i had not    st prentice what is that thomas   thomas in letting your wicked scoffing at me prevail with me more wickedly to neglect my duty if i had continued to pray to god as i ought to have done he would soon have made you ashamed of mocking me or have made me not regard it   the lad weeps  st pr indeed thomas i was ashamed of it when i did it and i am more sorry for it now since you tell me it mastered your resolution and made you leave it off i have thought on it a hundred times since that with regret that though i did not pray to god my self i should discourage another for whether i performed it or no my self i never thought the worse of another that did for i knew it was what every one ought to do   tho that makes your fault the worse to neglect it when you knew you ought to have done it and this is just my fault i am in the same case    st pr no thomas there is this difference between you and i you have repented and amended it and i have not   tho i think it almost broke my heart and yet i know not whether to call it repentance or no for what is all my trouble at it in proportion to the crime there may be much sorrow where there is little repentance   jour why thomas has that been the cause you have been so melancholy of late   tho is not that cause enough however i do not say that has been all the cause   jour well he has been ill used by us all i must own that and he does not deserve such usage from us i think we have acted by him like perfect infidels never was poor young man so treated for serving god sure what kind of creatures have we been   prentice i confess i am amazed at it i did not use to do so i know not what possessed me at that time   jour and was this the reason of your going over to mr  s thomas    st pr no no it was because they kept a regular family there and go constantly to prayers night and morning mr  is a very good man every body knows that and i observe every body nay the wickedest people in the parish love that man i never heard any body speak a disrespectful word of him but our jonathan there that laughed at him for rising before day in the cold weather to go to prayers    d pr yes you have heard his own prentice will do the same thing   jour that is a wicked young rogue indeed you have named a pretty youth for our example    d pr you see all his prayers and his being so good a man does him no good he cannot make him a good boy   tho you know nothing of that boy and very little of what you talk of i wish i was as good a boy as that will is now    st pr it is very true that boy is the wonder of this town he is the greatest penitent and is turned the soberest most religious young man that ever was heard of   jour i am amazed at it why then you see jonathan what the having a good master has done    st pr nay that has not been it neither and to do justice though thomas says modestly that he wishes himself as good as william i have a very good account that thomas was the first means of reclaiming him   tho gods grace has been the means and a religious good instructor at home i am incapable to do any thing of that kind his master and mistress have been the instruments he is very happy in coming into such a family   jour but was this really the reason of thomas going over thither so every night and morning    st pr yes it was my master says he has examined it why are you so unbelieving   jour nay for no ill i could not have expected it but i shall love him the better for it as long as i know him i wonder what my master thinks of it or says to it    st pr says i told you didnt i he is very well satisfied in it and ordered me that i should not hinder him   jour god forbid any should hinder him for my part if i was ten times wickeder than i am would never wish to make another be so    d pr you are all growing mighty good of a sudden this fit of religion will be over with you by and by when you come to an alehouse in the town which it seems they haunted too much kates down the street    st pr your eyes shall never see that of me again nor see me at that wicked house again   tho do not undertake for that in your own strength lest you are left to know your self by your fall    st pr i hope god will give me grace to keep that resolution   tho you must seek it then ask and thou shall eceive    st pr i wish i had been in such a house as that clothiers i was never brought up to live as we do here    d pr why cannot our master go to prayers with us as well as that poor man does   jour what for you to laugh at him as you did at the poor clothier and at thomas too    d pr you have all done it as much as i   tho i dont doubt we all fare the worse for t as well those who are not guilty as those who re    d pr how do you mean   tho mean why it is plain enough my mater and mistress go to prayers every night and morning with themselves and the little children and if he did not take us for a scoffing irreligious eprobate pack that would be never the better or it and would but make a jest of it and of im too to be sure he would call us all up but e sees how we live and does not count us worhy to be admitted    st pr are you sure of that thomas   tho sure of it why is there any sober man n the world that calls himself a christian and oes not do it   jour poor thomas thou know but little of he world is there one family in ten that oes nay is there one family in this town that does except the good man over the way ere the clothier   tho yes my father does i never knew him mit it in my life if he was well and our mister does and some that i know in the town ay i know none that do not   jour i am sure i know twenty families in the town that do not and yet call themselves good christians too and i never believed our master did   tho i will never believe such a thing of my master besides have not i heard the little children say to one another they must go up to prayers   jour nay then to be sure he does i am very glad of it i wish he would call us all up   tho no question if my master knew you wished so he would but we dont live as if we desired it i believe that is the reason we are left to live like heathens as we are    st pr i am sorry we have given him so much cause to think so and indeed thomas it is but too true   jour well for all that he might have gone to prayers   tho so he does i tell you but does not think us fit people to join with him   jour why the worse we are have we not the more need of being prayed for   tho but i cannot but say he might have good reason to shut us out that our bad example might not be shown to his children   jour why thou make us worse than heathens boy what do mean do you believe that if my master should come now and say to us all that though he finds we do not regard such things yet that he resolves to go to prayers every night and morning and we may come if we will that we would not all say we would come with all our hearts i am sure i would for one    st pr i am sure i would down on my knees and thank him for it for i am more concerned at seeing how we live now than ever i was   tho i am sure i would thank him and thank god for it too and think it the best day that i ever saw in my life    d pr i have heard all your discourse and have said but little but i will tell you i will never jest with any body for praying to god again while i live i wish my master would begin with us and try   any one may judge how the master who heard all this discourse was moved with it being before affected with the sense of having lived in a total neglect of his duty to god and his family and having thus providentially the great obstruction to his duty removed by hearing all his men servants who he thought refractory and ungovernable declare themselves touched with a sense of their loss in being shut out from the worship of god professing their willingness to join in a religious regulation and their desire of having their master begin it  wherefore coming hastily out of his closet into the place and the young men rising up to be gone he bids them all stay and sit still  i have heard all your discourse says the master and i bless god that i have heard it i am very well pleased with every part of it i do own to you all that it has been a hindrance to my desire of setting up the worship of god in my family that i thought my young men having had their full liberty in the world made no account of such things and might perhaps mock at me for it as i have heard you have done at the poor clothier over the way and though it was my duty to have done it however you had behaved yet i confess it has been such a se to me as  kept me back from what i know to be my duty but since i have providentially heard your discourse upon this subject and that you seem to be sensible of your duty and of your loss in the omission of mine and appear willing to join in a solemn manner in family prayer i will not be wanting to you nor wanting to my self in performing my duty any longer but according to my duty and your desire call you all up together with the rest of my family to worship god and pray to him for his blessing i hope you will convince me you are in earnest by your attendance at that time  the journeyman told him yes for his part he would with all his heart  the first prentice told him that since he had heard him make a promise to thank him upon his knees he would perform it and kneeling down he thanked god that had put it in his heart and thanked his master as he had promised and assured him the very thoughts of it rejoiced his heart  poor thomas the youngest prentice his heart was so full he cried for joy and could not speak a word  the other prentice told his master he was very sorry he had been one of them that had hindered him before but assured him it should be so no more  the good man went up with joy to his wife and giving her an account how his second difficulty was thus providentially removed told her the whole passage the pious lady reioicing at the thing and willing to prompt him on to put his resolution in practice before it might cool and fall off again persuaded him the same evening to call his family together and beginning with reading the scriptures to go to prayer with them which he did and from that time forward he had always sober religious servants and kept a most regular family exactly and constantly performing family worship instructing and catechizing both his children and servants to the great encouragement and increase of true godliness and holy living in that town by his extraordinary example  the end of the fifth dialogue and of the second part part iii the first dialogue at the end of the first part of this work the father of the family having effectually set about reforming his house and brought all his children except his two eldest to conform to his new regulation this part gives something of an historical account of the two refractory rebellious branches of that family viz the eldest son and the eldest daughter the son pursuing the dictates not of his reason but of his passion and having some estate independent of his father gratifies his disgust at his fathers imposing upon him as he calls it and goes abroad to travel his conduct as a pattern or warning to disobedience is followed by continual judgments disasters and distempers till his estate wasted and gone he is brought to humble himself to his father and submit to him however unwillingly and unreformed not as a true penitent but for mere subsistence and for want of bread  this is improved to be instructive of many things both to children and parents   it shows something of the mischievous consequence of leaving estates to children entirely independent of their parents especially where no visible objection lies against the trust being reposed in the parent and tells us that though in some cases it may be necessary to do thus yet it ought to be avoided as much as possible it being in general a fatal obstruction to paternal authority a foundation of childrens refusing instruction and especially of their not bearing reproof besides that oftentimes the consequences are such that the children had better be without such estates   this example warns children that the they may by provision of friends be made independent of their parents they are not thereby discharged of their duty to their parents in the least and great judgments from heaven generally follow those who totally cast off the subjection they owe to their parents on that account   first or last a contempt of paternal instruction is nothing else but laying in a great stock for repentance   the daughter who of the two appeared the most obstrnate and could not bear the restraint which her fathers new discipline obliged her to got leave of her father and mother to go and live with her aunt her fathers sister who lived at some distance from them in london where though the family was strictly religious as is before noted yet being there but as a guest she could better comply with it than at home where she had been used to liberties and left to her self and where the change being by constraint was the harder for her to stoop to  her aunt a sober religious gentlewoman and her uncle a grave pious good christian treated her with great kindness and courtesy and as she had been very well bred good manners obliged her to return it here an unforeseen providence gave a turn to the whole course of her life the young lady being of a good natural temper a modest handsome carriage and an agreeable person her uncles eldest son by a former wife fell in love with her and by consent of his father a proposal of marriage was made between them and this part is made public in this manner because the circumstances of this marriage have some thing in them very instructing to young married people to let them see how much it is their unquestioned and indispensable duty to make the good of one another souls be their principal care after marriage how far it may be the duty of a husband to instruct his wife and in what manner and likewise a wife her husband how far such a design may be consistent with the tenderest affection and how to be managed with decency respect and the due endearments of a loving and tender relation and in short gives a brief scheme of the relative duties of a married state  this compleats the economy of this work the first part relating to a paternal duty such as authority and discipline in a father among his children the second to the duty of heads of families viz masters of servants and how servants ought to submit to instruction and family regulation and this third part principally regarding the duty of husbands and wives to exhort and persuade entreat instruct and by all gentle means if possible prevail upon and engage one another to a religious holy life and to set up a foundation of religious worship in their families  the introduction or history of this marriage is not material to our present discourse only some thing of the characters of the persons and families more than what has been said already may be proper to prevent digressions in the particular cases that come after and these characters or descriptions will be found in the first dialogue and upon the following occasion  the young gentleman was the eldest son of the family and heir to his father who had a good estate he had been bred a gentleman had a liberal education was a handsome agreeable person and which was beyond all was like his father a sober virtuous studious and religious gentleman this person having been conversant with this young lady by the accident of their being in the house and as will appear she being very agreeable to him however engaged by the defect of education in gayety and mirth and hard to be weaned especially by violence as had been her case her disposition i say being soft and of an extraordinary sweetness in her temper as will be seen in the process of these sheets there appeared a particular suitableness in them one to another  the young gentleman had entertained an opinion of her being capable to make him a very good wife though he was not ignorant of her being wild and gay in her humor yet he had great proofs by daily conversation with her of her being virtuous and modest even to the utmost nicety the goodness of her temper and agreeableness of her person had engaged his affections to her and he had no reason to believe that she had any aversion to him whereupon he broke his design to his father who knowing his sons sobriety and serious inclination was the less inclined to thwart his affections and the less afraid to venture him in the matter of the young ladys humor though it was thought to be a little extravagant and gay as above so the father after some consideration calling him aside one morning spoke to him to this purpose  son i have considered what you said to me about your desire to court your cousin i am very willing to gratify your inclinations in any thing that may have a prospect of making you easy and happy and shall be as kind to you with respect to estate as you can expect but you know she is gay and wild loves company and mirth and that it was her impatience of restraint in these things that made the breach between her and her father and if she should continue that humor after you have married her i doubt you will have but an uncomfortable life with her however i do not think her of an ill disposition as to her natural temper and perhaps she may be prevailed with by good usage and kind treatment which i hope is all the method you propose to take with her to alter her notions of things i think she seems to be a little come off from some part of it since she came into our family i would have you seriously consider what hazard you run in it and especially that the venture is for your life and as i have no other objection against it i shall agree or not agree to it as your inclination shall lead you only not forgetting to hint to you what i hope you do not forget viz that you ask council and direction of him who has said commit thy way unto the lord and he shall direct thy steps   this discourse was too affectionate and obliging not to move a son of so much sense and goodness as he was which he expressed as became him in a dutiful and obliging manner and having after further consideration continued his inclinations and not so only but made some advances of that kind to the young lady her self it became necessary in the next place to have it moved to her father and mother and as they were the relations of the old lady motherinlaw to the young gentlewoman this occasioned her at her husbands desire to go to her sister the young lady mother and break the matter to her where after a little other discourse needless to our purpose the mother began with her and so introduce the following dialogue between the two sisters mother and aunt to the young gentlewoman  mo dear sister i believe you do not doubt your being always welcome to me and yet i can not say that i am so glad to see you come hither as i used to be   aunt why what is the matter sister if my coming gives you any uneasiness i will be gone again   mo my heart misgives me and i always expect something of evil when you come   aunt evil about what i beseech you   mo why about this unhappy girl at your house i ever think you have some dreadful story or other to tell me of her   aunt what can your worst thoughts lead you to fear of her   mo dear sister what can i not fear for her when i see her treat her father in such a manner who has loved her so affectionately and used her so gently in all this matter and now she has in a manner gone away from him purely on an account which all the rest of the family are thankful for and what any child of sense or virtue would have loved and valued him for as for her usage of me i take no notice of it at all i forgive her all that   aunt well but you must wait a little her temper may be wrought upon by degrees to be sensible of her mistake i hope sister you dont look on her as lost they go far indeed that never return   mo but have you no bad news now about her did not you come now on purpose to make some complaint of her to me pray put me out of my pain   aunt i wish you would tell me what you are afraid of about her   mo nay there is nothing so bad that i am not afraid of what can i expect when god has so far forsaken her as to suffer her to fly in her fathers face and that purely because he would have her live a sober religious life pray how does she behave her self   aunt sister i will be very plain with you i am very far you may be sure from approving her behavior to her father or to you but really she discovers nothing in her behavior among us that gives the least ground to be afraid of her on any other account   mo has she no company that comes to her or that she goes abroad to   aunt none at all she has not gone out of our doors since she came thither nor has any body come to her that i know of but your own family such as your own servants or children   mo well thon good manners obliges her to do more with you than duty would do here for when i told her that she should go no more to the plays nor visit or go to the park a sabbath days she told me to my face she would not be confined   aunt i see nothing but she is very conformable with us   mo i pray god she may come to a sight of her own folly when ever she humbles her self to god i am very sure he will bring her to humble her self to her father for she treated him very rudely and unbecoming what to do with her i know not she can never expect to come into her fathers doors again but as a penitent and that with very good satisfaction of her being sincerely so   aunt i know the substance of the breach but i never knew the last part i was going once or twice to talk of it to her but i found it disordered her and set her into a fit of crying and i am unwilling to discompose her   mo why sister you know the story it self and upon what the difference began viz about restraining her and her brother from going to the park a sabbath days going to the play and reading plays and the like and you have heard how the first sabbath day after this thing was debated among us when her father began that happy reformation in his family which blessed be god is strictly kept up to this day she and her brother contrived to go out of the way we thought indeed they had gone to the park in defiance of their father and my heart aked i confess for them for their father was so provoked at the thought of it that he had resolved they should neither of them have ever come into his house again till they had humbled themselves and acknowledged both their sins against god and their contempt of their father and he had ordered all the servants to keep them out if they came to the gate till they called him to them but happily for us all they were it seems only walking in the limetree walk behind our garden and just as we were enquiring about it they appeared walking together through the garden entirely ignorant of what had passed however their father not fully satisfied before they came in went to them himself into the garden and strictly examined them about it as they had the good hap to satisfy their father that they had been no further than the limetrees so they satisfied themselves by seeing their father in the greatest rage they had ever known him in i say they satisfied themselves of what they had to expect if it had been otherwise and this put them upon reflecting what course they had to take where dear sister who can but observe that in all their consultations god did not give them the grace once to think of submitting themselves to their father and conforming themselves to the most reasonable desire that ever father made to his children viz only to restrain wicked liberties and company and attend the worship of god in the family but on the contrary for five weeks that they stayed at home after that they never appeared at prayer time but kept up stairs pretending either not to be well or not dressed or not up and such like excuses till they were a shame to the whole family and besides this their father observed that notwithstanding his express command they went both of them twice to the play house the very same week as if on purpose to insult him and let him see they valued not what he either said or would say to them   aunt that was very provoking indeed pray what said my brother to it   mo if it had not been for me sister he had turned them both out of door that very week   aunt indeed i could not have blamed him if he had i think he had done them but justice   mo i am sure he had done himself justice sister but i considered their good more than they did themselves and that to have cast them entirey off had been to precipitate their ruin and throw them into the very mouth of all manner of temptation and representing this to their father it convinced him so far as not to proceed to that extremity with them but he had told them in so many words by me that since they had declined his authority he would decline their conversation that those that would not join with him in his duty to god should not enjoy with him the bounty of god and they that would not kneel with him to pray should not sit with him to eat and so he flatly forbad them his sight   aunt i think he was very just in it i wonder how it was possible they could behave so   mo you may be sure it could not hold long thus and at best it made a very melancholy family among us at last my son truly came to his father and in few words told him he was sorry he had disobliged him so much but as he saw no remedy he told his father he came to ask his consent to a resolution he had taken to travel his father said readily there was no need for his consent if it was a resolution he supposed he father came to take his leave of him the foolish boy for though he is a man in growth he showed the boy and the fool in his behavior told his father he was resolved to go but had rather have his consent than not   aunt he acted weakly in that and rudely too pray how did my brother take it   mo truly with more composure than i could have expected he told him that as his father he could not but be sorry to see him push on his own ruin but as it was his duty to exercise the authority of a father he not only refused to consent but forbid him to go and withal bid him remember what he had said to him before viz that if he set his foot out of his house upon this account he should never set his foot in it again but as a penitent   aunt what could he say to that   mo truly he said little but told his father he was resolved to go and so withdrew and the same evening without acquainting me with it or taking any further leave he went his way   aunt went his way sister why whither did he go i am sure he is not gone abroad now for he has been several times at our house to see his sister within this week   mo no he is not gone yet we know that he has lodgings at westminster and yesterday he wrote his father a letter pretending to beg his pardon for going abroad without his consent you know sister he has about  00 l a year which his uncle  left him so he thinks himself his own master   aunt alas how long will that last for a foolish gay fellow that expects to make a figure and look like a gentleman abroad   mo not long to be sure i expect he will see his way through it very quickly   aunt why i hear he has bought a commission i suppose he has disposed of some of it already that way   mo it is very likely but he acquaints me with nothing i expect we shall hear of him again when it is all spent   aunt it may be so indeed   mo well if he may but come home like the prodigal i shall not think that estate ill lost i shall be glad of his poverty for the sake of his penitence   aunt well and what said my niece to all this   mo truly she kept her chamber as i told you above a month and hardly ever was seen in the family i cannot imagine what folly possessed them both she cried incessantly converst with no body would scarce speak if i came to her at last she fell very sick as well she might sure as i told her one day no girl was ever such a mourner for the loss of her wicked pleasures   aunt childhood and youth are vanity   mo i took what care i could of her and especially to remove the discontents of her mind for we all believed she would die i asked her if she would see her father nay her father who i think verily wept for her more than i did would i believe have been tempted to have broke his resolutions and have been reconciled to her and would fain have been so far reconciled as to see her but when i did but name him she burst out into a fit of crying and would not so much as hear of it but her brother her brother if her brother might come again she would see him well such was the tenderness of her father to her who most passionately loved her that he would have given way to have her brother come again but when he came to be told of it he insolently answered he would not come unless his father would send for him this you may be sure was provoking nay sister it moved me so at them both that though he is my own son and my eldest i care not if i never see him more except in the terms as above and as for her i committed her to gods mercy and concerned my self no more about her other than to take care she wanted nothing   aunt i never heard the like in my life pray what said my brother   mo truly he was not so provoked at it as i thought he would have been i mean it did not throw him into a passion he retired into his closet and in an hour or two came down again composed in his temper but i could see like that of job his grief was great and indeed from that time i thought it my duty rather to comfort my husband than my daughter while she continued ill he was very uneasy and impatient but when she recovered again he was better satisfied and thought less of her our next consideration was what was to be done with her for our family looked very odly we had authority quite turned up side down among us instead of her father refusing to be reconciled to her who had been the guilty person and had provoked him to the utmost truly she pretends resentment and refuses to be reconciled to her father   aunt it was strange usage i confess i did not think she had been of such a spirit   mo when she was recovered and was well enough to go abroad instead of going to church to give god thanks for restoring her health she wanted to go to a young wild companion of hers my lady lighthead that they might go to the play together i could not bear the thoughts of this with any patience but being not willing to disturb her father with it because i knew it would exasperate him i took upon me to tell her of my own authority that she should not go at which she said very smartly to me she had but one request more to make me as long as she lived and what is that said i that you will let me go to service says she very scornfully dear sister you may judge how cutting this usage has been to us who so dearly loved this child as that we distinguished her in our affections from the rest of our children and that even to a fault   aunt that kind of love is generally so returned sister and providence suffers it to be so as a just punishment for an ill grounded and unequal dividing our affections among our children in which case we may read our sin in our punishment but i pray what said you to her i know not i confess what i should have done or said to it i believe i should have been apt to have told her that her petition was granted   mo if i had consulted my own passions rather than her welfare i should have done so too for i was not without resentment enough but i saw sister she was rash and foolish and i was not so willing to let her ruin her self as she was to do it   aunt but pray what did you say to her   mo i told her it was pity a petition that had so much ingratitude in it should not find resentment enough in me to grant it that however i would give her a week to cool her thoughts in and in that time i would have her consider seriously of what she had desired and if she would say then calmly and deliberately that she desired it still i would acquaint her father with it and it should be granted only i bad her remember the condition which her father had made with her brother viz that if ever he set his foot out of the house in this quarrel he should never have leave to set his foot in it again but as a penitent and she might depend upon it that both her father and i too would make the same condition with her at parting and so i left her to conside of it   aunt i suppose she was wiser when she had thought of it   mo yes about   or   days after she asked me if i would give her leave to go to her aunt meaning your house i told her yes i would consent to that if her father would agree to it so a her request i asked her father to let her come to your house and he was willing enough in hope your family would enure and acquaint her wit good things but he would not consent till she had promised solemnly that she would keep  company nor go to any plays or bring printe plays home to your house and she promised she would not so we sent her to you but i dare sa she will not keep her word   aunt well she is very welcome to my house and i assure you as i said before she carries he self very modestly and handsomely among us   mo nay she is of a very good temper and a obliging carriage enough she wants neither wi or manners she wants nothing sister but god grace   aunt all our children love her company etreamly and some of them more than i have tol you of yet   mo and do you think she has kept her promi with us about plays and my lady   aunt i dare say she has as i said before f we see no body come near her but her broth sometimes and she tells us in compliment she is exceedingly diverted with the company of  daughters so that she has quite left off a conversation   mo and does she conform to your family orders sister and appear at family worship constantly   aunt indeed sister she must do it in our house or we would not keep her there nay none of our children would keep her company or endure her if she did not for i thank god we have no contemners of religion among us but i must do my niece that justice that i never perceived the least reluctance in her to any thing that was good in my life i mean at our house nay sister we have a mighty opinion of her being very sober and you will say so too when i tell you really what i came hither about at this time   mo what is that sister   aunt why i am come to ask her of you and my brother for my son   mo dear sister we are but in a sorry circumstance as to her to be jested with your son is a pretty youth and god may give her more grace by that time he is fit for a wife if she is fit to deserve him you might be sure we should not be against it but their age would be unequal and they are very near a kin sister besides those things are remote i have no heart to talk of marrying her i dare not wish any family that i have a value for to venture upon her   aunt you quite mistake me sister it is not my own son that i mean but my soninlaw my husbands son i assure you i am not in jest   mo i am surprised to hear you talk so sister   aunt well do not be surprised i must talk with you about it in earnest   moth dear sister do not entertain such a thought i am sure i can never agree to it for your sake you will but injure your own peace and my brother your husband will think you and we are confederate to draw him in besides you know he has a good estate settled upon him and as for this girl she has so disobliged her father i cannot in conscience desire him to do any thing for her especially while she is in this state of obstinacy and rebellion how can it be expected therefore if you love your own family peace i would advise you seriously do not think of such a thing besides sister your soninlaw is a sober virtuous religious gentleman you see what a mad desperate furious spirit this girl is of a professed enemy to all that is good one that is broke from her father merely because he would reform her you cannot in conscience propose such a match to a gentleman that deserves so well i would not have a hand in making him so miserable for the world   aunt sister sister you speak very honestly and like your self but you quite mistake the case you take this for a project of my own to advance your daughter and oblige you and my own family but you are quite wrong the young gentleman has made the motion to his father and his father to me so that i only come of the errand it is all matter of their own choice the young man first and the father consenting at his request   mo i am amazed at it do they know the breach that has been among us   aunt yes every word of it   mo dear sister do not deceive me i will never give my consent so much as to speak a word farther about it unless they are told the worst of it all for i will be no cheat they shall never say hey were deceived by me though it be for my own daughter   aunt indeed sister i have not deceived them or i talked with my soninlaw two hours and old him every word i knew of it all neither ould it be hid for every one in our family nows it she does not deny it her self   aunt as i told you she always breaks out into ears and we dont care to grieve her so we orbear it as much as possible but she knows that we all know of it besides you will be satisfied by  reason you shall hear presently that she has ome sense of her circumstances for that when we have talked to her of marrying and named uch a one or such another she would say to us why do we talk to her of marrying that has no forune and that her father will give her nothing that e never expects he will be reconciled to her again r do any thing for her and the like and then t always ends in tears and that makes us break ff the story   mo upon what foundation then sister can his proposal be made to her father it is certain that though no family could be more agreeable to s than yours yet it cannot be expected he should ear any thing of it until she comes and humbles er self and acknowledges her fault indeed no body can propose it to him before upon any reasonable foundation she cannot expect her father should seek her again who did it so unexpectedly before and was rejected with such abominable nsolence when she did not know too but the was upon the brink of the grave   aunt i canfess that was a hard case and i know not what to say to it   mo besides sister i cannot think the young gentleman would be so mad to think any more of her if he knew what i have told you about her to day and i am resolved if he will have her nothing shall be hid from him that justice requires should be told   aunt indeed sister i have been as faithful to him as you can be except only what you told me just now he does not at all justify her conduct but says he believes she has other principles now and if my brother will give his consent to let him have her he says he will come and ask pardon for her   mo my husband is above in his closet if you please i will call him and hear what he says   aunt with all my heart   she sends a servant to call her husband and he comes immediately mo my dear here is an odd piece of news to be told you   husb no good i doubted as soon as i saw who was the messenger well sister let us know it however let it be as bad as it will pray what mad thing has my daughter done at your house   mo when we fear evil we always believe it your fears push you too fast my dear   husb in the ordinary course of gods providence i can expect no good to befall her she is manifestly under the judicial hand of god hardened to incur his curse and to be a curse to her parents   aunt gods ways are unsearchable sometimes our falls are made the first steps to our recovery and the very particular sins that we commit are the introduction to our deliverance from the dominion of sin in general therefore we can not conclude our selves reprobate or any body else till we see them past the reach of sovereign grace   husb i wish as heartily for her as any one can do that she may repent but i cannot say that i expect it she has gone a dreadful length for one of her age   aunt she may yet be a happy convert for all that we have instances of worse than her that have died martyrs for him whose name they had blasphemed   husb if ever she return her repentance must be very bitter   aunt he that gives repentance always proportions the degrees of it   husb but what is this account you have to give me i doubt there is nothing of repentance in it i expect rather to hear she is ruined   mo no no my dear thank god there is no bad news of her i had the same fears for her not doubting but her brother and she had pursued their usual trade of company and the playhouse but my sister assures me of the contrary   aunt indeed brother i would have been very faithful to you if it had been so i would not have hid it from you besides i should not have let her stayed in my house but my news is quite of another kind sister pray tell it to my brother   the mother tells the whole story as is before related fa you are all mad   aunt what do you mean by mad you must xplain your self or we shall think you are so   husb i cannot but think you all mad to go to ruin a gentleman at once i will have no hand in so icked a thing   aunt i have no more to do than to carry your nswer   husb i have more respect for him i assure you and should think it the worst action that ever i did in my life if i should be instrumental to bring such a young man as he is into such a snare i cannot do a thing so dishonorable   aunt why what do you take your daughter to be   husb to be a contemner of god a despiser of religion a rebel to her father given over to vanity and obstinate in all these i have by sad experience found in her what other evils these may produce god only knows i should be sorry my cousin  should know by experience nor can i be so unjust as to consent to his joining himself to one of my children especially to one who having no sense of filial relation can have little or none of a social relation one that can be ungrateful to her father and insolent to a tender mother can never suitably return the kindness of an obliging husband   aunt he knows the whole case and all that you would have him know i shall honestly tell him for i will no more deceive him than you would   husb does he know that she is now in actual rebellion against god in defyance of her father and mother and that she has laid me under an absolute necessity of having nothing at all to do with her or with him when he shall have taken her   aunt yes he knows all that   fa and what says he to it   aunt he says he will come and ask you forgiveness for her   fa repentance is never done by proxy sister a true penitent is never backward to come himself   aunt why it is true as he says that for her to come now and submit her self is only sending her home to cry for a husband or making her appear a penitent for a portion he desires your consent that he shall marry your daughter and leaves all the rest to you   fa i can have no concern with her nor assent or dissent to or from any thing that concerns her any more than if she was no relation to me till she returns to her duty and appears truly and sincerely penitent for her crime she knows i am obliged to act thus and i think i owe so much to god to religion and to the duty of a parent   aunt you will not however force her repentance brother i believe she is sensible she is wrong and i can see it plain enough but you know brother repentance is the gift of god only i dare say your daughter would be glad to ask you pardon and the affectionate concern she speaks of it with makes me think so but to say she shall be a true penitent toward god for her offense against him neither you or i or any body alive can answer for that would you be willing i should bring her to acknowledge her offense against you   fa sister i would have no solicitor in such a case when her repentance is sincere god will bring her upon her knees to him and then she will soon come to me also and that is the way i desire to have her brought   aunt well i am persuaded the sooner she marries my son inlaw the sooner she will be brought to repentance i am satisfied he will be no hindrance to her in the way of her duty   fa nor she any forwarding to him in the way of his duty alas what a family will there be among them how will she the mistress of a family comply to set up the worship of god in her house that left her fathers house because she would not submit to serve god there how shall she instruct her children that would bear no instruction her self and ridiculed it in her brothers and sisters who were better inclined if he is told all this faithfully and sincerely i know he is a religious sober gentleman and he can never so far forget himself as to think any more of such a womans being his wife   aunt you are very hard to be wooed methinks   fa my difficulties are just and honorable it shall never be said that i first turned my daughter out of doors and then let him marry her it is in justice to him that i say all this had she been deserving and dutiful and were i not satisfied in my conscience that she will be his ruin i should not have said so much nor made the least objection to the proposal   aunt if i had come of this message before my niece had disobliged you i believe you had thought it a good settlement for your daughter   fa had it been before she had discovered her self to be what i think will ruin and destroy him i mean as to the happiness of a relation i acknowledge i should have thought very well of it and now i refuse it only as i think she is not fit to make him a wife   aunt but if we will venture you will not oppose it   fa what mean ye by we if both the young man and his father are plainly and honestly told what i say and that i say it or will give me leave to tell it them my self and will venture after that i have no more to say but as i said first i will have no hand in it i can have nothing to say to her or about her till she alters her behavior she is you know out of my hands   aunt well i have no more to say but i believe we shall make a wedding of it among us   and perhaps she may be brought to her duty afterward your negative is not against her being married to him but against his being married to her which if they will venture we reckon we have your consent as far as you can give it   fa i will have no blame if she proves all that is wicked to him   aunt i will clear you of that effectually i hope she may be yet a good woman and make him a good wife   fa he runs more risque than a granadier in storming a counterscarp   mo the grace of god may reclaim her i grant it though we see but small hopes of it however sister i engage you upon your word to give a faithful account hoth to your son and to his father of all i have told you of her conduct how she has treated her parents and how it may be expected she will treat her husband and if after being thus fairly warned by us you will all venture we are honorably discharged you see we have no objection on your sons account do as you please only let it be acknowledged that we have hid nothing from you   the end of the first dialogue the second dialogue as in the former dialogue when the aunt came to treat of a marriage for the daughter we had of course the mother telling us the history of the conduct of her son and daughter after their coming home from the garden from their walk under the limetrees to the time that both of them so rudely left their father so in this dialogue which is between the brother and sister we shall from their own mouths have an account of the measures they both took afterward first as to her part till just before she went to be married and secondly as to his part till just before he went into the army and to his travels as he called them what became of both afterward we shall see in a part by it self  the brother being now preparing for his journey or voyage and the sister for her wedding they mutually desired to converse together about those things before they went on and the brother making his sister a visit their first conversation produces the following dialogue  the sister begins with a sigh sister well brother what is to become of us two methinks we are two odd people in the world   bro truly so we are we look like two exiles or people rather gone into voluntary banishment from their own country   sister i will tell you i have thought rather we are like two malecontent courtiers who being disgusted at the treatment they have received have left the court and desire to retire as they call it into the country   brother i think so too and i believe it is with them as it is with us or with me at least that they generally wish they had not done it afterward   sister why do you repent then   bro i dont say i repent i think i have been ill used and that i gave no reason for such violent treatment but i cannot say i am glad it has happened there are many things which make my present condition less pleasant to me than it was before   sister well if you repent why dont you go home as the prodigal did no doubt the old man would kill the fatted calf to have you again   bro ay but i ant come to feeding of hogs yet and eating of husks i dont know what i might do if it were come to that   sister nor never will i hope there is no danger of that brother   bro i hope not yet i must needs say ever since i have fixed my self for my travels my heart has been very heavy and i dream every night the strangest things   sister what need you be so concerned you have a good estate of your own you are as well as if you were at home   brother no not so well neither for to go back to your court simily the discontened courtier retires to his estate in the country and there he can live very well but still five or six thousand pounds a year at court made a very good addition and made him a great deal better so that he is always a loser by quitting his post and so it is with me sister if i had stayed with my father or gone abroad with his consent i had been subsisted at his expenses or perhaps traveled at his charge and then my own estate would have increased besides my father sure would not have disinherited me for no other crime but merely having a little estate of my own but now i suppose he has done with me entirely and what is my estate compared to living like a gentleman   sister i did not think you had been troubled with the hyppo brother of all things why you are quite cast down i never saw the like of you what must i say then if you talk thus i that have nothing at all but am kept here of charity   bro no i have not the hyppo i am not cast down but i tell you what thoughts i have sometimes   sister yes and dreams too you say what do they come from but from the hyppo i believe you have got the vapors pray what did you dream   bro i dream a thousand things not worth naming but however one dream was so particular i cannot but tell it you though perhaps you will banter me for it too but i will tell it you because you were a little concerned in it and acted a part in it   sister pray what was it   bro why you know i suppose that i have bought me a commission   sister i know you said that you intended it but i did not know you had done it i would not have had you done that methinks i would not have had you been a soldier on many accounts what need have you to go into the army to be knocked in the head   bro well that is not the case now well talk of that another time i have done it   sister but what is that to your dream   bro why the same night that i had bought my commission i had this ugly dream it seemed to me that i had been some time in the army and had met with many wounds and misfortunes but at last i had one of my arms shot off and had been a long while under cure and sick so that i was reduced to a mere skelleton   sister all hyppo all hyppo it is nothing in the world else   bro well but this was not all for i was reduced to such mean circumstances and so poor that i had not necessaries and was in the miserablest condition that ever you heard of and after suffering a great many hardships i wrote to my father to relieve me and he    sister refused i warrant that i know it is like him   bro no no he did not do so neither you run too fast he sent me money enough to bring me over to england and i was brought in a coach to his door but he would not let me be brought in but ordered me to be carried to a neighbors house where after an ordinary manner i was taken care of and supplied with necessaries though meanly enough and this part put me into the greatest passion that i thought if any thing had been in my way i would have murdered my self   sister it was very barbarous usage indeed the more like the rest of his doings with us but where is the part i was to act in this melaucholly scene   bro why good and generous like your self you no sooner heard of my condition but you came to visit me   sister and what could i do what condition was i in to help you was i reconciled to my father if you thought so i believe your dream will never come to pass   bro yes yes you were married kept your coach and lived gallantly you came to me very cheerful and gay but very grave in your carriage you told me you were very sorry for my condition but you were sensible we had both been in the wrong and had pulled down the heavy judgment of god upon me by our disobedient carriage to our father   sister could i be such a brute   bro nay you spoke kindly enough to me otherwise and gave me a handful of gold for my supply but talked mighty religiously to me about our usage of my father   sister it is a sign it was a dream religion and a great deal of gold alas brother it is all a dream to be sure i shall never have much of either of them but go on   bro i asked you why my father carried it so severe to me now when he saw me in that condition you said i might remember my father had solemnly engaged himself that if i went away i should never set my foot within his doors again but as a penitent and unless he was satisfied that i acknowledged my error i could not expect he would break those engagements nor would he see me till he had an answer to it in positive terms i asked you how then he came to be reconciled to you for his resentment was equal at us both and we were both in the same fact   sister ay and what said i to this   bro you told me with tears that you were not ashamed to say you had heartily repented of it and had asked forgiveness of god and your father a thousand times that you were sensible we had both offended god and abused the tenderness of the best of fathers and you never had done an action which gave you so much peace in your life as when you came upon your knees to my father and begged his pardon in the face of all the family and if i had any sense of religion or of natural duty you hoped i would do so too and that you came on purpose to persuade me to it   sister this is not a dream only but a dream that i am sure will never come to pass at least my part of it and i hope yours will not either is there any more of it   bro you said a great deal more to the same purpose that i cannot repeat   sister i hope you minded none of it   bro i cannot say that it has made no impressions upon me in spite of all my opposition to it for i hate to give way to such things   sister how did it end did you submit   bro i do not remember either that i submitted or that my father did any thing for me i remember this though that your arguments did not move me much and your example less i could not see much reason for penitence and i could not be hypocrite enough to counterfeit it and i bad you tell my father if i had offended him i was very sorry and asked his pardon but you told me you feared that would not be sufficient so you went away and i remained as miserable as i was before till i awaked and was very glad it was but a dream   sister dear brother i dont value dreams and of all dreams such a wild one as this which i am satisfied can never come to pass but i will tell you what use i will make of it and that is to desire you to make it impossible to come to pass   bro how is that   sister by resolving not to go into the army   bro that cannot be it is too late now   sister that is as much as to say there is a fate upon you and you must go by the same rule of fatal necessity which some people harp much upon all your dream may be under a necessity of coming to pass   bro it may be so for ought i know   sister you give me the vapors with but thinking of it   bro what can i do how can i help it now   sister why i tell you how you may help it do not go   bro but i tell you i have bought a troop of dragoons   sister what then you may sell it again   brother that is not honorable i should be laughed at   sister you have no occasion in the world to act thus you have an estate and may live happily and settle your mind what may come this way no body can tell the other way you were out of danger this way your dream may come good for ought i know   bro now you have got the hyppo sister   sister why such a dream and such a circumstance is enough to give any body the vapors i cannot think of your going to be murdered in the army if it had been my lot and i had been a man there had been some sense in it   she weeps bro why you any more than me   sister why because you have an estate as i told you before i have nothing at all but am turned out of my fathers house and am kept here in charity as it were   bro charity why i hear you are going to be married   sister married who do you think will have me without any portion   bro why i hear young mr  my aunts soninlaw courts you   sister there has been something talked of about it indeed but that was as i suppose if this breach had not happened as it has he knows better than to take me and if it had not i should have known better than to have had him   bro why as to the last i think you are wrong he is a very pretty gentleman has a very good estate and you have been acquainted with his humor you know he is a sober sensible good tempered man   sister ay brother but you know sir anthony   bro but you know sister on the other hand sir anthonys character is so bad and his estate but indifferent and entangled too so that you had no room to think that my father though you and he had not differed would ever have been brought to like it nor would he have been in the right if he had for sir anthony could have made you no settlement and besides he is a rake i wonder you could fancy him   sister well all that is over now i am a fitter match for my uncles coachman than for my uncles eldest son   bro that is all hyppo too sister prithee be as free with me as i am with you tell me that case i know something of it i know you may have him if you will notwithstanding all your circumstances as for the family quarrel he knows of it and yet he is so in love with you he will take you whether you have any portion or no and venture reconciling your father afterward i think he offers fair   sister indeed he said so to me which was very obliging i confess   bro what could you say to him in return   sister i told him i would not do him so much harm i was too much his friend   bro that was a mock friendship and what he did not thank you for i suppose what else could you say   sister i told him very plainly i would not be so much in debt to any husband as to have him take me without a portion i would not put it into a husbands power to reproach me with having had nothing with me   bro come tell me the whole discourse now i know you was able to keep him at arms end a great while with your tongue   sister you are mistaken in me and more in him i assure you   bro go on and tell me the utmost opposition you could make of that kind   sister no as you served me about your dreams so i will do now with you i will not trouble you with those single banters which were of no use but i will tell you the main debate because you are a little concerned in it too as i was in your dream   bro with all my heart   sister why after he had two or three times proposed marriage to me and my aunt had pressed me to a serious consideration of it i took the liberty to speak my mind very freely to him one night and to her too in short i made my aunt downright angry with me but i could get nothing from him but what i confess was kinder than as i told him i ever intended to deserve and what was so very obliging that i confess i think my self very rude to him i wonder he could bear it   bro i know he is a most obliging good humoured gentleman and you ought not to have used him ill   sister well i used him ill enough for all that i asked him first if he knew the occasion of my being at their house he said yes he did i told him i did not believe it   bro that was rude indeed it was unmannerly sister   sister no i was not rude that way neither i did not give him the lie but i went on immediately i told him that he might perhaps know that it was a breach between my father and me but did not suppose as i did that it was a breach that was impossible ever to be made up he looked a little surpised at that and said nothing but my aunt took me up short and said dont say so niece i hope it shall easily be made up no madam said i it can never be made up i thought you all went upon a wrong notion and therefore it was that i said i did not believe it when mr  said he knew the affair of the breach   bro but why would you lay it down so positively that it could never be made up   sister why i told them plainly my father thought me guilty of an unpardonable fault and i thought my self guilty of no fault art all my father thought me disobedient and i thought him unnatural my father had vowed never to receive me without repentance and i had resolved never to repent and so it was impossible we could be reconciled   bro that was laying it down very plainly indeed what could they say   sister my aunt was very warm with me indeed i thought she would have been downright angry at my saying i would never repent she alleged i ought not to say so in any case whatsoever i was as warm as she and told her if i was convinced i was in the wrong i should repent of course of that or any thing else if i was not i could never repent by violence that fathers might sin against children as well as children against parents i would have said more but i broke out into tears and could not talk   bro you were too warm you would have argued it better if you had been calmer   sister she moved me by seeming to condemn me as i thought without arguing but when she saw me concerned she said she was sorry to see things come to such height and that if it was so she was almost of my mind that it would never be made up after which she added what vexed me worse than all the rest these words viz what then do you intend to do child this nettled me worse as i said than all for it looked as if she had said i was not to expect to live always there at which i returned a little too short i confess go away madam when ever you are a weary of me   bro fie sister you should not have done so for i know she is very kind to you and loves you very well   sister that is true but i was vexed however i asked her pardon afterward as you shall hear   bro how did she take it then   sister calmly and obligingly enough i see cousin said she you are moved i will take nothing ill from you and therefore we will say no more of it now i hope ways may be found to accommodate things between you and your father still and i will be very glad to be instrumental to bring it to pass for you for your own sake   bro that was kind and very much like her for she is a very good woman   sister it was so and moved me so much the other way that i went to her immediately and kissed her and asked her pardon for being so rude to her and would have kneeled but she would not let me   bro and was the young gentleman there to see all this   sister yes he was and then it was that as i said he behaved so very obligingly to me he told his mother for he seemed to speak to her rather than to me that he had found out a way effectually to reconcile my father and me if i would approve of it i told him i could not but approve of any reasonable way to be reconciled to my father for no body could suppose it was pleasant to me to be turned out of my fathers house be looked upon like a vagabond and having no fortune or subsistence be left to go to service or be kept as it were upon charity he turned short to me upon this and said you know madam the offers of marriage i have made to you your aunt my kind mother here knows i am sincere in the proposal if you accept me let all the breach lie on me if when your father and i debate it he insists that you are in the wrong i will ask him forgiveness in your stead and i doubt not to prevail upon him to accept of it if you do not appear in the wrong and yet he should be obstinate i will endeavor to make up the loss of a father to you by doing every thing i can to make you forget the affliction that is past and i assure you i shall never enquire whether he will give you any portion or no   bro was it possible for you to answer any thing to so kind a proposal when made in such serious terms certainly you could not banter him than sister as you did before   sister no i did not banter him i answered him thus i told him that his offer was too much for him to make and too much for me to refuse without an apology for not making him a suitable return but that he and i yet differed about the main question viz what it was my father and i parted about and perhaps he and i should part about the same for if before hand i knew that he was against my part then he was not able to be an advocate but only took upon him to bear the ignominy of a submission for me which was a work i was not willing to put upon him and a debt i was not willing to owe him that i had too much respect for him to suffer him to do the first and too little to load my self with the obligation of the last that on the other hand if he justified me and believed my father in the wrong all the thoughts of reconciling of my father were at an end that as to taking me without it i told him as i told you just now that i seemed a fitter match for one of his fathers footmen than for his fathers eldest son and had too much respect for the family to fill up such a place upon such mean conditions   bro but he might have answered all that by telling you he took all that part upon himself   sister he did so and told me he would make the same settlement upon me as if i had my fathers blessing and a portion and he would apply himself for both afterward   bro what could you say to that   sister i turned then to my aunt for this was a public communing it was no courtship at all i asked her thus madam there is another impossibility in the way that you know of which really ought to prohibit my speaking it and that is this though this breach happened between my father and me and i seem now as it were to be out of his government yet i do not think my self at liberty by it to dispose of my self without his leave or consent or at least without asking it if upon any such motion he answers let her do what she pleases as she has put her self out of my care so she shall be out of my concern if he says so indeed i shall know then what i have to do but till such or some other answer is obtained from my father i dont think the question ought so much as to be asked of me at least if it be i ought to give no other answer to it   bro that was very respectfully answered as to my father what followed   sister my aunt answered me leave that to me child i will answer for that i answered i shall leave it to you with all my heart madam but i can make no answer then till you shall be pleased to let me know when i am at liberty to answer and when not well niece said my aunt to put you out of pain about that i have talked with your father and mother already about it i find them indeed very angry and dissatisfied with their daughter but upon no other account backward or unwilling to the proposal well madam said i a little surpised then you have gone further in this matter than i imagined and what is next said i next child says she why if you would go along with me and speak but one word to your father nay half so much as you did to me just now for no cause at all it would be all over and if the family was uneasy to you upon any other account we should fetch you out of it again in as short a time as you could desire do child says the good old lady i will introduce you i will make half your submission for you   bro indeed i would have gone with her i wonder at you if any one would do half so much for me i would go to morrow morning as far as things are gone with me   sister well i was once of the mind to have gone too but i did not   bro what could you say to her   sister i said these very words madam i find a greater obstacle here than before and i dont know but if it had not been on this account i should have been glad of your offer but do you think my father shall say that whereas i would not submit to him upon the just foundation on which he differed with me yet that i could come home to cry for a husband no madam no one on earth shall say that of me i am not in such distress yet   bro i should never have made that scruple indeed sister you are wondrous nice   sister why brother what would you think of any young lady that should make way for your addresses upon such low terms would you not think them very fond   bro no indeed and he would not either i dare say   sister i resolved i would not put my self so much at his mercy   bro what said he to it   sister he said what was like himself very obliging he told me that now i laid a double affliction upon him for i made him that was willing to do any thing in the world to bring about my return to my father be the only obstacle in the way of it i told him he knew how to remove that obstacle very easily which was by thinking no more of me and perhaps in time i might see my mistake and by my aunts mediation make my peace with my father or my father might abate his rigorous humor and it might go off again without it or if neither happened as i was not a wife fit for a gentleman and was too proud to take up with a footman i was in no haste i could remain as i was   bro you were extravagantly stiff   sister why really brother i think my circumstance requires it more than if i had been in my fathers house for to have consented one moment sooner for my condition had been the same thing as to be taken in charity besides i foresaw the dispute we should have about what our family breach began upon and to which this was but the introduction and therefore i was resolved to be open and free with them before hand whether we came to agree at last or no and as i have told you all this only to bring in the other so i will omit all the rest of our discourse and come to that point   bro do so for i think you said i was a little concerned in it   sister so you are but not much well mr  and my aunt too said a great many very kind things to me after that but at last i turned to my aunt madam says i i cannot but think all our discourse remote and foreign and since you will have me speak of a thing which i never had any thoughts of i ought to be very plain and free especially since you are pleased to give me leave do so my dear said my aunt why then madam said i we are talking of reconciling me to my father and as i told you i shall be very glad of it but as to making that reconciliation a means to what mr  proposes i do not see it will be any thing to the purpose why so niece says my aunt why madam said i this was the reason why i have two or three times asked mr  if he rightly understood the reasons and circumstances of the breach between me and my father he was pleased to say he did though i can hardly think it now madam says i it is my opinion that mr  and i shall differ as much about the same things as my father and i did though perhaps not with so much unkindness especially if we differ about it before hand and therefore it is best fighting that battle before than after for you see i can deliver my self from the fury of a father but i know not my case if it had been a husband besides madam i think it is honester and kinder to mr  to have all this matter settled and disputed now than to leave things to hereafter when i shall have neither liberty to go away nor freedom of speech at home which would be to make my bad case ten times worse than it is   bro what said your aunt to this   sister she was stunned at it at first and seemed willing to have put it off to another time which she afterward told me was because she was afraid my case should be represented too much to my disadvantage mr  seeing his mother too backward to talk of it thought there might be something she would not have him hear and withdrew which i was not pleased with for since i saw they would make a match of it and i saw no great reason to be averse or at least obstinately so i was willing to come to a certainty and know what kind of life i was to live for i was resolved i would no more be a married nun than i would be a cloistered daughter however he being withdrawn my aunt and i began the following discourse which i will give you as short as i can my aunt spoke first thus  aunt come child now my son is gone let me be plain with you and pray take all the freedom and liberty with me that you would now if your brother was here and let us talk of this matter for i would not have you stand in your own light again you see how things stand with you and your father and as you said before i doubt it will be hard to bring you to an accommodation but this match will make you entirely easy   niece madam said i as you give me a liberty to speak freely i hope you will not take it ill that i am very plain i have no particular objection against the match with your son as to himself indeed i did not look upon it at first to be a serious proposal but since you assure me it is and as you are now instead both of a father and a mother to me i shall give my self up to be entirely disposed by you only my present difficulties relate to my own circumstances and the ground and reason of the breach with my father seems to me to be a plain foundation of the like with my husband if i should ever marry mr  which would make me more miserable than i am now   aunt you must explain your self child i know the breach between you and your father was begun about religion and the reformation of his family which he has happily effected and which you and your brother opposed i am loath to bring those things to your mind i observe they always bring tears into your eyes things were carried too high we all have thought you were in the wrong but that is not the case now   niece pardon me madam said i that is just the case now and as you have heard parties against me so i doubt not you will hear me too for while you believe me in the wrong mr  and i can never be right suppose i should do just by him as i did by my father what then   aunt i hope you will not my dear   niece no madam indeed i will not i will not go away from him but to prevent that i will never have him till he and i adjust the matter as to what liberty i may expect and what not for i will never marry as i said to be my husbands cloistered wife any more than i would stay at home to be my fathers nun   aunt why child your difference with your father as i understand it was that when he set up the worship of god in his family you would not join with him but made a scoff at his resolution of reforming his family and several such things   niece did i not say madam that i believe mr  and you also had not had a fair account of the thing i cannot wonder madam that you thought me in the wrong i wonder mr  could think of me for a wife if i had been such a daughter   aunt come child undeceive me then and let me hear it all   niece no madam let me only let you hear it right my father and mother had bred up me and my brother as you know till we were come to be what we call men and women we had been used to company to good manners to converse in the world with people of quality and good breeding and were come to an age in which we might be thought fit to be trusted with so much of the government of our selves as to be past schooling and tutelage we made no other use of those liberties than became a modest behavior they can charge us with nothing criminal or scandalous no vice nothing injurious to our reputation when all of a sudden without any notice we were fallen upon abridged of all lawful liberties were to have new lectures of family discipline read to us which we were absolutely to submit to and to commence children again this you may be sure we thought hard and my share was immediately to fall under correction for my mother without any provocation as i thought flew to my closet took away all my books and flung them in the fire and laid her hands upon me into the bargain this i thought at my age was unreasonable usage   aunt well child but you say you made no ill use of your liberties whereas you went every lords day abroad to the park and a visiting you went every day almost to the play spent your time at home in playing at cards reading plays and the like   niece it is true madam we did so but we did not reckon these unlawful liberties madam nor do i yet think so   aunt i am sorry for that my dear i am quite of another mind   niece but madam if they were so who gave us the example who bred us up in that liberty did not my father and mother always go out with us to the park a sundays and go with us to the play nay did they not lead us into it by their example and did not my mother give me most of those very books she threw in the fire out of her own closet if this was a wicked course why had they not brought us up otherways and not introduced us to it themselves   aunt my child they own they were in the wrong and that is their grief i have heard them express themselves with tears and a just sorrow on that account and they are forward enough to charge themselves with it as the cause of all the obstinacy of you and your brother in resisting their measures of reformation and you should not reproach them my dear with what they repent of   niece i do not reproach them perhaps they have cause for their repentance but still it may be allowed for a reason against their so violently driving us into their new measures and breaking us off from all our friends and society at once without any other reason but that they thought fit to have it so if we had been little children it had been another case   aunt i cannot but be against you cousin in it though that part may seem hard to you for if the thing was necessary and just you could not justify so great a breach with your father and mother for the manner of it   niece this is what i looked for madam and is the reason why i mentioned it for if mr  thinks to go on with what my father has begun i am no wife for him to be sure if i were why should i come away from my father   aunt why if you were married to my son  would you refuse to have him pray to god in his family or to join with him if he did indeed cousin i love you very well but i have so much respect for him also and above all so much zeal for the keeping up the face of religion in families that i could not in conscience b for the match   niece if madam that had been the quarrel between my father and me why did i come to your house do i scruple going to prayers with you all here did i omit going to church with my father or do i omit it here you are satisfied i knew the orders of your family before i came hither this makes it plain it was not that made the dispute but the manner of his acting and abridging us of all those liberties he had bred us up in and then beginning a new discipline when he ought to have allowed us to be past discipline why had he not without all that ceremony and those severities upon us called his family to prayers and called us in do you think madam we would have run away or have left our father because of his going to prayers   aunt well niece though he might have done so yet i cannot think you were in the right of it nor your brother neither who i hear insults his father very rudely since because he has an estate without him but i fear that young gentleman will come to want bread yet unless his father help him i am persuaded i shall live to see him brought to his fathers door in as bad a condition as the prodigal though without the prodigals repentance i wish i am not too true a prophetess   niece this very thing is the reason madam why i am so willing to speak of this case before i can talk any thing to the purpose about mr    aunt why child what does this relate to him be knows it all and we know it all and yet we are willing he should make you his wife if these things do not hinder on his side sure they can never hinder on your side   niece i think just the contrary madam and i beg you will bear with me in speaking it plainly it is true he knows all this as well as you do but if he believes me in the wrong too as you do i would be glad to know how i that think my self in the right am to live with him in the case of such liberties which i justify and he condemns to be sure if i thought them not justifiable i would go home to my father this minute and ask his pardon upon my knees and if i continue to think them justifiable i shall think it more hard to be abridged by my husband than i did by my father and this is the difficulty i mentioned before   aunt why child what liberties do you mean or what would you speak of in such a case i hope you would desire no unlawful unbecoming liberties especially when you were a wife and a mistress of a family   niece i hope not madam nor any unbecoming restraints neither and that is the reason of my discourse he may think himself willing to run the risque of the first but i am not willing to run the risque of the last for our power of acting under them will be by no means equal   just at this word the young gentleman comes in again aunt here is my son let him answer for himself state your objection   niece no madam you can do it much better   the aunt repeats the very words to him son i wonder madam you should think i should practice restraints with you i see nothing in your conversation that prepares me to expect you can want a restraint or that bids me fear it   niece i may be a worse wife than i am a cousin as i have been a worse daughter to my father than i have been a niece to my aunt   son i am not so willing to suppose that as i am well satisfied of the contrary   niece but i would know what restraints i am to expect   son you can hardly mention upon what occasion   niece upon the very probable occasion of my being a bad wife   son that is a general head and yet you shall have a particular answer to it madam i know no practical restraints that a husband can honestly make use of but those of entreaties persuasions and kind reasonings and those i know you would allow   niece you are capable of learning though you may know no other yet   son pray madam be so particular then as to name some of the cases in which you apprehend i shall restrain you   niece perhaps i will go to the play what will you do you will not go with me   son to the door madam to see you safe i should   niece perhaps when you will go to prayers i go a visiting   son if you will not let me pray with you madam i hope you will let me pray for you   niece suppose i have a mind to go to the park a sundays   son i will show you the reasons why i dare not go with you and use all the entreaties and persuasions i can with you not to act so much against your own conscience and i hope to prevail with you too but to wave such suggestions upon the whole madam it is my principle and i believe it will be my practice that between man and wife no violence can be justified but that of affectionate tender persuasion and a reasoning importunity my disposition does not lead me to rudeness all the government and all the obedience of the married state that i have any notion of consists in the dominion of love and the subjection of love what monster i may be transformed into i cannot say but this is my judgment and i persuade my self you are not apprehensive of the rest any more than i am apprehensive of your acting as you say you will    sister this brother was the substance of our discourse and an odd sort of courting you will say it was and thus the case stands now what i shall resolve to do in it i know not what would you advise me to   bro i will be very plain with you sister if you were in as good terms with your father as ever you were yet if this had offered then i would have advised you to have had him if ever you expected to be happy he is a sober virtuous generous spirited gentleman and such a one can never use you ill i know you love sir anthony  but you are undone if ever you have him for he is a brute and a beggar he only wants your money and if he marries you he has neither estate to maintain you sense to entertain you or manners to use you well   sister i believe i shall take your advice truly but i shall not be too hasty   bro i am glad to see you in so fair a way to come off of this ugly family broil   sister i do not see that this will bring me off of it at all my father will be the same man   bro yes yes it will bring you off he will bring you to be reconciled and my aunt will work another way and if it should be impossible still you are provided for   sister i cannot say but i shall be provided for yet i own i shall never enjoy my self for whether i am right or wrong i cannot say i am easy to be at such a variance as not to be in speaking terms with my own father and mother   bro that is just my case i know not what i shall do to go abroad and perhaps may never see them again and not so much as see them or have their blessing or take my leave of them i know not what to do in it   sister dear brother then why will you go i think you take the wrongest step in the world   bro in what child   sister to go into the army what occasion have you for it you told me you should only go to travel   bro well be easy i am going to travel first for a year i design to go into italy   sister but you must go to the army at last   bro ay but not a great while yet though perhaps time enough to make my dream good   sister my aunts words came into my head when you told me that ugly dream i wish there be not something in it at last if you did not go into the army i should not be afraid of it   bro i do not love to heed dreams   sister i have heard our minister say there is a just medium to be observed in the giving heed to dreams viz that we should not lay too much stress upon them and yet not wholly slight them   bro i observe the dreams that signify bad things are true oftenest i dreamed exactly about a week before it happened of our breach with my father   sister here comes my aunt we must talk no more of that now   the end of the second dialogue the third dialogue the two last dialogues are to be understood to be a recapitulation of what had been acted some time past in order to introduce this part and preserve the connection of the history the daughter is now to be talked of as having been married some time the son was gone to travel and having been returned into flanders was gone to his post in the army where being in the confederate service and commanded out upon action he fell in with a party of the french and being very much wounded in the fight was taken prisoner and carried to cambray from whence he wrote his sister a letter of which in its course  the new married couple had for above two years lived together as they were at first with his father and her aunt during which time she had had two children and the treatment she had met with there had been so kind so diverting and so obliging that she could have no reason to say that they had not performed fully the engagement her husband had made with her to endeavor to make her forget the affliction of the breach with her father  her husband carried it with so much tenderness and affection to her as was capable to engage and win a temper far more refractory than hers and by his obliging carriage he prevented many little excursions which her inclination would otherways have led her too yet two things remained  st she could not persuade herself to like a regular kind of family government she loved company which she had been accustomed to and a little to play and when she made her visits would sometimes stay at cards or other diversions very late  d she could not bear to think of stooping to own her misbehaviour to her father or to make any submission to him nor could her husband though he failed in no endeavor bring that breach to an end without it  as her family increased and on the other hand her ways were not very agreeable to the family she was in it seemed necessary to think of settling themselves apart and her husband having a very good house of his own near the city it was resolved they should do so and accordingly as we say they began housekeeping  and now began the trial of her husbands temper and patience to the utmost the case was thus being now to be a master of a family he was obliged to take upon him the charge of family government he had not only been religiously educated but as has been before observed was a very serious religious gentleman himself it was his affliction that he found very little complasance in his wife to any thing that was religious and therefore he entered into no conference with her about establishing the orders of his family but as soon as his house was furnished and his family removed he resolved like a true christian to begin with the worship of god in his house and that he might leave no room to her to dispute it he did this without so much as mentioning it to his wife as if it was a thing which it ought to be taken for granted was as naturally and necessarily to be done in a family as providing food and conveniences for their subsistence however as if to make this more eligible and to introduce it without any seeming imposition upon his wife he invited his father and mother and a minister who was their acquaintance to sup with them the first night of their housekeeping and before supper his wife being in the room he asked the minister aloud if he would please to be their chaplain for that night the wife could not offer to oppose it though he could easily perceive she looked a little strange at it so the minister as had been concerted gladly accepting the offer books were brought in the servants called together and family prayers performed the first night after this was done and supper over he invited the minister who it seems lived in the country to stay two or three days with him which he also accepted so of course prayers were had every night and morning while the minister stayed and thus the worship of god was quietly introduced into the family and after the minister was gone the servants to whom it was no novelty having been all in the family before came of course together at the usual hour and he performed it himself  his wife who was more disgusted at his taking no notice of it to her than at the thing it self as if it was a beginning of some new method which he intended to take with her took a great many ways to let him see she was not very well pleased sometimes at the usual time when he would say come call in the servants she would give a smile as a signal of contempt often she would be busy above stairs and not come down at all very often though she would come she would make him wait a good while and when she came into the room would say with some disdain what need you have staid for me  however he took no notice of all this and though she strove by all the ways she could to have made him speak of it first yet he shunned it resolving not to have any dispute with her if it were possible to avoid it but she soon took care to make it unavoidable  being become now a mistress of a family he hoped she would have had some consideration for the station she was in and have appeared with a little of that gravity and authority that became her but on the contrary she entirely omitted all appearance of any such thing she visited oftener than ever she played at cards abroad two or three times a week and at home as often as she could get company she went almost nightly to the play in short she began to lead a life so different from the rest of the family and so uneasy to him and all his and her friends that it was greatly afflicting and perplexing to him  during all this time he treated her with the utmost tenderness and the most obliging carriage that was possible only it could not be concealed neither from her nor from all the house that his wifes conduct was an extreme affliction to him and the more because he saw no possible method to go about to reclaim her  his wife finding her self unrestrained grew still worse and at length contented not her self to give her vanity its full swing but appeared discontented that he would not do the like if she went to the play he would sometimes go with her to the door as he had said he would when he courted her but would not go in which she pretended she took very ill of him when he visited any where with her where he saw her resolved to stay late at cards he would excuse himself and leave her and it was much if she did not flout him before the company in some such manner as this what you want to go home and sa your prayers which he would turn off with a smile or a jest and withdraw but still these things were very grievous to him  during all this and much more nothing angered her so much as that he would not take the case into debate with her but he resolved to go on in the duties of a master in his family and to give her no occasion to say he used her amiss so that all this while he said nothing to her till at last she began with him upon the following occasion  his eldest child a fine little boy was now almost three years old he had been but too well assured that his wife took little care to teach the child any thing that might lay an early foundation of a religious knowledge in its mind wherefore upon all opportunities he would be talking to the little creature in such language as was fittest for him to understand viz of who made him and who redeemed him what god was and that he must serve god and he like as is usual to say to little children and his wife takes that opportunity to break in upon him one day in pursuance of her former resolution and began with him while he was talking to his little son in the following manner  wife so mr  you are worthily employed   hus my dear i hope it is no ill employment   wife no no only suitable to that absolute governmen of your family which you entered upon at your beginning to keep house   hus my dear i hope i have not encroached upon your province   wife no no my province to be sure i am not fit to instruct a child of three years old   hus my speaking to the child to let him know who made him and who redeemed him and who he was born to serve was a thing so innocent and i thought so natural that i wonder it should offend you my dear   wife no no offend me why should it offend me you know i cannot do it my self having never been taught any thing till i was almost  0 years old   hus though you have had knowledge enough my dear yet i have heard you say it had been better if your father had begun earlyer with his family and that it had prevented the breach that has happened since   wife yes yes and made you have a better wife   hus my dear you never heard me complain   wife no your reproofs are silent but very legible and easy to be understood   hus wherein my dear do i reprove you   wife only by taking all your family measures without consulting your wife as one not worth having her consent asked in the matter or rather not capable of giving it   hus what family measures do you mean my dear we have not been six months in a family yet and i know not one single thing in the house that i have ordered without you   wife not one thing why did not you bring home your chaplain without me and set up your family orders without me why was not i worthy being spoken to about it i suppose you fancied i would oppose it as you had once a notion i did at my fathers and so you treated me as if i were first an atheist that would oppose any thing that was good or religious and  dly an upper servant whose business was not to join in making orders but to submit to them when made but i dont trouble you much at your devotions   hus it is my great missortune that you have kept this in your mind so long and not let me know that you took offense at it before nothing was ever done with more innocence of intention or construed in a more contrary manner to my meaning i could have no thought that you would oppose the natural duty of all creatures to worship and serve the being that created them how could i have such a thought of you my dear when i know you always willingly joined with us at my fathers and when i heard you declare to your aunt that the coming to prayers was no part of the thing which made the breach at your fathers do not take it ill my dear indeed i had not the least thoughts of what you suggest and if i omitted any thing which i ought to have done in respect to you my dear i ask you pardon   offers to kiss her she turns away from him wife what signifies that when you have used me so you know i must submit to your orders now they are made   hus my dear is there any thing in my family orders which offends you or that you would not have done if there is let me know and it shall be altered   wife no no it is past the time to ask that question now you know it is my part to submit   hus my dear i cannot but think it hard you should talk of submitting where there is nothing imposed i impose nothing and offer to alter any thing you shall direct to be altered   wife is it not imposing when you did it all without so much as speaking a word to me about it though the matter of it was never so good yet the manner of doing it was by imposing a compliance in me since i was not thought worthy to be spoken to about but you see i do not trouble you much with my company   hus that is my grief my dear and principally because i fear that at last it will not be your comfort   wife what need that trouble you   hus my dear if you suppose i love you you cannot think i can be less concerned for your future happiness then for your present   wife i suppose none of the three   hus if you do me justice you will be satisfied of them all but you are angry now i will wave that discourse till you are better satisfied   wife your grief you speak of is not at all at the occasions given me   hus my grief is that the occasion you take of being displeased is from what is my indispensible duty and yours also   wife the doing your duty is none of my grief   hus my dear it is a double grief to me to hear you say the reason of your dislike is from my error in the manner of introducing it had i for seen it i would have made no scruple to have laid down all my authority as you call it as a master and have begged of you to let it be done   wife dont banter me you would have asked my leave to have set up family worship would you what if i had refused would you have let it alone for that   hus that is not a question to be asked i am sure you would not have refused you could not have refused such a natural known duty and the certainty of your free consent was a very good reason why i should omit the ceremony nay if i had thought of it i question whether i should have asked you i rather should have thought i had obliged you in it and should have offended in making it a question whether you consented to it or no   wife but the more ingenuous truth of the two bad been to have said that if you had asked me and i had refused to consent yet that you would have done it against my will and therefore to avoid the strife you chose not to propose it is not that the case now   hus my dear i own it is a duty that i dare not omit and though if i had thought that you had expected it i would have asked your consent yet i should have asked it upon a presumption of your being ready to agree to it and it would have been the greatest affront to you in the world to have supposed otherwise of you we ought no more to ask one another leave to pray to god than we ought to ask one another consent to eat or drink rise up or sit down   wife well you see as i told you i dont disturb you at it   hus but if you know how much that does disturb me i believe you would consider of it   wife i dont trouble my self about that i assure you   hus well my dear i remember what i said to you before we were married at your aunts house upon this very subject when i little thought you were in earnest but i will perform it faithfully   wife i remember nothing of it   hus i told you if you would not let me pray with you i would pray for you and so i do heartily and i hope god will hear me at last he has ways to move your heart though i cannot prevail   wife o your memory is very good and that makes me remember something too that was said at the same time which i suppose you have forgot   hus what is that my dear   wife why that i would have my liberty and would not be tied to your formalities but that i would go a visiting when i pleased though it were when you were at your long prayers and that i would go to the play and to the park a sundays too if i pleased   hus my dear have i not given you as much liberty as you have desired have i offered the least restraint to you i have not so much as used the entreaties and persuasions that i capitulated with you to have liberty for   wife but i can see well enough how you like and how ill you are pleased   hus nay my dear i never promised you that i would like such things and be pleased with them that is what you cannot say we agreed upon nor i believe have you so little sense to expect that i can like it but hitherto you have not had the least trouble of a complaint from me i believe and heartily pray that god will in his own time open your eyes to see that you are in the wrong and to restore you to me and to your friends that we may yet have the comfort of one another and till that time i bear all you think fit to do with as much patience as i can   wife but still you are going on with your family government and now you are for catechizing your children as if i was not able to tell them who made them as well as you   hus i never questioned your ability my dear   wife no nor my willingness neither for you never asked me whether i had done it or would do it or not what was this but exposing me to all the house as if i was not fit to be trusted with teaching a little child but that you were fain to do it yourself   hus instructing our children is the natural work both of father and mother and my talking to the child in that manner no way implies that you do not or cannot or that i think so in that your inference is not just my dear   wife i think it below you   hus my dear how can you think that when you said to me of your own father that if he had done it sooner by you the fatal breach among you had never happened   wife that case and this is not alike i never refused or omitted it what need you meddle with it   hus well my dear so the children be but early and rightly instructed you and i will never differ about who shall do it do but grant me this that it ought to be done   wife yes yes it ought to be done to be sure   hus then my dear if you will allow me so much plainness i will prove to you that i have not done amiss because it had not been done to this child and therefore it was my duty to do it you having thought fit to omit it   wife how do you make that out that i have omitted it   hus you shall have unanswerable evidence immediately for your conviction come hither harry come hither my dear  he calls the little boy and examins him   fa who made you my dear   child god   fa who told you so   child you did pappa   fa when my dear   child just now pappa   fa did no body ever tell you so before   child no pappa   mo sirrah did not i tell you so   child no mamma   mo nor nurse neither   child no mamma   mo you tell a lie sirrah   child no indeed mamma   hus nay my dear children and fools you know etc   wife i am sure he tells an untruth now   hus why my dear do not be angry with the child for i asked him over and over who made him and he said he could not tell then i asked him if no body ever told him and he said no and if he had not answered me so which a little surpised me and troubled me too i should not have committed this invasion upon your office   wife well well it is time enough to teach him all that he is not three years old   fa my dear i thank god it is yet early enough but never let thee and i dispute about whose work it is to instruct our children if we do our duty and instruct them well it will find us both work enough as they grow up we shall be glad to help one another and not think it an encroachment upon our office   wife but it is nonsense to meddle with children at three years old they will answer like parrots and say what they are bid but they understand nothing of what they say   hus with submission my dear that is a mistake an awe and sense of the greatness and majesty of god and the fear we ought to have of offending him is capable of being received by a child as soon as it can speak   wife i do not see it is to any manner of purpose   hus my dear does he know you   wife yes to be sure   hus does he know you have a rod and that he must not be a naughty boy and that if he does he will make you angry and you may correct him   wife what is all that to the purpose   hus by the same rule he is capable of receiving due impressions of his maker   wife not at all   hus no doubt as soon as god has empowered his soul to receive any knowledge at all it is our duty to help him to receive some knowledge of god besides my dear you are not ignorant how soon a little infant will be taught to sin and i think we ought to study to be before hand with the devil and lay a foundation of good in our children before he can get in to lay a foundation of evil   wife you are wiser than i to be sure and therefore you thought fit to begin as you suppose before me but to be sure before you enquired of me or consulted with me any thing about it   hus you are disposed to be angry my dear my comfort is you have no reason and that i have done nothing but what i think my duty and not even that with a design to displease you   wife you fancy your self very obliging   hus i would be always so to you my dear   wife mighty obliging indeed in letting me go alone always i suppose you are ashamed of your wife if you had you should not have taken me i did not court you   hus my dear i never let you go alone but to places which i cannot agree to go to such as the playhouse and to my lady  where you know the company and the gaming are things i have not been bred to and cannot comply with   wife what your conscience will not let you play a game at cards   husb my dear suppose it would as to the simple action yet i own it will not as to the circumstances   wife what circumstances i beseech you   husb why first i can employ my time better and they that know the value of time and the haste we are all making to eternity will think themselves obliged to waste as little of their time as they can and think it their duty always to employ it in the best manner they can possibly   wife i think time spent in good company is not misspent   husb my dear when you come nearer the end of your time you will think otherwise   wife that is more than you are sure of   husb for your sake my dear i hope it will it will be a sad day for you if you should not and for me too if i should live to see it   wife well that is but one of your niceties pray what are the rest   husb why my dear it is true i have other scraples and my second is this i am now a father and a master of a family and have servants and children growing up i have duties upon me now which were not my duties before and particularly family worship  dly i am obliged in duty to set no evil example either to children or servants and on the contrary to let my conversation be in all things exemplar that i may not have either my servants or children justify themselve in any excesses by my example   wife what is all this to lawful things such as visiting a friend seeing a play or playing a game at cards those things that you speak of relate to unlawful excesses only as drunkenness lewdness and such things as those   husb ay and other things too and those circumstances make some things unlawful to me which are not so in themselves particularly my dear you stay there at cards till one or two in the morning if i did so i must neglect my duty in my family and cause a game at cards to supersede the worship of god would not that game at cards be a sin   wife yes yes i told you at sir anthonys you must go home and say your prayers   husb that was not the kindest thing that ever you said to me in your life my dear   wife i shall always use you so when you are so rude to me to leave the company   husb then i hope you will excuse me from going again my dear   wife you may stay away if you please   husb indeed my dear i must stay away or offend you by coming away before you for i cannot dispense with my duty to god upon any account whatsoever i am very sorry you will not take that for a sufficient excuse   wife what need you make excuses to me any thing will serve to a wife you know   husb i am very loath to disoblige you my dear and therefore i am giving you just reasons for my behavior in every part that your own judgment may oblige you to say you have no cause to take it ill   wife other husbands do not live so do you think any body but me have their husbands go to the piayhouse doors with them and then run away and leave them   husb indeed my dear i cannot comply with you in that part and told you so before i married you if you will excuse me going to the door with you i shall take it very kindly but as for going to the plays as i said of playing at cards i can much better employ my time   wife yes yes you can go home to your prayers i wonder you dont make your prayer an excuse for going to dinner   husb my dear i am sorry to hear you make a jest and scoff at praying to god you never heard me make an excuse for doing any thing that becomes me to do in my life i am none of those that make a show or a boast of my duty i entreat you upon what do you ground this banter did i ever tell you when i carried you to the playhouse that i must go home to my prayers i tell you plainly and did so before we were married i go to no plays but i never said i did not because i must go to my prayers   wife no no but your spending your time better implies it for can you spend it better than in your prayers and you say you are always to spend your time as well as you can   husb you talk to me of my praying my dear as if i were a mere pharisee and said my prayers at the corner of every street   wife you make more ado about them a great deal i think than you need   husb i make no boast of them nor do you know any more of them than needful family worship requires if i offered any such thing as private prayer with you i fear you would but make a mock of it   wife no no not i you may pray all night and all day too if you please for you know you are to spend all your time as well as you can   husb my dear there are duties in a christian life for every part of time without letting them interfere one with another and yet my dear when you are at the play i dont know whether it might not be as proper a time for me to pray as at any time especially upon your account   wife why then i beseech you more than at another time   husb for the same reason that job was offering sacrifice for his sons and daughters when they were making merry viz that they might not be led into temptation   wife i desire none of your prayers   husb for that reason you have the more occasion for them my dear and i the more reason to pray for you   wife i had rather you would go to the play with me   husb i am sorry for the wretched choice you make and very sorry you make it impossible for me to oblige you i had much rather you would put your self in a condition that i might according to my own inclination deny you nothing   wife you will have your own way you will be a worse husband before you are a better   husb i believe you will be a better wife before you are a worse   wife you have too much religion to be a kind husband   husb lord give you more religion my dear then you will be a kinder wife   wife dont trouble your head to pray for me i tell you till i put up a bill to you as they do at church   husb i shall always pray for you my dear   wife you will have no thanks for it your labor is all lost   husb i hope not my dear but i entreat you let us have no more of this kind of discourse you mix it with so much profaneness as well as unkindness that it is very grievous and very afflicting to me i was in hopes never to have seen you come this length   wife what length am i come   husb i desire not to enter into particulars i fear you are laying in a great stock for repentance and our discourse does but increase it therefore i forbear saying any more for in multiplying words there wants not sin   wife i desire to be used better or i shall be a worse wife   husb you are disposed to be out of temper at this time my dear i hope you will be of another mind when you have considered of it i will leave you a while   wife for as long as you please   he withdraws and goes up stairs when her husband was gone and she had sat a while and mused upon what she had done her passion began to abate and reason to take place again in her soul and first her unkindness to her husband began to show it self to her i believe says she to her self i have angered him heartily well it cant be helped now let him even take it if he will  but a little further thinking brought her more to her self and then her affection to him stirred in her and she breaks out again but why should i treat him thus he never was unkind to me in his life he has been the tenderest husband that ever woman had and has taken me with circumstances ill enough i will go and heal it all again take him in my arms and speak kindly to him  away she goes to speak to him but cannot find him she enquires for him the servants say he is in his closet up she flies thither but he was come down again and was gone out then lookng out at the window she saw him at a distance walking very melancholy in some fields near the house all alone by him self by this time she was entirely come to her self and seeing him walk so solitarily made her very uneasy she sends a servant to him to tell him she desired to speak with him and in hopes of his coming she run out into the garden to meet him but the boy brought her word again he was gone and he could not find him  now she began violently to reproach her self with her ill usage of her husband and shutting her self into her chamber she reflected bitterly on her self  what a brute have i been said she to the best husband that ever woman had that took me without a farthing portion when i was turned out of doors by my father and mother that never said an unkind thing to me in his life that when i have lost  0 l at a time at play never said so much as why did you do so or grudged parting with his money what barbarous language have i given him and how calmly and tenderly has he returned all along without one unkind word sure i am the veriest brute of a wife that ever any man had and dont deserve that ever he should have the least value for me again she stopped a while and wept vehemently and then went on with her exclamations upon her self thus  then what have i quarrelled with him for but for what all the women in the nation but i would value a man for viz for his being sober and virtuous and religious and did ever a fool talk to a husband as i did about his family orders his praying to god and the like why my own conscience tells me that he is in the right and i am in the wrong and though i mind nothing my self i cannot but own he does well sure i am the worst creature alive there are many women and men too that have religion little enough but sure never any woman abused a husband for being better than themselves before  here she burst out into tears again and still impatient upon every little noise she heard in the house to know if her husband was come home  her husband had born all her taunts with the utmost patience as above and had not withdrawn at last but that he found himself moved by her talking irreligiously and profanely when fearing he should fly out in a passion too and so give her any indecent language as she did him and which he thought himself obliged to avoid he withdrew  he was however not only surprised but extremely afflicted at this treatment and not only at this as an accident but at the sad prospect of what he was to expect from the continuance of it and that both as it respected the conduct of her self abroad which began to be public and also the treatment he was to have from her at home  however as the best remedy for the disorder of his passions he went immediately into his closet and prayed earnestly to god for a patient submissive frame in himself to all his providence that he might not lay any stress upon the instrument but view the meaning and design of sovereign goodness in all those things not forgetting at the same time to pray very sincerely for his wife that god would open her eyes convince her of her sin and bring her home to himself by a true repentance and reformation  this brought him to a perfect composure of mind and after some time spent thus he went out and took a walk in some fields behind his house where his wife afterward as is noted above discovered him from her chamber window but before the messenger she sent came thither he was gone having walked into the city and as he went he accidentally met with his wifes father and going to take a glass of wine together the following discourse happened between them  fa well son i hear you are gone to house keeping i give you joy of your settlement how does all your family   son we should do all much better if we had your blessing sir and might have some of your company   fa indeed son you have my blessing and good wishes very heartily i have no other reason   son i thank you for it so far sir but we are without it in a family way which is what i long to have over is there no way sir to obtain your pardon   fa god has not obliged us to pardon offenses that are never acknowledged son   son sir your daughter and i are one now be pleased to accept my acknowledgment for her i do most freely own she has been in the wrong in every part and i will beg your pardon for her on my knees   fa if you will say she desires you to do so i will grant it at first word and abate you the ceremony of kneeling   son i wish i could say so sir honestly but i dare not say so unless it were true   fa i know that very well and therefore i put it upon your bare saying it   son it is my great grief that it is not so much so as i would have it but can you abate nothing sir   fa nay son i will leave it to you is it meet i should come and say daughter i am in the wrong i ought not to have reformed my family or if i had i ought not to have expected you or your brother should have complied with it and therefore you have been in the right and i am very sorry it has gone so far pray come and see me   son no sir i never so much as thought you were in the wrong nor do i say but my wife ought to come and acknowledge her fault and ask you pardon but she has had ill advisers if i had influence enough on her to prevail she should neither eat or sleep till she asked you pardon in the humblest manner possible   fa for your sake son and to let you see how willing i am to heal a family breach if she will send me word by you that she acknowledges she has failed in her duty and desires me to be reconciled to her i will come to your house and see her to morrow   son it is my grief sir that i cannot promise for her that she should comply with what is so reasonable and so kind i acknowledge sir you cannot ask less   fa nay i do not expect it i know she will not do it did she not refuse so much as to see me when she had no reason but to think she was upon her deathbed   son i am sorry to own to you sir that i have not interest enough in her to prevail for what is so just and so much her duty it is my affliction i did not think she would have stood out so long   fa i do not expect it of you son i know her i wish you could prevail with her upon some other accounts she manages her self very strangely as i hear   son i hope time may show her the mistakes she commits they are not of any great consequence she will be wiser sir with a little more experience   fa but in the mean time she ruins her reputation and may ruin your estate for she goes so much abroad she is very seldom at home and more than that i hear she plays   son i have no doubt at all of her virtue though she may err in her prudence sir and that makes me say i hope a little time will rectify it all as to play she does not play high   fa why son i hear she lost  0 l at sir anthonys a few nights ago i wonder you will let her go there i forbad her that house when she was a maid nay her brother give him his due blamed her for going there he is the rakishest fellow in the town and his sisters who she used to visit are no better than they should be i would have you for her sake as well as your own persuade her against it   son alas sir she is not to be persuaded by me to things of less consequence than that   fa then you must restrain her   son that is a task i am no way qualified for any farther than the violence of entreaties and persuasions will have any effect   fa why then a wife may ruin her self and you too i thought you had been fitter to make a husband than that comes too why it is not ill using a wife it is love to her to restrain her from ruining her own reputation and your estate do you think i would persuade you to use her ill though she has not behaved well to me she is my daughter and was once my best beloved daughter nay i love her very well still and i would not have my scores paid that way   son truly sir if that be required of a husband i am not fit for a husband and as to ruining me indeed if my wife will ruin me i may be ruined for i can never frame my temper to use any violence or restraint with her besides her temper is such she would set all the house in a flame and expose her self to all the world   fa pray what said she to you for losing  0 l at play i hear you paid it for her   son no sir i would not dishonor her so much i gave it her immediately to pay for her self she said of her own accord she was in the wrong and she would play no more i wish she would lose  00 l though i paid it this very night so she might but be prevailed with to leave it off   fa i hear she behaves very ill to you at home too   son no no sir i do not complain of her she would be a very good wife to me sir if i could persuade her to leave off keeping company with two or three families and i hope in time she will be tired of them   fa i cannot but be glad that i fairly told you all i feared of her before you had her you have nothing to blame me for   son sir i blame no body she is a very good wife   fa well you are kind to her but i blame her extremely and it is a grief to me that any thing out of my family should behave so i am sensible how obliging you have carried it to her and do still and how tenderly you use her and i wanted an occasion to tell you that though she has not grace to make you a suitable return for it i shall never forget it nor i hope forget to reward it   son sir you lay too much stress upon what is nothing but my duty and what she very well deserves for give her her due when she is not prejudiced by her passions which are hasty and which hurry her too violently after the gayeties of the town and the company which she is fond of she is of the most engaging temper in the world and no man that has any sense or affection can be unkind to her i may have faults of my side and i should think it hard she would not bear with them and i see nothing in her but i can bear with and wait patiently for the return of her temper nothing afflicts me so much in her as to see her so entirely empty of any thing that is religious that she will hardly bear with our family orders and the common worship of god but as that must be wrought by the immediate hand of god i hope still it will come in his due time she wants no sense of things nor knowledge of what is our natural duty either to god or one another   fa well son you have more hopes of her than i have i assure you i cannot but say if any thing on earth can bring her to a sense of her duty either to god or man it must be such a winning obliging carriage as she receives from you if that will not work on her she must be the ungratefullest creature on earth considering in what circumstances you took her and that you have had her three year without having had a penny with her   son sir as i told her before i married her i would never ask any thing of you on that account till i had if possible brought her and you to be reconciled so i have been as good as my word i am sure she has suffered no inconveniency on that account   fa but i shall not be so unjust to you as to let you suffer on that account and therefore though i cannot receive her as a daughter yet i shall always value you and treat you as a son nay as my own son and though for her i would not disburse a shilling yet i have resolved and have wanted an opportunity to tell you that i will give you for your own sake not for hers as much as i would have given her if she had never disobliged me and if you are willing to have it settled on either or both your children i will do it when you please   son it is more sir than i can ask and therefore it shall be settled as you shall think fit i hope my wife will think her self obliged to thank you sir as well as i   fa i do not expect or regard her thanks while she stands out against her duty the submission i have insisted upon is no ceremony i demand it not in respect to my self but as a debt due to the world in acknowledgment of her duty to god and her parents and as i had never withheld her portion but in expectation that some time or other she would have complied and have come to her self so i will make no advantage of the delay but you shall have the interest of it from the day of her marriage and as i say this is done to oblige you and as an acknowledgment of your extraordinary behavior to my daughter so you shall not take it ill that i desire her to take notice i will not now accept of her submission or be any ways concerned with her or for her upon any account whatsoever   son sir as the goodness you are pleased to express to me is more than i have merit to balance or reason to expect so i beg you would not let your kindness to me be clogged with any farther severity to my wife for since our good or evil being in this world is inseparable this would be laying a heavy load on me at the same time that you are obliging me in the highest manner possible nay this would be an unspeakable grief to me since all the prospect of happiness i have in this world consists in the hopes i have of one day making up this wretched breach to the comfort and satisfaction of us all   fa well however you may deliver this as a message to your wife from me only noting for your own private satisfaction that i do not make this with the same unalterable resolution as i have the other   son then sir i entreat you let not me be the messenger of any thing to my wife that i know will grieve her   fa if the absence from her father had been any grief to her she would ill have born it out so long i cannot suppose it any grief to her   son but sir i have many reasons to believe it is a grief to her and many more to hope that it will be much more a grief to her than it is when god shall be pleased to show her both the sin of what is past and what is her duty for time to come which time i earnestly pray for and not without hope and sir as i shall always make it my endeavor to convince her how much it is her duty to acknowledge her offense both to god and her father and humbly to ask pardon of both i beg you would not put a silencing argument in her mouth to answer my entreaties and persuasions with by saying to me dont you know it is too late and has not my father said if i do submit my self to him now he will not accept me if god should say so at the same time sir she would be undone and the having you say so on the one hand may tempt her to despair of gods mercy on the other and to make that conviction which i hope shall be her mercy when ever it comes be her ruin   the father embraces him fa dear son you are fitter to be a father than i am i am fully answered by your arguments nothing can be more engaging than the affection you discover for a wife that i doubt never deserved it from you and i believe never will i will forbear the message say to her then what ever you will and what ever god shall direct you in order to bring her to her duty you give me some hopes that god will yet be merciful to her in that he has fixed such a concern for her good in one so capable of being a prevailing instrument with her i pray god bless your counsel to her good   they part and the young gentleman goes home to his wife his wife had impatiently waited for his return her passion was entirely over and her affection to her husband acting now as violently the other way she had afflicted her self exceedingly at his not coming home in so much that her grief put her very much out of order and she had thrown her self down upon a couch in her chamber but had ordered her servants not to fail to call her as soon as their master came in  as soon as he came in which was later than his usual time and upon enquiring for his wife was told by the servants that she was very ill he ran directly up stairs into her chamber before any body could give her notice of his being come but the who listened too attentively to want a messenger heard him coming up stairs and rasing hastily off the couch she ran to the top of the stairs to him and taking him violently in her arms my dear says she forgive me that i have ungratefully insulted and basely provoked the tenderest husband and the best temper in the world tears choked her words and she could say no more and having risen up and run cross the room too hastily the violence of that motion and of her own passions overcame her and she fainted  he called out for help and the servants immediately running in she was carried back to her chamber and in some short time she came to her self again but finding her husband sitting by her and very anxious for her it renewed her grief and made her for some time unable to express her self freely  when she was entirely recovered and fit to converse she ordered the servants to withdraw and then with abundance of tears she acknowledged to him how sensible she was that she had used him ill and that she had not behaved her self as became her in any of her carriage to him how afflicted she had been at his absence so long believing that she had exasperated him and grieved him and in short assured him she would endeavor to make him amends by a quite different behavior to him all her life after  the grief he had conceived at her swooning away and the surprise of it together with the extreme of joy he felt within himself at her declaring her resolutions of altering her conduct caused him to speak little to her except what he thought proper to comfort her till she pressed him by often repeating such questions as these my dear do you forgive me are you not angry were you not very angry and the like which made him after some pause answer thus  husb my dear i am not angry nay i was not angry i never knew what it was to be angry with you but i cannot say i was not grieved and heartily afflicted but you have abundantly made me amends and much more than i ever desired of you for i can allow of no submissions and subjections between you and i but those of love but you will add to my satisfaction more than you are aware of or than i can express if you will give me leave to ask you one question   wife what is that my dear i will answer you any question you can ask as well as i can   husb how long my dear after i left you was it before your affections prevailed over your passion to work this blessed change upon your mind   wife my dear you were not gone a quarter of an hour before my heart struck me that i had been unkind to you and i acknowledge that you had not deserved it at my hands   husb my dear i am satisfied fully satisfied the work is of god to him shall be the glory and i will take it for a blessed token that it shall not end here for his works are all perfect   the wife had no guess at what he meant by this and therefore made no reply but his joy at her answer proceeded from this that he knew the change was wrought in her that very time nay as near as he could guess the very moments that he as is noted before was earnestly praying to god not only to give him patience to bear the affliction but in his own time to open her eyes to her duty convince her of her sin and bring her to a sincere repentance vide page     and this was an unspeakable comfort to him  this affected him so much that as soon as he could possibly leave his wife he retired to his closet and with great thankfulness and joy gave praises to the divine goodness for this beginning of mercy not forgetting earnestly to pray that god would be pleased to carry on this work to a through awakening the conscience of his wife and bringing her to a sense of her duty to god and to sincere repentance for her former errors in which how he was heard and how effectually he was answered will appear in the following part of this work  the father of this young lady having as is said above been discoursing with her husband some time when they parted he went home where he found a letter directed to his daughter and which had come enclosed in one to him from his son who had gone abroad into the army as is noted already this letter he immediately sent away by a servant to his daughter and it was brought to her just at that time when her husband was withdrawn as above so that when he came back he found his wife all in tears again he hegan to comfort her thinking it was the effect of the same thing which had affected her before but she undeceived him by showing him the letter from her brother which was to this purpose dear sister while i had a hand to write to you i too seldom paid youthe respect which my affection and duty to you required and now i have neither a hand to write or a heart to dictate my last gave you an account of my being wounded at the siege of doway of which after some time i was cured though i lay all the winter sick at lisle now i am the miserablest object in the world i was taken prisoner of war last week and am brought to this place having my right arm broken by a musket ball and to morrow it must be cut off god is just sister i cut off my fathers right arm as to his family when i broke from him by violence and went abroad against his consent now i lose my right arm as a just retaliation i insulted my father upon my having an estate without him now i must come a begging to my father for bread or perish in misery for my estate is gone and i am out of commission god is just sister he is very just i hope you have begged my fathers pardon and obtained his blessing though i may never live to do it i have wrote to my father for some assistance but have little reason to expect it adieu  your dying brother cambray    0     the grief of this surprising letter and the concern she had been in before upon her breach with her husband put her into such an agony that she spoke not a word but incessantly grieved and wept nor could the tenderest most affectionate expressions of her husband who never stirred from her procure a word from her all that evening she went to bed indeed but got no sleep that night and by the next morning it had thrown her into a high fever which brought her to deaths door as we call it and as it pleased god that during the violence of her distemper she retained the perfect use of her senses so the sense of her danger awakened her to a sense of her duty as will appear in the next dialogue  the end of the third dialogue the fourth dialogue the last dialogue gave an account of the accident which had thrown the young married lady into a dangerous fever and left her in a very weak condition her husband as he was a tender affectionate relation and was in the utmost concern and affliction for her seeing a great deal of danger of her life so as he was also a serious christian he could not be without inexpressible anxieties for her future state he had been backward to speak to her of death or of any of the perplexities which were upon him for her condition least the impression should be assistant to the disease yet he thought it was his indispensible duty not to be wanting to make her sensible of her danger as to her souls condition and especially as to the breach with her father which he always acknowledged was unjustifiable and a great sin in her both against god and her father  while he was sitting mournfully by her and his heart oppressed with the struggle he had between his duty to tell her his thoughts and his fear of injuring her health by it she put an end to his trouble of that kind by beginning with him thus  wife my dear you see i am dying but i cannot go out of the world without repeating my acknowledgment to you that i have not carried it to you as became me or done either the duty of a wife or a christian as to you in particular especially your kindness to me considered and therefore i repeat my asking you pardon forgive me my dear and let me be assured you do it freely for this is not a time to compliment me   husb my dear i have been backward to speak because i would not oppress and discourage thee but i cannot deny that i fear thy danger is great as for what troubles thy mind about any carriage to me be as easy as if we were not yet come together i have not the least regret or resentment in my heart about it it is all to me as if it had never been done   wife then say you forgive me you must say so say you forgive me my dear   husb if i did not say so plainly before it was because i would not call it an offense but since you will have me to call it so i do forgive all that can be thought an offense against me with all the freedom and joy i am capable of the lord forgive all our offenses against him   wife then my dear i am satisfied and thankful and if god spare me farther life i will make thee full amends if it be in my power if not my request is let it answer all the reproaches that shall be cast upon me after i am gone by telling the whole world that i acknowledged it and asked you pardon   husb my dear let it take up none of your thoughts matters of greater moment are before thee if thy life is in danger as i fear i beg of thee my dear look up to him that gives life and to whom are the issues of life and of death   wife i have a sad prospect within a guilty soul and a hardened heart   husb but there is forgiveness with him that he may be feared and he will take away the heart of stone and give a heart of flesh   wife but it is very late to ask it now very late a sick bed is an ill time to repent in when the body is burdened with the force of a disease the soul oppressed with a fearful view of eternity and the senses seldom free to act their part   husb my dear but though it be very late it is never too late powerful grace is not restrained to time or limited by circumstances one relenting thought sincerely cast up to heaven one hearty wish one returning sigh can reach heaven be not afraid to cast thy soul at his feet whose nature and property is ever to have mercy and to forgive   wife i cannot say that it is not too late   husb remember then the words of our blessed savior himself be not afraid only believe my dear shall i desire the minister to make thee a visit and to pray with thee it may be god may direct him to speak something to thy comfort   wife no my dear those prayers of thine which i have wickedly and unkindly made my jest shall be now my only comfort and as god is just in bringing me to want thy prayers which i too much slighted so he is good and may be pleased to do me good by the means that i so wickedly contemned that others may know the duty of so dear a relation as husband and wife and i may if i should live know how to value them for the future will you pray with me my dear   husb as well as grief will permit me my dear i will with all my heart   upon her earnest request her husband prayed with her and she seemed so affected with the confession of sin which he made to be as it were the introductory part of his prayer that from that time forward he entertained great hopes of her being a true penitent  he avoided being long in respect of her weakness but as he was never from her either night or day she caused him to pray with her almost every two hours and sometimes would break out in short ejaculatory prayers for her self in which he could perceive mingled with deep humiliation and confession plain appearances of her having more hope of her future state than before  her husband encouraged by this in one of his prayers making confession of sin mentioned something of the errors and mistakes of youth which we are hurried into by the violence of our passions and the violent affection with which we entertain our pleasures and vanities and then went on to a confession of the sin of rejecting the council of our instructors and refusing to stoop to the just reproofs of those who we are committed to by the consequence of our relation or by our dependence upon them and who it is our duty to submit to thus proceeding to point out though gently the sin she had been guilty of in resisting the admonitions of her parents imploring gods pardon for it and that her eyes might be opened to see and acknowledge it  as soon as this prayer was over she turned her self toward him and reaching out her hands to him she embraced him with great passion and earnestness as her strength would permit my dear said she i bless god for what he has put into thy heart to say upon that subject i am convinced i have sinned greatly in that matter of my father i am convinced i am convinced repeating the words several times with very great earnestness and abundance of tears  her husband told her he was very glad to hear her say so much that it had layn much upon his mind to mention it to her but that he was loath to grieve her but he hoped that as god had been pleased to make her sensible of the evil of it so he would as of old in the case of the great penitent david no sooner give her a resolution to confess the sin but add the comfort of his pardon i said i will confess my transgression unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin  she looked up with a kind of a smile at these words and said god will for give me my dear though my father will not at which her husband said my dear if god forgive us it is not so much to us if others do not but i dare say if thy father heard thee he would not wait for any farther acknowledgment shall i let him know it said her husband i know his heart mourns for thee my dear said she i am in an ill condition to ask him forgiveness now but if he was here i would do it as well as i could with all my heart and here her tears again interrupting her she said no more  her husband found it was not proper to say much more to her at that time her distemper being violent so he withdrew secretly pleased to hear her speak with so much earnestness and concern about her father and immediately sent a servant to her father with a letter to tell him he desired to see him in the morning and withal wrote some account of the occasion the father though he took the news of her illness very heavily for he still loved her very tenderly yet received this part of the account with great satisfaction and came early in the morning to the house where his soninlaw gave him an account of all the particulars of his wises discourse  but it was too late for her fever had increased upon her with so much violence in the night that when her father came into the room she was speechless and to all outward appearance at the very point of death  her husband though passionately afflicted at so sad a sight yet willing to give her all the consolation he could spoke close to her ear that her father was come but she did not seem to take any notice of it her repeated it adding he was come to give her his blessing and assure her that he had forgiven all the breach between them at which words she opened her eyes and looked at her father but closed them immediately and remained speechless my dear said her husband give us a sign if you understand us would you have your father forgive you at which she lifted up her hand and pray for thee said her husband at which she lifted up her hand again and just opened her eyes but could not speak  this was a melancholy sight for two such near relations to bear nor did it afford any thing more that serves to our present purpose the father prayed by her bed side and gave god thanks for any appearances of mercy to her soul and committing her into the hands of her redeemer they retired expecting her departing every moment  but providence had otherwise determined it for though she lay in that condition two or three days yet it pleased god after that the fever seemed to abate and she came to her speech again and in a few days more grew better though so very weak as made her recovery be very slow  now a new care and anxiety seized upon her husband who though truly joyful at the hopes he had of his wifes recovery which a few days before there was no room to expect yet he could not but be fearful least her convictions should wear off with a sense of her danger as is usual in the case of deathbed repentance and that the near prospect of death now disappearing her love of vanity and pleasure should return with her health and therefore like one that truly loved her souls advantage as well as her personal welfare he began early to put her in mind of the debt she owed to the goodness of god which seemed to be giving her a new life and to whom the hours he should now bestow ought to be dedicated as given for that purpose his often repeating these things gave occasion to the following discourse which though it suffered several intermissions from her weakness yet it being all to the same purpose will be very well read as one continued dialogue she began with her husband upon the occasion as i have noted of his often repeating his cautions against forgetting after her recovering the sense of her state which she had upon her mind when she was in expectation of death  wife my dear says she i see what you are afraid of you fear i shall forget gods goodness to me as soon as i am recovered   husb i hope my dear you cannot forget neither what you are or what you were   wife but i see plainly you are anxious about it   husb my dear do not take it ill we are not ignorant of satans devices our adversary the devil like a roaring lion goes about seeking whom he may devour we are all too subject to forget the vows of our afflicted condition i am no otherwise afraid for thee than as we are all apt to do so   wife but has he not snatched me as a brand out of the fire zech       husb it is very true my dear   wife has he not ransomed me from the power of the grave hos         husb he has i hope ransomed thy soul too   wife has not my soul been precious in his sight sam         husb may god keep the remembrance of it always upon thy mind my dear   wife i am assured he will do so  she breaks out in an ecstasy of thankfulness and repeats the  d  d  th verses of the  0  psalm bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who heals all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with loving kindnesses and tender mercies   husb let me join my dear said her husband psalm            o thou my god save thy servant that trusts in thee be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily for thou o lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy to them that call upon thee   wife psalm       0 lord i have called daily upon thee i have stretched out my hands unto thee will thou show wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and praise thee   husb my dear i will be an echo to all thy breathings of this kind psalm       it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises to thy name o most high to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night   wife psalm  0        i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered like grass psalm           i love the lord because he has heard my voice and my supplication because he has inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call upon him as long as i live   husb the lord upholdeth all that fall and raises up all those that are bowed down he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them the lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him to all them that call upon him in truth   they continued thus in this blessed ecstasy of praising and giving thanks to god for some time every day and when ever he came into the chamber to see her he came always with some comforting text of scripture in his mouth which he had found out while he had been absent and this way of conversation between them lasted till she was thoroughly well when being come down stairs and beginning to take upon her again the affairs of her family after having been at church to render more solemnly her thanks to god in public for her recovery she called her husband to her and began this short discourse with him  wife my dear now god has been pleased to give me a new life and restore me to thee and to my family it is my part to testify my thankfulness to his goodness by a new way of living and therefore i wish you would begin with a solemn giving thanks in the family at your usual time of family worship   husb with all my heart my dear   wife you shall see my dear i shall no more discountenance the service and worship of god in my family as i formerly did to my shame be it spoken   husb do not mention that any more my dear i hope it is forgotten above he remembers our sins no more and it is meet it should be forgotten with me   wife but i shall never forget to mention it with shame and reproaches upon my self as long as i live and therefore it is that i desire to be now the first to promote and forward that blessed work which i was so much the hindrance of before   husb i rejoice my dear at the encouragement you will give to our doing the duty of our station but the bare performance of a course of worship is the meanest part of what is required our whole lives must be squared according to those rules which god has set us to walk by that we may adorn the profession we make of religion and walk in the commandments and ordinances of god blameless luke       wife my dear i am not supposing that the form of our duty is the substance of it but as it is true that there may be the outward performance without the heart it is as true that where the heart is engaged there will be no omission of the outward performance and therefore i first thought my self obliged to give you this assurance of my willingness to comply with the outward performance and the rather because of what is past   husb my dear let us have no more reflections on what is past between us the remembrance of it is with great satisfaction buried with me   wife but my dear you must allow me to look back with regret and keep it always in my view i shall endeavor to remember you of it no otherwise than by showing you the reverse of it in my future behavior   husb that shall be a remembrance that will issue only in praises and thankfulness to gods infinite goodness and in an increase if that be possible of my affection to and delight in thee while i live   wife first then my dear be satisfied and assured i have entirely done with the follies of my former life and that i shall throw away no more time at the playhouse or in gaming those thieves of the affections and prodigal waster of time which time i have learned to know the value of at the appearance of eternity and hope i have now been furnished with knowledge from experience how to employ it to better advantage   he embraces her with tears of joy running down his cheeks husb god of his infinite mercy support those resolutions   wife my dear why do you show a concer at it why those tears   husb they are tears of joy my dear tear proceeding from a satisfaction otherwise inexpressible   wife are they not mingled with some doub and proceeding from some fear that i shall brea in again upon these resolutions as i have often times done before and as many people do afte their deathbed astonishments are over   husb no my dear i hope god in who strength you have made these vows will giv you grace and strength to keep them   wife my dear these thoughts of mine are not digested into formal vows and protestations things which often being made in our own strength we are justly forsaken by the divine assistance in and are left to break and fall from relapsing with greater violence into the very sins we in that manner abjure but i find my heart so fully convinced of the folly and vanity of those diversions the unsatisfying uninstructing pleasure of them the expense of those unvaluable moments in them which at death we would give millions to retrieve and the many other attending snares they are inseparable from that i look on them with the utmost detestation and reproach my self with the greatest admiration at the influence which those things had upon me   husb my dear this is a greater assurance to me of the stability of thy resolutions than a thousand formal oaths and vows against them which as you well observe being often made in our own strength god is pleased for our mortification to leave us to break and which also the devil never gives over soliciting us to forget and undervalue   wife well my dear i hope i shall never alter my sentiments of these things and you may i hope depend upon it that neither the practice it self or the company that used to make those things delightful to me will ever be tolerable to me again   husb my dear you must be civil to your acquaintance   wife truly it will be with difficulty that i shall be so to some of them and i shall miss no occasion of wearing out the acquaintance with them especially that of sir anthony and my lady light head   husb i believe my dear their company can be little diversion to you i cannot think they ever really were they have so little in them i think it was impossible   wife they have been engines in the hand of the devil to do me mischief and to make me run a dreadful length in my own ruin both soul and body   husb it must be by mere drollery and mimick then for they have neither of them any such thing as solid wit or agreeable behavior   wife it has been by that bewitching thing called gallantry and honor by which my lady especially as it were bantered me out of a sense of all kind of duty either to god or man made me think it below me to regard relative obligations and ungenteel to be bound by the duties either of a child to my father or of a wife to my husband   husb she has done thee no harm in the main i hope   wife she has employed me my dear these five year in diligently laying up a vast stock for repentance and making work for tears and reproaches as long as i live   husb those things often end worse my dear i fear they will end worse with them   wife if the end is any thing with me but rui of soul and body it must be the effect of infinit mercy and the free grace of god   husb and is not that a blessed fruit   wife but in the mean time it is a fountain o secret regret self abhorrence constant reproaches and sighs that break the very sou this is the fruit i have of those things whereof  am now ashamed   husb a blessed fruit it is however in the end viz the peaceable fruit of righteousness to the saving of the soul   wife but what mortification what regret what havoc has it made in my soul here i have been an undutiful child a terror to my relations a grief to my father and mother the ruin of my brother   tears stopped her speech for a while at the mention of her brother husb do not mention that now my dear   wife not mention it yes i must mention it he is undone and i was partner with him in his sin nay i was worse than he why has god ruined him and spared me i was a rebel to my father i have been a traitor to thee my dear and above all a forsaker of god and a despiser of religion and all that was good and why am not i destroyed rather than my dear brother   husb but god that gives repentance gives also pardon and blessed be god thou art now rejoicing in hope   wife ay my dear but what work is here for repentance not toward god only but to every one else i have asked forgiveness of thee my dear and i ought to do it to my brother and of my father and they ought all to refuse me   husb but i am sure we are all too glad of the occasion to entertain such a thought where god is pleased to pardon who is man that he should resent i dare say thy father forgives thee freely   wife well whether he will or no it is my duty to acknowledge my fault to him   husb my dear thou have done it already and he is satisfied he will be here to visit us to night   wife but that is not sufficient to me   husb here thy father comes already   her father knocks at the door and comes in she runs to him falls on her knees and cried my dear father but fainted again and could not speak a word more and continued so ill afterward that she was obliged to be carried to bed which put the family into a great disorder fearing the return of her distemper after she had lain some time and was a little refreshed she desired her father and husband to come up into her chamber while she lay indisposed on her bed her husband had related to her father all the discourse that had passed between them which so affected her father that he could not bear giving her the uneasiness of farther confessions and therefore when she sent for them up the father spoke to her husband thus son i desire you will go up first and tell her word for word what i say to you as near as you can remember first tell her you have related to me the discourse that was between her and you and that i am fully satisfied with and rejoice in the acknowledgment she has made of her former carriage to me and of her design to acknowledge it farther that i already think it more than enough that as neither her weakness on the one hand can bear it so neither can my affection to her on the other hand bear any more submissions and therefore i will not come up to her unless she will promise you not to speak one word to me of it more but only hear what i shall say to her and so put an entire end to it    her husband did so and with much difficulty prevailed with her to promise upon which her father being brought in went to her and kissed her as she lay and praying earnestly in few words to god to bless her and continue his goodness to her he comforted her in the following manner   my dear child said he i have acknowledgments enough and am fully satisfied my joy and comfort is that god has given you a due and deep sense of your offenses against him and i hope has pardoned you also your offense against me is nothing but as it was a sin against him nor had i ever any other resentment of it but what my common affection could have prevailed over i rejoice that god has given you repentance and i think it as much my duty to forgive you now as i thought before i was obliged not to do it till you had acknowledged it therefore i freely and heartily forgive you as if you had never offended me and i make but this one condition of my forgiveness which i oblige you to comply with viz that you say not one word more by way of asking pardon for as you cannot bear to do it so neither can i to hear it  she kept her word as to speaking but abundance of tears testified how sensible she was of what her father had said to her and thus an entire reconciliation was made of all that was past and she proved ever after a sober religious and shining christian a dutiful affectionate daughter to her parents a tender and obliging wife to her husband and a careful instructing mother to her children  the tragical part of this story remains and will make the conclusion of this work the subject is the miserable wretched case of the young gentleman the brother to this lady and who had gone abroad as has been said but was partly by his wounds sickness and misfortune but principally by his vices and extravagance reduced to the last extremity of misery had wasted his estate sold his commission lost one of his arms and was brought to the necessity of writing to his father for subsistence and for money to bring him over to england of which the particulars will appear in the next dialogue  the end of the fourth dialogue the fifth dialogue in the last dialogue you have some account of the condition the young gentleman formerly mentioned was reduced to in a letter to his sister dated from cambray where he was under cure of his wounds  it seems his extravagance had reduced him to the last extremity and having had his arm cut off and falling into a long fit of sickness after it though he was exchanged by virtue of the cartel for exchange of prisoners and so had his freedom yet he could not be removed and was at last obliged to sell his commission after which seeing himself reduced to great extremities and the utmost misery even of wanting bread being in his view he wrote a second letter to his father which being brought by a person who gave a particular account of his condition moved his father to take compassion of him and relieve him  his letter to his father was thus sir as i have little reason to expect any relief from you so duty ought to have moved me not to have given you the affliction of knowing my condition perhaps however while you may be moved with my disasters it may be some satisfaction to you to see that he who went away without your blessing is brought to the necessity of seeking to you for his bread if it be your pleasure that i shall perish here in misery and friendless i am ready to submit to the sentence from your mouth as a just punishment but if you have so much concern for my life as to cause me to be brought over that i may die in my native country the bearer will acquaint you how such undeserved bounty will be received by  etc    the tender compassionate father though he resented his sons treatment of him deeply enough and steadily adhered to the resolution of never receiving him into his family unless he acknowledged his first crime viz of withstanding the reformation of his fathers house yet being by no means obliged by that resolution not to relieve him in distress or to let him starve in a strange country having enquired into the particulars of his circumstances from the gentleman who brought the letter and understanding by him that his son was reduced to the utmost distress he immediately remitted money over to a dutch merchant at lisle with orders to give him present subsistence and to bring him from cambray thither in order to his being sent over to england all which the said merchant effectually performed and the poor reduced gentleman arrived at london soon after  it was the very same day of his arrival when he caused his father to have notice that he was coming to lay himself at his door but the father though he had relieved him and designed to take care that he should not want yet judging it needful to let him know that his resentments had been very just and that he was to be satisfied further with relation to things past before he could be restored to the state of an eldest son if ever that was to be done at all gave him the mortification of fignifying to him by a messenger that he was not to be admitted to see his father or to come into his house yet but that he was to go to such a place not far off where a lodging was provided for him  this afflicted him extremely at first it threw him into a violent passion expostulating with the messenger in such words as these what has my father brought me thus far but to trample on my misery and to make his resentment sink the deeper or has he brought me like a criminal to the place of execution thus as he may think it to do justice upon me why had he not suffered me to perish where i was rather than come hither to die with the more affliction and reproach the messenger told him his business was not to dispute with him but to deliver his message that he had no further instructions and so giving the coach man directions where to go he told the poor gentleman he would go before to receive him and took his leave  the unhappy gentleman bid the coach man go on and in a little time he found himself passing by his fathers door this struck him with an inexpressible grief even into an agony of shame anger and despair when in that very moment his dream came to his mind which he had related to his sister and which we have set down in the first dialogue of this part viz how that having his arm shot off and being relieved by his father abroad and brought over though he came to his fathers door yet he would not take him in but had ordered him to a neighbors house etc  as soon as this revolved upon his thoughts it immediately quieted him and he broke out into this expression well now i see that nothing befalls us without the determinate will of that sovereign power that guides and governs the whole world this was so long ago represented to me in a dream how exactly is every step of it come to pass upon me god is just and it is my part to submit  this quieted his mind for some time and he went on to the house which his father had appointed him where he found the servant who as he had said went before who helped him in for he was so weak he could hardly go and coming into a chamber provided for him fetching a deep sigh he threw himself on the bed without speaking a word and in this condition he remained all that night and part of the next day no body coming to him but the people of the house who were however directed to attend him and supply him with necessaries  in the evening he heard a coach stop at the door and soon after a lady coming up stairs who was brought into his chamber and who he presently knew to be his sister she found him very weak sitting in a chair by the fire leaning his head upon his hand and his elbow on a table that stood by him his eyes fixed on the ground his countenance to the last degree dejected pale and thin and in short as like a spectre as any thing that was real flesh and blood could be supposed to be as she came forward into the room he lifted up his eyes and said only this word sister and would have risen up but had not strength she designed to have embraced him but when she saw him she was frighted and amazed and sat down over against him at some distance being ready to swoon away at first she could hardly be convinced it was really her brother and when she was satisfied of that the very seeing him in that condition struck her with such grief that she could not speak a word to him for a great while being recovered a little my dear brother said she and would have gone on but she burst out into tears however these transports which the surpirze of seeing him in such a condition might very well be supposed to work in so near a relation being a little over they began to discourse a little together and after the usual questions concerning his health and the proper remedies to be used to recover his strength and the like the following dialogue contains the substance of their discourse  sister dear brother but what makes you so dejected and why have you lost your courage so much at your disasters i hope with taking care of your self and proper remedies being used you may recover but if your spirits are sunk you will fall under the weight of your own melancholy and be lost without remedy   bro dear sister not all my disasters not the loss of my arm or the cruel operations of the surgeons not the having wasted my estate not my being reduced to want bread not all that has befallen me or that could befall me in the world has ever been able to sink my spirits and cast me so low as this part of my tragedy   sister what part brother   bro why that my father who kindly relieved me when i wrote to him of my distress who ordered me to be brought home as i thought that according to my request i might die in my native country should instead of that common compassion which nature dictates for men in misery bring me hither but just as they do malefactors to die with the more shame and not suffering me to come within his doors should send me hither as it were to an hospital to be kept upon his charity like one who although he would not have starved he had relieved not in favor but that he might die with the most exquisite tortures of the mind this he could not but know such a thing would produce and must produce in a soul that had any sense of misery left   sister you lay it too much to heart brother that is not my fathers design   bro yes yes that is the design why else had he not ordered me to some hospital or place of retreat some place where i need not have been a spectacle to and the reproach of his servants and the contempt of all my acquaintance but he shall have his full satisfaction over me and i will as i dreamed i had done cause my self to be carried to his gate that he may say he had the pleasure to see his eldest son die at his door   sister your grief permits you not to make a right judgment of things i beg you will weigh the circumstances of every part and you will find my father has quite other designs toward you   bro it cannot be sister for why this triumph then over my disasters it is impossible   sister you cannot think so hardly of my father you should rather conclude that his bringing you so near him is in order to restoring you entirely and a little patience would give you light in that matter   bro has he so much as given me the least intimation of it on the contrary has he not brought me to pass by his very door and sent his messengers to command me to come no nearer to him nor himself so much as vouchsafe to see me   sister you should consider brother the terms on which you stand with my father with respect to your going away and the obligation he is under of expecting some terms before you are restored   bro i know what you mean sister i could have made any submissions had he not brought me thus as it were upon a stage to be a spectacle to all people and make a private breach become public by a scandalous penance now i can never do it though i were much more convinced of the crime than i am it is impossible no i cannot do it if i starve here   sister dear brother do not talk of that you shall not starve i have had too much hand in your miseries to suffer you to starve though my father would but you will not find my faiher inclines to any thing unkind but dear brother you are i hope too sensible of the mistake we both committed to be unwilling to give my father that small satisfaction he requires which is but a bare acknowledgment of having done amiss i have done it with the greatest sincerity and with the greatest peace and satisfaction to my self in the world to tell you true i had really no true peace or satisfaction till i did do it   bro well sister before i speak of that let me observe to you that your words put me in mind of my old dream again which you cannot but remember i told you of at my aunts and it is fulfilled in every part for i am brought to my fathers very door and being refused leave to come in am sent hither to be kept as in an hospital under cure and you only just as i dreamed are come to visit me acknowledging you having submitted to my father and persuading me to do the same god is just sister god is just and i have brought all this upon my self but my father is cruel and tyranizes over my distress and that i cannot bear   sister dear brother it is very wonderful and i have often thought on that dream and of my aunts prediction also about the same time viz that you would be brought to want bread and to beg my father to relieve you though i was in hopes it would never have come to that pass   bro it is a testimony that nothing befalls us without an invisible hand i acknowledge his justice but i cannot but think that my father is very severe and indeed very cruel   sister that is because you take the first part of this affair without the subsequent which is in his design and which i hope will make all end well still if you can be persuaded to act with temper and patience   bro that is upon supposition i perceive that my condition will oblige me to make the utmost submissions merely for want of subsistence whether i am sensible of the crime or no   sister dear brother i hope you are sensible of it if such judgments as you have met with cannot make you sensible nothing will however as all your dream is not come to pass i shall fulfill the rest by which besides my respect to you that excuse shall be taken away viz that you are necessitated to make submissions for bread i hope you will do it from a mere sense of the sin and of gods anger and justice as well as of your fathers displeasure and that you may not be in a necessity of doing it otherwise take that part of your dream too for your present comfort for you dreamed i brought you some money   she puts a purse of gold into his hand bro dear sister you are too kind but i am past this kind of consolation   sister as you are reduced to want necessaries you cannot be past receiving some satisfaction from a supply   bro if with my estate i had lost all sense of honor were grown as low spirited as i am low circumstanced i might cringe and stoop as a beggar at a door but if my father seeks to suppress the soul by the afflictions of the body as it is more than cruel in him so it is insupportable to me and i must deliver my self sister   sister if you had not at first disobliged him to the highest degree you would have had reason in what you say but if what my father expects now be no more than he expected when you were in your best circumstances no more than you made the condition of your return by receiving the assurance of its being the consequence of your going away and that even before you went and above all if it be no more than as a parent and a master of a family he was obliged to do to preserve that authority which you and i unhappily opposed then you cannot call his carrying it thus to you now an imposing upon you or insulting your misery i know it is not in his nature to do so if it had brother why did he answer your letters send you relief be at the expense of bringing you over and providing for you here has not this pity saved your life   bro but is not this way of giving life worse than death i know how to deliver my self he that dares die knows how to revenge himself of all the world   sister that is talking more like a soldier brother than a christian nay according to the notions of philosophy which you and i used to talk of it is talking like a coward not like a man of courage since what they call true courage consists in sustaining the mind under the most pressing afflictions and passive valor is the greatest extreme of true magnanimity whereas he that destroys himself is a coward and dies for fear of the bitterness of life   bro there are some circumstances which may overcome even human nature it self and among these to be insulted in distress is the most insupportable i could die by torture with much more ease   sister but dear brother you put the falsest construction imaginable upon your present circumstances my father has put no insult upon you and means you none you know the just engagements he is under binds him to what he does   bro is it no insult sister to bring me to his own door and then send a servant to tell me i must not be taken in but go to such a place   sister had there been nothing between you before that makes that proceeding reasonable it might have been thought hard but you cannot but own my father has been provoked   bro you were of another mind once sister   sister dear brother i acknowledge with the greatest affliction imaginable that i was doubly unhappy in being so that i was too much the wicked instrument to encourage you in that course which has reduced you to this misery and it has cost me more tears than you can imagine to think that i that loved you so dearly should have so much hand in your ruin   bro it has cost me more blood than it has cost you tears   sister that may be true too but my repentance has been severe enough   bro and pray how has it issued i wish you would give me the short history that i may judge how to regulate my conduct by yours   sister i was your unhappy pattern before i pray god extend the same grace to you now that as we sinned together we may be witnesses together of our repentance my case is thus   here she relates to him all her own story from her marriage to her reconciliation with her father as related in the dialogues foregoing bro your story is very remarkable indeed your husbands conduct must be admired but dear sister my father did not deal with you as he does with me if he had it would have fired your spirits and filled you with indignation rather than have engaged you to an acknowledgment   sister you misconstrue my fathers intentions extremely   bro what misconstruction can it be am i not here was i not brought to his door was i not shut out and turned here after five years absence has my father or mother or any of the family come or so much as sent a servant to see me   sister dear brother do not let your passions be your temptation i am come to see you   bro you are like your self kind and good but what is this to them   sister are you supposing then brother that i came without my fathers knowledge no brother i came to discourse with you that you may be easy and that my father may have room to act what his own compassionate inclinations move him to and to receive you with the same freedom and affection that he did me   bro then i am not to treat with you now as my sister but as an ambassador or a mediator   sister i entreat you dear brother let us be serious it is for your life   bro my life alas that is not worth a treaty i wish as it is in my power to give it it were in his to take it you should see i would die like his son but scorn to be fed by his charity   sister but brother i am not treating with you on the subject of charity i will protect you my self from the need of any ones charity but as the foundation of this breach was wrong and as i hope you are now convinced of it as well as i am i would fain persuade you to a dutiful accommodation with my father who is ready to abate you the ceremony if he can but have the reality of such a repentance as god and your duty calls for and that you may do this freely and under no pretense of being reduced to it by your circumstances i brought you the relief you have nor shall you be suffered to want let it go how it will   bro what would you have me do   sister your own sense will dictate that to you   bro i acknowledge i am very sorry i have given him offense and especially that i went away without his leave methinks what i suffered for that crime should be enough   sister you may be sure i shall relate this with all the advantage i can to my father but the matter it self is so plain the message you might send would as plainly put an end to it   bro what plainer can i say   sister nay brother you do not want me to dictate   bro you would have me say i acknowledge i gave him just cause for all he did that i acted very wickedly in opposing him in his family orders and that i beg pardon of him and so fall down on my knees etc dear sister if i should i am such a criple i cannot get up again   sister dear brother i am sorry to see how it is with you i see plainly it is not in your heart and all that is in appearance will be but from the lip outward what can i do   bro i could have made any submissions if he had not brought me hither to do it in this manner but death i think would be a much easier portion to me now   sister it is in vain for you and i to dispute it brother tell me then what shall i say for you or what shall i do for you   bro say as above which is the truth that i regret so much the usage of me at last that i have nothing left to do but to satisfy my father that i will be as short a burden to him as possible   sister dear brother i cannot carry such a message consider of something fit for me to say and do not provoke him at last when you are just casting your self upon him   bro tell him then what your kindest thoughts to me can suggest only not omitting to let him know that the repulse i have met with here is greater to me than all that has befallen me that i was prepared to have asked him pardon and in general i will do so still but that this has put me past all temper tell him just so and let it issue as it will   sister it is an uncomfortable message for me to carry but i must do as you bid me   bro i cannot say less without feigning a temper which if i should see my father i cannot make good or act over again for i cannot counterfeit and if i say more you will not be willing to carry the message therefore let it go so come of it what will   sister if i decline carrying any message it is for your sake that i may not injure your interest with my father and for no other reason   bro i know it sister and understand it also i hope you do not take amiss what i said   sister not at all i am only grieved that i do not see a prospect of doing you all the good i would do   bro i am such an object now that i do not see what condition to desire sister had my father received me kindly i should not have behaved unworthy of him though in so ill a condition but this indignity has placed me so far below any thing of a son that i shall be the contempt of his servants if i should come in   sister what then shall i ask of him   bro nothing sister nothing at all let him do just as he pleases   sister dear brother you act just the desperate part now where will it end   bro in the grave sister there i would have it end   sister i am sorry to see you so obstinate in your own ruin however i will do as well as i can for you   she leaves him in this humor not being able to obtain any thing of him and goes directly to her father who was waiting impatiently to hear what his son had said to her being himself disposed to have treated him with the utmost kindness and tenderness as soon as he saw her he began thus  fa well child have you seen your brother   dau yes sir i have seen a miserable object i am glad you did not see him at first   fa why so   dau i believe it would break your heart to see him he is lame with a wound in his knee one arm cut off thin and lean as one dying of a consumption he looks pale and melancholy and indeed is to the last degree dejected and disconsolate and withal he is mean and shabby in clothes i never saw such an object   fa but what temper is he in   dau an accident has disordered him otherwise he is as he used to be   fa what accident   dau why the servant you sent surprised him with telling him too hastily that you had ordered him to a lodging and not to bring him home and then to increase it the coach very unhappily drove by the door here and it grieved him so much to see himself brought to his fathers door and could not have leave to come in that he fell into a violent passion the people say he raged so much all night though they knew not at what that they were afraid he would destroy himself and he lays it so to heart still that it grieves me i know not what to do for him   she weeps fa i heard indeed that he flew out into a passion the fellow was a fool to deliver his message insolently and also to bring him by the door there was no need of it but as for not coming in he knew my terms of his return and i know that he expected no other before he came over but he might easily think my bringing him hither was in order to receive him kindly and make his submissions as cheap to him as i could   dau he would have scrupled no submissions i believe if this had not happened   fa but he does now it seems   dau no really he bid me say to you that he is very sorry he has given you offense and especially that he went away without your leave and that he will ask you pardon with all his heart   fa but child does he come to the main point will he acknowledge his sin against god and his father in resisting the just measures taken for the reformation of our family and his leaving the house upon that account for which i solemnly declared to him that if he went away upon that score he should never return but as a penitent   dau i hope sir you will construe his asking you pardon in general to contain all that   fa why should i construe it child a way that he does not declare it to be understood for i have had some information already that he resolves the contrary   dau i am in hopes sir he will not declare that and i hope you will let his condition plead a little for him misery disorders our tempers as well as our body   fa but if his misery will not allow him to make so just an acknowledgment nor he will not free me from the engagements which he knows i am under it is he refuses to come in it is not i that shut him out it is a sad sign if so much suffering has not reached his heart to convince him of his sin   dau perhaps he may be better sir when his concern at this accident is a little over i am loath to afflict him for he is so weak i fear disturbing him may kill him   fa i could find in my heart to go to him my self   dau i cannot say sir whether it may be better or worse if he be in temper it must needs be to his advantage to have you see him but if his disturbance at this affair is not over though he be so low reduced i fear his obstinate temper   fa what does he think that i take occasion from his misery to force him to a submission   dau i cannot say but something of that is upon his mind   fa come then i have a thought of an expedient to remove his resentment for i will not leave him the least room to complain of me nor indeed do i desire or value a forced submission if god has not wrought a change upon him by his afflictions it is not my forcing him that will do any good if he makes any acknowledgments from the power of his present necessities they will be but hypocritical and insincere and such a kind of penitence as will not be acceptable to god i am sure will be very unsatisfying to me   dau that is very true sir   fa i will tell you what you shall do go back to him and tell him i had no design to put any affront upon him or to suppress him in his affliction at all and if my servant behaved ill to him it was without my order   dau that will be a great comfort to him i dare say   fa then tell him he knows the reason why i cannot agree to take him home which reason it is in his power to remove when he pleases tell him that when he thinks fit to remove it effectually he shall be received with as much affection and kindness as he can expect but that it is below me to take advantage of his misery to oblige him to that submission though i have good reason to do so and that therefore i allow him to remove whether he pleases to go for his accommodation and i will allow him  0 l a year for his subsistence and there is  0 l for him for his present supply thus he is left entirely free either to comply with his father or not to comply with him as god shall please to influence his mind he can complain of no force or ill usage on my side   dau indeed sir i must acknowledge for him it is more than he can expect i will carry him the news and remove him this very night for he will break his heart if he stays there he reckons that he is only sent into an hospital but whether shall i remove him   fa where ever he will go   dau are you pleased sir that i shall carry him home to my house   fa i will direct nothing in that   she goes away to return to her brother and coming up to him finds him on the bed sister brother what are you not well   bro never worse body and mind   sister come will you get up   bro i cannot without help i am an emblem of mankind they can fall when they will but cannot rise without help   sister come i will help you up alas you are no heavier than a little child   she lifts him up bro well have you seen my father   sister dear brother we have such a father as no children in the world but us could ever offend   bro why what does he say   sister he is very angry with his servant for treating you so rudely and bringing you up to the door and has turned him out of doors for it he says he ordered no such thing and that you may not lay any thing of that to heart he has given me leave to carry you away from hence where i will or in short given you leave to remove to any part of the town where you please   bro sister i am willing enough to construe every thing my father does in the best sense but you mistake me the servant did not behave rudely nor was it his fault that i was brought up to the door the servant only did his message it was the nature of the message not the manner of it that was my surprise and for the rest it was only casual or providential the way i know lay by my fathers door and the coachman who knew nothing of it drove that way of course but it is the matter of the message and sending me hither as to an hospital to be kept in sight of his house and not admitted till i had performed so and so   sister well brother however my father says you quite mistake him he says he should have been very glad your own inclinations had led you to give him the satisfaction which he thinks is your debt and which you know he cannot go from that he hoped you had been convinced by the hand of god upon you both of your past sin and your present duty but that he scorns to put any force upon you or to press you by the violence of your necessities to comply with him it must be gods work or it can be no satisfaction to him and therefore he leaves you to your liberty   bro what does my father call liberty sister he leaves me to my liberty that is either to submit or starve come on my knees to him or beg is this leaving me to my liberty   sister dear brother see now how your passions and impatience misguide you my father is none of those tyrants he says he hopes god may still open your eyes that repentance is gods gift it is not in his power to force it that however you refuse or decline your duty to him he will do his duty to you and leave the issue to time to this purpose he will allow you  0 l a year for your handsome subsistence and has sent you  0 l more for your present supply and as you know the conditions of reconciliation to your father he says you have the keys of his door and the key of his affections too in your own pocket you may come in when you please   bro did my father say all this   sister yes indeed and if i had not prevented him i believe he would have come and told you so himself   bro why did you hinder him   sister why brother i was afraid of your passions least by too warm expressions you should do your self a prejudice and lessen that affectionate concern he has for you i know the different influence of words as they are well or ill placed   bro i am easily over come by kindness never by violence   sister will you not allow your father the same effect of flesh and blood   bro had my father come hither in that temper and said those words you say from him i should have thrown my self at his foot with more submission than he can expect   sister then i am sorry i hindered him i will go and fetch him still   bro no do not do that i cannot promise for my self at second hand   sister o brother you have not a sense of the crime though you have some sense of the kindness i hope still time may open your eyes for the present i would be glad to recover your spirits and cheer your thoughts a little that you may consider things with more composure will you tell me what course you will take   bro any course you shall direct only to remove me from this place   sister i doubt not it grieves you to look out of the back window and see your fathers garden gate   bro many other things make this place hateful to me   sister come you shall go home with me to my house i am sure my dear will make you very welcome   she takes him home in her coach where she used him with all the kindness and tenderness in the world but could never bring him to any sense of his duty to god or his father after some time having still his allowance from his father he grew melancholy and disturbed and offered two or three times to destroy himself but being recovered from that he removed from his sisters and god having not pleased to grant him either the grace of repentance for his former sins or to prevent future he fell into an extravagant life ill company and drinking and died in a miserable condition atheistical and impenitent having never seen his father nor so much as desiring it till on his deathbed being delirious he cried out for his father his father that he had abused his father and begged to see his father that he might ask him forgiveness but he died before his father who happened to be in the country could be sent for  finis
