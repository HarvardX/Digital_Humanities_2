necessary with regard to the difference of the french and english stage is taken from a comedy published last year by madame grafigny  let me be permitted to take this opportunity of returning my best thanks to the several performers for the cheerfulness with which they went through the fatigue of rehearsing and acting the public is the best judge of their merit and its favor the best proof of it  mr garrick is entitled to my sincerest gratitude for his performance as an actor and for his punctuality as a manager but his assistance in a thousand alterations his strong good sense with that spirit of theatrical criticism which is his peculiar natural genius give him a right to a great share of that applause with which this play was received the rest is friendship and esteem  dramatis

in paris eugenia act i mercour crosses the stage sees aemilia endeavors to avoid her she looks at him some time then speaks aemilia ah what a look was there how his eye started as from a thing of horror i am lost abandoned to an unavailing penitence to the upbraidings of my own weak heart looking after him to virtues keen reproaches mercour mercour  for all the promised joys of love and constancy oh teach me not to feel what now i am or to forget what late i was how blessed with innocence  alas now lost for ever  mercour speaking as he exters it was the music of aemilias voice though much untuned from its delightful sounds when harmonisd by love tell me my heart why did aemilia call me  aemilia did i call you  mercour repeatedly with accent most alarming  aemilia it was the voice of sorrow and despair not mine  mercour despair but how can it approach you by friendship guarded in the arms of love yet whence those startings of the soul that rend the laboring breast why melts your eye upon me whence is that paleness on my fairones cheek where rosy love with pleasures blushes glowing was wont to dwell amidst the smiles of beauty  aemilia and sure  forbid it love  youre altered too are you the same as constant to our friendship   mercour as you are beautiful why doubts aemilia her wondrous power of charming  aemilia yet even now your eye meets mine with pain some secret purpose turns it aside and that once dear protesting which love was wont to warm with his own language falls feebly from your tongue yet treat me nobly for such a waste of tenderness and truth is it too much  for all that i have suffered for all i am still to suffer  to expect a little kind sincerity  mercour aemilia can she suspect the heart that she has formed where fits her image in the power of beauty to rule its passions and inspire its wishes  aemilia tell me my fate nor fear that i will upbraid you nor shall my rage nor shall my tears upbraid you nor even my love i will find a thousand reasons to justify your change i will tell my heart midst its resenting beatings that your passions are not your own that loves inconstant pleasures are sacred to your lordly sex that men however just to honor with each other should scorn their fond engagements with a woman  mercour i would be just to both for some days past i own my thoughts have been perplexed confused a thousand varying projects for your happiness   aemilia my happiness  mercour oh my souls highest pride does it become the dignity of love to steal into your arms to hide our joys in darkness and concealment i will no longer bear these uncertain casual hours of bliss but let the world behold and envy me the rich possession of aemilias beauties  i will make you mine for ever  aemilia yours for ever oh let my heart pour forth its joy in thanks forgive the unkind suspicions the reproaches   mercour they were suspicions that arose from love but will you hear  aemilia my soul is listening to you  mercour my father to support his countrys honor and his own noble birth in foreign embassies consumed a fair estate and left his sons my brother and myself dependant vilely upon my uncles bounty  aemilia oh how nobly has he discharged the sacred trust of friendship and duty of a parent  mercour true his duty then how are we obliged curse on the name of obligation how my soul disdains this insolence of goodness that enslaves the freeborn mind is not his every act an insult on our wants has he not gained from our distress the name he most delights in the name of good methinks a rich return for trivial benefits without the slavery of endless gratitude  aemilia surely you mean tinsult my understanding as for me he took me in distress of infancy the orphan of his friend with every tenderness even of a parents care he formed my youth alas in vain to sentiments of virtue here were no ties of blood no sense of duty twas innate goodness and my grateful soul through all its feelings thanks him but forgive me i interrupted you  mercour the fair eugenia his much loved daughter   aemilia aside ah what means my heart by its tumultuous beating  mercour vain and haughty bred in the virtuous principles of pride by her affected governess   aemilia orphisa  mercour ay she who even in poverty assumes an insolence that treats me with disdain and has refused a bribe which might have purchased a wealthier honesty  aemilia a bribe for what  mercour i would have gained her to befriend my purpose on her fair pupil midst the solemn lessons with which forsooth she forms her heart to wisdom to steal a kindly mention of my love into her breast and mix me with its passions  aemilia wildness and horror passions love eugenia yet yet be kind and ease my tortured heart  mercour this morn i mean to ask her of her father and if he easy man should grant her to me with that unmeasurable wealth his age has long amassed when a few days are spent in the cold duties of the nuptial bed well fly aemilia to some distant realm enjoy each other be a present wonder and leave to future times a bright example of constancy in love  aemilia a breathless horror heaves panting at my heart outcasts of virtue what nation will receive us whither fly wherever the sun drives round the various day it is the same sun that here beheld our guilt in vain the midnight cloud shall fall upon us nor shall the graves eternal darkness hide it twill rise to future worlds oh could we fly far from all human converse from ourselves from conscience and from memory   mercour aemilia i have no time to waste in idle arguments on visionary subjects let me rather demand your aid the assistance of your friendship with this fond girl it is your interest fairone and interest our best wisdom should instruct you to try your sexs arts to win her for me you know their softest moments  aemilia yes it is just most exquisitely just this purposed insult and mark it ye unhappy ones like me thus shall it ever prove who first betrays will first insult our weakness hear me sir fallen as i am from honor lost to fame and hateful to myself yet dare not think i basely can betray anothers innocence be wise and dread the wildness of my temper lest it start out in madness to destroy myself and thee with horrors worthy both exit mercour there goes the sexs virtue and their spirit but that i know her pride her sense of shame these too are female virtues i might fear the wildness of her threats but soft my uncle now for a soothing tale of love and rapture for my fair cousin yet  i think  i love her not like my brother for i know not what some sentimental merit mine are ardours kindling by nature at the sight of beauty but now my other face dear dear dissembling  enter dorimond mercour joy to the morning sir whose light restores your power of doing good your sole delight  dorimond thanks gentle nephew for methinks i feel your pious wish my soul sits light within me as conscious of some happier hours approaching  mercour it is heaven in bounty to the good and virtuous that gives this foretaste of approaching happiness and dashes the presumptuous villains hopes with visionary boadings  dorimond turning a little from mercour truly said how nobly just are all his sentiments  mercour no wonder sir i learned them all from you your converse and example   dorimond stop we here the rest were flattery let us change the subject when you and my fair ward aemilia meet i have observed nor think me grown too curious your eyes maintain a gentle correspondence of many a tender meaning  mercour aside then i am ruined  dorimond her father was my friend brave wise and honest you were his favorite he much esteemed you and made me first observe that open nature for which i since have loved you i know he gladly would have seen his daughter the happy wedded partner of your merit  mercour aside this stroke has thunder in it  dorimond therefore think if a full third of all that i possess can make you happy   mercour sir enjoy it long   dorimond i shall enjoy it if i make you happy  mercour nor me alone i long have known your bounty my very being yours let it extend in doing acts of charity compassion and universal love open the gates of liberty to wretches lost in dungeons relieve the oppressed assert the orphans rights and teach the widows heart to sing for joy with bounty guide the partial hand of fortune and make the virtuous happy  dorimond nor shall these the duties of our being be neglected but let me ask your heart how it approves of my proposal  mercour sir my will is yours and my obedience   dorimond no speak freely to me  mercour sir if i must obey you  let me own aemilia has her charms my eye confesses them but not the charm of looks the frail delight of beauty can subdue a heart like mine superior sense the beauties of the soul that dignity of sex which can chastise the wishes it inspires though pure as innocence  such are eugenias charms  dorimond eugenias  mercour sir  dorimond you stand amazed what can this transport mean  mercour oh give me back the dear the fatal name that my distraction uttered wild it started from the quick pantings of my heart  dorimond surprising in one of your cool temper knows eugenia your passion for her  mercour sir you hold me honest nor would i lose my own my selfesteem or bear the woundings of a secret baseness even for eugenias beauties then imagine whether i could presume without your leave to talk to her of love  dorimond still truly just i own i meant to give her to your brother his gayety of youth i thought might charm the fancy of a girl but as ye both divide my heart and share my best esteem it is to me indifferent who gains her i will propose you to her and shall plead your elder claim of birthright as of love  mercour may loves own eloquence inspire your tongue paint the pure passion of my love refined from sordid interests as from sensual meanings and with a parents soft authority oh win her to obedience  dorimond no i dare not i must disclaim all other influence than that of tender and persuasive reason  mercour let me disclaim it too ungenerous thought in which my honest heart had no concernment  dorimond going i do believe it  myrcour aside yes in truth you may the unlucky thought escaped me  dorimond returning but aemilia  my second care  i think your brothers heart is not insensible and she has beauty  my age rejoices in the hope this moment  yes  i will propose her to him for their union and yours with my eugenia are alone my earnest prayer to heaven exit mercour what easy creatures are these same honest men so credulous they are hardly worth deceiving but this governess  my uncle must discharge her though her pride will scorn to own i could suspect her honesty aemilia wed my brother  honor conscience i feel ye not then why should i believe an idiots tale about ye but  impossible  it is beyond hope  he never can consent  he comes and with him  arm in arm  a common soldier who can it be at sight of me they start it is guilt it is fear at least it is suspicion wellmanagd to produce most precious mischief  enter clerval clerval good morrow brother is our uncle risen  mercour he is since early morning and desires impatiently to see you  clerval i could wish he might not know you told me  mrrcour as you please  clerval i had engaged to do an act of kindness this morning for a brave unfortunate whom highly i esteem  mercour perhaps the person whom now you parted with  clerval the same his story which yet i am not at liberty to tell you is full of wonders mixed with such misfortunes   mercour has he been long at paris  clerval he arrived but lately from our settlements in india last night i brought him with me from the army where though concealed beneath that mean disguise yet his great spirit through the ranks of war diffused a soldiers warmth  the warmth of glory  mercour may i not know him i perhaps can serve him why may not i be trusted with this secret  clerval it is the secret of my friend not mine  mercour i am satisfied it is most noble in you to succor the distressed yet your own happiness might well employ a youthful lovers cares so near his nuptial day  clerval my nuptial day  mercour you seem surpised has not my uncle told you he means to give you his beloved daughter the fair   clerval eugenia  mercour no the fair aemilia in every real tenderness of heart as much his daughter as the young eugenia  clerval o my deluded soul how swift was hope to catch the imaginary joy oh brother  mercour now for a strain of rature aside speak good brothers  clerval in vain would i conceal my souls confusion i am untaught to hide the rising passion tell me for whom the happiest of his kind is the dear maid her sexs pride and envy for whom designed  mercour is she indeed this wonder  clerval sure she was formed in some indulgent hour which blessed the works of nature with perfection that truth and honor might with beauty dwell and virtue with the chaste delights of love  mercour such are the dreams of lovers as for me who think perchance with less mysterious reverence as with less rapture of a womans worth i take her   clerval brother  mercour for some wiser reasons some truer merit to deal frankly with you the fathers fortune is the daughters beauty  clerval be wiser still enjoy my uncles fortune let me possess  oh give her to my arms rich in herself in her own native wealth of youth and beauty give the charming maid and make your brother happy  mercour clerval hold these transports if i thought eugenia knew them much more encouraged them  we yet are brothers but learn to think less warmly of the woman whom you perhaps tomorrow may call sister exit clerval tomorrow and my sister what no more only a day and such a day of horror between my fate and me  enter delville clerval come now my lord and after fifteen years of banishment while every clime had its peculiar sorrows behold a new distress  delville sure i have seen afflictions various forms is there a grief that saddens human life i have not known  clerval eugenia  delville starting ha that start has meaning in it then you have heard you know  let me conjure you give me each circumstance   delville by holy friendship my wonder was to hear that name pronounced in accents of despair  clerval oh it was once  twas music tuned by love it is lost for ever my brothers wife my sister these are names my tongue must learn eugenias is no more pass but a few short hours  i dare not think on it my sisters lover misery and horror  delville fly to your uncle pour your heart before him the heart has a peculiar eloquence to plead the cause of love  clerval has not my brother the aids of art to paint the unconscious passion eugenias virtues though he feel them not her beauties though he gazed insensible are ample themes for counterfeited rapture but why  my lord your day of happiness though long overcast again is opening on you why should i cloud it over  delville and can you think that i will enjoy the blessings you restore me my sovereigns pardon honors friends and fame till you are happy nor despair my clerval for if without presumption to high heaven the virtuous must be happy  clerval whence my lord are your misfortunes then  delville from guilt and justice did i not break the laws of earth and heaven when for a point of honor false false honor i killed the partner of my soul my friend  i loved him i esteemed him  and i killed him  clerval the king the judge of honor as of justice declares you innocent  delville but in that court where conscience heavens vicegerent sits supreme who shall acquit me there  clerval you think too deeply  delville the king is gracious but in vain his mercy till i can find that dear that bosomed bliss for whom alone i live driven from her arms to hopeless banishment from the pure joys that bless the nuptial bed   clerval and yet my lord until your pardon pass the usual forms for you have powerful enemies this habit for a few hours no more must still conceal you  delville i will repress these longings of the heart and wait my clerval  think with what impatience for news of your eugenia  clerval my evgenia o sounds how charming to the hopes of love come love and virtue come unite your powers inspire my heart with honor how to gain her or teach it  oh  without a crime to lose her  act ii dorimond and eugenia meeting dorimond my mornings joy may all its dearest blessings as fall its dews on earth descend upon you sure my eugenia rising with the morn steals her complexion from her why those blushes a fathers praise is but the excess of fondness the overflowing of a heart that loves you  eugenia and can i wish it more this tender proof that your eugenias not displeasing to you is far beyond all praise  dorimond my lifes first blessing but yet its tender care and soft anxiety  for while my heart with pleasurable fondness pours its affections over you still it trembles with strongly imagd fears  eugenia alas my father  dorimond if heavens indulgence should no longer spare me to this delightful task to form your youth  but i will not pain thy gentle disposition i came to talk to you of happiness thou fondness of my soul  eugenia aside where will this end  dorimond tell me eugenia can a virgins heart conceive the chaste delights the pure endearments that dwell with wedded love where holy friendship inspires the mutual wish where equal interests produce an equal bliss where each is happy in the others happiness  eugenia sir may i own if the acquaintance of a man of worth be truly valuable how much more dear must his alliance be his kindred virtues to have my understanding formed improved enlarged by his superior sense to share in the esteem that is paid him by his friends or by the public voice that speaks his worth  if there were such a man   dorimond there is there is whom his own sex esteems for manly virtue and yours might love for every softer art which makes that virtue amiable but as the highest proof how dear i hold him for nature bids me love him as my kinsman i dare to trust him with eugenias happiness  eugenia aside it is  be still my heart  it must be clerval to dorimond what has my soul but gratitude and love what has my duty sir but its obedience to pay you back this wondrous tenderness  dorimond then take him from my hand my heart my judgment my happy nephew mercour ha that trembling that pale confusion on your frighted cheek what can it mean whence are those tears eugenia  eugenia they are not mine they start involuntary from passions not my own but sir my will my duty love and gratitude are mine and they shall all obey you  dorimond no my child i am a father would be thought a friend whom nature has entrusted with your happiness whose more experienced age might influence but not control your choice yet this hereafter for now my hearts too full  of tenderness going eugenia yet stay oh stay i will stop these gushing tears since they displease you do not leave me thus this the first time think how my heart must feel it i ever knew your anger your displeasure  dorimond embracing her is this to be displeased is this like anger indulgent nature hovers over her works as they yet rise to life with less fond pleasure than fills thy fathers breast nor will i ask why you are thus alarmed  some other time   enter orphisa orphisa take my daughter to your care exit dorimond eugenia orphisa orphisa your father strangely moved and you in tears could you offend him or can he be angry  eugenia though always most indulgent yet this morning  sure never was a fathers fondness shown in such exceeding tenderness  orphisa then what afflicts you thus  eugenia his tenderness orphisa afflicting as his anger yet even now he thinks me disobedient base ungrateful looking after dorimond oh sir  these tears  this sorrow of my soul  is this like disobedience this ingratitude turning to orphisa you madam who have formed my heart must know it am i ungrateful can ingratitude the basest vice that taints the human heart dwell with the lessons you have planted there  orphisa yet may i understand you  eugenia pray forgive me while he pronounced his morningblessings over me his looks were full of care and soft anxiety he talked to me of happiness of marriage and earnest wished to see my fate united with one whom be described with every art with every charm that gains esteem and love  orphisa aside sure i once knew the dear original of this delightful picture  pray go on  eugenia with conscious eye where joy and rapture shone i viewed the pleasing portrait i compared it with that which love had pictured on my heart and found the likeness real think orphisa what horrors filled my eye my heart my brain when with a much unusual warmth he cried then take him from my hand my heart my judgment my happy nephew  mercour  orphisa aside poor eugenia perceived he your confusion  eugenia it was not in the power of artifice sure not in my simplicity to hide or to disguise it while my tongue stopped faultering unknowing how to answer every feature too strongly told the aversion of my soul  orphisa whence this aversion in the worlds opinion which seldom judges wrong when it commends mercour has merit an extensive knowledge in letters and in men with every elegance that is formed and polished by the arts of courts may i not fear that mercours greatest fault is clervals being amiable  eugenia no madam it is not that my judgment disesteems him there is somewhat in him that my nature starts at an instinct of aversion  orphisa but his brother  i will allow his worth  yet all engagements   eugenia that never shall transgress the bounds of duty not even in thought  will you condemn them madam  orphisa i do i must without your fathers knowledge the maid who loves her innocence should blush if ever her wandering eye excite the hope of secret love it is even a crime to please which virtue startles at oh would eugenia exert the spirit of virtue let the sense of filial piety inspire her breast and at the marriagealtar offer up the passions of the heart that noblest sacrifice worthy of her of virtue and of heaven   eugenia and will high heaven be mocked with such a sacrifice and shall i give my hand that sacred pledge of love and truth to him my soul abhors shall i deceive even him shall i profane the altar and its rites with vows of falsehood there shall i learn dissimulation there first speak a language foreign to my heart ye blessed saints and angels shall ye hear my unhallowed lips pronounce the solemn promise of everlasting love to one i hate  orphisa all holy things forbid i durst not think it yet when the affections hear the voice of reason they rise like purest incense from the heart then who shall rob the father of his right his childs obedience not his voice alone it is natures primal law that bids obey and heaven has promised to this first of duties its first of blessings  eugenia but to live orphisa a mean dissembler of the hearts affections while duty coldly acts the part of love  guide of my youth directress of my life teach me for sure you know the unerring path that leads to happiness  orphisa there is but one not hard to find the unerring path of virtue virtue that in itself commands its happiness of every outward object independent i see youre moved at some more temperate hour we may resume the subject only this let not aversion prejudice or passion and above all let us not suffer clerval smiling to mix a lovers reasoning with our councils you must not see him  eugenia how can i avoid him look where he comes  orphisa retire depend upon me i will take a tender care of all your interests eugenia looking back as she goes out o clerval clerval  enter clerval orphisa as clerval enters how her eyes spoke a streaming tenderness beyond all power of language  clerval stay eugenia tell me my fate whatever you purpose for me cruel  o speak to me  unkind eugenia  orphisa sir she has ordered me   clerval there needs not madam a tale of cruel pity to inform me  i see it plain  that i am most undone your influence madam your too rigid virtue   orphisa you cannot sir imagine me your enemy  clerval i know you cannot be an enemy but can you be the lovers friend who think that love is weakness she whose virtue sits above the passions how can she forgive their least misrule in others can she pity those softer yieldings which she never experienced  orphisa i would not sir be thought insensible even to the softest yieldings of the heart for i have known them all aside clerval then tell eugenia let me conjure you tell her that my heart never felt the power of beauty for another nor hopes nor fears nor wishes that my eye never gazed with joy on any other form witness ye powers who view our inmost thoughts and see the mind yet rising into action did i ever think of happiness without her or feel a grief but as it gave her pain  orphisa is there not too much warmth too much of passion in this protesting when that youth and beauty whose very nature is decay and frailty which now inspire these transports shall decay will they not alter too will they not change  clerval yes madam when discretion sense and honor these are eugenias beauties change their nature then shall my passion change if it be passion it is formed of purer fire than that which warms our sense to beauty  orphisa sir i must confess these sentiments most noble i acknowledge when virtue rules the passions they are virtuous but how can i oblige you is it fitting  shall i the guardian of eugenias youth i who should aid her to control her heart fill her soft soul with loves tumultuous cares with love that in itself is all the passions  clerval i am perhaps but an improper judge of this calm temperate reasoning but my uncle  no motive there of duty can restrain you i know how highly he esteems your merit let me conjure you then   orphisa i must not hear you my duty sir forbids me lest my heart  it must not yield even to its own esteem aside seeing mercour nor shall it mercour to my just resentment even for that bold unworthy bribe you offered me  enter dorimond mercour mercour aside to dorimond good heaven forbid that i should do her wrong by my suspicions  dorimond i much fear you do not i have myself observed  but i will be satisfied  mercour there is a foolish softness in my nature that cannot see what i so late esteemed in the distress of guilt your pardon sir i must retire now mischief do thy pleasure aside exit dorimond to orphisa how happy madam did i think my daughter beneath your care with what delight behold her confiding to your truth the dearest treasure a fathers love possesses  orphisa have i wronged that confidence  dorimond how did my heart rejoice to own the obligation and repay it why must i charge you with ingratitude  orphisa ingratitude then i am fallen indeed aside i am so little used to such reproaches  forgive me sir  i know not how to answer them  dorimond madam this haughty air but ill befits the woman who can mix in dark intrigues to hurt the peace of families  orphisa am i this character am i so represented  dorimond i need not say how highly i esteemed you i honored as i thought superior merit but when i know you practice on my daughter to turn her heart aside from its obedience and scorn or hate whom i esteem and love   orphisa sir if you know this of me it is in vain to justify my conduct  dorimond it is indeed a maid of such a gentle disposition  who taught her passions who these strange aversions but madam for the little time eugenia shall have occasion for your services let me desire you may confine your cares within their proper bounds  orphisa it is fitting sir that i obey you exit dorimond clerval dorimond ha such matchless insolence it is ever thus when guilt is near discovery it boldly takes the conscious pride of innocence  clerval aside then my best hopes are lost much wronged orphisa o virtue ill rewarded  dorimond tell me nephew why is my house become the dark retreat of persons in disguise can clerval fall to such low intimates such mean society as this appears to be  clerval your pardon sir they who of late have gained your confidence have much abused it you yourself often told us the brave unfortunate are our best acquaintance they show us virtue may be much distressed and give us their example how to suffer  dorimond it is true but wherefore in disguise for virtue when justly conscious of her native worth disdains to walk in darkness and disguise or is he what he seems a common soldier  clerval as highly eminent in birth as merit sir a few hours shall give him to your friendship the man to whom i owe my life my honor and france her share of glory  dorimond i believe you suspicion shocks my nature i rely on your discretion to avoid engagements where friendship has a greater share than prudence nor will i ask the secret of your friend when i can serve him tell me but this action this gallant deed so glorious to his country may sure be told it is honor to repeat it  clerval it is gratitude it is friendship and my heart whenever you permit me will with joy   dorimond then come to my apartment i would talk with you of somewhat that concerns your happiness exeunt dor cler enter mercour joy friendship gratitude this gallant deed now some romantic tale shall quite subdue my uncles spirit clerval too regains his confidence no matter all my views are fixing to their point for now eugenia my haughty virtuous maid shewing a paper here lies thy fate and i the ruler of it rapturous thought to see her kneeling in the dust for pity and in her prides despair imploring me to save her from her shame from poverty  while he is reading aemilia enters aemilia is it my own disturbed imagination or do i see strange terror and confusion in every face i meet no there is a face that knows no change inflexible in mischief what can he smile it is more than common villainy when mercour deigns to smile and now he frowns as if some thought of goodness smote his heart  mercour starting aemilia most unlucky  but perhaps   aemilia i fear sir i disturb some hopeful project of most important goodness  mercour no aemilia twas nothing but some light and trivial thinking but may i hope we meet on other terms than when we parted last the tempest over reason enjoys the calm and temperate hears the voice of friendship  aemilia ay my temperate monitor thus far have i regained my native temper not to reproach the author of my ruin or call the violated host of heaven to witness to his perjuries no mercour the fault i own was mine for oh one night one false betraying night yet hear it not ye holy matrons and ye stainless virgins feebly i listened to the voice of virtue and gave away my soul to love  and ruin  mercour thus let me thank you for the dear remembrance that gives the blissful hour   aemilia and dare you think that i could mean with riotous intent to call imagination loosely forth to view the guilty scene too well i see how vilely you esteem me i deserve it yet think not sir i will stand a cold spectator to view the ruins of this happy dwelling for by eugenias tears too well i know thy terrors are abroad  mercour i will not answer the unkind suspicion all will soon be well and you my best aemilia shall be made the pledge of peace  aemilia ah me the pledge of peace  mercour dear to my heart as in the rapturous hour that gave you to my arms  but poverty  distress and penury  how should i support them were you to share them with me thus compelled sure proof of love i force my heart to yield thy beauties to another never more to gaze delighted on thee to exchange the melting sounds of tenderness and love for the cold name of sister  aemilia what new horrors  mercour to save your fame procure you wealth and honor by my advice my uncle is this moment proposing you to clerval   aemilia as his wife what shall i stain the holy marriage bed give to a noble unsuspecting youth the foul pollution of his brothers passions  mercour these are among the many things aemilia which if not known are not  aemilia do not i know them  mercour but not to tell  aemilia heaven will in thunders tell them  mercour if heaven told secrets of this kind in thunder sure it must roll unceasing  aemilia hear me mercour though heaven and hell should keep the guilty secret there is who will discover it  mercour who can  aemilia

aemilia mercour why what a wilful wayward thing is woman even in their best pursuits so loose of soul that every breath of passion shakes their frame and every fancy turns them but her threats  they too are weak and womanish eugenia  if she has aught of woman in her form their universal vanity their pride their wandering appetites their sense of shame and dread of infamy  she must be mine exit act iii dorimond mercour mercour showed her refusal in contempt or hatred or was it sir the consciousness of beauty that would be wooed and not unsought be won milton   dorimond sure it was more at mention of your name for she till then i thought with pleasure heard me trembling she stood as if some sudden horror had smote her heart  mercour only a virgin fear starting at marriage  dorimond i should rather think her hearts engaged already  mercour sure you wrong her could she with such a sense of filial duty engage her heart without your approbation or with her open and ingenuous nature could she have art to hide it  dorimond that i know not i think i might depend upon her choice would it were clerval  mercour starting what my brother sir perhaps  impossible  yet if i thought  though terrible to think it  that eugenia indulged a secret passion for my brother by all the hopes which my fond soul had formed i would resign would give her to his arms  dorimond how noble such disinterested passion  mercour may i confess even beautys rich possession eugenias beauty but my second wish  nearer to be allied to you and goodness in a sons right to wait upon your age with every grateful tenderness and care first taught me how to love first raised to hope the conscious humble spirit of my wishes  dorimond you have a dearer interest in my love than yet you know of nephew for

my esteem to you and to your virtue i bequeath eugenias youth to watch her beautys frailty and guard her from the world and its delusions  dorimond there spoke her heart her first last care was virtue why was i not informed of this before  mercour fearful perhaps from too much delicacy lest it might seem a lowintentiond fraud a base and bold attempt on your credulity   dorimond oh no i feel its truth it is in my heart a power that cannot lie eugenia too shall hear and will obey her mothers will  mercour how my soul thanks you yet my hearts too delicate to take her sir from any other influence than that of mutual love have i your leave to talk to her alone  dorimond most willingly i will send her to you yet remember nephew in all engagements where the hearts concerned the heart

father do i not stand amidst the works of heaven a lonely being where all creatures else allied by instinct duty or affection find mutual aid and comfort  orphisa yet who knows but youre descended from a line as noble as dorimonds high race  eugenia am i not rather the child of poverty whose wretched parents for some low interest sold her or perhaps oh save me from the thought the hapless

peace of mind or hurt your health misfortune then were guilt were parricide  dorimond too sure it will if you tear up the heart strings will not the lifeblood follow but my nephew  why comes he not i

why since her death has this bold guilty fraud for ten long months why has it been concealed  mercour sir should i aim the dagger at your life twas in my fear alarmed by my affection my gratitude and duty i resolved to wed this fair unknown to mix our blood with vileness and obscurity  dorimond i thank you for me you dared to violate the faith due to the sacred dead and her repentance twas for my sake you showed this fatal paper and urged its terrors poverty and shame to force her to a loathed detested marriage mercour your heart  but can it sir imagine bold as you are and sanguine in contrivance that i will resign my child turning to eugenia my ages comfort my only future hope  expose her youth her bloom of softness to despair and sorrow on this weak evidence this trivial paper

virtue are the same  the end epilogue written by colley cibber esquire spoken by mrs pritchard of all the various wonders wit can do whether to please the many or the few none charms an audience  like a stroke that is new now this choice secret found i dare engage has brought our solemn champion to the stage as if to reach this merit were no more than just to write  as none ever wrote before why here is a play now  of what kind to call it i know no more than  of what will befall it  whether the critics praise  or bolder bucks shall maul it in france twas comedy but here it is tragic and all by dint of pure poetic magic  mistake me not i dont by this aver that every poet is a conjurer ours is all sentiment blank verse and virtue distress  but yet no bloodshed to divert ye such plays in france perhaps may cut a figure but to our critics here they are mere soupmeagre though there they never stain their stage with blood yet english stomachs love substantial food give us the lightnings blaze the thunders roll the pointed dagger and the poisning bowl let drums and trumpets clangor swell the scene till the gored battle bleed in every vein we love the muses animating spark till gods meet gods and justle in the dark this now did something in the days of yore when lungs heroic made the galleries roar as for our bard the fatal die is thrown and now the question is  what says the town has he thrown in or is the dupe undone yet on your justice boldly he relied no party formed no partial friendship tried though love of praise his inmost soul inflame all feigned or forced applause he dares disclaim your candor  no  your judgment be his fame
