an essay on the history of parties and persecution in britain  beginning with a brief account of the testact and an historical enquiry into the reasons the original and the consequences of the occasional conformity of dissenters  with some remarks on the several attempts already made and now making for an occasional bill  enquiring how far the same may be esteemed a preservation to the church or an injury to the dissenters  london printed for j baker at the blackboy in paternosterrow      price   d  an essay etc in order to enquire critically into the reason and justice as well as consequences of an occasional bill or an act to prevent the occasional conformity of dissenters it seems necessary to state as distinctly and in a method as unexceptionable as may be the nature and original of the thing called occasional conformity and by what steps the present debates about it have come upon the stage  that this may be done with as little offense as possible we shall deduce things in a brief historical narration from undoubted testimony of fact recent to the memory of most observing men in this age and not to be contradicted by the false glosses or misrepresentations of any and if by this it should appear that the following are undoubted truths of unquestioned authority then all the vehemence which some have used in presenting the several acts against occasional conformity will appear so many attempts whether knowingly or ignorantly is not to the purpose against the constitution and against the just right of their country that is to say    if it it appears that the act of parliament called the testact has been inverted by the sinister designs of a party among us and being in its true intent and meaning formed against popish recusants only has been turned against our fellow protestants to the weakening and injuring the interest of the protestant religion in general in this kingdom   if it appears that it is a law unjust in its own nature and inconsistent with the native rights of the subjects of england as well as with the sovereignty of conscience which ought not to be imposed upon   if it appears inconsistent with the christian religion and with the principles and doctrine of the church of england   if the manner in which it is put in practice appears to be a plot against the peace of the nation and a constant handle to the strife of parties and oppression of the innocent if upon an impartial enquiry into the history of this law these things should appear then it may be worth our consideration whether we should still pursue a thing so fatal to the general good and be for ever sacrificing one another to the resentment of parties robbing each other of the peace liberty and birthright of englishmen under the forms but contrary to the true intent and meaning of the law  from this short introduction and in order to lay these things more plainly before us that english protestants may see what they are doing and may not sacrifice one another to the interests of the enemies of both we proceed to ransack from the beginning the records of these things that the truth being brought forth into a clear light and viewed with open unblinded eyes the present generation may have none to blame but themselves if they pull down the liberties and religion of their ancestors with their own hands  after the restoration of king charles ii had been for some years perfected and the court as well as the kingdom was gotten over their first transports enjoyed a full dominion over the puritanparty as they called them and had for two or three years suppressed the remains of them by severe prosecutions of dissenters suppressing conventicles fining imprisoning and confiscating the hearers and banishing as by the corporationact their ministers or preachers five miles from every considerable town and the like the nobility and gentry of england began to see that while their eyes had been taken up with pursuing these lesser evils of schism in religion among protestants they had as the consequence of such proceedings generally proves insensibly suffered the secret encroachments of rome and of france and opened a door to popery and tyranny  it would be too tedious a thing to undertake here what all our histories are full of viz to give an account by what insensible degrees the king influenced by the council of his brother a declared papist and by his own resolutions himself as appeared at his death being secretly a papist an account whereof shall in these tracts be at large made public suffered himself and all his councils to be acted and managed by the artifice of france and being himself a pensioner to the king of france brought his whole kingdom to be passively subservient and actively assistant to the rising exorbitance of that prince whose power so assisted has since grown too great for all europe and has cost this same nation whose blood and valor assisted them to rise so much blood and treasure since to reduce  at length though late the people of england took the alarm when in the year      the king of france made that dreadful eruption into holland attacking the dutch with three formidable armies at once without any provocation any satisfaction demanded or cause assigned save that he was ill satisfied in them  at the first of this war we wretchedly assisted france not only by land but declared war against the dutch and fell upon them by sea in a manner too dishonorable for an englishman to say much of viz falling upon their smyrna fleet while in full peace they might be supposed to come securely into our channel if not into our very harbors the rest we choose to cover with a hand of charity rather than expose the nakedness of those times more than the necessity of the present argument obliges us to  the successes of france against the dutch reduced the states to the brink of ruin and naerden being taken by the duke of luxemburgh it was expected that amsterdam which was but    miles off would have sent deputies to make their submission to france but in this interim the massacre of the de wits and the ruin of the barnavelt faction intervening the prince of orange afterward king william of glorious memory a prince born for the rescuing oppressed nations and for a refuge to the protestant religion was restored to the administration of the affairs in holland revived the courage of the desponding people and in a little time drove the french as fast out of the country as they came in  these things and the progress of the french in flanders alarmed england as we hinted above and put us upon enquiring into our state at home endeavors were used to bring england over and the pulse of the people in parliament beat so high against france that the court was obliged to make a show of changing sides peace was made with the dutch an offer of marriage of the princess mary afterward queen mary to the prince of orange and several measures taken which looked like a war with france though nothing less intended  an army was raised three millions seven hundred thousand pounds given by parliament for the carrying it on but such hold had the popish and french councils gotten in the english court that all the means which were possible to be used could never get the king to declare war but at last ended all in the treaty of nimeguen a peace wholly to the advantage of france  during these transactions the patriots of the protestant interest in this nation finding the influence which french and popish emissaries had on the king and finding the popish lords in the house always vigorous to oppose every thing which was for the advancing the new measures they applied themselves to several methods in order to weaken the popish party they could not yet obtain an act to prevent the popish lords sitting in the house but the present case was to prevent popish officers in the army who were so many and behaved so insolently that the army then raised and encamped at black heath under a pretense of the war with france was become a terror to the people and was called the cutthroat army  the earl of shaftsbury who till then had been one of the five capital letters which formed the word cabal was the man who contrived and brought in the proposal for a bill to dispossess these popish officers and the title of the act expressed the meaning and design of its being brought in the king the court and all the popish and french interest opposed it with all their might but the popular terror and the just fear the people were in of a popish army prevailed and it passed by a great majority neither did the king think fit to oppose himself to the stream of the whole nation at that time especially there being a great moneybill then depending in the house for no less than       0 l which would have been lost so the bill passed    carol   and is entitled an act for preventing dangers which may arise from popish recusants  this is the famous testact and that the true intent and meaning of this act and the reason of its making may more plainly appear the preamble to the act is thus for preventing dangers which may happen from popish recusants and for quieting the minds of his majestys good subjects the uneasiness of his majestys good subjects was at that time manifest to be their fears of the army and court being put into the hands of papists and the people who pushed on the act were those very people who espousing liberty and property obtained in contempt from the courtparty the name of whiggs  but further to explain this matter the court which with all possible management and art opposed this law endeavored to alarm the dissenters with their danger from this act and alderman love representative for the city of london a man of unspotted integrity was privately spoken to that he might oppose it on behalf of the dissenters this at first had some effect on the people but mr love seeing into the design avoided it and would not meddle on the other hand the persons who brought in the bill assured the dissenters there was no design to offer them any disturbance and that if they desired it they would bring in another bill afterward to exempt them from the penalties of the said act representing to them at the same time that if they struck in to oppose this act the bill against popery would be lost and both they and the church of england should fall together under the growing mischiefs arising from the power of papists in the court  the dissenters prevailed upon with these arguments and especially depending upon the promises of the churchmen unhappy credulity that the act had no view toward them and should in no wise be turned upon them acquiescd and to save the church of england sacrificed themselves and their posterity to the ingratitude of those that proposed it to them just thus the dissenters in ireland suffered themselves to be prevailed upon in the same case rather than to lose that happy bill last past there to prevent the growth of popery into the middle of which a certain noble person then in the ministry and lately become a convert to a principle perfectly new to what he formerly professed thrust into the middle of that act thereby to throw out all the faithful subjects of the government who spent their estates and some of their blood in the defense of londonderry against the popish army of king james from being trusted with the magistracy of the city they defended  in this manner and on this occasion and no other this act was passed which is now become so much the favorite of a party as to be thought the great defense of the church of england how and by what degrees it became so may not be improper to enquire  it was some years after the first passing of this act ere the effects of it on the dissenters were much taken notice of and during the first  0 years afterward the capitulation of those persons who brought it in was pretty well observed and though several persecutions happened in that time upon the dissenters by virtue of other penal laws which were turned against them yet this part of the law was not much insisted on till about the year    and    when the popish plot being turned into ridicule and several plots trumped up upon the dissenters partly to turn the odium of that plot upon them and partly to suppress them as a party joining with the whigs especially when the court undertook the modelling of corporations and brought writs of quowarranto against the charters of towns then this law was turned fullbut upon the dissenters and with all imaginable eagerness insisted upon even so much as to the common council men of the city of london nay they began to talk or offer at allowing no citizens to vote for common council men or aldermen but such as had taken the sacrament and to run it to all possible extremities they went this length that no man should be allowed a license to keep an alehouse unless he had taken the sacrament of the church and several sad stories are left upon record of persons falling into despair melancholy and madness for having acted against their consciences in that case till at last it was said a poor profligate wretch found out an expedient for it and finding a priest with as little religion as himself communicated with him professing to take it as no religious act for that he owned he was not fit to do it acknowledging himself a scandalous sinner but that being forced to do it or lose his license which was his livelihood he took it as common bread and wine etc there are other scandalous instances of the severity of those times which we omit being not willing to aggravate the grief of those things  by the public management of these times this act was thus brought on the stage as if made on purpose for the dissenters while at the same time the papists against whom it had really been made were upon every occasion forborne connived at and overlooked and all attempts to prosecute the law against them discouraged and discountenanced  this continued during the whole reign of king charles ii and in king jamess reign till the defeat of the duke of monmouth when the king in his speech to the parliament fairly told the house he could not want the service of the gentlemen of his own religion and openly dispensing with this law in the papists cajoled the dissenters with their share of the liberty  some of the dissenters it must be allowed were so far partial to their own ease as not to consider that it was given them at the expense of the constitution and that their enjoying the relaxation of penal statutes by the breath of the king was a stopping their mouths against the open breaches of the law and effectually taking from them any argument they might use against the dispensing power or the pulling down all the fortifications of our laws against popery and arbitrary government  but their eyes were soon opened and they saw the mistake time enough to join heartily with the church of england in restoring the liberties of their country and overthrowing the projected establishment of popery and then followed the revolution  during the whole reign of king william the testact slept in its native circumstance its first design in keeping papists out of public employment out of parliament army and civil list was effectually answered but the corrupt turning the edge upon the dissenters was discountenanced as what was not only not the interest of the nation but as what was not the true reason or intent and meaning of the bill the king who had a native aversion to all religious coercion had also the less inclination to push the severity of this law upon the dissenters because he knew in the original making that law it was not in the view either of the people or of the sovereign to give them the least disturbance on that account  yet here the dissenters committed another error for as if they were easier in their compliance in that they were not at all compelled they voluntarily complied with the law though they were sure no man would meet with encouragement in prosecuting them for the omission nor do we find in all this time any prosecution commenced against any protestant dissenter for taking or executing any office or place whether civil or military without taking the sacrament  this obtained the name of occasional conformity but the freedom with which the dissenters qualified themselves at their entering into such offices though there seemed no danger in the omission gave offense first to their own friends especially among those who having a more strict regard to their principles looked upon it as an inconsistency with their professed dissent from the church who complained openly that such who could on mere occasion of preferment and to shun a penalty conform ought not to be received again into the communion of particular congregations but as penitents  there were many who took up the weapons against this objection and thought to master it with arguments drawn from general charity but however they might prove the legality of a communion of charity with all orthodox christians or a general communion with the whole christian church yet it is most certain no full answer could be given to that part of occasional conformity which was submitted to by persons otherwise dissenting from the church merely to quality for preferment and places in the government which was the sum of the dispute at that time  this argument therefore being directly against them became exceeding popular and especially it appeared a little new to find the dissenters themselves vigorously disputing for conformity to that very church which they statedly separated from  no sooner was her present majesty come to the crown but the enemies of the toleration having as they thought an opportunity to oppress the dissenters began here they found nothing so proper to render them hated and odious to the people as the charge of hypocrisy and therefore immediately took hold of this as an advantage which offered against the dissenters and that would make their proceeding against them popular and specious and this introduced the first occasional bill  now as all extremes in the unhappy divisions of this nation have been fatal to the common liberty of the whole as well as to the parties themselves who run unadvisedly into them so here as the occcasional confor of those dissenters in general who run to the sacrament in that profane manner merely for a qualification grew scandalous and hateful even to their own brethren whose consciences were more strictly obeyed so the absolute restraining the liberty of occasional conforming in all that should enjoy any public employment tying them up from ever communicating or so much as hearing a sermon in a dissenting meeting or indeed in any foreign protestant church on pain of losing their employments and livelihood this always carried with it such an air of cruelty such an invasion of nativeright such an oppression of conscience such a visible inconsistency with the toleration and such a degree of persecution that all the moderate part even of the church of england it self opposed it  how it was first introduced and passed the house of commons how it was sent up to the lords for their concurrence how the lords returned it but with one amendment relating to some circumstances not essential to the bill and which the commons would gladly have quitted in their subsequent attempts and yet how the commons adhering to their first bill and the lords insisting on their amendment that bill was lost how the next session a second bill was brought in and sent up to the lords but the temper of persecution having lost ground was thrown out by the peers by a great majority and lastly how a third bill was brought into the house of commons and lost in their own house by the attempt to tack it to another bill and how that tacking project not only threw out the bill but even overthrew the party that had been all along so forward to promote it these are things so well known to every man that has any concern upon him for the public and the particulars have been made so public that we need do no more than refer the inquiring readers to the papers which have been already published on that occasion  when after this by the late courtrevolution in england a new turn was given to all our civil affairs and new faces appeared in the management as the warmth of the high church party appeared in several extravagancies so unbounded as we had reason to apprehend that they could be denied nothing and knew they would stick at nothing to raise their new party and effectually crush the old so it was expected this old affair should be revived  when we say expected it is needful to add that it was expected by every party the high party expected it they said one to another that now was the happy moment when it was in their power entirely not to establish the church only but so effectually to crush the interest of the dissenters as to render it impossible for them ever to rise again at least so as to make themselves formidable to the church  we might add here what that party promised themselves from the restoration of their friends the elections having gone generally in their favor how they reduced the toleration to such a pitch that they would no more have it allowed to be a toleration but an exemption from the penalty of certain laws how the academies and schools of the dissenters were threatened and prosecutions against some of them actually begun and how in all places they began to threaten the dissenters with shutting up their meeting houses and in many places rabbld pulled down and burnt their meeting houses but this may be referred to a more proper place this may we hope sufficiently prove that the friends of that party made no question but that an occasional bill should be immediately brought in  the dissenters testified early their just apprehensions when in the hurry of this change at court and the coming in of a new party like a flood the insults in their persons the injuries in their houses and meetings the abusive railing pamphlets and the tumultuous carrying of all kinds of elections against common rules of modesty and decency as well as right made it rational to them to think that nothing could be so severe but what they had reason to expect and therefore that an occasional bill should be introduced into the next parliament to the ruin of their liberty was one of the least things which they thought it was reasonable to fear  even those gentlemen who though willing for other reasons to join in the changes at court were yet of more moderate principles that were willing to have the late ministry deposed and admitted the new ministry as a means to such other ends as they had in view whether respecting this or that view yet unconcerned with any religious prospects these though they did not approve of the occasional bill as what they imagined needless to the church and tending to increase the vneasinesses of the people which they having settled the new management of civil affairs desired to bring to some settled condition yet it is plain expected the occasional bill to be pushed at the last session and as they expected it so they applied themselves to prevent it and as by the consequence appeared did prevent it  it will be needless to bring the complaints of the hot men against these last for their fatal moderation as they call it is an evidence that these men of moderation did effectually stop the current of that zeal or heat call it what you please which would have put forward such a bill it is enough that the house of commons governing themselves by moderate councils contrary to all the expectations hopes or fears as above offered nothing to the prejudice of the dissenters abridgd none of their liberties nor encouraged any of the heats without doors which would have pushed at the dissenters and the session passed over with a calmness as exceedingly mortifying to the enemies of peace as perhaps surprising to those who had been under apprehensions of other usage as above  by this happy conduct the dissenters began to take courage rebuilded their demolished meeting houses and promised to themselves that as her majesty had passed her royal word to preserve inviolable their privileges and religious liberty they should enjoy the same notwithstanding the former fears without any farther interruption  when on a sudden from a quarter whence they expected nothing of that kind and from hands which they well hoped would as they formerly had been held up in their favor the storm seems to be risen by what ever influence and with what ever design raised is not for us to enquire yet but we shall adjourn it with the words of the apostle we have many things to say but you cannot bear them now  we are now come to that unhappy time that crisis when we see the dissenters given up by their beloved patriots attacked by those who they justly placed their confidence in as the people from whom they expected protection and as another author writes sacrifizd to the partyinterest of those who pretended formerly to espouse them  this we say with respect to those people who to congratulate the new converts that come over to a party are pleased to see themselves ruined and the liberties of their posterity taken away in matters both civil and conscientious in order to form a secular interest and support their prospects relating to power management and administration we are speaking now of people without doors for of the parliament and proceedings within doors we may not now discourse  but above all it seems astonishing to unbiased judgments to find even the dissenters themselves less alarmed at their approaching bondage than they used to be willing to please themselves with hopes that the hands that this comes from cannot be supposed to hurt them willing to amuse themselves with the rumor that the bill now depending is differing from the former and less severe that it is qualified with some circumstances which makes them amends that it includes a farther security to the tolleration and the like  alas poor people when are ye to open your eyes when will heaven be pleased to restore you to your understanding what are you doing if the present bill is qualified with some clauses for your better liking it if the bitter pill is covered with a thin leaf of glittering metal if there are not all the severe things which you were formerly attacked with in this do you derive comfort from this or ought you not the rather to see the certainty of what is to come and that your bondage is made sure to you by the earnestpeny given you in the beginning  the present parliament are perhaps disposed to gentle methods and backward to bring upon you the weight you were formerly threatened with and you are pleased with the negative of your miseries and thankful that it is no worse  but have you looked at the formidable power of your enemies without doors have you inquired into their new measures how having as before miscarried in their attempts on you by the rash pushing all at once upon the whole of your destruction they now see their mistake and are acting wisely with you go to let us deal wisely with them was the ancient method of gods enemies and what is this wisdom but a gradual encroachment upon you and gaining by little and little what they would find less likely to prevail in if offered at once  fatal is their policy to wheedle you in they take hold of your party animosities and send over their hushais to counterfeit a revolt to you and to bring in your easy and impolitick leaders into measures with them at your cost forming a party to carry on temporal interest at the expense of your religious liberties and thus you are drawn in by the spies and cheats of a party to be agents in your own destruction  poor unhappy blinded people supinely sitting down pleased with the ruin of your liberty because it comes from hands that you think would not hurt you perhaps those people whom you rely so steadily upon are your friends and would not willingly injure you but they are not dissenters their opinion is not with you so it can be no point of conscience to them perhaps they do not see so far into the fatal consequences of your oppressions as you may soon have cause to do and are willing to give up a few points which they may not be sensible are fatal to your interest and as this may form a greater interest for them another way they think this the lesser mischief  but is this suitable to the sincerity of those pretenses these men have always made of a disinterested regard to the concerns of the dissenters is this according to the stipulations of the memorial to the p of o or is not this opening a door at which the apparent ruin of the tolleration must infallibly enter it is our duty to suppose that the parliament has no such view has no prospect or intention but to the better establishing the interest of the church and are not desirous of invading the tolleration or taking away the liberties of the dissenters or lessening their native rights but is not the restless pursuit of the ruin of the dissenters at the bottom of their conduct who prompt these things without doors and why do they content themselves with this part of their design at this time but perhaps because they foresaw they could obtain no more and because they are willing to get up every step they can toward that entire dominion over conscience which they hope to arrive to  it cannot be construed a reflection upon the parliament without manifest injustice to say that others may have abhorred destructive prospects in contriving what these may have no view but the general good in their enacting for the wholesomest laws have been perverted to the most wicked purposes as establishments of civil right to oppression corporationprivileges to monopoly royal prerogative to tyranny and church settlements to persecution and therefore while we charge the party who aim at the ruin of the toleration to be at the bottom of every attack against the dissenters we no more reproach the proceedings of the parliament than when we clear the parliament of any evil in such proceedings we may be said to acquit the contrivers and party who promote on all occasions the ruin of the dissenters liberty  that the present bill depending in the house may be with fewer restrictions than the last that there may be some clauses in favor of the toleration we cannot say but all this may be true and the moderation and justice of the houses are so far your safety but are there not clauses in the same law which lessen the liberties which the act of toleration either granted you or which were your right in consequence of the act of toleration or which are the native rights of englishmen are there no clauses which break in upon that liberty of conscience which we have so long insisted upon as a right which no humane power ought to invade are there no branches of persecution in it are there no powers given to your enemies to insult and oppress your consciences are there no poor innocent men who must forego their employments and starve their families or act against conscience to feed them are there no innocent people who must be driven from the dissenters to the church merely for subsistence or which is still worse are there no conscientious dissenters who must now perish and starve because they cannot totally conform being obliged to quit their employments because they cannot in mere conscience comply if none of these things are in the bill it is well but if there are let the dissenters flatter themselves as much they will that those on whose favor and judgment they so much depend acquiesce in the bill let them please themselves as much as they will in the negatives of the bill that this or that which was severe in the late bill was not in this they will find let this be as mild as it will it is yet so much the nearer to the persecution which the party designs it is yet a step forwarder to the approaching evil that waits behind the slower the poison the surer the operation the lingering consumption is most certain to kill and the toleration which is the aim of the party is so much the nearer to its fatal period  nor is the slumber of the dissenters and the lethargy that is upon them as to this matter the least of their danger when they are so divided in interests heated with animosities and engaged in parties that too many among them are willing to give up any thing and fall in with any body so they can but strengthen the party interest they pursue this is a foreboding signal of the ruin of their interest we speak not merely with respect to the present heats that rage among us but for several years past this has been the prevailing temper  and how else could they now rejoice in and propose things to themselves from the seeming conversion or revolt or what you will call it of a person known through many years of public conduct to bear a professed aversion to the revolution to the person of the king to the whole body being and very name of a dissenter is it for this man and his very few dependents that we are so willing to sacrifice the liberties of two millions of her majestys subjects is it to gain a man who no side ever thought capable of business whose interest never put an ounce in the scale of parties but who has been the derision of all sides and the contempt even of his own house is it for this mans favor that a whole party should deviate from their ancient steadiness and give up the rights and privileges of their countrymen  we look upon an attempt of this nature to be a plot upon the whigs in general and their interest as a party as well as upon the dissenters and this plot is to divide them and no doubt but it will have the desired effect for will the dissenters ever trust a low church whig again when they find that these have turned upon them in such a manner as this and flattering the other party put their hands to such a work as this smiling to the tories with jehv come see our zeal for the church  could there ever be a more effectual step to divide the interest of the whigs can one party ever betray another but it lessens their confidence one in another for ever after will a dissenter ever repose his safety again in the breast of a church whig or will a church whig ever believe a dissenter can trust him with his liberty after this and do not the enemy percieve it  were there no man of moderation left among the whole body to have recourse to to save us and when did this happen had it been when a majority of high flying interest had governed in the it might have been expected but when we boasted of the contrary to an extreme to have this storm arise from that quarter o hominem o mores  why should any man wonder that a nemine contradicente is added to the accounts we have of the progress of the affair we are upon how should it be expected that any one should contradict what those alone who it was always expected should oppose it had consented to do nay and as we are told were the originals i had almost said worse in the famous introduction of it into the  it might be expected here that somewhat should be said to the matter of the present bill depending but there may be more time for that and a time more proper  it may suffice at present to speak a little to the general design of a bill or act of parliament against the occasional conformity of dissenters whether it respects this bill or no and a little of that occasional conformity it self as they relate to what has been formerly transacted in both houses of parliament upon that head  we have not the least view in this to plead for the occasional conformity of the dissenters as it relates to a mere qualification a practice which it is manifest few of the dissenters defend which they are very much come off from and which has done much more prejudice to the dissenters themselves than to the church but it seems absolutely necessary in common justice to distinguish here between a voluntary ill practice of a few and a law to divest the subject either of his civil or religious right  we find many people who by their constant practice though dissenting in worship and in many things relating to discipline church government and ceremony have yet held it as a point of conscience to maintain a communion of charity with the church others though they do not choose to communicate with the church yet in such cases where the law requires it think themselves bound in conscience as they are to show obedience to the laws to comply with that occasionally which statedly they cannot do these we call conscientious conformers  if these things are merely matter of principle then oppressing these men must be the highest of persecution which persecution was censured in the preamble to the first occasional bill to be contrary to the principle of the christian religion and the doctrine of the church of england and it is to be noted here as well worth our reflection that both the first and second occasional bills were rejected because they were looked upon to be a degree of persecution  we cannot but think it is always reasonable to distinguish between preventing an evil practice and taking away a civil right and that this is the case here no body will dispute  the dissenters have injury enough in that they are by the letter of the law contrary to the intent and meaning of the whole legislature at the time of its making excluded from the common privileges in society with their fellow subjects viz of serving the public and receiving the reward of their prince for the expressions of their zeal and loyalty in the public service except upon the unhappy condition of doing that which as dissenters they may be not supposed capable to do  but to lay so severe an injunction that if ever they touch any public employ they shall never go to hear a sermon again or to communicate again in a meeting house this is persecution with a witness to compel to do any thing which is against our conscience to do otherwise though lawful in itself is persecution to restrain from doing what is in it self lawful and we may think to be duty to do is persecution and all the punishment inflicted in these cases is persecution in the abstract  it has been so often argued that this is no service to the church or to the high party that this argument seems perfectly useless to be repeated but we cannot but take notice that all the acts hitherto proposed have not seemed to have an eye to the church but to the civil preferments not to bring the dissenters over to the church but to keep them out of the offices of profit there lies the true aim in all this matter and this has been so visible in all the former practice that it needs little explanation  had the design been purely the bringing the dissenters over to the church they would let it alone where it is since nothing is more certain than this that the occasional conformity of dissenters has done more toward bringing all their posterity into the church than all the coecive laws penal statutes or other violence in the world could ever do and it is most remarkable that generally speaking wherever the parents have been occasional conformists the children have been total conformist so that this liberty taken by the dissenters has been the ruin of their strength the breaking of the principal families of their party and the indifferency of one age has terminated the dissenting of the next  this the high church men are not ignorant of and it is mentioned for this reason viz to prove that were the true interest of the church regarded in this case or at least were that true interest the end and design in these things they would entirely let the dissenters alone but the design in these things is so far from that is so remote from a religious view that it all centers in making parties keeping posts of profit and advantage and if possible keeping the dissenters out of them and which is yet worse the aim is at a dividing the interest of the whiggs which being linked to that of the dissenters has been too formidable for them to deal with but if the low church men can be brought to give up the dissenters  what then why they shall have the honor  of what of being devoured last and that is all they can promise themselves  and will the low church men give up the dissenters will they make a sacrifice of the consciences of their brethren to gain a small addition to their party interest what can be said to them we crave leave to remind them of two or three things    how long do ye think the new interest you are making will last upon so ill a foundation built how far can you go along with the new converts you are bringing over either they must turn whigs or you must turn high flyers the first can never be but by project and purpose to trick and deceive you and the last can never be but by unaccountable and most judicial blindness and if these cannot be then you cannot go far together   when they and you part and they go back to their own party you having in the highest manner provoked the dissenters are you able to stand the ground against popery and high flying mad men by your selves   remember the time when you were last tried and consider that two things will suit your present case   that when you were tried with popery and slavery the one from a popish prince the other from french maxims of government what was your case were you able to stand your ground alone were you not sensible of the impossibility of it and   when you were sensible of the contrary and made solemn invitations to the dissenters to stand by you and join with you did the dissenters abandon you did they make their court to king james at your expense as it is evident they might have done and were courted by the king to do in short did they serve you then as they are served by you no they resisted all the caresses of popery and and passiveobedience tories and chose affliction and hazard with that very church of england that now are for denying them the least public advantage from that government they have spent their blood and their money to support are these the men you will now sacrifice to the private views you have of a partystrength are these the returns to the dissenters for the putting themselves into your hands is this the temper promised them at the revolution is this the justice to their adhering so vehemently to the personal interest in the late changes of those that are now making a market of them honest coleman thou have lost the most effectual and undisputed axiom of political philosophy that ever was delivered at the gallows no trust in man the scriptures concur in it rich men are vanity and great men are a lie put not your trust in princes  turn we our eyes up to heaven from whence comes help and as zachariah the son of jehojadah said when the rabble stoned him after all the great things his father had done for them the lord look upon it and require it  nor can the spirit of common discernning forbear to say without respect or claim to prophecies this cannot end but in the sinking of that very party who by this treatment of an innocent people seek to establish their interest even with the very men they always abhorred they will sink under the weight of the party they caress and this egyptian shall be to them as a staff which whoever leans thereon it shall pierce through their hand and the deliverance of the dissenters shall come some other way  but we are told here several things to buoy us up under the weight of what we see coming upon us such as these    the bill now depending in parliament though it may restrain the occasional conformity of dissenters as to places yet it gives you more than the equivalent in many things it confirms the toleration it restores the act of exemption to the name of the toleration which it had lost it checks the jacobites in scotland and it is not extended in many things which were included in the former act   it was brought in from a prospect of mere kindness to the dissenters to prevent the design of another party who had projected one tenfold worse and which had been perfectly ruinous to the dissenters interest and had in effect turned the toleration out of doors and both these evidence that the dissenters are not given up or betrayed or sacrificed as above we answer briefly to this that as before we are not debating what favor the two houses of parliament may grant in the bill now depending it is not for us to say here we are speaking of or to that bill or to the houses of parliament but we are speaking to those people whom we call whigs without doors who are concerned in or agree to bringing any bill in or putting forward any law to restrain the consciences of innocent men and take from them at the severe penalty of the loss of their employments the liberty of serving god according to their consciences if the parliament have sweetened this bitter potion with any negatives with any favors we are for being thankful for all favors but we are not to think our selves obliged at all to any of those people if any such are who having it in their power to prevent it have put us into the condition to seek or be glad of such favors  and let those favors be what they will if the clause excluding all those from the natural privilege of loyal subjects and from the favors of their sovereign who cannot how conscientious soever their scruples are conform to the church we may without offense say we should not be at all the less thankful to be without the said favors having but at the same time the liberty to be without the grievance  as to what is called confirming our toleration if we think it sufficiently confirmed before and in a most sacred manner established besides the act of parliament in the sanction of her majestys solemn promise from the throne of preserving it inviolable we hope it will not be ill taken if we say we do not see how it can be better confirmed though every session of parliament should pass a new act in its favor nor is our confidence less in her majestys sacred promise than in all the acts to confirm our toleration that are or can be passed since one parliament may repeal what ever acts another has made and even their own too but her majestys veracity is a royal security which we have so much dependence upon as we cannot prevail upon our selves to say we desire any further confirmation of it  that the parliament in their printed votes have thrown dirt in the face of that condemned impostor s l and restored the act for the liberty of dissenters to the true title and denomination of it viz a toleration vide the votes die lunae december         it is a satisfying piece of justice done that honorable house and what we are bound to acknowledge is like the righteous proceedings of so august an assembly and we should have been larger in owning the favor did it not come accompanied with something in the cover of it which we can by no means without the utmost hypocrisy be thankful for viz an act to restrain the consciences of men in the affair of possessing offices without renouncing the worshipping god in their own way and according to the dictates of their consciences for this we can no more be thankful than to a judge who pronounces sentence of death against us for crimes we think our selves not guilty of  that we had as dissenters a legal toleration before by act of parliament is certain that the act entitled an act to exempt her majestys protestant subjects etc is a toleration is out of all question true and to prove it the title to this act now passing is my authority being the words of the parliament lords and commons in whose name and by whose very mouths s l is thus pronounced an impostor and a deceiver  we might address our selves now to speak to the act it self and examine two things in it and which shall be done with brevity and modesty    will this act answer the end which is pretended in the title viz to secure the church of england   will it answer the particular view of those who acquiesce in it in hopes of obtaining by it their partyends against the measures taken for a peace   will this act answer the two other ends confirm the toleration and preserve the succession   will it answer the end which is pretended in the title viz to secure the church of england to this i give the opinion of all those gentlemen whose speeches are upon record against the first and second occasionalbill where it seems manifest at least that it was all their opinion that this law would bring no real addition to the church only serve to keep the body of dissenters more united and if we might add in this case that union may in time be found the only case in which the dissenters can be formidable to the church the divided condition of the dissenters their vain trusts in the great men who they thought were their protectors their frequent access to favors and fortunes these have all along been the foundation of their disasters their dependence upon great men elevated them made them secure divided them made them despise caution and enemies and made them selfinterested narrow and reserved in short it buried what they call a public spirit among them this lessened them in their real strength to that degree that instead of making them formidable it made them despicable so that indeed the liberty and occasional conformity of dissenters has been their ruin has been the weakening their strength lessening their numbers and destroying their interest and in all these have been if the prosperity of the dissenters is the churches danger a safety to the church now will this restraint answer the churches end as it is proposed it is impossible neither is it calculated for that end since as is before noted the design is not to bring the dissenters over to the church but to keep them out of places but if alarmed by this treatment the dissenters should more firmly unite act in concert recover the reputation of their integrity and sincerity as if they are wise they may they will add weight to their interest and the end of their mighty struggle will be quite defeated    will it answer the end of those who by it push at breaking the measures of the court as to peace or war  not in the least the interest they had this way is entirely divided by it mutual confidence is destroyed irretrievably destroyed and can never be restored when men trust and confide in one another and then decieve one another they seldom but in parties and sets of men never trust again they may join outsides though that will be difficult but insides never now if the concert is broken which when whole could not withstand the measures above how should they do it when divided no strength increases by being separated vis unita fortior is an old and true maxim to say vis separata fortior would be a gross absurdity can any one be so weak to think that the interest of the whigs and dissenters which is miserably torn and dismembered by this mystery of politics can be able to do that now which they could not do before where are the legions added to their strength by this new step where is the equivalent they recieve ridiculus mus a poor empty unaccompanyd hero whose interest has not been able to draw his own brethren the sons of his mother into his measures nay whose measures unconcerted and undetermined have hardly amounted to a clear proposal  where are the preliminaries of this mighty treaty truly the whigs have done as the king of france was to do first evacuate the towns and then let the confederates make their demands so they have first evacuated their friends surrendered the faith they had pledged to the dissenters and now the tories may make their demands and if it be to give up the toleration next we do not see how these can deny them so that in short the end is as uncertain as it was before    will this act confirm the toleration because the house says it shall we will not say it shall not but god forbid we should say it will while we see not the least room for any thing of that kind this act and a hundred more of this nature being all attended with this circumstance that they may be repealed by the breath of the house who gives them life as to the succession being secured by excluding a few jacobites out of the faculty at edinburgh where they are capable of doing little mischief unless they were likewise excluded out of commissions of the peace in scotland where their power is capable of doing things fatal to the succession as may be proved by innumerable instances we cannot have so much value for that clause as others have as to confirming the toleration we will not say that this act is a direct breach of the toleration and a most open invasion of the liberties granted to the dissenters by the toleration but we must profess our selves utterly ignorant of any discovery to our present understanding as to any clause matter or thing in it whereby the said toleration is at all confirmed as abovesaid which ignorance we hope may be humbly acknowledged without offense  we conclude this with one only view being the last resort the dissenters have and the alone help which humane power can offer to interpose in this affair and this is in her majestys royal goodness and compassion  and the authors of this small tract beg leave in the humblest manner with all possible respect with the utmost sense of duty in the name of her majestys loyal but distressed protestant subjects the dissenters to whom her majesty has so often promised her protection and in whose zeal for her service her majesty has been graciously pleased to express great satisfaction to represent  that her majesty has given her royal and sacred promise to them on several occasions to preserve their toleration inviolable  submitting the rest to her majestys consideration  finis
