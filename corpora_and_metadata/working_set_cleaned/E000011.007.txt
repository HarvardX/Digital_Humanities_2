the works of jeremy bentham published under the superintendence of his executor john bowring volume vii edinburgh william tait  0  princes street simpkin marshall  co london mdcccxliii ii   rationale of judicial evidence book v —of circumstantial evidence chapter i circumstantial evidence what—how distinguished from direct evidence this book has for its subject circumstantial evidence in relation to this as to all other objects within the compass of this work its business and aim is to bring to view the course which it is supposed ought to be taken by the legislator and the judge by the legislator the result will be that under this head in the way of regulation very little ought to be done done viz in such sort as to coerce in the way of obligation positive or negative the will and conduct of the judge what remains is by apposite instructions to hold up to view such considerations as promise to be of use in the character of lights to the understanding of the judge to the exercise of this function power political power not being necessary—it is capable indeed of being exercised by the legislator but so is it of being exercised by anybody else addressed more immediately to the legislator as the fountain of all authority the judge is the person in whose conduct if the instructions here endeavoured to be given are destined to have any influence their influence will be more directly discernible instructions to the legislator they are at the same time instructions as from the legislator to the judge under the denomination either of circumstantial or of direct everything to which the denomination of evidence is applicable stands included when all the evidence is of that sort which is termed direct no part of it of the nature of circumstantial the case is such as affords not room for any special inference—for any other inference than that general one by which from the discourse by which the existence of this or that fact is asserted the existence of that fact is inferred and credited when evidence of the circumstantial kind presents itself and either no evidence at all of the direct kind or none that is of itself sufficient without the aid of the circumstantial evidence in every such case inference—special inference—is necessary of some one fact at least call it for this purpose the principal fact the existence with or without the aid of direct evidence applying immediately to that same principal fact is inferred viz from the existence as established by direct evidence of some other fact or more commonly from some cluster of other facts call them for this purpose evidentiary facts in every case therefore of circumstantial evidence there are always at least two facts to be considered—  the factum probandum or say the principal fact—the fact the existence of which is supposed or proposed to be proved—the fact evidenced to—the fact which is the subject of proof—  the factum probans—the evidentiary fact—the fact from the existence of which that of the factum probandum is inferred the principal fact is in its nature susceptible of two main distinctions it may be—it cannot but be—either of a physical or of a psychological nature if it be a simple one it cannot be of both natures at once if it include both it must be distinguished by the name of a complex or compound fact for in practice its properties will in this case be found to be different from what they are in the other this same distinction is alike applicable in every instance to the evidentiary fact and the occasions for applying it to that latter object will occur as frequently as the occasions for applying it to the other the same fact which with relation to one fact bears the relation of a principal fact will with relation to another or even the   same bear the relation of an evidentiary fact in this way a chain of facts of any length may be easily conceived and chains of different lengths will be frequently exemplified each such link being at the same time with reference to a preceding link a principal fact and with reference to a succeeding one an evidentiary fact in a chain of this sort it becomes necessary to distinguish the several precedential or introductory facts principal and evidentiary from the ultimate principal fact the ultimate principal fact occuptes that station only it is the very fact sought it is not viewed for the purpose of inducing a persuasion of the existence or nonexistence of any other fact in all criminal cases this fact is a complex fact and in such case complex as to include in its composition divers psychological facts together with at least one fact of the physical kind affirmative or negative in the case of direct evidence the distinction between the principal fact and the evidentiary fact is alike applicable and the union of the two alike indispensable as in the case of circumstantial evidence but in the case of direct evidence the evidentiary fact is throughout of an uniform description it consists in the existence of a person appearing in the character of a deposing witness and in the way of discourse asserting the existence of the principal fact in question on the ground of its having in some way or other come within the cognizance of his perceptive faculties† if in order to make up a complete collection of the facts the proof of which is necessary to afford a ground for the decision in question there is no need of forming any conclusion—of drawing any inference—of deducing the persuasion of the existence of any one fact from the existence of any other fact—in a word from any other source than the direct assertion of a deposing witness speaking in the character of a percipient witness—in that case the proof consists wholly of direct evidence and nothing that comes under the notion of circumstantial evidence forms any part of it but so long as the body of proof to make it complete stands in need of any inference though it be but a single inference and that ever so close and necessary a one in so far an article of circumstantial evidence forms a necessary part of it in a case regarded as criminal the body of evidence unless it consist of confessorial evidence cannot if complete be composed solely of direct evidence how satisfactory soever it cannot but include a mixture of circumstantial evidence for to constitute a criminal act one or more facts of the psychological kind are indispensably requisite in most instances the sentiment of consciousness with relation to the existence of divers exterior facts in all cases intentionality viz the intention of bringing about the obnoxious event or at least of doing the physical act by which it is produced or endeavoured to be produced‡ to complete the body of evidence necessary to the proof of a criminal act proof of psychological facts one or more is indispensable but unless by the individual himself whose mind is the scene of them no fact of the psychological kind can be proved by any direct testimonial evidence why—because unless stated by the individual himself in whose mind the fact is considered as having place the existence of any such psychological fact can only be matter of inference what passes or has passed in my own mind i know by my own internal consciousness and without any inference concerning what passes or has passed in the mind of titius i cannot know but by one or other of two means viz either from what he himself declares so far as i credit what he says or from the observations i have had the opportunity of making on the subject of his exterior deportment in regard to a complex act of this class the class of criminal offences direct testimony therefore consisting of extraneous testimony alone cannot but be incompetent or at any rate if a body of extraneous evidence be in itself complete and in its effects on the mind of the judge satisfactory and persuasive it will be so in part only in the character of direct evidence as to the other part viz in so far as any facts of the psychological class are proved by it in the character of circumstantial evidence in regard to the existence of facts considered   in the character of principal facts it is no uncommon case for the persuasion to be indicated and to find credence and that with reason on the ground of circumstantial evidence alone without the aid of any direct evidence but it is seldom indeed that the body of evidence adduced in proof of any such principal fact would upon examination be found to consist purely of direct evidence unaccompanied by any admixture of circumstantial evidence this is so true that of a body of evidence say the testimonial evidence of an individual deposing in the character of one who was at the time in question a percipient witness of the matter of fact in question—of a body of evidence delivered in the character of a body of direct evidence—it is very rare that upon examination the whole would be found to consist of direct without any admixture of circumstantial evidence simple perception is the operation of sense inference is the operation of the judgment but by the most constantly in exercise of all the senses viz sight it is seldom that any belief of any matter of fact is produced but that the judgment has been more or less at work in the production of it the evidence afforded by any given mass of testimony is either direct or circumstantial according to the relation it bears to the fact to which it is considered as applying it is direct in respect of any and every fact expressly narrated by it and in particular every fact of which the witness represents himself as having been a percipient witness it is circumstantial in respect of any and every fact not thus expressly narrated by it in particular every fact of which the witness does not represent himself as having been a percipient witness and the existence of which therefore is matter of inference being left to be concluded from its supposed connexion with the facts spoken to by the testimony in its character of direct evidence the testimony of a witness operates as circumstantial evidence not only in regard to all facts which not having been actually perceived by him are by him inferred from facts which he has perceived—his testimony or at least the fact of his giving utterance to such testimony may operate further in the character of circumstantial evidence in regard to facts which have neither been perceived nor inferred by him but which are inferred by the judge from the fact of his having uttered the testimony in this case the evidentiary fact is not the testimony itself but the delivery of it by the witness in the character of direct evidence the truth of any decision grounded on the testimony will depend altogether upon the truth—the logical truth the verity—of the testimony if the facts are whether knowingly or not knowingly misrepresented by it the decision will in so far as the question of fact is concerned be erroneous in the character of circumstantial evidence the truth of the decision will not depend upon the truth of the testimony it will depend upon the truth the justness of the interence grounded on it on the strength the real strength of the connexion between the fact assumed viz the fact of the utterance of a mass of testimony assertive of the fact purporting to be asserted by it and the fact inferred from that same assumed fact if the inference grounded on the testimony be a just inference the decision grounded on that inference may be a just decision although the testimony which it has thus taken for its ground be false a man suspected of a murder is interrogated on the subject of it by a judge if being guilty he confesses the fact including the several circumstances necessary to fix it upon himself as the author of it and in the character of a crime there is no demand for inference—the testimony amounts to a full confession and operates purely in the character of direct evidence—if being guilty he does not confess the fact he being at the same time pressed with the strings of questions which a man acting on the occasion with an ordinary degree of zeal probity and intelligence in the character of a judge will not fail to ply him with the testimony thus extracted will almost always or rather necessarily in so far as he quits the intrenchments of nonresponsion or its equivalent evasive responsion contain a mixture of truth and falsehood now it is that the testimony—not being in respect of such part of it as is true full enough to operate of itself with a conclusive force in the character of direct evidence—is consulted as it were and made to operate further in the character of circumstantial evidence in which character it may be full enough to operate and even conclusively affording full satisfaction—generating a full persuasion—although in the character of direct evidence it was deficient but on this occasion such parts of the testimony as are false may in so far as they are understood to be false contribute in support of the conclusion just as much as the facts that are true for not only when the whole narrative is viewed together in a general point of view falsehood is to the apprehension of every rational mind a strong indication and symptom of delinquency—of whatever modification of delinquency the defendant on the occasion in question happens to be suspected of—but in respect of the details of the transaction this or that particular falsehood an assertion representing this or that fact as existing at the time and place in question which did not exist at that time and place or representing as not existing   at the time and place in question a fact which at that time and place did exist will afford an inference and that frequently a conclusive and perfectly satisfactory one establishing this or that particular truth—the existence of this or that fact which then and there did exist or the nonexistence of this or that fact which then and there did not exist from the foregoing elucidations the definition of an article of circumstantial as distinguished from an article of direct evidence may be deduced as follows viz— the principal fact being given and being the same in both cases the evidentiary fact constituting the article of evidence—if it be of the nature of direct evidence having for its source a person to wit a single person and no more—consists of an averment statement assertion narration all these mean the same thing made by that person averring that at a specified time and place the principal fact in question came within the cognizance of his senses such assertion being expressed either by words spoken or by written discourse or even by gestures or modifications of deportment if such gestures were intended to convey an assertion to the effect in question instead of its being conveyed by words in the same case as above the evidentiary fact in question if it be of the nature of circumstantial evidence may consist either of some physical fact from a real source or if from a personal source a psychological fact such psychological fact having necessarily for its index some physical fact issuing from the same personal source chapter ii of probabilizing disprobabilizing and infirmative facts—examples of principal facts with the corresponding evidentiary facts—improbability and impossibility how distinguished from the other kinds of circumstantial evidence when of any principal fact in question the existence is indicated by direct evidence no objection presenting itself to the trustworthiness of the deponent by whom the existence of it is asserted it is said to be proved and for the proof of every such fact by evidence of this description a simple assertion made by any one such person in the character of a deponent is frequently under english law at any rate regarded as sufficient the persuasion generated by it in the mind of the judge is of sufficient strength to give birth to a decision on his part together with such acts of power to which on the occasion in question a decision to the effect in question is in the habit of giving birth when of the existence of the principal fact in question no other indication presents itself than what is afforded by circumstantial evidence it is seldom very seldom that by any single article of evidence of that description the fact is considered as being proved it is seldom that by any one such article standing by itself a persuasion strong enough to constitute a ground for action is constituted in the mind of the judge by some greater number of such lots of circumstantial evidence taken together the fact may be said to be proved of the probative force of any one of them taken by itself the utmost that can be said is that by means of it the fact is probabilized—rendered in a greater or less degree probable as there are facts—evidentiary facts—by the force of which a fact considered in the character of a principal fact is probabilized—so it will generally happen that there are others by which the same fact may be disprobabilized—the existence of it rendered more or less improbable when a principal fact is thus probabilized it is by the probative force of the evidentiary fact by the strength of the inference by which the existence of the evidentiary fact being affirmed the existence of the principal fact is inferred a fact being in the character of an evidentiary fact deposed to and considered as proved and the principal fact in question considered as being thereby in a certain degree probabilized—it will often happen that by the bare consideration of some other fact which is not proved nor so much as attempted to be proved the principal fact will be considered as being in a greater or less degree disprobabilized why because if the existence of this disprobabilizing fact be supposed it being itself in the case in question not impossible it will therefore be seen that notwithstanding the existence of a probabilizing fact the existence of the principal fact is not in so high a degree probable as it would be if the existence of the disprobabilizing fact were impossible   speaking with reference to the probabilizing fact in question—any such disprobabilizing fact thus contributing to weaken to render infirm the probative force of the probabilizing fact may be termed an infirmative fact there are few if any probabilizing facts in relation to which one or more commonly if not constantly more than one infirmative facts would not in case of an adequately diligent scrutiny be found if in one point of view it be of importance that—in relation to all facts which with reference to any of those principal facts on the credit of which a mans station in society is disposed of are wont to be considered in the character of probabilizing facts—the probative force should be perceived and rightly estimated—in another point of view it is a matter of correspondent importance that the several facts bearing upon such probabilizing facts in the character of infirmative facts should also be perceived as capable of having place and the probative force of them respectively be rightly estimated among the facts which will be brought to view in the character of principal facts is delinquency among the facts which will be brought to view in the character of evidentiary facts are various facts the nature of which supposing them proved is to operate with relation to any principal fact of that description in the character of circumstantial evidence among the facts which will be brought to view in the character of infirmative and thereby of disprobabilizing facts are various facts the force of which applies itself to divers of the facts just mentioned in the character of probabilizing facts operating in that character with relation to delinquency in the instance of a fact of either description supposing it either unseen or the probative or disprobative force of it undervalued the effect of such oversight or error may be fatal with reference to one or other of the direct ends of justice if the fact overlooked be a probabilizing fact in relation to delinquency—a wrongdoer may escape the burthen of punishment or satisfaction to which it was the intention of the law to subject him if it be in relation to any such probabilizing fact an infirmative fact—an individual who is not a wrongdoer may be subjected to punishment or the burthen of satisfaction as if he were in the case of delinquency as in the case of a principal fact of any other description the probabilizing facts in question be it observed are by the supposition not only brought to view but proved so that in regard to these all that for the instruction of the judge can be done by human industry is to give what little instruction can be given in relation to their respective degrees of probative force but of any regard paid to any of the infirmative facts that respectively apply to these several probabilizing facts the nature of the case affords no such certainty it is in this instance therefore that the need of instruction is the greatest it is by bringing to view the facts of this description that by hands unclothed with authority the greatest service may be rendered to justice under the head of circumstantial evidence overlooked they are in many instances not unapt to be accordingly in the instance of one of the most illustrious luminaries of english law an example will be seen in which for want of due notice taken of the infirmative facts that bore upon the case delinquency of the deepest dye viz murder was considered as certain in circumstances in which regard being paid to those infirmative facts it will perhaps to a discerning eye appear not more probable than innocence at any rate not to a sufficient degree probable to afford a just ground for a judgment of conviction† to exhibit every fact capable of being considered in the character of a principal fact together with every fact capable of being with reference to it considered in the character of an evidentiary i e either a probabilizing or a disprobabilizing fact—and moreover every fact capable of being considered with reference to such evidentiary fact in the character of an infirmative fact—would be to exhaust the stores not only of jurisprudence but of everything else that has ever borne the name of science for the purpose of the present occasion a selection must therefore necessarily be made and this even among the cases liable to call for decision at the hands of judicature for in one way or other to whatever branch of science it belongs there is scarce an imaginable fact to which it may not happen to be   an object of research for the purpose of a decision sought at the hands of judicature patents by which temporary monopolies are granted for the encouragement of inventions suffice of themselves to subject to the dominion of judicature almost the whole practical department of the field of physical science wagers have power to subject to the cognizance of the same authority every proveable fact without distinction by a wager concerning the existence of phlogiston the whole field of chemistry might have been laid at the feet of the judge in the selection here made the object has been to take such examples as by the frequency of their occurrence and the extent of the ground which they cover in the field of law promise to be in a more particular degree serviceable towards the prevention of the erroneous conclusions to which the function of judication so far as concerns the question of fact is exposed here follow examples of facts which in the character of principal facts facts on the belief of which judicial decision depends are susceptible of being probabilized or disprobabilized by correspondent evidentiary facts or groups of evidentiary facts constituting so many articles of circumstantial evidence such as are in use to be deposed to and considered as proved in a course of judicial investigation i principal facts considered as probabilized—   delinquency in general viz any act by which the ordinances or supposed ordinances of the law i e of the supreme power in a state are transgressed an enumeration of the several facts capable of serving in the character of evidentiary facts to probabilize a principal fact coming under this description viz the description of delinquency will be given in the sequel of this book   intention of performing any individual act belonging to a modification of delinquency i e to a species of acts forbidden by law and thence when the fact so intended to have place has taken place the existence of such physical acts as on the part of the   person in question were necessary to cause it to have place for the correspondent evidentiary facts see chap iv of this book   unauthenticity or unfairness on one or both sides in the instance of a written instrument expressive of agreement or conveyance correspondent evidentiary fact nonobservance of formalities viz of the formalities the observance of which has been made by the law a condition to its binding force by the laws by which these formalities have been appointed the evidentiary fact here in question has in general been considered as conclusive evidence of the principal fact concerning the propriety of so peremptory a conclusion see the book on preappointed evidence and the book having for its subject the exclusions customarily put on various modifications of evidence   unauthenticity total or partial of any instrument being or purporting to be of ancient date for the circumstances capable of serving in the character of evidentiary facts to probabilize this principal fact unauthenticity—or which is the same things in other words to disprobabilize the authenticity of the instrument—see a table of evidentiary facts of this description taken principally from le clercs ars critica   posteriora priorum any supposed antecedent acts in a number of supposed successive acts whether forbidden by law or not considered as following one another in a supposed naturally connected series for example as being or being supposed to be conducive to one and the same end such as in a lawsuit success viz on either side of the suit correspondent evidentiary facts—any acts proved to have been performed and considered as having been performed in consequence of such supposed antecedent acts for example in pursuit of the same end see a table of evidentiary facts of this description taken from comynss digest of english law†   priora posteriorum any supposed consequent acts in a number of supposed successive acts considered as following one another in a supposed naturally connected series as above correspondent evidentiary facts—any acts proved to have been performed and considered as having been performed antecedently to and with the intention of their being followed by such supposed consequent acts as being means conducive to the same end see a table of evidentiary facts of this description also from comyns ii principal facts considered as disprobabilized—     any supposed act of delinquency any act made penal or though but disreputable especially if in a high degree the correspondent disprobabilizing evidentiary facts are situations viz situations in which the supposed delinquent is capable of being found placed in the sequel of this book it will be seen what situations can be considered to operate as circumstantial evidence probabilizing the existence of delinquency now whatsoever situation exhibits the supposed delinquent as in a certain degree exposed to the danger of falling into the species of guilt in question—by a situation opposite to that seductive situation he will in a proportionable degree he guarded and fortified against that danger     any supposed physical fact whatsoever short and general expression for all supposed facts considered in the character of disprobabilizing facts with relation to the supposed fact—physical impossibility or improbability these disprobabilizing facts follow in each instance the nature of the supposed principal fact any facts considered as affording the indication in question being supposed to be established whether by special proof or by their own supposed notoriety—there remains in each instance for consideration the question whether the existence of the supposed principal fact is incompatible with the existence of the disprobabilizing facts the principal fact being considered as proved viz by such special testimony as if not opposed by counterevidence would be regarded as sufficient for the proof of it the decision will in this case turn upon the supposed preponderance of probative force as between special testimony the testimony of the witness or witnesses by whom the supposed fact is deposed to and the supposed general testimony by which those facts which are regarded as incompatible with it are considered to be as it were deposed to at any rate as established on sufficient grounds of the applications capable of being made of this modification of circumstantial evidence the principal is that in which the extraordinary interposition of supernatural power is supposed as in the case of sorcery witchcraft and such other operations real or supposed as have been designated under the general name of miracles       any supposed psychological fact whatsoever i e any supposed fact the supposed seat of which is in the mind of this or that individual human being corresponding disprobabilizing facts shortly designated as above psychological improbability the term impossibility is in this case omitted the reason is the want of uniformity and consistency on the part of all psychological facts as compared with physical ones correspondent and opposite to impossibility is certainty but the case of insanity is of itself sufficient to prevent any state of the human mind from being considered in any instance as certain and of insanity there are gradations innumerable many of them at that end of the scale which is next to sanity scarce distinguishable from it the lastmentioned species of circumstantial evidence—improbability or impossibility—has in its nature something peculiar in all the other kinds of circumstantial evidence the evidentiary fact whatever it be—positive or negative is at any rate something entirely distinct from and independent of the principal fact the fact to be proved in the case of improbability or impossibility the evidentiary fact is not another and a distinct fact it is no other than a property or supposed property of the principal fact itself to wit as will hereafter be seen the property of being contrary to the order of nature circumstantial evidence therefore may with propriety be distinguished into that which is afforded by other facts and that which is afforded by the nature of the fact itself that is to be proved for the illustration of the first of these modifications of circumstantial evidence—taking for the principal fact delinquency considered in a general point of view—i shall bring to view the several classes of probabilizing facts bearing relation to it accompanied with an indication of such facts as present themselves in the character of infirmative facts with relation to such of the abovementioned probabilizing facts as are exhibited in a state particular enough to be susceptible of any such particular indications this done from the mass of particular considerations thus brought to view i shall deduce such considerations of a general nature as promise to be of use in the way of instruction either to the legislator or the judge for which purpose the matter afforded by such of the circumstantial evidences as have for their principal fact delinquency will it is supposed suffice i shall then pass to the consideration of that kind of circumstantial evidence which is afforded by the nature of the principal fact itself viz improbability and impossibility chapter iii of real evidence or evidence from things §   of the nature and extent of real evidence by real evidence i understand all evidence of which any object belonging to the class of things is the source persons also included in respect of such properties as belong to them in common with things the properties of things are the subjectmatter of the different branches of physical science a work having for its subject any such branch of science is as to a great part of its contents a treatise on circumstantial evidence in this point of view this comparatively small portion of our field of inquiry is of itself infinite on the present occasion the inquiry is limited to the field of law even after this limitation however there is scarce an imaginable distinction or observation an indication of which could with reference to the subject of the present work be charged with being altogether irrelevant for in one way or other and even in each instance in various ways there is not an imaginable fact the existence of which is not capable of being taken for the subject of inquiry in a court of judicature no imaginable fact for example the existence of which may not unless in case of legal prohibition interposed for special reasons have been taken for the subject of a wager on which occasion whether the wager has been won or no by titius may become a question to be determined by a court of law add to this the case of a premium offered for an invention or discovery the case of a claim put in to the sort of temporary monopoly granted to inventors for the encouragement of inventions and the case of a question whether a contract respecting the practice of any branch of art or the affording instruction in relation to any branch of science has been properly fulfilled of the evidence that on any of these occasions may come to be exhibited a portion more or less considerable if not the whole will come under the notion of the species of evidence already distinguished under the appellation of scientific evidence but it is not the less true that the facts brought to view on such occasions respectively are brought to view in the character of evidentiary facts and are included in the field of legal evidence if therefore the whole encyclopædia were to be crowded into the body of this work and into this part of it in particular there is not a page of it that if relevant with reference to the particular branch of art or science of which it undertook to treat would strictly speaking be irrelevant—could be justly chargeable with being altogether irrelevant—with reference to the subject   of this work but as the duration of human life as well as human powers psychological and physical has its limits it becomes matter not only of convenience but of necessity to mark off and abandon to the labours of their respective professional and other appropriate cultivators these several distinguished and preeminent portions of the field of evidence even in the more limited field opened by the penal branch of law—a prodigiously ample and diversified demand a demand scarce susceptible of limitation will be seen to present itself cases of homicide and personal injury not to mention at present a great variety of other cases are sufficient of themselves to draw deep upon the stores of medical science cases of monetary forgery upon the metallurgic branch of chemistry cases of scriptural forgery upon the arts of the engraver the papermaker the letterfounder the inkmaker and through one or other channel upon the stores of chemistry of all modifications of real evidence the human body is that source which will serve best for exemplification the matter afforded by it being at the same time of the most interesting nature susceptible of the greatest variety and capable of being brought to view in the smallest compass proportionally to the importance of the instruction conveyed by it the following table is a translation nearly literal of the heads offered in plinks elementa medicinæ et chirurgicæ forensis vienna      a few articles are omitted some as not being applicable to the present design others as referring to vulgar errors which at this time of day no longer threaten to be productive of errors in

present instance limited to the penal branch of law the fact sought and concerning which on each occasion the question is whether it be evidenced or no is delinquency the evidentiary facts are any and every fact considered as capable of operating in that character with reference to the fact sought division of things considered as sources of real evidence the source of the division being the nature of the relation they respectively  0 bear to the fact of delinquency considered as the fact indicated i subjectmatter of the offence itself—  the person killed or hurt   the thing stolen or otherwise taken in the way of depredation or damaged or destroyed   the instrument of contract fraudulently uttered or fabricated   the genuine money diminished the counterfeit money fabricated ii fruits of the offence—in the case of depredation above mentioned it is the goods taken in the way of depredation which constitute the immediate fruits of the offence in the case of forgery of written instruments and monetary fabrication it is the profit in whatsoever shape obtained in the case of subduction by monetary forgery it is the quantity of valuable matter subducted iii instruments of the offence—examples—  in the case of homicide or other bodily injury—the pistol sword club knife or other weapon in case of poisoning—the poison   in case of depredation by housebreaking—the picklock keys the crow or chisel the ladder   in case of incendiarism—the combustibles   in case of forgery—the engraved plates the instruments for the fabrication of the appropriate papers   in case of monetary forgery—the coining tools iv materials of the subjectmatter of the offence or of the instruments of the offence when they happen to have anything appropriate in their nature exclusively or peculiarly fitting them for being converted into instruments of the offence—examples—  silver or gold in plates or other suspicious forms where coining is the offence in question   laurel leaves for distillation where poisoning is the fact in question   drugs calculated for the purpose of adulteration found in large quantities in the possession of a dealer in the article which such drugs are capable of being employed to adulterate v receptacles inclosing or having inclosed as above—  the subjectmatter   the fruits or   the instruments of the offence—example—  the clothing of the person killed or hurt   the house ship room closet stable waggon chest of drawers package case in which the goods stolen damaged or destroyed or the instruments or materials of the offence were contained vi circumjacent detached bodies bodies circumjacent though detached with reference to any of the objects above enumerated—examples—the floor on which the person killed or wounded was standing the chair on which he was sitting the bed on which he was lying the pathway spotted by his blood it is in virtue of some peculiarity in their condition that the things in question are qualified to become sources of real evidence evidentiary facts with reference to the modification of delinquency in question—the fact indicated this condition may to the purpose in question be distinguished into relative and absolute relative bearing to the person in question any such relation as has the effect of indicating him in the character of the delinquent absolute indicating without any indication of the person the existence of the obnoxious event the death the damage to property by fire or other cause coupled or not with the indication of its being referable to human delinquency as its cause physical real evidence whether issuing from a real or from a personal source requires to be distinguished into immediate and reported i call it immediate in the case where the thing which is the source of the evidence is made present to the senses of the judge himself i call it reported in the case where it is not made present to the senses of the judge himself—but the state of it in respect of the evidence the evidentiary facts said to be afforded by it is presented to the judge no otherwise than by the report made of it by a person by whom in the character of a percipient witness the state and condition of it in respect of the evidentiary facts in question is reported by him to have been observed in the case of immediate real evidence as above described the evidence is of the circumstantial kind purely it is a case of purely real purely circumstantial evidence in the case of reported evidence it is of a compound or mixed kind composed of supposed real evidence exhibited through the medium of personal of circumstantial exhibited through the medium of direct evidence to the reporting witness indeed if his report be true it was so much immediate so much pure real evidence but to the judge it is but reported real evidence the distinction is far from being a purely speculative one practice requires to be directed by it reported real evidence is analogous to hearsay evidence and labours more or less under the infirmities which attach to that modification of personal evidence compounded of circumstantial evidence and direct—of real evidence and ordinary personal evidence evidence given in the way of discourse it unites the infirmities of both the lights afforded or said to have been afforded by the real evidence are liable to be weakened in intensity and altered in colour by the medium through which it is transmitted a topic which will come to be considered in the book which treats of makeshift evidence from this infirmity results an obvious practical rule—viz not to receive real evidence in the form of reported real evidence when without preponderant inconvenience it can be had in the form of immediate real evidence    a rule exactly analogous to that which is alike obvious in the case of the analogous species of evidence called hearsay evidence but of this elsewhere §   infirmative five facts applicable to real evidence the evidentiary i e the criminative or inculpative facts belonging to this class being in so prodigious a degree multifarious—in a correspondent degree multifarious must be the facts that apply to them respectively in the character of infirmative facts yet except in so far as the connexion between the principal fact and the evidentiary fact is necessary there is not one such evidentiary fact but must have its correspondent infirmative facts by the possibility of which its probative force is diminished not that facts are altogether wanting which the evidentiary facts being by the nature of the principal fact so many criminative or inculpative facts are applicable in common to all evidentiary facts belonging to the class of real evidence of the infirmative facts of this description five examples may be designated as follows viz—   accident the appearance unquestionable but not having for its cause any agency of the supposed delinquent directed to the production of the forbidden result in question being produced either by causes purely physical or if with the intervention of any human agent acting in pursuit of any end produced either by some other person or by himself in pursuit of some unforbidden end   selfexculpative forgery in relation to real evidence viz the evidence composed of the appearances in question committed by some other person guilty either in respect of the offence in question or some other offence see further on forgery in relation to real evidence   like forgery committed by some other person who—though not guilty in respect of the offence indicated by the real evidence in question in its genuine state—yet under the apprehension of the indications it affords to his prejudice alters the appearance in question with a view to the doing away of those indications   like forgery committed by another person in the view of subjecting the defendant to the imputation in question for a malicious purpose i e for the purpose of causing him to suffer either at the hand of the law or in the way of reputation as if the offence in question had had him for the author of it or a partaker in it   like forgery committed in sport i e without any design to subject the individual in question either to legal punishment or lasting disrepute but only to momentary alarm† §   on the circumstantial evidence of delinquency afforded by the possession of an article of criminative real evidence nothing is more familiar than the word possession nothing more variable and indistinct than the ideas which are wont to be attached to that word but in so far as on any occasion it is considered as being applicable in such sort that a thing considered as a source of criminative real evidence being such in relation to the supposed delinquent in question is considered as being in his possession—in so far is the relation indicated by the word possession apt to be considered as evidentiary of delinquency in his instance of this species of criminative circumstantial evidence possession of stolen goods affords the most obvious and frequently exemplified case of possession of criminative evidence the probative force will be liable to be varied according to a distinction expressible by the terms actual and antecedent actual when at the very time in question the thing in question is supposed to be found in possession of the supposed delinquent antecedent when it is only supposed to have been in his possession at some antecedent point of time in the latter case its identity is supposed but is liable to become the matter of an additional question in relation to which question this or that supposed intrinsic mark of ownership designed or undesigned will frequently present itself in the character of an    article of real evidence serving to probabilize the supposed fact in question viz that the thing which is not now was at some antecedent point of time in the possession of the supposed delinquent to possession of criminative real evidence in its character of a fact evidentiary of delinquency apply in the character of infirmative facts those five which we have seen applying to real evidence itself when considered as criminative additional infirmative facts applying to possession of criminative real evidence and not to the real evidence itself are—     unconsciousness when though the situation of the thing in question is or has been such as to warrant its being said to be or to have been in the possession of the supposed delinquent he himself has never been conscious of its being so a state of things that may naturally enough have been brought into existence by any of the five causes enumerated as above under the head of real evidence     clandestine introduction subsequently to the introduction of the thing into the place by its introduction into which it is put into his possession he becomes conscious of its being there but of the operation by which it was introduced he had not while the operation was going forward any knowledge     forcible introduction when it was with his knowledge indeed but against his declared or known will that the thing in question was placed in that situation in which it is considered as being in his possession as if by conspiracy among three men against one one lays hold of both his hands another puts into his pocket a stolen handkerchief which the third running up during the scuffle finds there by the circumstance of force supposing it proved the criminative effect of possession as above would be destroyed altogether but what may happen is that the possession shall have been proved when the force is not proved     in case of supposed antecedent possession as above—nonidentity of the thing in question the man is seen running and on the path which he has been taking a handkerchief is seen lying a handkerchief resembling it had been seen in his hand but though similar it was not the same  0   furtherance of justice receipt or seizure of the thing in question in the view of applying it to its use in the character of a source of criminative evidence as in the case of an official minister of justice so demeaning himself in the execution of his office or an individual volunteering his services to the same effect nothing can be more persuasive than the circumstance of possession commonly is when corroborated by other criminative circumstances nothing more inconclusive supposing it to stand alone receptacles may be contained one within the other as in the case of a nest of boxes the jewel in a case the case in a box the box in a bureau the bureau in a closet the closet in a room the room in a house the house in a field possession of the jewel actual possession may thus belong to half a dozen different persons at the same time and as to antecedent possession the number of possible successive possessors is manifestly beyond all limit connected with this subject is the consideration of the probative force of possession of criminative written evidence when written evidence—such as supposing it to have for its author the supposed delinquent would in the character of confessorial evidence tend to induce a persuasion of his being guilty of the offence in question—is found in his possession—the mere circumstance of its being in his possession will of itself if separated from the circumstances that are so apt to be connected with it scarce be capable of possessing criminative force sufficient to entitle it to the denomination of criminative evidence if indeed possessing with regard to him this criminative tendency and speaking in his own person it appears upon the face of it to be written with his own hand as in the case of a memorandum written for his own use or a letter written by him and intended to be sent to the person to whom it is addressed but not sent there is no doubt that—if being spoken it would have amounted to selfcriminative i e to confessorial evidence—it will being written amount to no less but in this case its criminative force depends altogether upon what it contributes in the character of confessorial evidence towards inducing a persuasion of his having been concerned in the forbidden act from the circumstance of its being found in his possession it can scarce be said to derive any probative force over and above what it would have possessed if found anywhere else if for example being a letter it had been sent to the person for whom it was designed and by him produced in evidence it being still of such a nature as had it for its author as above the supposed delinquent and were it spoken in his person would operate against him in the character of confessorial evidence suppose it were to have for its author another individual writing and speaking of the criminal transaction in question whether in the character of an accomplice or an accuser with a probative force proportioned to the strength of the indication afforded by it and to the trustworthiness of the writer it would operate in the character    of the weak and makeshift species of evidence which will be brought to view in the next book under the name of casuallywritten or written casual evidence but from the circumstance of its being found in the possession of the supposed delinquent it would scarcely derive any probative force over and above what it would have possessed if in its way to his house it had been intercepted—for example at a postoffice addressed to him by word of mouth—or even although not addressed to him if spoken in his presence—a discourse of exactly the same tenor might have operated against him with a considerable degree of probative force why because—when the supposed delinquent and the virtual accuser were at the time of uttering the virtual accusation in presence of each other—not only the motive to contradict the accusation in case of its falsity but the opportunity the opportunity for immediate contradiction exists noncontradiction of criminative discourse operates therefore as evidentiary of confession though not without standing exposed to the debilitative force of various infirmative facts but where the form of the criminative discourse was in writing and the parties not in presence—the opportunity of immediate contradiction not having place—the circumstance of the writings being found in the possession of the individual so addressed by it scarce affords of itself any the slightest inference in the case of real evidence possession may indeed and not unreasonably be considered as operating in the character of a criminative circumstance why because by possession of things fit for use a most natural though sometimes not an infallible presumption is afforded of actual use and ownership including under the head of use in the case of a mercantile man sale as being a mode of using particularly adapted to his situation in life but as in the case of real evidence a mans having possession of a thing of any sort affords of itself scarce any presumption of his having made it—so in the case of written evidence mere possession of a manuscript of any kind not being in his own handwriting affords scarce any presumption of his having been the author of it in regard to writings as in regard to chairs and tables possession is good evidence of ownership but of the possessors being the author of the writings it is not much better evidence than of his having made the chairs and tables true it is that where the authorship has for its proof similitude of hands which is a sort of real evidence possession adds probable force to it why because if it be extraordinary that writing bearing such a degree of resemblance to that of reus should not be his it is still more extraordinary that writing bearing such a degree of resemblance to that of reus and moreover found in his possession should not be his taken by itself so weak is the probative the criminative force of written evidence understand all along such written evidence the tendency of which is to fix the imputation of the offence in question on the individual in whose possession it happens to be found that it is scarce susceptible of being rendered weaker by the consideration of any facts operating in the character of infirmative facts but the infirmative facts capable of applying to it are of the same nature as those which have been seen applying to the case of possession of real evidence at large when considered in respect of the criminative force with which it is capable of operating so far as concerns clandestine introduction so it exceed not a certain magnitude a mass of written evidence possesses a means peculiar to itself for being introduced into a mans possession without his consent or privity it may have come for example by the post addressed to himself it may have come by the post addressed to some inmate of his and thus remain in his possession for any length of time without his knowledge on such an occasion naming it my dear friend you failed in your enterprise an enterprise describing it by allusion of theft robbery murder treason on such a day do so and so and you will succeed in this way so far as possession of criminative written evidence amounts to crimination it is in the power of any one man to make circumstantial evidence of criminality in any shape against any other it has perhaps very seldom happened that written evidence tending to criminate a man in respect of the crimes in question has been found in his possession but there has been good and sufficient reason for regarding him as guilty but in these same cases the principal reason has been constituted not by this of possession but by similitude of hands or by other evidence supposed facts that belong not to this head are apt to be urged in the character of infirmative facts for the purpose of encountering the criminative circumstantial evidence constituted by possession of written evidence of the nature here in question such are—   irrelevancy of the discourse either with reference to delinquency in general or with reference to the particular species of delinquency or individual act of supposed delinquency in question   unauthenticity of the script purporting to be in the handwriting of the supposed delinquent    §   of interrogation as an instrument for supplying the deficiencies of real evidence in the character of criminative evidences besides the special and contingent infirmities to which they are respectively liable the several mute evidences which compose the subject of this chapter have as such several infirmities in common—  the indications they afford are particularly apt to be incomplete by written evidence to which it happens to be found in the possession of the supposed delinquent the lights afforded may be to any degree broken imperfect inconclusive   from the intrinsic nature of these mute evidences by which their criminative force is exposed to the opposition of so many infirmative facts arises the question—a question that forces itself upon every rational mind—these several possible infirmative facts in the individual case in question have they or any of them actually had place for filling up the abovementioned deficiencies for clearing up these lastmentioned doubts the nature of things has provided one and the same natural and naturally efficacious instrument—interrogation on this as on all other occasions the way to know is to inquire a proposition that from the beginning of the world to the present day has never been a secret to any human being unless it be to english lawyers and of whom to inquire of whom but of the one person in the world who if the fact be in existence cannot fail to know of it—the one person in the world in comparison with whose evidence every other imaginable species of evidence direct or circumstantial except in so far as this naturally best evidence happens by the force of sinister motives to be driven into mendacity is a miserable makeshift insomuch that if on the score of hardship to the person so interrogated there were any rational objection capable of applying to the extraction of the evidence from this most direct and in case of confessorial responsion most trustworthy of all sources—it would operate and with augmented force to the exclusion of all other evidence the case in which the written evidence is confessorial as compared with the case in which it is extraneous here presents a difference in the case of confessorial written evidence the author of the writing and the possessor of it are but one person there is not therefore of necessity more than one person of whom to inquire concerning it in the case of extraneous written evidence there are at least two persons the person in whose possession it is supposed to be and the person whose writing it is supposed to be these two at the least add to whom in the case of a script purporting or supposed to be a transcript or written from dictation the original writer or dictator on the one hand the transcriber or amanuensis on the other of these two persons the possessor and the writer dismissing for simplicitys sake the accidental decomposition of the writer into the original and the derivative writer as above it may happen to the latter to be no longer forthcoming in such sort as to be subject to inquiry death imbecility or expatriation may have put him out of reach in this case the imperfect evidence which to false science and blind prejudice has been the object of exclusive choice is left by necessity in the character of the only receivable because the only obtainable evidence from that same source but in the case of confessorial evidence where the possessor of the evidence and the writer are one and the same person if he be also the defendant and in that character forthcoming this first resource the faculty of inquiring remains accessible on this same occasion there remains in both the above cases yet another sort of person who when the process of inquiry is going on ought not to pass unheeded this is the person whosoever he may be in the ordinary course of things an official person by whose instrumentality the papers which it was so much the interest of other persons to conceal have been brought under the eye of justice the papers produced in the character of criminative evidence whether confessorial or extraneous are all genuine be it so—but the papers which thus are produced are they all the papers that in the character of evidence in relation to this same supposed delinquency could have been produced these are criminative but did the same possession or any other within the reach of the searchers afford no others that were exculpative these are questions which common sense in aid of common probity cannot fail of pressing upon the minds of all parties concerned but to which the system of english procedure affords no adequate and allcomprehensive means of obtaining answers in pursuance of one of the most mischievous conceits that ever entered into a lawyers head—one of the most absurd if justice one of the best imagined if injustice were the object—the above sources of necessary explanation have in great measure been cut off and always to the prejudice of justice on whichever side of the cause seated by the responsive testimony of the defendant the existence of the criminative fact cannot be established nor the clouds that hung over it be cleared up because no man is to be compelled to accuse himself by the responsive judicial testimony of the same person neither can the existence of any of the abovementioned infirmative facts be established nor the clouds that hung over it    be cleared up because no man is to be a witness in his own cause if it were by a plaintiff in the cause that a mass of evidences—partly inculpative partly infirmative with relation to the criminative facts or in any other way exculpative—were discovered and made forthcoming—he produces what he pleases he suppresses what he pleases master at the same time of an accusation and a defence—he produces the accusation he suppresses the defence why—because no man is with or against his will to be a witness in his own cause of these mischievous maxims the breach is as notorious and perhaps as extensive as the observance but broken as they are there remains force in them to do mischief in deplorable abundance as well by their application to this topic as to a multitude of others §   forgery of real evidence when the appearance of things leads to wrong conclusions the deceit will sometimes be the pure work of nature at other times the work of human artifice the former case is exemplified but seldom when it is its birth may in the language in use among naturalists be ascribed to the play of nature the irrational animals may be ranked and to this purpose without injury in the class of things a case which whether real or fictitious is famous in the history of french jurisprudence may serve for illustration to an english eye there as elsewhere magpies have been remarked for a propensity to pick up and hide not food only but other articles though of a nature not applicable by these hoarders to any ascertainable use an innocent person was accused of stealing from the house of a neighbour several pieces of gold and being convicted suffered an ignominious death the real thief was a magpie which without the privity of its master had taken the money at different times piece by piece from the too accessible hoard of a neighbour and deposited it in a place inaccessible to any other than the unfortunate person who suffered as for stealing it when the deceit is the work of art—has human artifice for its cause—it may be ranked with forgery the act by which deceit is produced or endeavoured to be produced may be termed forgery of real evidence† in another though a nearly related point of view forgery of real evidence is to real evidence what subornation is to personal it is an attempt to pervert and corrupt the nature of things of real objects and thus force them to speak false of themselves the things are silent or if they speak speak to the inculpation of the defendant by the force he applies a thing that was silent is made to depose falsely—a thing that was speaking against him is either made to speak in his favour or at least put to silence as well in the case of real evidence as in the case of written evidence forgery is susceptible of one main distinction—into fabricative and obliterative the case where in the employment of expedients of this kind the endeavour of the criminal is simply to remove the imputation from himself without seeking to fasten it on anybody else is as common as the other case is rare whatever be the crime a main object of the endeavour of the criminal is of course to expunge as effectually as possible all traces of the commission of it the hands the garments of the murderer have they received a stain from the blood of the deceased the most obvious reflection suggests the removing the stain from everything from which it can be removed and the destroying or hiding anything from which it cannot be removed to superinduce upon any object an appearance the tendency of which shall be to disprove the commission of the crime—whether by disproving the existence of the criminal act or some criminative circumstance or by proving the existence of some justificative or extenuative or exemptive circumstance—an artifice of this tendency would suppose an ulterior degree of refinement and would come under the denomination of fabricative forgery of real evidence as it is only through the medium of physical facts that psychological facts can be brought to view it is consequently through the medium of physical facts alone that any deceptitious representation of psychological facts can be conveyed physical facts alone and not psychological facts are the only one of the two sorts of facts upon and in respect of which forgery can properly speaking be committed—to which the operations indicated by the term forgery can bear any direct and immediate application as to physical facts although among the several modifications of which real evidence of the evanescent kind is susceptible—evidence consisting of motions sounds colours    smells tastes and if the word may be used touches—there is not perhaps a single article that has not at one time or other been taken for the subject of that sort of deceptitious operation which applied to other subjects has received the name of forgery yet it is among the modifications of permanent real evidence that we are to look for that modification of forgery which is most in use most readily apprehended and most apt to present itself under that name the beautiful history of the patriarch joseph will afford us one exemplication of forgery respecting real evidence preparatory to the affectionate forgiveness he meditated to extend to his brethren his plan required that an alarm should be raised in their guilty bosoms—an apprehension of being punished not indeed for the barbarity of which he had formerly been the victim but for a supposed offence of recent date of which they were altogether innocent in this view it was that into one of the sacks that had been filled with the corn which they had been buying he caused a cup to be introduced which not having bought it they had never meant to take here then we have an example of forgery of real evidence of theft—forgery of real evidence of the permanent kind—forgery of evidence presented by the permanent situation of a certain material object a certain real body principal object and subjectmatter of the supposed theft the imputation of which it was intended thus to fix upon them though for a time only and for a generous and friendly purpose another example may be afforded by the modern case of captain donnellan the smell afforded by the laurelwater the poison supposed to have been employed by him as the instrument of death—this important phenomenon susceptible of permanence in respect of the substance itself and its odorous power evanescent when considered in respect of the sensations of which on any given occasion it might have been productive—was at any rate so long as the phial continued impregnated with it a lot of real evidence—a lot of evidence indicative at once of the physical act by which the poison was applied to the organs of the patient of the intention the murderous intention in pursuance of which these acts were performed and of the criminal consciousness with which that intention was accompanied conscious of all these facts as well as of the punishment annexed by law to such crimes donnellan on observing how the phial had become the subject of observation took it up and with the apparent view of doing away the instructive smell poured water into it and rinsed it out the forgery thus actually committed was of the kind that has been distinguished by the name of obliterative suppose now that instead of simply clearing the phial of the existing smell it had been his plan for further security to superinduce another—the smell for instance of some highlyscented medicine such as would have been suitable to the patients case—fabricative forgery would thus have been added to obliterative in the case where guilt guilt on the part of the forger really exists—the inculpative fact of which the act in question operates as evidence is a psychological fact—the existence of culpable consciousness—consciousness that the act whereby the effect is intended to be produced is of the number of those which stand proscribed by one at least of the two guardian sanctions the political and the moral if not by both the presumption thus afforded by this species of circumstantial evidence—the presumption of correspondent delinquency—is obviously a strong one it is however far from being a conclusive one cases supposable cases are not wanting in which supposing them realized the failure of the presumption the erroneousness of the inference will be obvious and indisputable nor are instances wanting in which these several supposable cases have been exemplified in real life   forgery exculpative in selfdefence against a false accusation forgery having for its object the removal of appearances tending to fasten the imputation of delinquency upon an individual really innocent the party in question being innocent—suppose at the same time a number of natural appearances tending to induce a persuasion of his being guilty take away the preexisting source of deception the forgery in question is true evidence of guilt add the preexisting source of deception the forgery by which the deception from this source is endeavoured to be done away is in the character of evidence of guilt fallacious no system of established procedure is yet known that does not afford instances—instances in greater numbers than an eye of sensibility can contemplate without concern and apprehension—where individuals really innocent have sunk under a load of imputation heaped upon them by fallacious circumstantial evidence suppose an article of this description pregnant with false inferences—an article exhibiting appearances susceptible of permanence—the dagger employed by a murderer conveved into the pocket of an innocent man one garment of an innocent man stained by design or accident with blood from the body of a man who has been murdered suppose the innocent man detected in his endeavours to rid himself of the dagger to wash away the blood the dagger the blood fallacious as they are are notwithstanding evidence these endeavours innocent as they are    will accordingly be in appearance at any rate and in a certain sense in reality forgery of real evidence the case of the unfortunate calas affords an exemplification of more than one of the incidents by which the conclusiveness of an inculpative presumption may be proved a son of his had received a violent death from his own hands the father was brought to trial on a charge of murdering the son as far as the confusion of mind into which he was plunged permitted he had obliterated or changed some of the appearances about the body of the deceased and other circumjacent bodies here was forgery of real evidence on his examination he denied some of the facts by which the nonnaturality of the death was indicated in this mode as in the former he concealed—not indeed the fatal act itself the act by which the process of strangulation was effected for in that he had neither part nor privity—but some of the evidentiary facts by which it was indicated here was clandestinity to what end all these aberrations from the line of truth—to cover guilt—no for there was none anywhere the object was to save the reputation of his departed child and thereby the reputation of the family from the ignominy which had the direct truth been known would he was but too well assured be stamped upon it by a most mischievous and endemial prejudice   forgery inculpative acted in sport forgery committed in endeavouring for a sportive purpose to fasten upon an innocent person the imputation of delinquency in this or that shape for a time† in the story already referred to—the story of joseph and his brethren—we may find an exemplification of this case though the sport was there not of the mirthful but of the serious and moral—not of the comic but of the tragic kind suppose the patriarch—minister as he was to an absolute king—suppose him notwithstanding amenable to the ordinary dispensations of justice suppose his fraternal and generous project observed and mistaken for a serious hostile one—the ultimate innocence of intention would when demonstrated have been sufficient to repel the presumption afforded by the apparent indications of a design deceptitious and injurious and to add to the instances by which it is proved that in the character of inculpative evidence this any more than any other species of evidence is never entirely exempt from the danger of proving fallacious penal justice is not the only theatre of a fraud of this complexion it is equally applicable to nonpenal cases it may have for its object the subjecting a man to punishment or to the burthen of making satisfaction when undue it may have for its object the exempting a man from punishment when due it may equally have for its object the causing a man to be put into possession of some right to which he has no just claim it may have for its object the exempting a man from some obligation which as necessary to the collation of a correspondent right some other person has a just claim to see imposed upon him the clandestine removal of a landmark affords an example of a case of forgery of real evidence having for its object the acquisition of a proprietary right considered in respect of its most obvious and most frequent motive and efficient cause it is a contrivance for stealing land it is a succedaneum to the forgery of a deed designed to serve as evidence of a title to land considered as the act of a person to whom the loss would not be productive of any profit it would at any rate be a contrivance for injuring a person in his property by destroying his title to land by the foregoing theoretic views a few practical instructions are obviously suggested the first is that it is an office incumbent on the legislator and under his authority and guidance on the judge—whenever any material objects present themselves as capable of affording real evidence in the cause be it penal be it nonpenal—to take such measures as may be suitable to the nature of the case for securing their continuance in that state in which they shall be still exhibitive of the evidence which they appeared to exhibit at the time of their being first observed and to prevent them from either passing of themselves or being purposely or accidentally brought into any other state in which the evidence exhibited by them might be in danger of proving fallacious the attention bestowed upon this object is in the french law particularly conspicuous more so than in the english in the former the judge has general explicit duties presented to him and explicit rules for his guidance with commensurate powers in the english law no special powers extensive enough to embrace the object are possessed    by any magistrate and in the exercise of his powers so far as they happen to be adequate he is left to his own unassisted discretion without any instruction for his guidance before any suspicion has arisen—before any steps have been taken in the view of bringing the delinquent to justice—the field for this species of forgery is open to him and no provisions taken by the legislator can be of any use the moment for making application of them not being yet come but as soon as suspicion has told her tale to justice and the servants of justice have been put upon the search for evidence then it is that things as well as persons may in this view be fit objects of their care   another subject for the consideration at least of the legislator is the putting where practicable this species of forgery under its several applications upon the same footing in respect of prohibition and punishment as forgery of written evidence when directed to the same ends by the compilers of the books of romanogerman law prussian as well as austrian† removal of landmarks constitutes an independent species of delinquency under a title by itself not referred to frand the crimen falsi or any other genus under the same denomination mention had been found to be made of it in the original books of ancient roman law‡ this it is evident is a case of forgery of real evidence in which the obliterative and the fabricative species are combined in so far as the designation that had been given of the real boundary is done away by it it is obliterative in so far as an indication of a false boundary is presented by setting the mark down again in a wrong place it is fabricative in this spot and in this alone the penal law of these two german states has covered a portion important indeed in its nature but comparatively minute in its extent of the wide field of this modification of forgery neither the english nor the old french law have made so much as this small advance towards the comprehension of this fraud the french in their adoption of the roman law seem somehow or other to have dropt what the more faithful germans have copied in french jurisprudence however instances are not wanting of the application real as well as suspected of this species of fraud to the most mischievous and flagitious purposes in the case of le brun∥ who died of the torture that had been unjustly inflicted on him for his supposed participation in the murder of his mistress the judicial officers when possession had been taken of an old key that had been in his occupation were charged by his advocates with having altered it into a masterkey for the purpose of his appearing to possess a facility which in fact he did not possess for the commission of the crime under the roman law the word stellionatus served as a head to comprise a hodgepodge of offences chiefly of the predatory class bearing scarce any other resemblance to each other out of six the third is si quis imposturam faciet in necem alterius—if any one shall have employed imposition in the view of depriving another of his life under this head forgery of real evidence for that particular purpose may probably have been meant to be comprised a lizard is a cunning animal and a stellio is the most cunning of all the lizards as pliny the most accurate of natural historians assures us it is upon the ground of this anecdote of natural history that the roman lawyers have jumbled together so many other offences which require no contrivance under the name of stellionatus stellionatus should by this description of it have been synonymous to fraud or been used to express exclusively some modification of fraud chapter iv of preparations attempts declarations of intention and thrlats considered as affording evidence of delinquency §   probative force of these circumstances considered in themselves i preparations—viz acts done in the intention of giving birth to the act considered as the principal fact the fact said to be evidenced the event having actually taken place—if the acts considered as preparations with regard to that event were such as properly come under that name their probative force with reference to it is out of dispute and they are assumed to be conclusive of acts of this description and those others that follow them under the same more extensive denomination of precedential acts it may be of use at the outset to observe that—although in point of time the acts themselves are essentially prior to the principal act or other fact—it will frequently happen that the time when they are understood to be such the time when their connexion with the principal fact is perceived and even the time when they themselves come to light is of later date that it should be so is the more natural inasmuch as—if the design being of a criminal or in other respects an obnoxious nature is understood or though it be but suspected—a natural though not a necessary    result is that it should be frustrated that the obnoxious event should be prevented from taking place it is in the penal law that acts of this description have been most frequently brought to notice the purchasing the collecting the fashioning the instruments of mischief the repairing to the spot destined to be the scene of it not that the facts which are apt to come in question in a nonpenal cause are in their nature by any means destitute of this species of circumstantial evidence—  preparations for the ceremony of interment have been brought forward as circumstantial evidence of expected though more naturally of precedent death most commonly to prove a death which really took place rarely but not without example to afford a fallacious proof of the death of a person at that time still in existence   preparations for birth i e for parturition have been brought forward sometimes to repel the charge or suspicion of the destruction of an illegitimate child by the mother sometimes to afford proof of filiation real or pretended   preparations for the marriage ceremony have been brought forward sometimes as presumptive proof of the subsequent performance of the ceremony sometimes as proof of an engagement to that effect when satisfaction for the breach of it has been claimed† when the act projected is of a criminal nature or where on any other account the discovery of the design threatens to be followed either by the frustration of it or by any other inconvenience either to the agent in question or to any other person or persons whose welfare is regarded by him with an eye of sympathy—the natural state of things is that the preparations should be endeavoured to be concealed understand the preparations for bringing about the event which is particularly and for its own sake endeavoured to be brought about but in this main and direct design are involved by accident a various and almost indeterminate multitude of incidental and collateral ones   preparations for giving birth to productive or facilitating causes of all kinds and degrees of propinquity or remoteness for removing obstructions of all kinds from all quarters and among others for obviating suspicion of the design itself   preparations as it were of the second order for preventing discovery or suspicion of the preparations of the first order viz of those which are pointed most immediately to the accomplishment of the principal design   to these preparations of the second order imagination will easily add preparations of the third and fourth order and so on for it is evident that to this chain of preparations—to the chain of eventual or intended causes capable of being thus spun out of the stores of wayward industry—there can be no certain limit the measures thus taken for concealment or illusion—for involving facts in darkness or covering them with false colours—will sometimes appear in the form of discourse oral or written sometimes in the shape of deportment—physical acts at large whatever a man does he does either by his own hands by his own immediate operative powers or by the hands of others when he gives motion to the hands of others it will generally be by words so if the hands or the lips of others be prevented from raising up obstructions to his designs and among the persons thus wrought upon—the persons prevented from becoming or continuing to act in the character of opponents or converted into coadjutors—may be the intended sufferer himself on march  0th      at the assizes at warwick captain donnellan was convicted of murder committed by poisoning sir theodosius bonghton in whose estates he had an interest in right of his wife under the present as well as several succeeding heads this case will be found pregnant with a variety of instructive illustrations the determination was formed that in some way or other the death of the young man should take place to shut the door against suspicion a notion was to be propagated that his state of health was desperate that death—speedy death—was certain that his imprudence was continually heaping up causes upon causes‡ the poison employed was distilled laurel water the plant was to be found of course in the garden and the murderer not to have poison to buy had provided himself with a still for the fabrication of it he practised distillation frequently and the room in which he operated was kept by him locked up∥ the young man had a trifling complaint for which he was taking medicine the contents of one of the phials were to be got rid of and the poison substituted the phials as they came in used to be placed by him in an inner room which he had been in the habit of locking up he happened once to forget to take his medicine why says donnellan dont you set it in your outer  0 room you would not then be so apt to forget it—the fatal advice was taken and thus the necessary opportunity was prepared preparations capable of a specific description are frequently and properly made the subject of a separate prohibition—converted into distinct offences where the connexion between any such preparatory act and its correspondent principal act is looked upon as sufficiently intimate—where the existence of the former is looked upon as sufficiently conclusive with regard to the existence of the latter—the vigilance of the legislator has not uncommonly exercised itself in laying hold of the preparatory act and converting it by his prohibition and punishment into a separate offence instead of taking the chance of the judge being able to treat it upon the footing of an evidentiary act with reference to the corresponding principal act and so bringing it within the punishment already attached to such principal act forgery coining but above all smuggling afford so many instances of this line of legislative practice under the head of indirect legislation it has been brought to notice in another place† to an operation of this sort an objection presents itself which when it is not conclusive as a bar may at any rate be useful as a caution such an operation it may be said will be either useless or mischievous useless if the effect of it be not to cause a man to be convicted of the offence in a case where otherwise he could not have been convicted mischievous in the opposite case to the judge alone it belongs to be informed of the circumstances of each individual case to the legislator not if in any given instance to him who is thus informed of those circumstances the evidentiary act even with the addition of whatever other evidence the case may happen to furnish does not appear to afford a sufficient ground for pronouncing the existence of the principal act—the operation of the legislator—the obligation which he lays on the judge to act as if the ground were sufficient—is an act of injustice it is productive of punishment where not due—and in the only remaining case justice at any rate does not gain by it to this objection three answers may be applied   in the first place the act of the legislator—the act whereby the prohibition is issued together with its punishment—is as such prior in its date to the occasion by which any act in disobedience of it can be produced the subject has complete and effectual warning of it for if not the answer it must be confessed does not apply the subject has complete warning of the prohibition put upon the newlyprohibited act the formerly unprohibited and amply evidentiary act and the abstaining from it is as much in his power as the abstaining from the principal act if indeed the law—instead of being a law precedent to the offence a law issued with the ordinary precedent notice—were a law subsequent to the offence—were in a word in the language of english jurisprudence and after the fashion of every decision of jurisprudence in a new case that monster of iniquity an ex post facto law—then indeed the objection would be not only applicable but unanswerable but this is not supposed to be the case   in the next place the more effectually to secure innocence from the punishment levelled against guilt—when an act that accidentally might now and then in the character of an evidentiary act have involved the agent in the punishment appertaining to the principal act—when such an act is taken in hand by the legislator and converted into a principal and independent offence care ought to be and commonly is taken to interweave in the description of the newcreated offence explanations serving to limit it and make sure of confining the application of the punishment to the case where the quondam evidentiary act the supposed act of preparation is really such—is really connected in the mind of the agent with the intention of committing the principal act   in the third and last place to the lastmentioned precaution may be and not unfrequently is added another—viz the reducing to a degree below that of the original or principal offence the punishment annexed to the evidentiary the newcreated offence instances of this sort in no inconsiderable number and variety would probably be found in the laws of all countries relative to smuggling they certainly are to be found in the british laws relative to that multifariouslydiversified species of offence what has been said of preparations may apply with little variation to attempts since—with reference to the ultimate object of intention the ultimate result—all attempts all motions previous to consummation may be considered as preparations by attempt we understand action carried beyond mere preparation but falling short of execution of the ultimate design in any part of it    between preparations and attempts the distinction will it is evident be in many cases very indeterminate and in different cases it will be widely different in penal cases it will be different according to the nature of the species of offence in offences of the same species it will be different again according to the different circumstances in which the different means by which the individual offence in question is endeavoured to be committed in case of homicide for example—according as the intended scene is laid on shipboard or by land on the public way or in a private chamber by drowning firearms or poison fortunately on the present occasion these distinctions are as useless as on any occasion they would be nice and intricate so the ultimate design be evidenced whether the act by which it is evidenced come under the denomination of an attempt or only of an act of preparation makes in this respect no difference ii second example of circumstantial evidence decidedly precedent to the fact evidenced declarations of intention—of the intention to perform the act the performance of which constitutes the principal fact the fact evidenced as above this species of circumstantial evidence bears a close analogy to the foregoing declarations of intention are expressions of intention purposely conveyed by words by preparations purposely or not the intention is expressed by acts the former belong to the head of personal evidence by discourse the latter to that of personal evidence by deportment iii threatening or menacement a threat an act of menacement is a name given to a declaration of intention in the case where the act declared to be intended is of the number of those of which it is supposed that the effects would be of a painful nature with reference to the person to whom the declaration is addressed the reason for giving to a declaration of intention in this case a separate mention under a separate name is that it necessarily assumes a separate name in every system of penal law inasmuch as where the act declared to be intended is considered and treated as an offence so is or at any rate in cases of a certain degree of importance so ought to be the declaration likewise a declaration to this effect may be expressed by any other signs as well as by words preparations when open may have for a collateral object this collateral result it matters not whether the threat be addressed immediately to the person on whose mind the unpleasant impression is intended or declared to be intended to be made—or to any other person or persons to the intent that in one way or other at some time or other it may reach his notice in a word if it be in the shape of a discourse oral or written that the threat is meant to be conveyed it matters not whether he be mentioned in the second person or the third for the reason given above menacement is presumptive evidence of the act i e that it was by or with the cooperation of the threatener that the act was done but for the reason also given above the evidence is not of itself absolutely conclusive §   —infirmative circumstances applicable i preparations and attempts infirmative circumstances applicable to them these circumstances have been already considered in the character of criminative circumstances evidentiary of the part supposed to have been taken by the supposed delinquent in the production of the noxious result remain to be brought to view the several possible facts by which in the character of infirmative facts their probative force in regard to the part supposed to have been taken by him is capable of being diminished   intention different ab initio† in which case the result intended to be produced may have been either—  altogether innoxious‡   less noxious than the result that actually took place or   equally or more noxious∥      intention overshot by the result but in this case the disprobabilizing the infirmative force of the infirmative fact applies not to the whole of the result but only to the excess of the result produced over the result intended   the intention changed viz at a time posterior to the attempt or course of preparation which being proved is exhibited in the character of a probabilizing circumstance evidentiary as against the supposed delinqent of a participation in the production of the mischief here as above it is only on the supposition of the fresh designs being less mischievous than the original one that the possibility of the infirmative fact in question can have or at least ought to have any influence in practice   intention persisting power failing the result though intended to be produced by the supposed delinquent having in fact been produced not by any act of his but by other means†   among codelinquents the operation of the immediate criminal agent varying from the common design agreed on this a case frequently exemplified includes the three first cases being distinguished by no other circumstance than that of the number of the offenders two or three engage in a plan of robbery one of them in prosecution of the design commits a murder—on his part intentional but not necessary to the design whether in the intention of committing the greater crime the accomplices in the lesser did or did not take part is among the questions which in a case of homicide on the occasion of a design of robbery have been passed over as not worth notice by the unfeeling negligence of english judges‡ in an early and rude state of society the attention of those on whose will the fate of their fellowcreatures depends has everywhere been almost exclusively pointed to physical facts regardless of psychological ones in the instance of the chinese lawyers englishmen being the eventual or intended victims of it this barbarity has attracted notice but it on this score the first stone be due to the head of the chinese lawyer the second is on a multitude of similar accounts due to those of his learned brothers on the english bench ii declarations or other expressions of intention infirmative facts applicable to the criminative force of discourse expressive of an intention to commit an offence of the nature of that eventually committed the supposable facts that apply in the character of infirmative considerations are in species and denomination the same that have been seen applying in the case of preparations and attempts but forasmuch as words are apt to be uttered with less consideration than a course of preparation attended with labour and hazard is wont to be engaged and persevered in—the probative force of the criminative circumstance seems in general less considerable and at the same time the disprobative    force of the infirmative consideration more considerable being of the nature of confessorial evidence viz of that species of it which is extrajudicial and spontaneous differing only in respect of relative time the confessorial evidence being subsequent to the event the evidence here in question antecedent it stands exposed to the disprobative force of the same infirmative considerations as confessorial evidence which see   if the state of things expressed in the former instance by the words intention different ab initio be exemplified here this is as much as to say that the declarations that have place here viz the declarations of an intention to commit the crime that in fact was afterwards committed were false supposing such to be the case the inferences that may be drawn from them and the infirmative considerations that apply to their probative force in the character of criminative circumstances are the same as in the case of false extrajudicial and spontaneous confessorial evidence or false responsion which see† the supposition that these declarations are false may at first view be apt to appear inconsistent with the supposition all along made viz that the crime in question has actually been committed and that by whom committed or rather whether committed by the supposed delinquent is the only remaining subject of inquiry but whether the crime actually committed by the supposition had or had not the supposed delinquent for a sharer in it—the declarations made of an intention to commit a crime of that or a similar description may at the time when made have been false and declarations of an intention to commit a crime are no less susceptible of being false than declarations of the opposite cast viz declarations of an intention to abstain from the commission of that or a similar crime see chapter vi in which the various inducements by which a man may have been engaged to avow the commission of a crime committed or not committed are brought to view iii threats—infirmative considerations applicable to threaten to do a criminal act is to express an intention of committing it the only difference is that when a man threatens to commit a crime he not only expresses an intention of committing it but declares this intention in the design that such his declaration should come to the knowledge and be productive of fear in the mind of some person in whose mind if committed he expects it would be productive of grief of course whatsoever infirmative considerations apply to declarations of intention taken at large viz declarations of an intention to commit the crime afterwards committed apply to threats viz to threats bearing relation to the same crime but in the case of threats these infirmative considerations seem in some instances to apply with superior disprobative force in the case of threats very commonly the result really intended to be produced is—not the mischief of the crime nor therefore the crime itself—but only the apprehension of it—the alarm the terror naturally attendant on the expectation of it—on the contemplation of it in the character of a mischief likely to take place if so it is in this way that the state of things expressed by the words intention different ab initio is here verified the consideration that contributes to render the falsehood of the declaration in question in this case probable and consequently to weaken the probative force of this circumstance in the character of a circumstantial evidence of the imputed delinquency as against the supposed delinquent is the tendency of such a prediction to obstruct and frustrate its own accomplishment by threatening a man you put him upon his guard and force him to have recourse to such means of protection as the force of the law or any extrajudicial powers which he may have at command may be capable of affording to him whatever may be the disprobative force with which in the character of an infirmative fact this tendency on the part of an antecedent threat may operate in opposition to its probative viz to its criminative force—the indication afforded by this infirmative consideration can never be peremptory and conclusive by the testimony of experience criminal threats are but too often sooner or later realized to the intention of producing the terror and nothing but the terror succeeds under favour of some special opportunity or under the spur of some fresh provocation the intention of producing the mischief and in pursuance of that intention the mischievous act note that among the tendencies of menacement is that of operating at the same time as an evidence of an ulterior and distinguishable evidentiary fact viz operation of corresponding motives existence of corresponding dispositions permanent sources of the delinquency in question in the instance of the supposed delinquent as to this point see further in an ensuing chapter‡ a question which may occasionally arise is how far mendacity on the part of a witness may be considered as probabilized by evidence proving him to have previously threatened to prejudice by his testimony a party on a side opposite to that on which he is called in particular in a criminal case to have threatened    to give such testimony as should render certain or more or less probable the conviction of the defendant in this supposed circumstantial evidence of mendacity may be seen a very frequent source of delusion and a very useful instrument in the hands of delinquents and their advocates if the threat be conditional next to nothing is proved by it if absolute still less if you do not so and so as i would wish i will testify against you with superior and refined morality it certainly is not consistent for a man thus to render dependent on a compliance with his personal wishes a service which he owes to justice but does it follow that because—out of court and before you have been called upon for your testimony by the official ministers of justice—you reserve to yourself or rather declare yourself to have reserved to yourself the faculty of making or not making as you think fit the preliminary disclosure which may eventually lead to prosecution—that therefore if by the power of justice called upon for your testimony you will perjure yourself a threat however of this kind—though taken by itself it operates with very little force in the way of presumptive evidence of mendacity—may be of considerable efficacy in corroboration of other circumstantial evidence to the same effect chapter v of nonresponsion and false or evasive responsion considered as affording evidence of delinquency i first article of that class of circumstantial evidence the nature of which is to present itself at a period of time subsequent to that of the principal fact—nonresponsion judicial silence on the part of an individual being a party to the cause at the time of his being subjected to examination in due form of law wilful forbearance to make answer in the character of a deposing witness to any relevant question put to him in the course of a judicial examination in this case is involved the supposition of the establishment of the practice in question in the instance of both parties plaintiff and defendant in both sorts of causes penal and nonpenal and in the supposition of the establishment of that practice is again involved the supposition of the propriety of it—of the propriety of it in the utmost latitude of which it is susceptible as above is it then proper and to an extent thus unlimited yes and that for two sorts of reason in the first place because the notions by which in one of the four cases viz that of the defendant in a cause of a penal nature it stands condemned are mere prejudices—groundless and utterly indefensible prejudices—conceits founded not on the principle of utility but solely on the principle of caprice in the next place because in this case as in the three others the practice in question is the most powerful as well as the safest of all instruments that can be employed for the discovery of truth the reasons in favour of the former of these positions will be exhibited under other heads the reasons which the latter has for its ground will now appear as we advance the fact of which this sort of behaviour operates as evidence—the conclusion to which it tends the inference which it appears to warrant—varies in its description as already intimated according to the quality of the cause penal or nonpenal and the relation which the party plaintiff or defendant bears to it case  —let the cause be a penal one and the person examined in the character of a witness the defendant in this case the conclusion will naturally be that he is guilty of the offence of which he stands charged thus stands the proposition the proof will be exhibited further on case  —let the cause be a nonpenal one and the party examined be the defendant as before the conclusion is of the same kind varying only with the nature of the cause the predicament he stands in is of the number of those in which a man stands bound by law to take upon him the obligation sought to be imposed upon him by the plaintiffs claim case  —let the cause be a penal one as before but the party the plaintiff in this case if it be a cause purely penal—the demand made by the plaintiff being purely the infliction of punishment and that a punishment not including any effect of a nature to afford personal satisfaction to himself as is the case where the plaintiff prosecutes for the public merely in which case he is a public officer acting without personal interest in this case it cannot fall to the share of the plaintiff to be examined if by accident and it could happen only by accident it did fall to his lot to be examined wilful forbearance to answer is a result that can scarcely be supposed it being difficult to suppose a motive that should engage him to it and supposing it to take place no conclusion can in the nature of the case be drawn from it if the cause be of the mixed kind in which a nonpenal demand is combined with the penal one—a demand of satisfaction for the benefit of the individual with the demand for punishment to be inflicted for the benefit of the public—in this case so far as concerns the nonpenal part of the demand the case coincides    with the case next following the conclusion turns to the prejudice of the plaintiff in the same way as we saw it turn to the prejudice of the defendant in the preceding nonpenal case case  —cause nonpenal party the plaintiff as before conclusion the plaintiffs claim illfounded the defendant not in fact in that situation which it is necessary he should be in to give legality to the demand made upon him by the plaintiff—the demand that he shall be compelled to submit to the obligation sought to be imposed upon him at the instance of the plaintiff the obligation correlative to the plaintiffs pretended right now then as to the proof—the grounds of the conclusion that the party refusing to make answer to questions put to him by authority of justice was in the wrong in respect of the point in controversy in the cause and first where the party in question is the defendant and the cause a penal one   supposing him not guilty such silence cannot but be detrimental to him supposing him guilty it cannot but be advantageous to him that is to say supposing the judge were to abstain from drawing the inference which no individual viewing the matter in the same point of view ever fails to draw on the ground of the known principles of human nature and common sense to answer one way or other cannot but be in his power no question whatever to which a man any man whatsoever is not able to make an intelligible answer of some sort quest what do you know about this business ans so and so or i know nothing about the matter whatever be the question whosoever be the individual to whom it is propounded an answer to one effect or the other may in every case be given by him the answer may be true or false if false the case belongs to the head next considered the party is exposed to suspicion—to a strong and serious suspicion of having been really guilty of the offence of which he stands accused followed or not followed by punishment—the persuasion entertained respecting the truth of the accusation—entertained by every man to whose cognizance the particulars of the examination present themselves will be the same the part that will be in general acted on such occasion by a man who feels himself guilty being made known to all mankind by reason grounded on experience—so sure as that part is acted by any man so sure will he be looked upon as guilty by all who know of it and being so looked upon the disrepute attendant upon the offence—the punishment attached to it by the popular or say the moral sanction—the forfeiture of a correspondent portion of esteem and consequent goodwill attaches upon him of course supposing him not guilty every fact and circumstance that he knows will contribute if known to manifest his innocence for that he has not done the act charged upon him is certain by the supposition between facts that are all true there cannot be any incompatibility any inconsistency if therefore there be a single true fact with which the fact charged upon him is inconsistent that fact cannot but be false speaking therefore from memory and not from invention—by every fact he discloses he gives himself an additional chance of manifesting the falsity of the imputation cast upon him forbearing to put in for this advantage he makes manifest by as plain a token as it is possible for a man to display—as plain as he could by any the most direct confession that were to confine itself to general terms—that the situation he is in is of that sort that does not suffer a man to put in for that advantage the situation of him whose memory holds up to him the picture of his own guilt such are the grounds of the inference spread out at full length but where is the individual male or female high or low rich or poor who being of ripe years and of a sound mind is not in the habit of drawing the same inference with equal correctness and security though by a shorter process and without the trouble of clothing it in words where is the master or mistress of a family who seeing reason to suspect a child or servant of any forbidden act does not for the confirmation or removal of such suspicion employ this species of evidence and with more confidence than any other—silence is tantamount to confession is accordingly an observation which whether it may happen or not to have been yet received in any collection of proverbs is repeated and acted upon with not less confidence and certainty with not less safety than the most familiar of the sayings which have been thus distinguished could the existence of a set of human beings have been conceived endowed with any particle of the attribute of rationality in whom a conceit of any kind should to such a degree have extinguished the lights of reason and common sense as to have disposed them to shut the door of justice against this surest safest and most satisfactory species of evidence yes two have already been indicated—english lawyers—and a people whose boast it is with eyes hermetically closed to be led by a hook put into their noses by the interested hands of english lawyers in the character or at any rate the guise of an objection or exception one consideration has here a claim to notice a case it may be said there is in which in the instance of a defendant under examination the inference    from muteness to delinquency will not be just—understand the individual act of delinquency of which he stands suspected for it is relatively to that and that alone that decision pronouncing delinquency can be pertinent and just his conduct will be just the same if instead of the motives furnished as above by appropriate delinquency there be any others to which it can happen to bind him to silence with equal force and without having been guilty in respect of the individual act of delinquency imputed to him may it not happen to a man to be bound to silence by the pressure of other equally coercive or even more than equally coercive motives yes certainly it may but of what nature can be these hypothetical and just possible motives motives derived from delinquency motives not derived from delinquency under one or other of these divisions they cannot but be comprised say in the first place motives derived from delinquency the delinquency from which they are derived will then be of an order inferior equal or superior understand as indicated and measured by the degree of punishment with reference to the act of delinquency upon the carpet to motives derived from delinquency of an inferior order it cannot happen to have produced this supposed equal pressure sooner than expose himself to the superior punishment as he would by silence a man will make answer though such answer be confession and though the effect of such confession be to expose him to punishment—such punishment being by the supposition inferior to that to which he would expose himself by silence put the case of equal delinquency and punishment the silence will be quite natural put the case of superior delinquency and punishment it will be still more so but what follows to the prejudice of the conclusion at least in respect of the utility of the practical conduct proposed to be grounded on it—absolutely nothing   in the first place a coincidence of this sort though possible is much too rare and too improbable to constitute a valid objection to the practical conduct to which the inference leads if valid as an objection to conviction and execution in this case it would be an objection at least equally valid to conviction and execution in every case it would be an objection more than equally valid to every other species of circumstantial evidence in a word to every other species of evidence false testimony—even false criminative testimony—at least false testimony amounting to mere incorrectness and not accompanied with criminal consciousness—is more common than the sort of coincidence here supposed false testimony in cases nonpenal is abundantly more so in penal causes false testimony on the exculpative side still more so cases of this rare sort have now and then appeared but as often as they have appeared they have been cited not for their probability but for their extraordinariness a story i have often heard or read of no matter which may serve for illustration an entertainment was given by some great personage to a numerous and mixed company in the course of it a trinket was displayed the value of which had by i know not what operation of the principle of association been raised in his imagination and affections above all ordinary estimation on a sudden an alarm was given that the precious article was missing let every man of us be searched said one of the company yes let every man of us be searched said all the rest one man alone refused the eyes of all were instantly upon him his dress betrayed symptoms of penury no doubt remained about the thief he entreated and obtained of the master of the house a moments audience in a private room his pockets were turned inside out when in one of them was found—not the lost thinket but something eatable he had a wife who for such or such a time had gone without food the story may be true or not true but supposing it ever so true would it afford any valid objection against the universallyprevailing law which authorizes the making search about the persons abodes and other receptacles in the occupation of suspected persons for stolen goods it would afford a better argument in such case against such search than the possibility of the coincidence in question can afford against the examination of a defendant   another consideration is that—supposing the coincidence realized the inference drawn and that by the supposition an erroneous one and the decision followed by the practical measures which are the proper consequences—still there is no harm done a man suffers for an offence indeed of which he is not suspected or accused but not for an offence of which he is not guilty the consequence is good in all its shapes—prevention by example—prevention by incapacitation—reformation—compensation if the case calls for it and furnishes matter for it—the good in all its shapes that is looked for in penal justice none of the alarm that reverberates from injustice remains the case of the absence of all delinquency    but if the former case is so rare how much rarer is this latter case to a suffering equal or superior to that which is fastened upon a man by the given delinquency with the punishment annexed to it he would expose himself were he to make his conduct known—expose himself without being justly chargeable with any act of delinquency—without having done any of those acts in virtue of which the punishment would be just this indeed is possible but still more improbable innocent himself a man chooses to be treated as if he were guilty rather than to expose the secrets of a mistress or a friend an act of martyrdom perfectly heroical and the more heroical the fitter a subject for a play or a romance but the more heroical the more rare and therefore the less fit a subject to constitute a ground for the steps of the legislator the secret protected at this price the secret of the mistress or the friend—was there any spice of delinquency mixed with it the muteness heroical or otherwise is at any rate criminal it is the common case of an unwilling witness unwilling to expose a friend to the punishment which his delinquency has incurred that sort of contumacy which wheresoever it exists it is incumbent on the law to get the better of at any price without any the least guilt on any part—on the part of the examinant himself on the part of his mistress or his friend—of a true and full account of his own proceeding out of his own mouth will the effect be to subject them or him to punishment of a conduct which not being tainted with delinquency exposes a man to suffer as for delinquency are any examples to be found not impossibly but once more the case is too extraordinary to afford any tolerable ground for the rejection of so instructive a species of evidence—a species by far less exceptionable less liable to give birth to undue decision than any other that can be named appearances are against him to borrow a phrase from the title to a play appearances are against him and by the disclosure of these appearances he subjects himself to punishment for an offence of which he was innocent appearances are against him yes some of the appearances but are there none that are for him the same examination which calls upon him to disclose the one calls upon him to disclose the other of those which are against him he is called upon to give an explanation the explanation if favourable to himself will by the supposition be conformable to truth being conformable to truth is the conclusion to be that it will be disbelieved that by possibility it may be so is not to be denied but once more probabilities and not improbabilities constitute the true ground for legislative practice ii nonresponsion extrajudicial in a penal case the act the negative act of him who understanding himself to be suspected of an offence and being interrogated concerning it forbears to make answer to such judicial questions as are put to him in relation to it the tendency of this case is evidently to afford an inference of the same nature as is afforded in the case just mentioned in degree however the inference will most commonly be weaker and is capable of existing in all degrees down to 0 the strength of it depends principally upon two circumstances the strength of the appearances understand the strength they may naturally be supposed to possess in the point of view in which they present themselves to the party interrogated—the strength of the appearances and the quality of the interrogator suppose him a person of ripe years armed by the law with the authority of justice authorized as in offences of a certain magnitude persons in general commonly are under every system of law to take immediate measures for rendering the supposed delinquent forthcoming for the purposes of justice†—authorized to take such measures and to appearance having it in contemplation so to do—in such case silence instead of answer to a question put to the party by such a person may afford an inference little if at all weaker than that which would be afforded by the like deportment in case of judicial interrogation before a magistrate suppose on the other hand a question put in relation to the subject at a time distant from that in which the cause of suspicion has first manifested itself—put at a time when no fresh incident leads to it—put therefore without reflection or in sport by a child from whom no such interposition can be apprehended and to whose opinion no attention can be looked upon as due in a case like this the strength of the inference may vanish altogether in the three remaining cases that of the plaintiff in a penal cause that of the plaintiff and that of the defendant in a nonpenal cause—from what has been said it will be easy to deduce the nature and strength of the inference afforded by this same modification of circumstantial evidence in all these cases the evidentiary fact being nonresponsion    the fact evidenced will be want of right—unfoundedness of the pretensions advanced by them in their respective situations in all these cases the relation—the connexion—between fact and fact on which the presumption grounds itself is the same the cases in which the presumption is liable to fail are also much the same but the injury liable to result to the individual from a decision to his prejudice in the case where such decision in respect of its being grounded on such presumption is undue being by possibility not so great—the inference will be drawn with so much the greater freedom in any of these three latter cases then in the case first mentioned iii false responsion the inference is of the same nature and in point of strength whenever in this respect there is any difference between this case and that of nonresponsion it is in this case that the inference the probability of guilt will be the strongest in the case of judicial interrogation the particular inference applying to the particular case will be strengthened by the general unfavourable inference the shade thrown upon a mans character by the additional circumstance of falsehood supposing it always to have acquired the tinge of mendacity by the infusion of criminal consciousness in the case of nonjudicial interrogation whatever counterinference may be deduced from the topic of incompetency on the part of the interrogator will by the additament here in question generally speaking be repelled—a question an idle question put to me by a child a question from such a quarter—could i have conceived that it would be thought to have any claim to notice in justification of simple silence the defence might be pertinent and even convincing to false responsion the application of it could scarce extend of the claim it had to notice you yourself have borne sufficient testimony so far from grudging the trouble of a true answer you bestowed upon it the greater trouble of a lie false answers are naturally enough interspersed more or less with selfcontradictory ones the case is no otherwise varied by the intermixture than by this viz that in the case of selfcontradiction the falsehood is more palpable and incontestable of any two contradictory propositions the one or the other will of necessity be false take away this internal and irrefragable proof the detection of the falsehood must rest upon the basis—the more or less precarious basis of other evidence iv evasive responsion is responsion in words and appearances nonresponsion in effect it may be termed virtual nonresponsion under this head may be comprised all answers in so far as they are irrelevant to the interrogatories all answers in which nothing is contained that has in any respect the effect of a compliance with the requisition or say command which every interrogatory as such involves in its very nature responsion is either relevant or irrelevant if irrelevant and after admonition persisted in it is evasive if evasive it is tantamount to silence or rather in the case of evasion if there be any difference the inference is stronger silence may be ascribed to stupidity evasion is the work of art—the natural resource of selfcondemning consciousness but evasion—to what circumstance when successful does it owe its capacity of having the effect of silence that is the desired effect without the undesired to indistinctness everything is referable to this cause in some instances it will now and then happen that indistinctness designed or undesigned shall have the effect of false statement affirmative or negative in that case upon a first view and for the advantage of his design he is taken to have said something—while upon a second view and to the disadvantage of his design he is not found to have said anything as against punishment or other burdensome infliction he is secure when perhaps by means of some false and fallacious conceptions conveyed by these same words to the mind of the judge he has produced the same desired effect that would not have been produced if any assertion had been hazarded by him in express words but the most common deceptitious effect and use of indistinct language understand to the deceitful deponent is to operate as a succedaneum to silence to prevent the judge or whoever on this occasion stands in the situation of the judge from observing among the several points to which a man could not have spoken truly without speaking in the way of confession what there may be to which he has forborne to speak evasion is a sort of middle course between nonresponsion false exculpative responsion and confessorial responsion compelled to say something on pain of the consequence which cannot fail to attach upon his virtual refusal to say anything a man keeps saying what amounts to nothing partly in the hope that the imposition may pass undetected and the insignificant discourse be accepted as if it were significant partly to give himself time to consider into which of the two other paths—confessorial truth or exculpative falsehood—he shall betake himself the effect of indistinct language in the character of an advantageous substitute to false statement or silence depends greatly upon the magnitude of the mass—the voluminousness    of it in the case of written language take a single short proposition—be the language of it ever so indistinct it will commonly be seen to be so the insignificance of it and in case of mala fides the evasiveness will be seen through but in psychological as in physical objects as the mass increases the transparency diminishes and since along with the indistinctness of the object the exertion of the mind in its endeavour to see through it increases it will not unfrequently happen that the sinister purpose of the manufacturer of the chaos shall be effected by the mere lassitude of the eye which has the misfortune to stand engaged to look into it order—method—is among the instruments which intellectual vigour has to construct for the assistance of intellectual weakness and which when made intellectual weakness assists itself by in its endeavours to surmount the difficulties it has to contend with but as on one hand the labour and difficulty of producing order so on the other hand the demand for it increases with the magnitude of the mass—with the multitude of the elementary particles which compose it order—meaning good order—order the best adapted to the purpose—consists in the selecting out of the whole number of changes capable of being rung upon the number of elementary parts in question that one of the whole number that will place the aggregate mass in the most intelligible point of view the number of changes capable of being rung upon an assemblage of elementary parts increases with the number of those parts—increases with that rapidity of increase which is so familiarly and precisely known to mathematicians and which is matter of so much astonishment to persons altogether unconversant with the first rudiments of that science but with the number of changes capable of being rung upon the elementary parts of the mass in question increases the chance in favour of disorder and confusion—the difficulty of producing order—the difficulty of detecting the want of it—the difficulty of pointing out the remedy for the want of it for the purpose of insisting on the application of the remedy—the facility of producing that sort and degree of disorder which shall weary out the energies of the inspecting eye and force it to withdraw from the subject altogether to save itself from the labour perhaps the fruitless labour of persevering in the endeavour to discover what has and what has not been said and done it is in written language alone that the art of evasion finds a favourable field for its operations let the deposition be delivered vivâ voce any attempt of this sort is soon rendered abortive though accepted in such abundant instances in the readywritten form in masses of any magnitude—testimony is never accepted in the spontaneous mode in the form of vivâ voce testimony in a mass of any considerable magnitude delivered in the vivâ voce form and thence in the presence of the judge if indistinct and by law not capable of being subjected to interrogation for to this pitch of opposition to common sense has legal usage soared—no better purpose—none more favourable to the design of the malâ fide deponent—will be answered by it than would have been answered by silence but if subject to interrogation by interrogation it would immediately be clarified and reduced either to false statement or to verbal silence delivered in the shape of written language a mass of indistinct matter runs on to any number of pages or volumes delivered vivâ voce in the presence of a person having power to interpose at any time by interrogation it is stopped at the first indistinct word chapter vi of spontaneous selfinculpative testimony considered as affording evidence of delinquency §   confession and confessorial evidence what—distinction between them when the supposed delinquent is really guilty—the offence the subject of discourse between himself and another person—and he himself the speaker—in the natural course of things the composition of the discourse will be a mixture of falsehood and truth fear of detection and the view of the criminative force with which in so far as followed by detection falsehood never fails to act being sufficient to prevent it from being willingly recurred to in any other case than where to repel suspicion it seems altogether indispensable but though in the discourse itself these elements will generally be found in a state of combination yet for the purpose of explanation it will be neither useless nor impracticable to separate them in idea and examine them apart moreover on the occasion of any such discourse—howsoever it should have happened that the discourse was begun by the supposed delinquent whose conduct by the supposition is the subject of it—yet it will seldom happen but that in the view taken of it by the hearer or hearers say for simplicitys  0 sake the hearer it will in this or that part appear obscure ambiguous or if not incorrect at any rate more or less imperfect in every one of which cases—if on the part of the hearer discourse as well as thought is free—interrogation on that part responsion on the other will in some shape or other take place of course in the ordinary colloquial intercourse between man and man it is however not less natural for the discourse to take its commencement without interrogation than by interrogation having been thus begun it may happen to it to continue upon that same footing for any length of time and so long as upon that same footing it does continue it will be conducive to distinctness of conception to consider in what shape the sort of evidence in question—selfdisserving and selfcriminative verbal evidence—is capable of presenting itself by itself and without any admixture of that sort of evidence in the extraction of which interrogation has been the instrument employed when on the part of a supposed delinquent discourse of the selfregarding kind and with relation to the offence in question of a selfdisserving and thence it being a case of supposed delinquency of a selfcriminative or selfinculpative tendency is considered as sufficient of itself to justify a judgment of conviction declaring him convicted of that offence—such discourse is when taken in the aggregate styled in judicial practice a confession in regard to the two modifications of evidence distinguished from each other by the denominations of direct and circumstantial it has already been remarked how intimate the connexion is—how faint and oftentimes scarce determinative the boundary line which separates them a confession if so it really be that it is particular enough to form a sufficient ground for conviction cannot fail to contain more or less of that sort of evidence which requiring no ulterior inference to be drawn from it may with propriety be considered as being of the nature of direct evidence but moreover what can scarcely happen is that it should not contain any admixture of circumstantial evidence viz of propositions each of which coming as they do from the supposed delinquent supposing it to have stood by itself might have operated with more or less probative force towards conviction by means of some inference for which it would afford a ground—by means of some such inference and not otherwise when it amounts to a confession the mass of discourse in question is full and satisfactory as above but even when so far as it goes the tendency of it is disserving and in respect of the occasion selfcriminative yet when delivered in loose and casual fragments it may happen to it to possess this tendency in any the slightest degree imaginable operating with any degree of probative force from the highest to the lowest in the case where the whole mass being complete would have amounted to a confession if any fragment is broken off the remaining force may be styled a mass or article of confessorial evidence    this it will be seen presently is far from being the only species of imperfect selfdisserving and thereby selfcriminative or selfinculpative evidence exemplified in practice it is however one species of selfdisserving evidence and forasmuch as a mass of simply confessorial evidence i e a mass of confessorial evidence not amounting to a confession does not of itself form a sufficient ground for conviction while a mass of confessorial evidence amounting to a confession does of itself form a sufficient ground for conviction—it would be of no small utility in practice if a criterion was established whereby without danger of dispute or misconception it might upon every occasion be pronounced of a mass of selfdisserving and selfinculpative evidence whether it was a complete confession or nothing more than a mass more or less considerable of confessorial evidence let this criterion be constituted by the application of the process of interrogation interrogation oral or epistolary as shall be determined but at any rate judicially performed insomuch that—be the mass of confessorial evidence upon the face of it ever so correct as well as complete—yet until and unless for the assurance of its correctness as well as completeness it has had that security which it is not in the power of anything but the process of interrogation to afford let it not be considered as amounting in any case to a confession for any such practical purpose as that of conviction as above mentioned short of a confession—although so far as it goes confessorial—it may of course be after and notwithstanding interrogation but without interrogation let it never be considered as amounting to a confession in what degree soever upon the face of it ample and instructive another condition which it might perhaps be proper to add to the description of a confession is this viz that to amount to a confession although extracted by judicial interrogation it ought to be such as would have been sufficient to warrant a conviction had it been delivered by an extraneous witness selfregarding evidence as has been observed in a former chapter is the only species of direct testimonial evidence which with reference to a complex act of the description in question a criminal act can be complete without comprehending any article whatever of circumstantial evidence—without leaving any fact to be made out by inference when it is thus complete—mention being made in it of every fact psychological as well as physical which is necessary to complete the description    of the offence this deponent the person whose testimony it is being the defendant the person who stands accused or suspected of that offence such body of evidence may be termed plenary confession if there be any one such fact of which express mention is not contained in the mass of evidence so denominated the confession whether satisfactory or not is at any rate short of plenary in practice it may very well happen that in this or that instance it may without being strictly speaking plenary be considered as being equivalent to plenary and as satisfactory as if it were so as for instance if reus being accused of the murder of occisus on being interrogated says yes it was indeed i who struck the fatal blow in this example nothing more is necessarily deposed to than the physical act but from the confession thus made of the physical act the existence of the correspondent intention a psychological fact will naturally enough be inferred of course there is no imaginable lot of testimonial evidence which may not as hath already been observed operate in the character of direct as well as in that of circumstantial evidence as this is the case with extraneous so is it and more particularly with selfregarding evidence direct with reference to one fact the fact asserted by it it may be circumstantial with regard to another fact a fact inferred from the assertion but its being capable of operating in the character of direct evidence does not lessen the force of the demand which calls upon us to consider it in the character of circumstantial evidence there is therefore no possible modification of confessorial evidence that will not require to be considered here under the head of circumstantial evidence in truth it is only in its character of confessorial evidence—in respect of its capacity of affording inferences meant or not meant by the party to be drawn from it—that it admits so great a variety of modifications consider it purely and simply in the character of direct evidence—consider the asertion as evidentiary of the fact asserted by it and nothing more—all these distinctions vanish by the assertion in question the fact asserted is proved or not proved—that fact and that fact alone—according as the testimony is regarded as true or false in considering whether a given lot of selfregarding evidence belongs or not to the head of confessorial evidence regard must be had not to the conception entertained or not by the confessionalist himself in regard to the consequences of it whether to himself or others but merely to the use eventually made of it when exhibited in the course of the cause the application of which it is regarded as susceptible being considered the idea of reluctance on the part of the confessionalist will naturally enough be presented by the term confession and its several conjugates but if reluctance were looked upon as a necessary component circumstance the extent of the idea thus annexed to the term would be found to fall far short of the extent that will be found necessary to be given to it on many of the occasions on which the demand for it presents itself these occasions will be distinctly brought to view when we come to speak of the different modifications of confessorial evidence the case where the utterance of it is attended with reluctance is but one out of many distinguishable modifications §   of spontaneous confessorial evidence extrajudicially delivered of this species of evidence it being one characteristic property that the tendency of it is prejudicial and that in any degree up to the highest to him to whom it owes its birth and another that it comes out spontaneously and without any application of the instrument with the help of which evidence of the same tendency is capable of being extracted from the unwilling mind by the hand of power two doubts naturally present themselves as seeking for satisfaction viz to what causes it is capable of owing its birth and to what others its introduction to the theatre of justice to the first of these questions an answer may be conveyed by so many specific denominations each of them having the effect of indicating the cause the psychological cause to which the species so denominated owes its birth to the other an answer will be afforded by an indication given in each instance of the causes of transpiration incidents by the force of which it has been found in practice that evidence of the species in question has made its way to the theatre of justice   first species of selfinculpative or selfcriminative evidence conspiratorial evidence discourse held amongst delinquents as to the time place means and other circumstances of the offence whether already committed or as yet but meditated examples of the causes of transpiration—  overhearing   loss of papers by accident by interception by seizure   disclosure with or without treachery on the part of one or more of the codelinquents      simply confidential a disclosure made whether from any interested view or merely in expectation of sympathy by one or more of the codelinquents before or after the commission of the offence to an individual who either was or was expected to be a partaker in it transpiration causes the same in this second case as in the first   jactitantial—directly or purposely jactitantial the supposed offender taking a pride in the offence or in the reputation of having committed it makes an intentional and unreserved statement of it in a manner more or less circumstantiated to one on whose part he expects on that account esteem or sympathy transpiration causes still the same   jactitantial through unadvisedness in the view of conciliating esteem or sympathy a man relates some act of his in itself not criminal or otherwise obnoxious but which in one way or other becomes evidentiary of the principal act—the act of delinquency in question transpiration causes still the same   simply unadvised or unadvisedly colloquial in the way of ordinary conversation without any design of boasting a man speaks either of some act of his own or of any other incident any other matter of fact which—in virtue of some connexion that he is not aware of with the principal fact in question the fact of his delinquency—operates in the character of an evidentiary fact in relation to it for example his having been in such a place at such a time transpiration causes still the same except that there is no place for treachery no confidence having been placed   unadvisedly exculpative finding or apprehending himself exposed to the imputation of the act of delinquency in question—the supposed delinquent in the view of wiping off the imputation or screening himself from it mentions in discourse some matter of fact which without his being aware of such its tendency contributes to the contrary effect as above transpiration causes as per last no room for treachery   penitential or penitentially confessorial though by the supposition the occasion on which it is delivered is here extrajudicial it may happen to it to have been delivered in contemplation of its being judicially produced in evidence if so—here as in the case of a confession or confessorial evidence judicially delivered transpiration is out of the question if so it were that the communication was made in confidence it then in respect of transpiration causes coincides with simply confidential selfdisserving evidence as above but in this case as in that other it remains for inquiry by what causes a course so repugnant to the universallyprevalent principle of selfpreservation was produced   superiorbenefitseeking by the pursuit of some benefit it may happen to a man to make known some fact which—without his being aware of it or even though he be aware—may happen to contribute in the character of an evidentiary fact towards his being convicted of the offence in question probability and nearness as well as magnitude considered on both sides it may happen that the value of the benefit shall be in his eyes so great as to more than compensate for the risk of the whole mass of evil punishment included which he beholds attached to the offence the infirmative considerations applicable to the probative force of criminative circumstantial evidence of this class seem capable of being designated in general terms by three words viz   misinterpretation   incompleteness   mendacity   misinterpretation has in this case the effect that incorrectness on the part of the evidence itself has if not misinterpreted inasmuch as though the evidence itself be not incorrect yet the conception produced by it either in the mind of the judge or in the mind of the extrajudicially percipient witness the earwitness of the discourse and through him in the mind of the judge is incorrect and deceptitious causing the supposed delinquent to be believed to have committed an act of delinquency which in truth he did not commit   as to incompleteness it depends upon the manner in which it is incomplete whether the effect of it shall to the prejudice of the supposed delinquent be the same as that of incorrectness or whether it shall amount to nothing more than the rendering the probative the criminative force of it less considerable than if it had been nearer to the being complete   by mendacity here as elsewhere is to be understood wilful and purposed incorrectness where the evidence thus delivered the discourse thus used is incorrect being rendered so wilfully and on purpose   misinterpretation by misinterpretation on the part of the judge the deceptitious effect produced by circumstantial evidence of this description is susceptible of modifications    analogous to that already mentioned as producible by misinterpretation of preparations and attempts directed in appearance but as in the case supposed it happened not in reality to the act of delinquency eventually committed instead of the act which by means of the misinterpretation is supposed and concluded to have been committed—under the supposition of its having been virtually acknowledged to have been committed—the act really performed may have been—  blameless though seeking secrecy   blameless and not so much as seeking secrecy   imaginary as if the intimation given of it whether directly or in the way of allusion or insinuation was meant in the way only of sport or jest or if the act committed by the supposed delinquent and meant by him on the occasion in question to be spoken of was an act which though culpable was culpable in a different manner or in less a degree than the act which from the consideration of such his discourse is inferred from it and believed to have been committed many cases may be put in which that which really is not a confession might be taken for and acted upon as such a paper is found in the defendants handwriting charging him the defendant with a crime though written by the defendants hand it may have been the discourse of another person and all of it false simple curiosity or even the intention of refuting it in a private way or with the assistance of justice might have been his motive for copying it the poet jean baptiste rousseau wrote a virulent libel aspersing a multitude of respectable characters saurins among the rest and circulated it in manuscript saurin having borrowed one of these manuscripts copied it with his own hand for the purpose of answering it or instituting a prosecution on the ground of it rousseau hearing of this or suspecting it got possession of saurins copy and on the ground of it with the help of some false evidence for the explanation of it instituted a prosecution against saurin charging him with being the author of it the truth was discovered by the vivâ voce examination of the false witnesses and this too without the benefit of that sort of examination which under the name of crossexamination they would have undergone had it been in england the confession may have been given in the way of jest the whole of it or any part devoid of truth neither in fact conformable to the truth of things nor so much as meant to be taken for such a case of this description happened if i have been rightly informed not many years ago in england from i know not what circumstances a person whom i will call juraturus was expected to be put upon the jury in a cause of public expectation in which the affections of political parties took an interest a letter was written to him by jocosus conjuring him to see the defendant convicted right or wrong for this letter jocosus was prosecuted as for embracing the name given by the english law to the act of extrajudicial solicitation where the sort of ephemeral judge called a juryman is the subject of it the matter being somehow explained jocosus escaped conviction or at least punishment administered under that name but the costs of prosecution were in effect a punishment and a very severe one had the testimony of the defendant been receivable in law and known to be so the prosecution would hardly have been instituted   incompleteness it is evident that an extrajudicial confession may be incomplete to any imaginable degree for—  in the shape in which the discourse flows from the lips of the confessionalist it may be loose and imperfect up to every conceivable degree of imperfection   the interlocutor—who may be sensible or to the highest conceivable degree insensible of such its deficiency—may accordingly let it pass in such its imperfect state without applying himself in any way to render it more complete   though he possessed in ever so high a degree the requisite inclination the power the effective power of commanding and producing the requisite explanations may on his part be deficient in any conceivable degree   the case of mendacity requires more explanation to a first view nothing can be more paradoxical than the case of a mans having recourse to falsehood for the purpose of subjecting himself perhaps to the punishment at least to the disrepute attached to a supposed act of delinquency which in fact he has not committed in the relation between the sexes may be found the source of the most natural exemplifications of this as of so many other eccentric flights the female umarried—punishment as for seduction hazarded the imputation invited and submitted to for the purpose of keeping off rivals and reconciling parents to the alliance the female married—the like imputation even though unmerited invited with a view to marriage through divorce even without view either to marriage or to possession without marriage—vanity without the aid of any    other motive has been known the force of the moral sanction being in these cases divided against itself to afford an interest strong enough to engage a man to sink himself in the good opinion of one part of mankind under the notion of raising himself in that of another false confessions from the same motive are equally within the range of possibility in regard to all acts regarded in opposite points of view by persons of different descriptions i insulted such or such a man i wrote such or such a partypamphlet regarded by the ruling party as a libel by mine as a meritorious exertion in the cause of truth i wrote such or such a religious tract defending opinions regarded as heretical by the established church regarded as orthodox by my sect in many cases probably in most the infirmative facts above brought to view will be seen to have no place the import of the discourse and its applicability to the purpose for which it is adduced will be out of dispute though not complete for it is seldom that a lot of extrajudicial evidence will be endowed with that completeness with which it is the object of judicial examination to endow it it will as far as it goes be thus far complete that it will be sufficiently manifest that no addition which it could have received could have been of a nature to destroy or materially to change the inference the act to the imputation of which the confessionalist was exposing himself by this his discourse was really his act—really done by him nor was he on the occasion of holding such discourse acting in prosecution of any such eccentric and perilous a design as that of subjecting himself to an imputation known by himself not to be merited a distinction requires here to be noted between the case where the evidence may be said to be designedly furnished and that in which it may be said to be undesignedly furnished having been obtained as it were surreptitiously by the party by whom it is produced or offered to be produced without the consent of the party whose confession is contained in it in the former case it partakes in a great measure of the nature of judicial confessorial evidence the person to whom it is delivered though not a magistrate yet by the relation he bears casual and momentary as it is may be considered as standing in many respects in the situation of a magistrate the proprietor of stolen goods having by a train of indicative evidence been led to the discovery of the thief makes up to him and charges him with the theft the delinquent through remorse confusion of mind or hope of favour confesses the offence in all its circumstances in a degree more or less particular to extend the illustration substitute for the case of theft the case of any other offence of that class which supposes the existence of an individual exposed to special injury and to the case of the proprietor of the stolen goods substitute that of the individual so injured the reason and use of the distinction is that when as here the confessorial evidence is furnished ex propasito confitentis the same causes that are capable of giving birth to false confession when judicially exhibited are capable of producing the same effect in the case where it is furnished extrajudicially as here—confusion of mind—hope of commuting a severer punishment for a less severe one—hope of obtaining mercy—despair of acquittal produced by prospect of false evidence    the opposite case the case where the confession was obtained imprudentiâ confitentis is the case which on the former occasions referred to was principally in view the party the confessionalist has made a memorandum in relation to the fact for his own use this falls into the hands of the adverse party who thereupon produces or offers it in evidence in terms more or less particular either direct or more or less indirect the confessionalist has mentioned the fact in a letter to an accomplice or a friend the letter falls into the hands of the adverse party who produces it or offers it in evidence the confessionalist has been overheard to mention the matter in conversation with an accomplice a friend or even for no species or degree of imprudence is altogether without example an utter stranger through the medium of the extrajudicially audient witness it comes round to the adverse party who with or without his good will engages him to come forward with the information in the character of a judiciallydeposing witness from the differences that exist in respect of the mode in which the evidence was obtained in the two cases result several other differences when of a nature approaching to judicial the extrajudicial confession having conviction or at least full information for its object either on the part of him who delivers it or on the part of him to whom it is delivered will naturally be more or less effectually shaped and adapted to that purpose when obtained as above explained in a manner by surprise neither the confessionalist nor in the case of hearsay evidence his interlocutor or auditor has any such object nor has the interlocutor or auditor generally speaking any means of shaping the evidence to that object the shape in which it presents itself will naturally be that of some broken scrap variable ad infinitum in respect of form and quantity of information in the case where as above it is furnished by a man as it were with a halter about his neck the language will necessarily be direct and explicit and in that respect whatsoever it may be in point of precision for precision will depend as much upon the party receiving the information as upon the party furnishing it nearly upon a par with that which it assumes when extracted by an official hand in the case where it is furnished without apprehension of the use eventually made of it it may indeed happen to the language of it to be equally direct and explicit as is apt to be the case with libels but it is equally capable of existing in a form to any degree mysterious and indirect it may consist of nothing but mere allusion and in any case to find out a key to it and apply it to the proof of the fact endeavoured to be proved from it may be the task of argumentation and conjecture §   of spontaneous confessorial evidence judicially delivered for the advantage of viewing objects one at a time the species of criminative evidence in question has hitherto been considered as being delivered as well without the intervention of interrogation as without the intervention of the authority of a judge present at the time of the intervention of these two circumstances the consequences will be seen to be material if the selfcriminative discourse be conceived to be held in the presence of the judge it is not natural that adequate power not being wanting the use of so efficient a security for correctness as well as completeness should be foregone but that which in respect of its manifest mischievousness and absurdity will be apt to appear most unnatural is under the influence of the sinister interest which gave birth to the technical system of procedure but too frequently realized for example under english law in the case of all those modifications of delinquency in relation to which the evidence is delivered in no other shape than that of affidavit evidence the scene of intercourse being now removed from the closet to the theatre of justice—one consequence is that of the eight modifications of selfdisserving evidence above brought to view five stand excluded as being incapable of finding entrance into a place so defended these are—  conspiratorial   simply confidential   purposely jactitantial   unadvisedly jactitantial and   simply and unadvisedly collognial superiorbenefitseeking a modification under all circumstances rare and eccentric is by the authority of a present though mute and inactive judge rendered still more unlikely to be hazardeo still more so by the presence of an interrogating judge remain as the only two modifications of selfdisserving evidence natural to the spot now in question—  unadvisedly selfexculpatire evidence and   penitential or penitentially confessorial evidence to ground conviction confession it has been said ought to be perfectly free not produced either by hope or fear such is the language we frequently meet with in english law books reason is here obscured by a covering of absurdity accused or suspected of a crime guilty or innocent—what but hope or fear should induce a man to speak guilty in particular what but hope or fear should induce a man to confess confession without hope or fear is an action without a motive an effect without a cause it is more it is an action without an inciting motive overcoming a force and that a mighty one of restraining    motives it is as if on a level billiardtable a ball should run into one of the pockets not merely without being struck with the mace or cue but in spite of the impulse of the instrument striking it in a direction exactly opposite what there is of reason in the rule amounts to this—a judge in examining an accused or suspected person should be upon his guard against the sinister inducements to the action of which a man in such a situation is exposed the causes which may be capable of giving birth to evidence of the description in question when it is not true come now to be enumerated i causes capable of giving birth to untrue confessorial evidence even when plenary   guilty of a greater crime i e a crime more severely punished than the crime now charged a man makes a confession of the crime now charged in order to avoid the severer punishment or being charged with two crimes he confesses the less to avoid being punished as for the greater and so in regard to facts subjecting a man to nonpenal damage or otherwise to an obligation of an unpleasant cast   not guilty of the crime charged nor consequently being justly subjectable to the punishment annexed to it—but exposed or conceiving himself exposed to undergo some severer suffering whether on the score of criminality or any other at the hands of the prosecutor or some other man in power to whom it would be acceptable that he should suffer as for the offence in question—he makes confession of it accordingly in the hope of thereby escaping such severer suffering various is the description of the person by whose power i e by the hopes and fears that point to it a man may be drawn into a false confession it will depend in a considerable degree upon the nature of the offence an ordinary offence or a political offence it may accordingly be a private individual it may be in a monarchy the monarch or one or more of his ministers in a commonwealth some officer or some individual invested by law or influence with appropriate power it may be though without atrocious abuse of judicial power it cannot be even the judge   if in the case above supposed—hoping as above to mollify the enmity of his too potent adversary—he regards the stream of the evidence as likely to run against him and with a force sufficient for conviction though this be what by the supposition cannot take place without falsehood somewhere an adequate motive—a cause adequate to the production of the supposed effect viz that of a false confession—will in this way too be exemplified   lastly the same effect is capable of being produced by mere confusion of mind the state of mind producible in a man by terror—by the contemplation of his impending fate the case of false confession is a case which in the present state of jurisprudence among civilized nations including a century or so under the notion of present time has seldom been exemplified so at least one wishes and hopes to be able to believe for the honour of governments and of human nature the only instance in which it has been in any degree frequent even for some centuries past—and in this instance it has been but too frequent—is that of a case in which the fact was not only false but impossible i speak of the case of witchcraft turn which way we will—to france to england to north america—we shall find wretched women not only convicted but confessing themselves guilty of that imaginary crime so at least say the accounts that have been transmitted to us in these deplorable instances in what shape has the confession been conceived to produce a frantic cry of guilty—to produce the mark of a trembling hand to a paper full of calumnious lies contents known or unknown—these are effects to the production of which confusion of mind may be fully adequate in the instance of the weakest and most ignorant certainly not less than in that of the strongest and bestinformed minds but to produce and produce extempore a circumstantial and consistent account of intercourses and conversations with an imaginary being—this would be scarce possible even to the strongest and if possible where should be the inducement when the consequence was the being hanged or burnt to guard against false confessions therefore the two following rules ought to be observed—   one is that to operate in the character of direct evidence confession cannot be too particular in respect of all material circumstances it should be as particular as by dint of interrogation it can be made to be why so because supposing it false the more particular it is the more distinguishable facts it will exhibit the truth of which supposing them false will be liable to be disproved by their incompatibility with any facts the truth of which may have come to be established by other evidence the greater the particularity required on the part of the confession the greater is the care taken of the confessionalist—the greater the care taken to guard him against undue conviction brought on upon him by his own imbecility and imprudence   the other rule is that in respect of all material facts especially the act which constitutes the physical part of the offence it ought to comprehend a particular designation    in respect of the circumstances of time and place for what reason for the reason already mentioned to the end that in the event of its proving false a case not impossible though in a high degree rare and improbable facts may be found by which it may be proved to be so i killed such a man says the confessionalist mentioning him on such a day at such a place impossible says the judge speaking from other evidence on that day neither you nor the deceased were at that place but time and place are both infinitely divisible to what degree of minuteness shall the division be endeavoured to be carried for this purpose a particular answer that shall suit all cases cannot be given the end in view as above stated must be considered and compared with the particular circumstances of the case in regard to either species of extension ere the degree of particularity proper to be aimed at by the interrogatories can be marked out under the head of time the english law in the instrument of accusation admits of no other latitude than what is included in the compass of a day the nature of things did not in this instance render uniformity impossible the parts into which time is divided are uniform and determinate place—relative space—is not equally obsequious the house yes if the supposed scene of the supposed transaction be a house the street yes if the scene were in a street but a field a road a common a forest a lake a sea the occan any of these may have been the scene the question therefore still recurs upon us and at the same time the difficulty of finding a general answer for it recurs undiminished supposing the confession—the narration—false—will the intimation which it has been made to include of time and place be sufficiently particular to enable the judge supposing it to be false to extract sufficient proof of the falsity of it from other evidence between the degree of particularity to be looked for in the article of place and the degree of particularity to be looked for in the article of time there will be a mutual dependence supposing it clear from other evidence that on a given day the confessionalist and the deceased were upwards of two days journey distant from one another—the specification of the day on which in the false confession the murder is stated to have been committed will be sufficient to prove the falsity of the confession—to prove the nondelinquency of the confessionalist but suppose the distance no more than two hours journey—the specification of the day will it is evident not be sufficient for the same purpose he should be called upon to fix the very hour the hour becomes as material in this second case as the day was on the first in the wording of the instrument of accusation particularity in respect of both species of extension is insisted upon and evidently for the reasons above given by the english law but between the case of an indictment a statement of the offence as drawn up by an accuser and a confession whereby the defendant himself becomes as it were his own accuser there is in this respect a great difference in the case of the instrument of accusation compliance with this requisition however desirable may in respect of this or that degree of particularity be impossible why because antecedently to the exhibition of the whole mass of obtainable evidence though ultimately that evidence should prove ever so satisfactory it is but natural that an accuser should be in the dark while supposing the charge true and the defendant willing to confess the fact that same degree of particularity which it was altogether out of the power of the accuser to give to the relation may be exhibited in the confession of the defendant without any difficulty for from whom can so precise an account of a mans acts be expected as from the man himself especially acts of such moment to himself so he be but disposed to give it    chapter vii of confessorial and otherwise selfdisserving evidence extracted by interrogation §   of interrogation in general as a means of extracting selfdisserving evidence interrogation has already been mentioned as the most efficient and in case of doubt the indispensable instrument for the extraction of truth—complete truth—in favour of whichsoever side of the suit it militates on both sides its property is to clear up all doubts—all doubts produced or left by other evidence—doubts which without its aid can never be cleared up possessing this property it is not less favourable to innocence than adverse to delinquency all suspected persons who are not guilty court it none but the guilty shrink from it antecedently to the application of this test the mind of the judge remaining in doubt as between innocence and delinquency viz in which of the two opposite states the mind of the defendant shall be considered as placed the process is directed indistinctly to the production of the one or the other of two opposite results—in the case of nondelinquency selfexculpative testimony in the case of delinquency confessorial testimony ending in confession but confessorial testimony having punishment or evil in some other shape for its visibly impending consequence does not in the ordinary course of things come willingly or singly or in the first instance the instrument being applied some course on the part of the proposed respondent cannot but be taken instead of this most visibly dangerous course he betakes himself if not definitively at any rate in the first instance to all other possible courses no other course presenting to view the image of punishment as following with a step so sure but of all these possible courses if the proposed respondent be really delinquent there is not one that will not if the judge be at the same time willing and at liberty to follow the manifest dictates of justice and common sense operate with a degree of probative force more or less persunsive towards conviction because that which is visible to common sense as being consonant to constant and universal experience is that there is not one of them all that a man ever betakes himself to and persists in in case of veracity and innocence true selfexculpative testimony being by the supposition incapable of being delivered—his constant resource were it not for the inferences which on such an occasion every man as is visible to him would draw from it would be silence but silence being in such a case by common sense at the report of universal experience certified to be tantamount to confession though by a mode of expression as general as possible—tantamount at any rate to the purpose of disrepute if not to the purpose of legal punishment—this is excepting confession in particular and explicit terms his last resource thus repelled from that which would otherwise be the easiest as well as safest course his next endeavour is to tax his invention for such statements of an exculpative tendency as though false shall present the fairest prospect of being taken from first to last for true but besides the difficulty a defence of this kind is attended with constant and manifest peril for no sooner does any statement present itself which by its inconsistency with other statements of his own already delivered on the same occasion or with facts understood from other sources of information to be true is understood to be false and believed at the same time to be wilfully false—than another evidence of delinquency is afforded still more probative and impressive because more particular than mere silence true selfexculpative discourse is not to be had silence would operate as confession of a course of false responsion if understood to be false and the falsehood wilful the effect would be still worse than that of silence false responsion of an exculpative tendency in any shape that promises security against detection not being to be found—his next endeavour is to find and to obtain acceptance for such discourse as at the same time that it affords no inculpative evidence shall not be liable to be taxed with being false discourse of this description is that which in respect of its object is termed evasive and in respect of its nature is either irrelevant or indistinct for being relevant and at the same time distinct it could not fall to be either true or false if nothing of this cast be to be found or if his employable stock of it be exhausted he has then left but one alternative which is either silence as above or confessorial evidence which in so far as true it depends upon the interrogator to draw on till it terminates in confession but after interrogation—which coming from a person whose station by office or by the occasion is that of a superior is in other  0 words an order requiring a man to speak—silence is an act of disobedience confessorial discourse is the result of submission—of compliance of noncompliance with his will it is the property to call forth illwill on the part of him towards whom it is manifested especially of the man in power of compliance goodwill silence therefore on the part of the affrighted culprit seems to his ear to call for vengeance confession holds out a chance for indulgence while devising and pursuing a plan of selfexculpative misrepresentation the discourse held by the delinquent will naturally be of a motley cast presenting a mixture of falsehood evasion and truth falsehood under the apprehension of the discredit which attaches instantly upon detection will be hazarded then and then only when evasion seems no longer practicable and the response if true could not be otherwise than manifestly confessorial truth then will almost always form and that in no inconsiderable proportion a part of the delinquents selfexculpative tale but such and so visible is the connexion between truth and truth—between the fact of delinquency and all the several facts that have accompanied or led to it—that of the admixture of truth thus unwillingly inserted a portion more or less considerable in one way or other with or without his knowledge though designed to operate in a way opposite to confession will operate in effect in the character of confessorial evidence and thus it is that—by one and the same process the process of interrogation where the respondent who is suspected to be a delinquent is really so—in spite of and in consequence of the endeavours used by him to impress the persuasion of his innocence—silence or nonresponsion evasive responsion false responsion confessorial responsion one or all of them in infinitely diversifiable proportions will be extracted each of them contributing to conviction each of them evidentiary of delinquency—operating in the common character of selfdisserving to wit selfinculpative or selfcriminative evidence in species and denomination the infirmative considerations applicable to selfdisserving evidence thus extracted by interrogation are the same as those applicable to evidence from the same source and of the same tendency when delivered without interrogation but in respect of force they are in every instance decidedly inferior why because in every instance the infirmative considerations are mere suppositions—suggestions of states of things neither proved nor so much as probabilized but merely brought to view as being at the same time possible not glaringly improbable and not disproved in whatsoever degree disprobabilized but of the process of interrogation by whomsoever performed if performed with an impartial view or what comes to the same thing with partial views on both sides it is the known object and effect by the most efficient means to clear up all such uncertainties    §   difference in point of effect between extrajudicial and judicial interrogation compared with each other selfinculpative evidence extracted from a supposed delinquent by extrajudicial interrogation and evidence of the like denomination extracted by judicial interrogation have their natural points of advantage and disadvantage the observation of which is pregnant with instruction of practical use—   to extrajudicial interrogation considered as an instrument for the extraction of truth from unwilling lips belong naturally two disadvantages comparative deficiency in respect of coercive power and comparative deficiency in point of intellectual skill of these disadvantages however neither is constant in point of existence or uniform in degree the interrogator is not indeed himself the judge—the judge by whom the decision grounded on the evidence so extracted is to be pronounced but on this head unless where in virtue of some particular connexion the supposed delinquent is by sympathy or any other cause assured of concealment on the part of his interrogator the difference will not be very considerable inasmuch as every question will naturally present itself as if backed by the authority of the judge   in the process of interrogation the casual interrogator will not in general possess experience nor so far as depends upon experience skill equal to what may be naturally expected on the part of the judge but in this respect the father or other head of a considerably numerous family will not in general be much behind even an official judge and whatsoever superiority in point of acquired skill may be expected to have place on the part of the official judge the superior interest and zeal that may no less reasonably be looked for on the part of the domestic interrogator may be considered as forming in general no inadequate compensation on the other hand in the circumstance of surprise may be seen a circumstance from which the situation of the domestic interrogator will be apt to derive a considerable advantage from the domestic inquirer may come a question or string of questions at a time when no thoroughlyconsidered plan of mendacious defence can as yet have been adjusted whereas the interval between arrestation and judicial interrogation will afford for the purpose of mendacious invention not to speak of mendacious suggestion in case of concert amongst codelinquents a quantity of time over and above whatsoever in the same individual case the delinquent could have applied to the purpose of his defence against the casual inquisitiveness of extrajudicial interrogators one great and as it should seem in general decisive advantage attaches beyond dispute to the side of the judicial interrogator it rests with him to continue the process of interrogation that is to keep the supposed delinquent in a state of subjection to it for whatever length of time appears to him to be necessary and sufficient for the purpose—for the extraction of whatever mass of evidence the proposed respondent is looked upon as capable of yielding—for the extraction of it in all its plenitude on this occasion there are four distinguishable objects with which selfdisserving evidence extracted by judicial vivâ voce interrogation will require to be compared the evidence being in all four cases supposed to issue from the same source i e from the same individual and to be of the same tendency—viz   evidence delivered extrajudicially and without interrogation by word of mouth   evidence delivered extrajudicially and without interrogation in a written form for instance in the form of a private memorandum or of a letter sent or not sent   evidence delivered extrajudicially in consequence of interrogation by word of mouth   evidence delivered extrajudicially in consequence of interrogation in a written form expressed in the written form the evidence taken in itself is more apt to be incomplete and in such a way incomplete as in respect of partiality to be deceptitious why because on the occasion of writing the writer the supposed delinquent has in general more time at command for the purpose of mendacious invention nor are the workings of his invention in a situation to receive that disturbance which it is natural they should receive from the presence of a person at whose hand hostile suspicion or at any rate prying curiosity and consequent interrogation whether eventually applied or not will naturally be apprehended when delivered in the form of a letter the person to whom the statement is addressed must for a length of time at least take it as it comes delivered orally no sooner are gaps discovered in the texture of it than comes a question requiring them to be filled up—no sooner ambiguity or obscurity than the clearing of them up selfregarding evidence delivered by a delinquent in the written form    will therefore be more likely to be deceptitious i e guarded against detection and so effectually as to produce the deception aimed at by it viz where deception was an object which it had in view but in some cases it has no such object as when the cast of it is conspiratorial simply confidential or jactitantial at the same time such as it was delivered—delivered from the mind of the writer—such and without alteration without being exposed to be misreported it is sure to be presented to the mind of the judge whereas if delivered in the oral form it will always be liable to alteration—liable to be misreported by the deposing witness through the channel of whose lips it being extrajudicially delivered in the first instance it cannot but have passed as to interrogation in the written form as when statements which have been extrajudicially delivered have eventually been made use of as evidence and thereupon have assumed that responsive form of which interrogation when submitted to is naturally productive—it is a possible case but a case not by any means likely to be frequently exemplified rarely indeed when compared with the form which discourse so readily assumes under the process of interrogation when performed by word of mouth why because out of the presence of the interrogator compliance with the command expressed by interrogation is if irksome refused without difficulty evasive responsion if responsion be resorted to is more easy silence being liable to be accounted for by so many other causes besides delinquency is resorted to with less reserve a plan of selfexculpative mendacity is pursued with more time for the continuance of it and with better promise of success and from amongst the truths which to guard against detection it may be necessary to intermix a selection is made with greater facility and safety of those which for fear of their being found to operate with a selfdisserving a selfinculpative tendency require and may it is supposed bear to be omitted of discourse orally delivered it is moreover the nature when the apprehended tendency of it is as here selfcriminative to bring with it another species of criminative circumstantial evidence which will be brought more particularly to view in another chapter viz fear as indicated by deportment more particularly passive deportment and from an accompaniment thus treacherous it is a characteristic property of written discourse to be altogether free meantime howsoever being orally delivered the evidentiary selfcriminative discourse may have been accompanied with any such symptoms in the state in which on the extrajudicial occasion it was delivered to the percipient witness interrogating or not interrogating by whom in the character of a deposing witness it is reported to the judge—yet when thus reported to the judge it comes accompanied not by the symptoms themselves but only by the report so made of them to which report it may happen to be in any degree incorrect or incomplete or both of the comparative view thus taken what is the practical result not preference followed by adoption and rejection but conjunction each mode and form is marked by its peculiar advantages counteracted by its peculiar disadvantages both therefore should be called in to the assistance of justice expressed originally whether in writing or in conversation the probability is that the evidence in question especially being as it is selfregarding and subject to the risk of being found selfcriminative will abound with gaps with dark passages with broken hints all these imperfections the judge and he alone is competent to do what can be done towards remedying in his hands alone is reposed adequate power and whatsoever time in his view of it the occasion needs selfinculpative discourse when it is uttered extrajudicially designedly or undesignedly with or without a view to its being employed as evidence can never be an adequate succedaneum to judicial confession the plenitude of which is secured by judicial examination in the former case it is not itself the proper evidence it is no more than indicative of the source from whence conclusive evidence may by the proper process be obtained and of a sample of what may be expected from that source it is not the best—the most satisfactory evidence that the case furnishes it shows where better where still more satisfactory evidence is to be had and it may require completion and explanation not to speak of opposition and confutation not only for the benefit of the party by whom it is produced but even for the benefit of the party whose confession it is and against whom it is produced but although it be thus indicative of a lot of evidence more satisfactory than itself the use of the inferior is not always superseded by the superior evidence   a case that happens not unfrequently is this—after a true confession more or less full delivered extrajudicially—when the confessionalist comes to be examined in a judicial mode he repents and instead of confirming the truths he has disclosed betakes himself to falsehood when the extrajudicial confession was suffered to escape from his lips the debt thus paid to truth had the confusion of mind he had been thrown into for    its cause his presence of mind regained he endeavours to avail himself of it and attempts to take back the lights that had transpired from him when off his guard as one man is confronted with another the interests of truth and justice require that in such a state of things a man should be confronted with himself the extrajudicial confession may be consistent with facts established from other sources the judicial retraction may be alike inconsistent with the extrajudicial confession and with these established facts the extrajudicial confession may obtain credence the judicial retractation may with reason be disbelieved   even when the two lots of information accord—when the extrajudicial confession instead of being contradicted by a judicial retractation is confirmed by a judicial confession—the extrajudicial confession may be not altogether without its use the first confession giving confirmation to the second as well as receiving confirmation from it may serve to render more complete the satisfaction of the judge   where the judicial confession accords with the extrajudicial the utility of it will be still more apparent in the case where both of them happen to stand contradicted by other evidence how should this happen it may be said the defendant has himself acknowledged the offence—acknowledged it once and again what hope can remain to him to overthrow the effect of this double acknowledgment by inferior evidence of the two acknowledgments by evidence that is not a match for either—to him to the same man not but a case that may happen and does happen not unfrequently is—the evidence that a man gives against himself applies with equal pertinency to the case of another man say as in a criminal case an accomplice the confessionalist acquiesces as he cannot but acquiesce in the consequences of his confession thus repeated and confirmed but the second accomplice having his separate plans of defence having hopes where his confederate has none denies the truth of the confession and seeks to combat it by other evidence   lastly another case that may happen and which will on another occasion† be brought to view is—after furnishing the extrajudicial evidence and before there has been time or opportunity for following up the indication by judicial examination the confessionalist dies or ceases to be forthcoming by his death the possibility of inflicting punishment punishment rightly seated ends and therefore so far as punishment is concerned there the cause ends and therefore the demand for other evidence for judiciallyextracted oral evidence along with it as to punishment yes and therefore as to causes in which punishment and nothing but punishment is or ought to be demanded‡ but as to satisfaction the demand for decision may remain and therefore for the purpose of a decision on that ground the demand for evidence while the confessionalist was alive his extrajudicial confession was in comparison with his judicial deposition if subsequently taken but an inferior kind of evidence the source however of the superior evidence being dried up by death the inferior the extrajudicially confessorial evidence takes its place—a species of evidence which howsoever inferior to the confessorial part of the judicial evidence from the same source is as far as it goes superior as we have seen to every other species of evidence thus far as to penal cases in cases not penal the necessity of employing it is still more evident the necessity of treasuring up and employing this species of extrajudicial evidence will be equally evident where the completion of the confession by the judicial examination of the confessionalist has been rendered impracticable for a period determinable or indeterminable but not known to be perpetual such as absconsion or expatriation so much for the importance of interrogation as applied to the extraction of selfdisserving evidence from the suspected delinquent no supposition surely can be more unnatural than this—viz that if discovery of truth and consequent rendering of justice had been the object the use of an operation so necessary to the discovery so obviously and indispensably subservient to the purposes of justice would ever have been rejected but under the technical system the interests and ends of judicature being from first to last opposite and hostile to the interests and ends of justice—whatever exertion and ingenuity has been bestowed is applied not to the discovery of truth but to the finding of pretences for not discovering it not to the administering of justice but to the finding of occasions and pretences for administering injustice in its stead    governed if not by sinister reason by blind caprice under the mask of tenderness english lawyers admitting selfdisserving evidence when supposed to have been extrajudicially delivered or extracted forbid it to be judicially extracted or received—extracted by the judge by whom the decision is to be formed receiving it in an incomplete state they will not suffer it to be completed receiving it in the state of hearsay evidence they refuse to receive it in the state of immediate unaltered evidence receiving it in a variety of bad shapes they refuse to receive it in what by their own uniform acknowledgment is the best tenderness—to whom to the innocent individual maliciously or erroneously accused no what it does for him is where misrepresentations have taken place tending to his unjust conviction to refuse him an opportunity of clearing them up to the guilty no not even to the guilty considered in the aggregate by the promise it gives of escape it augments the number the number being so great thence comes the pretended necessity the factitious demand for excessive punishment—the deficiencies in certainty must be made up in magnitude death is the english judges universal remedy higher he cannot screw up the exertions of blind barbarity to this point the labour of every session adds at this a stop is made because there is nothing beyond it it is the part of the same man the same natural and implacable enemy of justice—on the one hand to keep watch and ward in favour of the murderer charging him not to let drop any the least hint from which justice may receive assistance not to say anything by which his guilt may be brought to light and on the other hand to be no less active in his exertions to extend the demesnes of death to the profit of cold barbarity he adds the praise of tenderness the manly dictates of public utility are sacrificed to the cant of hypocritical or childish sentimentalism the excess of the punishment becomes a sufficient warrant for not executing it extending the demesnes of death he thus extends the mass of his own despotism of that preposterous state of things by which every year the lives of men by dozens and by scores are laid at the feet of every english judge† chapter viii of confusion of mind considered as affording evidence of delinquency another modification of subsequential circumstantial evidence is confusion of mind—confusion as expressed and betrayed whether by countenance by discourse by conduct or by all three this may also be considered as a sort of submodification of circumstantial evidence a modification of confessorial evidence with this difference only—confessorial evidence is personal evidence confusion of mind is real evidence—the presumed state of mind the state of mind evidenced by the external indications is psychological real evidence the indications themselves physical real evidence hesitation alone—hesitation without confusion—would be misinterpreted if it were looked upon as an indication of falsehood much more if of wilful falsehood hesitation has for its cause—its most natural and frequent cause—anxiety to shape the narrative by the exact line of truth accompanied with a difficulty a man experiences in his endeavours to accomplish it correct memory and adequate expression are both necessary to this end by the consciousness or even mere apprehension of tailure in either article hesitation may be produced the most careless and least scrupulous of witnesses are frequently among the most fluent suspicion indeed is not altogether without ground when to hesitation confusion is added confusion is the result of consciousness of manifested inconsistency of inconsistency with itself or with indubitable truths—a repugnancy which is among the surest indications and proofs of falsehood but of any such inconsistency a man who means nothing but the truth is not in much danger of labouring under any serious apprehension the truth and nothing but the truth is what by the supposition he means to hold up to view truth cannot be inconsistent with itself two truths parts of one and the same complex truth cannot be inconsistent with each other truth in all its parts is the one thing and the only thing his memory is in search of in regard to some parts at any rate he is singularly unfortunate if he cannot make sure to himself of possessing it these parts he will at any rate adhere to others of which his hold is not so strong he will adhere to no otherwise than upon the supposition of their being compatible and consistent with those fundamental stronger ones should any inconsistency display itself he will abandon these weaker points without difficulty and without confusion that is without shame or other fear having nothing to suffer from the temporary mistake—no point of his own to lose by it confusion affords a presumption more or less strong of the fact contested by the party but not absolutely a conclusive one it proves alarm and in the case in question the most natural cause of alarm is the apprehension of seeing the contested fact taken for true but    this though in the sort of case in question the most frequent and natural cause of the alarm is by no means the only one   it may be that—although the fact in question the fact contested by the party was not true—yet some other fact the declaration of which would in some other way be prejudicial to him was true and that the alarm was produced by the apprehension of seeing this other fact brought to light   it may be that in respect of the fact in question the offence in question appearances are against him notwithstanding his perfect innocence and the consciousness of this circumstance may be the cause of his confusion chapter ix of fear in so far as indicated by passive deportment considered as affording evidence of delinquency a class of cases has already been brought to view† in which the principal fact in question viz delinquency in this or that shape cannot be probabilized by the evidentiary fact deposed to before the judge without the intervention of some other fact or facts constituting together with the principal fact and the evidentiary fact an evidential chain of a peculiar nature the case where fear howsoever supposed to be manifested is the fact considered as evidentiary of delinquency belongs to this class in a chain of this sort the number of links will be different according as it is to the perceptions of the judge himself or to those of some other person by whom in the character of a deposing witness it is reported to the judge that the fact here considered in the character of an evidentiary fact viz fear presents itself first suppose the judge himself the person to whose senses the fear i e the appearance of fear manifests itself the links of the evidentiary chain will then succeed one another in the manner following viz—   link the first group of evidentiary facts immediately presented to the senses of the judge—symptoms of fear these being objects of sense must all of them be such as come under the description of physical facts‡   link the second—the emotion of fear a psychological supposed fact inferred and supposed to be probabilized by these physical appearances—fear having for its supposed cause the expectation of the evil consequences legal punishment included considered as attached to the offence in question by means of the ensuing links   link the third—selfinculpative recollection the memory of the supposed delinquent presenting to him the wrongful act as having been committed by him viz the physical act positive or negative accompanied with its criminative circumstances   link the fourth—the criminal act itself as above in an evidentiary chain of this sort it has    been already mentioned as the principal use of and reason for the operation of distinguishing link from link that to each link belongs a distinct set of infirmative considerations capable of operating in diminution of its probative force the truth of that observation will be found exemplified in the present instance in this case the chain of inference by which these four distinguishable links are connected stands thus—  from the physical appearances regarded as symptoms of fear the existence of that emotion is inferred   from the supposed existence of that emotion the existence of the criminative recollection above mentioned   from the existence viz the present existence of that recollection the existence viz the past existence of the criminative fact itself in relation to the second of the above three inferences what must be observed is that for the purpose of forming the inference the nature of the occasion is an object that must indispensably be called in since but for this even supposing fear to be the emotion sufficiently established by the symptoms this emotion might have had any other cause than the particular cause thus ascribed to it but for the occasion the probative force of this circumstance would scarce amount to anything add the occasion and of itself it cannot but be very considerable infirmative considerations there are as will be seen to the disprobabilizing force of which it stands exposed but of these—of all these taken together the disprobablizing force it will be seen will not in general be very considerable the occasion here in question is the circumstance of the supposed delinquents being taxed with or being supposed by himself to be suspected of the particular act of delinquency in question the existence of which occasion is always part of the case the second link is constituted therefore properly speaking not of the fear alone but of the fear combined with the occasion since it is by the occasion that the existence and operation of those other possible causes which will be brought to view in the character of infirmative possibilities will be rendered improbable it is with this psychological sort of chain as with a physical one the chain is the weaker the greater the number of links which enter into the composition of it why because each link brings with it is particular infirmative possibilities i inference forming the joint or connexion between link the first viz physical supposed symptoms of fear—and link the second viz the emotion of fear itself infirmative possibilities applying to this joint—   the cause of the appearances different a purely physical fact viz bodily indisposition   the cause of the appearances different a psychological fact indeed and that an emotion but a different emotion such as grief or anger grief or anger produced for example by the consideration of the wound inflicted on reputation notwithstanding innocence ii inference forming the connexion between link the second viz the existence of the emotion of fear—and link the third viz the existence of a criminative recollection having for its subject the particular offence of which the supposed delinquent understands himself to be accused or suspected infirmative possibilities applying to this inference—   recollection criminative indeed but not in the way in question recollection of an offence committed but an offence different from that of which the supposed delinquent stands accused or suspected   recollection of an offence committed not by the individual himself but by some other individual connected with him by some tie of sympathy and in whose instance the inquiry it is apprehended may be productive of conviction or suspicion   recollection of a fact by means of which without any delinquency on his part vexation has been or appears likely to be produced in this or that shape to himself  —or to another person or even a class of persons more or less extensive connected with him by some tie of sympathy   apprehension of punishment notwithstanding innocence of this infirmative probability the disprobative force will depend it is evident in a considerable degree upon the general complexion and character of the system of procedure under which the inquiry is made   contemplation prospect of the vexation attached to prosecution notwithstanding innocence another circumstance the infirmative force of which will be seen to depend more or less on the system of procedure iii inference forming the connexion between link the third viz supposed recollection of the criminative fact in question as committed by him—and link the fourth viz the actual commission of the act so supposed to be recollected infirmative possibility— falsity of the supposed selfcriminative recollection the error here supposed will present itself as being of a nature not very apt to be realized it is capable however of taking place    not only in case of mental derangement but in the case of habitual delinquency especially if the time of the supposed offence be very remote apprehended and examined though for a theft in which he had no part an habitual thief will naturally enough exhibit symptoms of fear and confounding one of his exploits with another may suppose himself to recollect a theft in which in truth he bore no part such are the conceivable facts which in the character of infirmative probabilities apply to the criminative force of fear when the symptoms of it apply themselves without the intervention of any other medium to the senses of the person by whom in the character of judge the conclusion is to be formed—the decision grounded on them formed and pronounced if instead of the phenomena themselves being presented to his senses what is presented to him is but a report made concerning them by some other person by whom they are stated as having been presented to his senses—the probative force of them stands in that case subject to the infirmative operation which attaches upon supposed unoriginal evidence as compared with the original evidence itself an infirmative circumstance of the same nature as that by which according to a distinction already noticed supposed real evidence reported is distinguished from the real evidence itself and of which a more detailed view will be given in the next succeeding book to the additional joint added to the evidentiary chain by the presence of this fifth link the following circumstances present themselves as applying in the character of infirmative possibilities—   possible untrustworthiness whether in respect of moral or intellectual qualifications on the part of the reporting witness viz the supposed precipient witness speaking in the character of a deposing witness   impropriety of the shape in which his testimony was received or extracted if to the deciding judge this testimony be presented not in the oral but readywritten form—  inaptitude whether in respect of moral or intellectual qualifications on the part of the receiving or extracting judge chapter x of clandestinity considered as affording evidence of delinquency under this class of criminative circumstantial evidence may be noted the following distinctions viz—   clandestinity by concealment of the forbidden act or principal fact itself for example by doing in the dark what but for the criminal design in question would naturally have been done in the day or choosing a spot which is supposed to be out of the view of everybody for doing that which but for the criminal design would naturally have been done in a place open to observation   clandestinity by concealment of the person of the supposed delinquent while occupied in the act as in the case of disguise   clandestinity by concealment of the part taken by the supposed delinquent in the commission of the act—in the production of the mischievous result concealment for example of the purpose for which the act viz the physical act is performed as in the case of murder by poison the several acts by which the poison is prepared or put into the hands of or recommended to be taken by the person intended to be poisoned   clandestinity by eloignment or deception of witnesses to the act exertions employed for removing this or that person from the scene of the intended unlawful action under the supposed apprehension of his becoming in relation to the forbidden act its accompaniments or consequences a percipient and thence eventually a deposing witness   clandestinity by eloignment or concealment or destruction of criminative real evidence concerning the modifications of real evidence see above ch iii   forgery in relation to real evidence viz either by fabrication of exculpative appearances or by alteration of inculpative into neutral or exculpative the modifications of which it is susceptible correspond of course with those of real evidence disguise of the person—a mode of clandestinity already brought to view—may be considered as a modification of forgery in relation to real evidence on the preceding occasion forgery in relation to real evidence was considered as capable of being practised by others to the prejudice of the supposed delinquent here it is considered as practised by him there it was an infirmative an exculpative probability here it is an inculpative fact being a mode of deception effected or attempted—a species of falsehood—and as such no less than forgery in relation to written evidence a modification of the crimen falsi of the roman school—falsehood uttered by deportment—it is in that respect closely allied to falsehood in the same intention uttered by discourse it may be moreover considered as being in relation to real evidence that which subornation is to personal as in the one case so in the other objects of the class of things are thus pressed into the service of delinquency   opposition to search made for real evidence see the next chapter    clandestinity in what manner soever aimed at may be considered as evidentiary of fear and in that way and that way alone through the chain of inferences of which that emotion constitutes as above the principal link constituting a circumstantial evidence of delinquency in this or that shape as explained by the occasion as above in the case of fear as above explained the emotion itself the psychological and that a pathological fact constitutes but the second link in the evidentiary chain the first link was constituted by the physical symptoms from which that psychological fact is inferred in the case of clandestinity under the several modifications as above enumerated the positive voluntary physical acts by which the concealment is effected or endeavoured at stand in the place of the involuntary appearances the pathological symptoms by which in the other case the emotion is betrayed   intention or design differently but equally or more culpable   intention or design less culpable   intention or design blameless though requiring secrecy these are among the infirmative counterprobabilities which have just been seen in the case of fear applying to and weakening the probative and criminative force of that emotion they may here be seen applying with equal force to the criminative force of clandestinity in these its several shapes to the probative force of the inference which in the case of fear binds together the two first links viz the aggregate of the physical or pathological symptoms and the psychological emotion two infirmative counterprobabilities were seen applying themselves viz   the emotion different for example grief or anger and   the cause of the physical symptoms not psychological but purely physical viz bodily indisposition in the case of clandestinity in the place of those infirmative counterprobabilities stands another characterizable by the word sport the clandestinity having for its object and its cause desire of producing sport merriment pastime and not delinquency in any shape† at the end of a judicial investigation it does not often happen that in a case of clandestinity the decision as between sport and criminality can be attended with much difficulty but for want of timely explanation sport indiscreetly pursued has every now and then been itself an object of pursuit when thus enveloped in the livery of guilt a man who endeavours to pass for a ghost risks the being taken for a thief or something worse‡ forgery in relation to real evidence has an infirmative counterprobability peculiar to itself viz selfdefence—the individual innocent exertions made to remove physical appearances which whether produced by nature or by human malice viz in the way of forgery tend to fix a criminative imputation on him in the circumstances in which he happens to be placed in the view of removing the imputation from himself a murderer has been known secretly to deposit in the apparent possession of an innocent person the bloodstained instrument or garment or some other such article so circumstanced as to operate in the character of a source of criminative real evidence in this case were it the lot of the innocent man to be observed in the night time retransferring the articles to the place from whence they came it is to him instead of the murderer that the artifice might thus come to be imputed† chapter xi of suppression or fabrication of evidence considered as affording evidence of delinqufncy supposing the whole mass of evidence actually suppressed no such discussion it is evident can have place as the inquiry concerning the probative force belonging to any part of it or the circumstances by the consideration    of which that force may be diminished but under the head of these several modifications of criminative circumstantial evidence considered as deducible from active deportment the attempt successful or unsuccessful is to be understood for it is by the attempt successful or unsuccessful that the state of the mind is indicated and it is from the state of the mind that the criminative inference is not less properly than naturally deduced preventing as it were the birth of evidence by preventing from becoming witnesses i e percipient witnesses those by whom that character might otherwise have been acquired is a criminative circumstance already brought to view viz under the head of clandestinity the circumstances in view under the present head are such as are capable of taking place at a more advanced stage of the business viz at any point within the length of time intervening between the moment in which the offence is considered as having been committed and the moment at which the evidence produced in consequence of prosecution comes to be delivered the malpractice here in question is therefore any act whereby a person who in relation to any criminative fact in question has already been in the condition of a percipient witness is prevented or is endeavoured to be prevented from appearing in the character of a deposing witness but to draw for the separation of the two objects a clear line of distinction applicable to all cases would be found impossible under one or other of the two general heads here mentioned the following specific modifications of circumstantial criminative evidence seem comprisable—   destruction concealment eloignment or falsification of any already existing source of real or written evidence tending or supposed to tend to the inculpation of the supposed delinquent   interception of evidence oral real or written measures taken to prevent the forthcomingness or delivery of the evidence of a person whose testimony in the character of a deposing witness would tend as supposed to the inculpation of the supposed delinquent or the evidence deducible from the written document or other thing capable of operating in the character of a source of written or real evidence ex gr by obstacles thrown in the way of whatever antecedent operations may be necessary to the delivery of it†   subornation causing a person to deliver false testimony tending to the exculpation of the supposed delinquent   fabricating or causing to be fabricated evidence real or written tending to the exculpation of the supposed delinquent—nb this is one out of several modifications of forgery in relation to real or written evidence as to infirmative counterprobabilities considered as applicable to the criminative circumstances comprehended in this class—the generally applicable ones already mentioned may perhaps be found some of them to be applicable upon occasion here though in general with but a slight degree of probative or rather disprobative force the infirmative counterprobability peculiar to this class may be thus designated apprehension of similar malpractice on the other side the supposition that in the character of an infirmative counterprobability opposed to any of the criminative circumstances in question this consideration can operate with any such degree of disprobative force as to render it worth employing involves the supposition of no ordinary degree of depravity on the part of the national character at the time english law affords a story which whether meant for truth or jest may alike serve for exemplification pressed for payment on a forged bond a man applies to his attorney  0 client what is to be done—attorney forge a release on looking back one cannot say exactly how far it might not be impossible to find even in english history a period in which a story of this sort might have had a foundation in truth in some countries there have been said to exist a sort of houses of call or register offices for a sort of witnesses of all work as in london for domestic servants and workmen in different lines and in some parts of italy for assassins ireland whether in jest or in earnest was at one time noted for breeding a class of witnesses known for trading ones by a symbol of their trade straws sticking out of their shoes under the turkish government it seems generally understood that the trade of testimony exists upon a footing at least as flourishing as that of any other branch of trade chapter xii of avoidance of justiciability considered as affording evidence of delinquency on the part of the supposed delinquent the acts or modes of conduct immediately directed to the production of this effect may be this enumerated—   expatriation migration into the dominion of some foreign state viz of some foreign state in which at the instance of the judicatory in question justiciability on the part of the supposed delinquent will not it is supposed in the case in question be enforced   exprovinciation migration into another juridical district within the dominion of the same state viz in so far as such change of place is regarded as being definitively or for a time productive of the like effect   latency the supposed delinquent being so circumstanced as that means whereby he may be found as well as the spot where he is are unknown viz to him who in the character of judge or in that of prosecutor is desirous of causing his person to be forthcoming for the purpose of his being justiciable   latitancy i e where the nonforthcomingness of the supposed delinquent is clearly understood to have the avoidance of justiciability for its cause   eloignment of property i e by expatriation exprovinciation transfer into other hands or concealment   tampering with any person on whom in whatever character ex gr in that of minister of justice permanent or occasional    superordinate or subordinate prosecutor in the case of an offence considered as being of a public nature included his justiciability may depend the several special inculpative circumstances comprised under this more general head being all of them indicative of fear—fear having its source and object in the power of the law—the infirmative counterprobabilities applying to this case are pro tanto the same as those which apply to that in the case of the four that consist in so many expedients employed or supposed for the avoidance of personal forthcomingness the infirmative consideration already above designated by the phrase contemplation of juridical vexation notwithstanding innocence operates with peculiar force a circumstance that demands attention with an immediate view to practice is that this force will of course undergo variation according to the nature of the system of procedure—according to the mode and the degree in which it is subservient or adverse to the several ends of justice the exculpative force of this infirmative counterprobability will be the greater—in other words the probative force of the criminative circumstance constituted by avoidance of justiciability by eloignment or concealment of person will be the less—the greater for example the vexatiousness or the length of the imprisonment to which by accusation or suspicion of the offence in question a man stands exposed understand provisional imprisonment in technical language imprisonment on mesne process so circumstanced that the innocent as well as the guilty stand exposed to it† other differences might be cited by which the determination whether to abide or not to abide the course of penal procedure could not but be more or less affected the severity of punishment and the severity of the process    employed for the extraction of evidence in france while breaking on the wheel and other excruciating modes of capital punishment were in use the hazard attending such abidance could not but present itself as considerably greater and consequently the inference from flight to delinquency considerably less cogent than at present when simple death is the highest degree in the scale and another and perhaps still greater difference could not but be attached to the useless barbarity of preparatory torture health—business—pleasure—by any one of these objects of pursuit may a man be engaged in a plan of expatriation exprovinciation or eloignment of property by pursuit of pleasure possibly even by pursuit of business he may be engaged in a plan of latency here there are so many infirmative counterprobabilities operating in diminution of the probative force of the four circumstances in question in the character of evidences of fear of the hand of law and thence as evidences of delinquency in a word under one or other of these three modifications the ordinary pursuits of mankind in general being comprehended the consequence in regard to the circumstances in question is that considered in themselves and independently of every other circumstance of a criminative tendency they can scarcely be considered even putting all of them together as operating with any perceptible degree of criminative force the presumption afforded of delinquency by any one of these changes will be the stronger the greater the deviation it makes from the course of life habitually pursued by the supposed delinquent in the case of a mariner a carrier an itinerant vender or an itinerant handicraft it may amount to nothing in other words the disprobative force of the infirmative counterprobability denoted by the expression pursuit of business may be so great as to reduce to nothing the probative force of the criminative circumstance or circumstances in question—viz expatriation exprovinciation eloignment of property or latency—any one or more of them in case of real delinquency—expatriation exprovinciation or eloignment of property one or more of them are apt to be accompanied with the circumstance of clandestinity and for the purpose of clandestinity with mendacious extrajudicial discourse having for its object the preventing or removing on the part of any persons on whose part inculpative testimony is apprehended all suspicion of the true cause that by the concurrence of any such other criminative circumstances the criminative force of the circumstances here in question cannot but receive considerable increase is altogether obvious but it does not follow that by the mere nonappearance of these confirmative circumstances the criminative force of the circumstances here in question must be altogether destroyed since it may happen that—the change of place in question having been already determined upon in pursuit of business health or pleasure—advantage may have been taken of the means thus afforded for the avoidance of justiciability and under favour of the promise of impunity thus entertained the crime in question may have been committed as to tampering with prosecutors and other ministers of justice to an act of this description considered in the light of a criminative circumstance the same suppositions apply in the character of infirmative counterprobabilities as have been seen applying in the case where the persons thus practised upon are considered in the character of witnesses expatriation exprovinciation and eloignment of property involve in each instance the necessary supposition of intentional agency positive or negative but in general positive on the part of the supposed delinquent himself in latency on the other hand no such supposition is necessarily involved what it designates is the effect—not any act by or by the help of which the effect is produced latency—though it does not necessarily import on the part of the supposed delinquent any act done by him in the view of producing the effects designated by it—is in respect of its criminative force subject to the operation of the same counterprobabilities as those which apply to the other criminative circumstances which do on his part import action since like any of them it may be the result of a mans ordinary and blameless pursuits by the word latency nothing more can be designated than the state of him in whose instance no means of communicating with him either through the medium of his place of abode or otherwise is known to those to whom such knowledge is necessary to enable them to insure his forthcomingness for the purpose of justiciability but in whose conduct is the cause of this want of knowledge to be found till this point be settled the condition denoted by the word latency can scarcely with    propriety be placed upon the list of criminative circumstances the means of communicating with an individual i e the means the best adapted to that purpose can scarcely be brought under any general description they will in every case be dependent on the individual circumstances in which at the individual point of time he happens to be placed but it does not often happen that the means are deficient or prove ineffectual when to the real desire the power is added—such power as it depends on the law to give if it be really my wish to communicate with a man to hear from him and make him hear from me what course do i take the answer is almost too obvious to be called for i make inquiry among his friends such is the course which everybody takes whose wish it is to succeed and such is the course which it has been the care of english judges not to take supposing powers adequate to the purpose given by the law those powers accompanied with the correspondent obligations and those obligations duly fulfilled then it is and not till then that latency becomes presumptive evidence of latitancy and through that of criminality latitancy being understood to designate voluntary latency having for its object the avoiding forthcomingness for the purpose of avoiding justiciability supposing the fact of latency established and the fact of latitancy justly inferred from it still under the existing institutions there exists a counterprobability by which its probative force in the character of a criminative circumstance is weakened fear and fear of the law would indeed be indicated but the real evil apprehended at the hands of law might be not the evil of punishment inflicted under that name on the score of criminality in any shape but the evil of imprisonment on the score of satisfaction for money due on an account not penal in so far as nondischarge of pecuniary debts or other nonpenal obligations is considered as an offence and nonsurrender of a mans person to imprisonment in satisfaction for the wrong done by the nonfulfilment of those obligations is considered as an ulterior offence grounded on the former—the engaging in a course of latitancy for the purpose of voiding such imprisonment may be considered as constituting the matter of the infirmative supposition above indicated under the title of design less culpable suppose a prosecution actually commenced and notice of its being so actually received by the supposed delinquent on this supposition latency is actually converted into latitancy notoriety of the obnoxious event coupled with notoriety of popular suspicion fixing upon the supposed delinquent as having been concerned in the production of it—these circumstances together will operate of course in the character of evidentiary facts affording presumptive evidence of the informations having reached his ears by habitual occupation or by accident he was in an itinerant state he is illiterate and the advertisements if any have issued from the press have not reached his eyes the country is of the number of those which are not yet far enough advanced in the arts of life to render communications in that mode customary or easy these may serve as examples of a variety of circumstances by which the probative force of simple latency as evidentiary of latitancy may be more or less impaired chapter xiii of the situation of the supposed delinquent in respect of motives means disposition character and station in life considered as affording evidence of delinquency §   of the situation of the supposed delinquent in respect of motives and means considered as probabilizing or disprobabilizing delinquency between these several objects the connexion is so intimate that they can scarcely be spoken of any of them without reference to the rest but with regard to delinquency the indications they will be seen to afford are with reference to one another though all material very various and even discordant being not uniformly inculpative but in some respects exculpative—in others directly inculpative—in others again inculpative but not so much directly as indirectly by serving to weaken the force of an exculpative circumstance and as such not admitting any infirmative supposition the psychological object designated by the    word motive is as it were the basis of all the rest the existence of a motive by which the supposed delinquent might have been led it is supposed to the commission of the offence in question is a fact which in criminal cases more especially is very frequently made the subject of proof is there any use in doing so in certain cases no and in those i believe it never is done in other cases yes and in these i believe at the suggestion of common sense it commonly is done in what cases and in what sense of the word motive it is worth while and practicable to have recourse to evidence or argument for this purpose seems very generally understood in practice motive is a term applied to the indiscriminate designation of divers objects which require to be distinguished it is applied to designate any desire when considered as the cause of action call this the interior or internal motive it is applied to designate any corporeal thing or mass of things considered as the object of any such desire call the object by which such desire is considered as excited or capable of being excited the exterior or external motive thus when a hungry man knocks down a baker for the purpose of stealing a loaf of bread—hunger is the internal motive of this criminal act a loaf of bread the external a mischievous event being supposed to have been produced and titius suspected of having been concerned in the production of it—what could have been his motive says a question the pertinency of which will never be matter of dispute the following seem to be the circumstances to which it owes its pertinence— every act which in the force of any one or more of the tutelary sanctions finds a source of restraint—every penal every disreputable in a religious community every irreligious act—is on that account rendered more or less improbable by the consideration of the penal or other evil consequences attached to it unless this restrictive force finds an impulsive force and that stronger than itself in opposition to it the culpable act is not merely improbable but psychologically speaking impossible to ask what in this case could have been the motive is to ask not what could have been the interior but what could have been the exterior motive and that adequate in point of force to the production of such an effect not the interior motive because without any exception worth noting to the present purpose all sorts of desires are common to all human beings but what could have been the exterior motive in the situation in which the supposed delinquent appears to have been placed where is the object to be found which could excite a desire strong enough to give birth notwithstanding the opposition made by the combined force of the several tutelary sanctions to an offence of the nature of that which he is suspected of to go about to prove on the part of the supposed delinquent the existence of a desire a feeling a passion which presents itself as capable of accounting for the commission of the crime would be an enterprise frequently impracticable and always useless no crime that has not some species of desire for its cause and with an exception or two not worth dwelling upon no human bosom that is not the seat constantly or occasionally of every modification of desire it is not the mere existence of the desire—the propensity or the relish for this or that source of pleasure the aversion for this or that source of pain if it were—by the same rule that the supposed delinquent is guilty so is every other human creature it is the existence of some exterior object of a nature to call into action this or that desire or propensity and to infuse into it a degree of force capable of surmounting the joint force of those tutelary motives by the influence of which men in general are restrained from giving the reins to criminal desire under the denomination of the motive must be comprised for the present purpose not only the internal desire but the contemplation of the exterior event or state of things which the desire looks to for its gratification—looks to as the cause which will bring within a mans reach the good whatever it be which is the object of the desire the existence of the motive in the former sense is the psychological fact—in the latter the physical fact it is in the latter sense and that alone that the existence of a motive either requires proof or is susceptible of it in this case the internal motive to the act—the criminal act—is the expectation that the good in question will be brought into a mans possession by such criminal act the existence of titius is sufficient proof of titiuss being acted upon and that during the whole course of his life by the love the desire of the matter of wealth the man who desiring to live has no desire for the matter of wealth exists only in the fancy or rather in the language of shallow declaimers to desire to live is to desire to eat and to desire to eat is to desire to possess things eatable what then is the matter of fact proved under the name of the existence of a motive it is either the actual excitation of this or that desire by this or that assignable cause or else the existence of this or that object    in a state in which it will naturally in the breast of the party in question have had the effect of exciting this or that desire man in general is susceptible of enmity—the desire of witnessing pain on the part of the individual who is the object of it man in general is susceptible of sexual desire no human bosom that does not harbour within itself the love the desire of the matter of wealth thus much is what everybody is sufficiently persuaded of thus much is what nobody ever thinks of proving but clodius had become the object of enmity to milo in the bosom of tarquinius the appetite of sexual desire had attached itself upon the idea of lucretia with particular force upon the death of amerinus property to a considerable amount was secured to hæres of that state of things hæres could not be unconscious and had been heard to speak of it with impatience these are facts which admit of proof and may well appear to call for it but in the case of the happening of the correspondent obnoxious event in question and a suspicion pointing to milo tarquinius or hæres respectively as the criminal author of that event—to prove the existence of these respective facts is to prove on the part of these persons respectively the existence of the appropriate motive thus it is that the consideration of any object pointed to as capable of having operated in the case in question with an adequate degree of seductive force acts in relation to the supposed offence not so much in the character of a directly probabilizing consideration as in that of a consideration tending to repel the force of improbability psychological improbability acting in the character and direction of a disprobabilizing circumstance on no occasion says the defendant does man ever act without a motive admitted replies the prosecutor but here then was your motive such or such may have been the desire excited in your breast thus or thus was it or might it have been gratified by the event of which from all the evidence taken together your act your criminal act is concluded to have been the cause against this disprobabilizing circumstance—psychological improbability—the existence of a motive if proved may have considerable weight it may even destroy the force of the disprobabilizing circumstance altogether considered in itself the criminative force of the circumstance consisting in the motive consisting in this viz that the situation in which the supposed delinquent is is such as subjects him to the action of the motive in question amounts to nothing in the natural course of things where there is any property every child has something to gain by the death of a parent but upon the death of a father no one is ever led by any such consideration to look to an act of parricide in the first instance as the most probable cause of the death not being properly a criminative circumstance no counterprobabilities seem applicable to it in the character of infirmative considerations the following cases may serve as instances where in the way above explained the motive viz the exterior motive became and with propriety an object of consideration in the character of a criminative circumstance anno     —donnellans case at warwick assizes offence murder of his wifes brother motive prospect of succession to his property anno   0 —ferns case at surrey assizes offence incendiarism motive profit by overinsurance anno   0 —robert wilsons case at edinburgh offence murder of his wife motive paving the way to a more agreeable connexion with another woman anno     —mary blandys case at the oxford assizes offence the murder of her father by a long course of poison the property of the father was considerable she was an only child it would fall to her of course but where parricide is the offence is it in the nature of money to constitute a seducing motive at that rate parricide instead of being as rare as it is horrible would be among the most frequent of offences she was enamoured of the wretched cranston her seducer and the existence of the fondest of parents presented itself as an obstacle to an union which had she known all she would have known could not be legalized what the force of steam is in the physical world the force of love is in the psychological—capable when under pressure of opposing the strongest force the existence of such pressure is among the most common of all family incidents the attempt to surmount it by such flagitious means happily among the most rare but to bring this motive to view required no separate evidence the same evidence which showed from what source she had received the poison showed by what motive she had been led to administer it theophrastus is accused of theft fortune opulent reputation unspotted disposition generous the object of small value delinquency assumed what could have been his motive it was a blackletter book a cockleshell a butterfly theophrastus was a collector means—i e means of producing the mischievous effect in question—seem to come under consideration to much the same purpose as motives the belief of the existence of whatever means are regarded as necessary to the production of the effect in question being a condition precedent to the endeavour—means may in this case be considered    as coming under the denomination of motives power being as necessary an article as desire in the assemblage of productive causes by opportunity seems to be understood an assemblage of such articles in the composition of the aggregate mass of means as possess not a permanent but only a transient existence §   of the situation of the supposed delinquent in respect of disposition and character considered as probabilizing or disprobabilizing delinquency disposition is produced by motives a man is said to be of such or such a disposition according as it is to the influence of the motives that belong to this or that class that he is considered as being more or less in subjection reference being made to the degree of influence supposed to be exercised by these same motives over the minds of the generality of the class of persons with whose conduct his conduct is compared if the motives of the selfregarding class are considered as predominant a selfish disposition is ascribed to him if motives of the social class a disposition of the social or benevolent cast if of the dissocial kind a disposition of the dissocial or malevolent cast the effect of disposition supposing it in proof may be either inculpative or exculpative so far as it is of the virtuous cast and thence the tendency of its operation exculpative important as the consideration is it belongs not to this place the effect and use of it is to be opposed to inculpative evidence of all sorts and on the ground of a modification of improbability viz psychological improbability to tend to discredit direct and positive evidence or in the character of an infirmative consideration to diminish the probative force of the inferences drawn from the circumstantial part of the evidence so far as the disposition indicated is of the vicious cast exhibiting a more than ordinary degree of force on the part either of the selfregarding or dissocial motives—it will generally though not uniformly afford inferences tending to probabilize the delinquency of the supposed delinquent in respect of the offence in question whatever it may be in general however it admits not of proof on purpose to take disposition for the subject of express inquiry would be to try one cause or perhaps a swarm of causes under the name and on the occasion of another but not unfrequently indication of disposition depravity of disposition comes in of course along with other and more directly apposite evidence and when it does it is naturally impressive and if sufficiently proved it is scarcely to be wished that it should be otherwise than impressive as to infirmative suppositions they are here also plainly out of the question reasons the same as above character is sometimes used as synonymous to disposition itself but more commonly for the opinion supposed to be entertained concerning the disposition of the individual in question by such persons as have had more or less opportunity of becoming acquainted with the indications given of it† character is accordingly on occasions of this sort the word almost exclusively in use disposition very seldom the distinction is scarcely an object of notice for the consideration of character so far as there is any difference there is evidently still less room in general than for that of disposition for the purpose of probabilizing the act of delinquency in question on the part of the supposed delinquent cases however are not altogether wanting in which not only the question of dispesition as indicated by this or that article in the general mass of evidence collected for other purposes but even the question of character as distinguished from disposition may in a criminative view present a claim to notice offences having illwill for their motive—having illwill for their psychological cause—seem to be those in respect of which in a criminative view the question of character is most apt to be material in the case of an offence of this description take the following examples—   offence personal injury the author uncertain the character of the supposed delinquent is it such as to point to him rather than to others   quarrel mutual the supposed delinquent a party the transaction more or less involved in obscurity—considering the adverse party on the one hand and the supposed delinquent on the other—which in respect of his character seems most likely to have been in the wrong or likely to have been most in the wrong §   difficulties attendant on the admission of character evidence in an abstract point of view it appears obvious    and indisputable that on the question between delinquency and nondelinquency considerable light may be expected to be thrown by the consideration of previous character but when the occasion calls for applying this general notion to practice difficulties of no small moment will be seen to arise some of them such as seem scarce capable of receiving solution but in the gordian style   character favourable tendency of the evidence exculpative fact indicated nondelinquency bond of connexion between the evidentiary fact and the fact indicated improbability of the psychological kind improbability that a man bearing such a character should have soiled it by such an offence that a man in whose instance the preponderance of the social motives over the dissocial and selfregarding has been so decided and confirmed should in the individual instance in question have given way to the impulse of the seductive motives whether the character be general or special in this case the danger of prejudice to justice does not present itself as by any means considerable enough to indicate the propriety of excluding the evidence in any case   circumstantial evidence so loosely connected with the fact in dispute is not likely to prevail against a mass of appropriate evidence whether direct or circumstantial or both together to an amount sufficient for conviction   in the case of general bad disposition and its natural consequence bad character it will in general not be easy to obtain testimonials of good character from persons possessing a character of sufficient apparent trustworthiness to present a prospect of material probative force nor would it be safe to put an exclusion upon evidence of this nature inasmuch as in case of an inculpative conspiracy or even an untoward combination of circumstances it may be the only sort of evidence by which it may be in the power of the purest and most exalted probity to defend itself in all such cases general character it being on the favourable side is pertinent nor does it lie open to the objection which we shall see applying to it if employed for the purpose of painting character on the unfavourable side what seems the only objection then in this case is referable to the head of vexation vexation to the judge which is vexation to the public through the medium of the judge by the time that may come to have been consumed in the exhibition of a species of evidence of which the probative force is so inconsiderable and inconclusive vexation again to the judge by the quantity of his power of attention that may come to have been expended upon a species of evidence comparatively irrelevant—a species of vexation which when screwed up to a certain height becomes dangerous even to the direct justice of the cause to the species of vexation attaching itself as above to the station of the judge may be to be added in some cases another lot of vexation attaching itself to the station of witness viz to the witnesses from whom the testimony in question is to be extracted on the other hand vexation in this instance supposes unwillingness on the part of the witness power to compel his testimony notwithstanding and that power exercised a witness who is on such an occasion unwilling to depose in a mans favour is not likely it may be said to be called upon by him for that purpose hostility rather than sympathy is the affection in such a case to be expected but it does not follow by any means that because a man is unwilling to take upon him the loss of time and perhaps expense imposed upon him by his coming forward in the capacity of a witness his reluctance and resentment should rise to such a height as to engage him to give an unfavourable testimony in contradiction to his own conscience   the case where the party calling for the evidence of character the defendants character is the demandant—the prosecutor—the expected tendency of it consequently unfavourable—presents much greater difficulties   is it conceived in general terms—no specification of facts no instances of particular misconduct on any individual occasion specified—a wide and at the same time a safe door is opened to calumny the calumny is in its nature unpunishable by the supposition no particular fact is or can be specified nothing which for the purpose either of punishment or compensation is capable of being disproved what is delivered is mere matter of opinion and that an opinion which by the power of the law itself a man is compelled to give   is it conceived in particular terms particular facts stated—still either the door is left open to calumny or fresh difficulties present themselves neither on this nor on any other occasion ought a mans reputation to be liable to be destroyed or impaired by mere hearsay evidence if a punishable or otherwise disreputable act is to be charged upon a man on this occasion as on others the charge ought to be made good by a satisfactory mass of evidence on this as on any other occasion he ought to be heard in his defence with liberty to contest the charge and produce exculpative evidence of all sorts as in other cases under the name of giving evidence of character what then does the operation here in question amount to it is trying one cause for the purpose of another cause say rather trying an indefinite number of causes for it is not a single swallow that makes a summer—a single act a habit a disposition a sufficient    ground for character and that unfavourable causes thus in any number are tried—one cause at least is tried—as it were in the belly of another considered in itself the trial of any or every such incidental cause cannot with any consistency he regarded in the light of an inconvenience either the law is a bad one and as such ought to be repealed or obedience to it ought to be enforced either the law itself is a grievance or the nonexecution of it bating the particular cases calling for pardon is a grievance far from regret it should be matter of satisfaction that by so cheap and unexceptionable a method delinquency is brought to light but it is by the decision given in these incidental causes that the decision to be given in the principal cause is to be influenced on this supposition perhaps the progress at any rate the conclusion of the principal cause is kept back till after the conclusion of each such incidental cause such are the difficulties in the case where the imputation clothes itself in specific forms where as above it confines itself to generals the difficulty the ulterior difficulty that remains to be brought to view is different but not less those persons on whose opinion or pretended opinion without any check upon their mendacity the fate of the defendant is more or less to depend who are they what sort of a character is theirs character in this case—the case of a witness a mere witness—presents it must be allowed or at least ought to present a different idea in this instance from what it did in the other in that of the defendant in the instance of the defendant—the character the disposition in question it is by the supposition of the unfavourable cast admits of any modification according to the nature of the imputed offence in the case of the witness it is confined to mendacity or if it extend to any other vicious propensity it is only in so far as a propensity to mendacity may be inferred from it but if the character of any one witness ought to be suffered to be put in issue so by the same reason ought that of every other this being admitted you put it in the power of the party—of that one of the parties whose interest it is to defeat law and justice—to bring upon the carpet a chain of character evidence without end—an arithmetical repetend or by accident even an arithmetical circulate §   rules tending to the solution of the above difficulties in judicature in legislation difficulties how great soever should never be dissembled from falsehood from concealment from imposture in any shape justice never profits never can fail of suffering upon the whole the complete removal of the eventual inconveniences and correspondent difficulties being hopeless all that remains is to present such considerations and expedients as appear calculated to reduce the embarrassment to its minimum on the one hand to compel the admission of this sort of evidence in all cases on both sides and of both aspects favourable and unfavourable—on the other hand to compel the refusal of it in any case by an unbending rule—are two extremes both of which though not in equal degree threaten to be prejudicial to the interests of justice it seems to be one of those cases in which a considerable latitude ought to be given to the discretion of the judge to abuse it will not indeed be out of his power but neither is the danger of abuse so great but that if he is not fit to be trusted with this power neither is he fit to be trusted with the other powers attached to his office if there were a case in which it would be proper to render the admission of evidence of this species compulsory it would be the case where the character in question being that of the defendant the evidence is called for at his instance and the punishment attached to the offence is loss of life why because in case of an improper refusal punishment undue and at the same time irreparable may be the consequence but what is the measure indicated by this consideration not the making the admission of this species compulsory even in this case but the forbearing to employ a mode of punishment which in this as well as every other point of view is adverse to the interests of justice—favourable to them in none the case in which the sort of circumstantial evidence afforded by moral character is of greatest importance is that in which the station of the party and the witness being combined in one the cause affords no other evidence on that side the demand for this species of evidence is of course doubled in the case where the same combination of stations takes place on both sides and on each side is accompanied with the same absence of all other and less suspicious evidence in cases not penal it will constitute a natural safeguard against perjury on the part of a plaintiff deposing in support of his own demand supposing an habitual course of perjury to be capable of being otherwise engaged in as a source of livelihood the taint which a few steps in this career would have the effect of imprinting on a mans reputation would not fail to oppose a powerful obstacle to his persevering in it with any adequate prospect of success    the following seem to be the considerations by which the admission or rejection of this species of evidence ought to be determined   the importance of the cause to the demandants side in respect of the mischief of impunity   the importance of the cause to the defendants side in respect of the mischief of undue punishment   the importance of the matter in dispute to each party respectively in the case of a nonpenal cause   the delay threatened by the production of the evidence applied for   the vexation apprehended to third persons from the production supposing it compulsory of the evidence applied for   the doubtfulness of the case as it stands on the ground of the other more appropriate evidence the following rules and observations seem calculated to aid the judge in determining on the admission or rejection of this species of evidence—   no evidence of character good or bad—no speaking to character favourably or unfavourably i e at the instance either of the defendant or the demandant—ought to be admitted without power to the judge if he thinks fit to allow of time for inquiry into the character of the charactergivers themselves why for the same reason as in case of alibi evidence but the force of the reasons in this case are much less conclusive the evidence of badness of character being in its nature so much less precise and satisfactory than the evidence of the existence or nonexistence of such or such a person at such or such a time in such or such a place   evidence of bad character in crimination of the defendant ought not to be admitted unless in so far as it results from evidence admissible on other grounds or unless the fact of the offence being clear the question is between two persons suspected which of them was the author and even in these cases that the quantity of vexation and delay may not be altogether boundless power should be left to the judge to limit the quantity or quality of the evidence the number and choice of the witnesses in declared consideration of the apprehended magnitude of these respective inconveniences   if at the instance of the defendant evidence in favour of his character is admitted so at the instance of the other side should counterevidence operating in disfavour of his character be admitted and time accordingly be allowed for it†   supposing the extraction of selfcriminative evidence from the mouth of the defendant admitted examination to this point will be as unexceptionable as to any other and so far as it extends the vexation will be kept from reaching third persons and the additional delay will be less in the case of evidence extracted from this source than of evidence extracted from any other   two considerations operate in diminution of the inconvenience from characterevidence at the instance and consequently in favour of a defendant if the characters of his witnesses are obscure and unknown the danger of their obtaining undue credence is but little if suspected still less—if known so as to present a claim to confidence the inference thence deduced though not good as to past innocence in respect of the individual offence charged may be good in respect of the probability of future reformation in consequence of the impression made by the trial and its attendant terrors   but if in consideration rather of the prospect of reformation than of the probability of innocence acquittal be grounded on evidence of preceding good character as above—it ought not to extend beyond the amount of punishment under the name of punishment it ought not to preclude the party injured from satisfaction at the expense of the defendant if the force of the evidence upon the whole would be sufficient to entitle him to a decision in his favour supposing the case a purely nonpenal case   if the appropriate evidence in the cause leans in favour of the defendant the demand for this inappropriate evidence has no place   supposing a professional judge or judges with a jury of occasional judges—power might be given to the judge to suspend the admission of this characterevidence so as not to admit it but in case of conviction or indecision on the ground of the appropriate evidence suppose a professional judge or judges acting without a jury—the demand for the conditional decision as above has no place he simply suspends his definitive decision till the evidence of character has been got in characterevidence has this in common with alibi evidence that it is with the utmost facility and clearness distinguishable from every other species of evidence what passes in relation to it is therefore with proportionable facility susceptible of registration   whose character it is—the demandants or the defendants   at whose instance called for—that of the demandant the defendant or the judge   when called for by demandant or defendant—whether ordered accordingly or refused by the judge  0   if refused on what ground—whether delay and to whose prejudice—that of demandant or defendant or vexation and to whom—whether   to the court and the public in respect of time consumed or   to the witness or witnesses or   to the party repugnant in respect of the expense   if exhibited whether prevalent or inoperative i e whether the decision was in favour of that side or of the opposite   length of time consumed by the evidence of this description in court by the exhibition of it—out of court in waiting for it ratio of this length of time to that of the length of time consumed in like manner upon the other evidence the appropriate evidence in the cause   names description and number of the witnesses of whose testimony this evidence was composed ratio of this number to that of the whole number of the witnesses whose testimony was exhibited in the course of the cause such is the information by which the advantages and disadvantages attending the employment of this species of evidence would be placed in a distinct and satisfactory point of view in this place the statement of the heads occupies space but in each cause the space as well as time consumed by the entry of the matters coming under these heads would be trifling indeed in comparison with the use hitherto the question regarding the admissibility of characterevidence has been considered only so far as regards the character of the defendant but there still remains another question—how far shall it be allowable to produce evidence for or against the character of a witness in this case an imputation conveyed in general terms may on certain conditions without any preponderant inconvenience be admitted what then are these conditions   in the first place the imputation if general should be confined to that part of a mans character which respects veracity the witness among his acquaintance is regarded as an habitual liar a habit of this sort may be ascribed to a man without specific proof why because a habit of this sort may be the result of a multitude of acts none of them perhaps punishable in course of law and too numerous to be proved   but in this case it should be allowable for the party by whom the witness is produced to call upon the impugning witness viz upon his crossexamination to declare if it be in his power the particular instances in which this alleged disposition to mendacity became apparent   in the next place an imputation of this sort ought not to be admitted unless it has been previously ascertained that there are three witnesses or two at least to maintain it the considerations that suggest this limitation are as follows— of evidence of this sort if false the falsity is not in its nature capable of being proved for the purpose of punishment in case of that sort and degree of improbity on the part of the party in question which prompts to subornation this is of that sort of false evidence which is procurable with least risk and therefore with least difficulty if an imputation of this sort has really attached upon a mans character it can scarce happen but that more witnesses than one may be found to speak to it there seems therefore little danger that the condition in question if annexed should operate in exclusion of this species of evidence the objection above mentioned as presenting itself on the ground of facility of subornation will thus be proportionably reduced in force it is not only twice as difficult—indeed as on close examination it would appear more than twice as difficult—to suborn two false witnesses as one but in case of their being procured the chance of detecting the falsehood is much increased in respect of the probability of disagreement and mutual treachery as between individuals thus linked together by community in guilt supposing the general habit of mendacity viz extrajudicial mendacity ever so clearly established the judge should not regard the inference from such general mendacity to mendacity in the individual case in question viz a judicial case as being by any means conclusive on the ordinary occasions of life a man has no such cogent motives to confine him to the path of truth no such sanctions to bind him to it as in this extraordinary one without a motive of some sort or other a man will not encounter any risk without a motive and a motive of very considerable force a man will not subject himself to such serious risks so far as specific acts are concerned there are but two sorts of crime that present themselves as affording any inferences worth regarding in this view these are—   crimes of mendacity at the head of these stands actual perjury underneath at a considerable distance stand other crimes of extrajudicial mendacity such as obtaining valuable things or services by false assertions which though made in direct terms are made without oath below these again crimes in which the assertion is indirect and inexplicit as in case of forgery at large and those forgeries which have coin or money of any kind for their subjectmatter   the other class is composed of such other offences of the predatory cast such as theft highway robbery and housebreaking as suppose what may be called a general prostration of character though here too the    inference from such an act will be very inconclusive unless it appear connected with a habit of the same kind but in the case of all offences in the description of which mendacity is not involved the inference will stand lower in the scale of strength by a very determinate and perceptible degree as to offences which neither are indicative of any such prostration of character nor involve any breach of the duty of veracity—in the case of any such offences the inference may be said to fail altogether offences produced by the irascible passions and offences produced by the sexual appetite may serve for examples in the case of a witness evidence of good character can scarcely ever be admissible with propriety in the first instance for no imputation is cast upon a mans character in this case as there is in that of the defendant and till a ground for a contrary opinion presents itself the character of the witness like that of every other man ought to be presumed a good one the endeavour to produce evidence of this sort would merely have the effect of producing useless delay vexation and expense but in this same case of a witness if evidence charging him with bad character has been produced on the adverse side there seems no more reason for excluding evidence of good character in behalf of the same person than has been seen already in the case of a defendant on various scores evidence of good character is liable to much less objection than evidence of bad character when no evidence of bad character had been adduced the demand for similar evidence of good character did not exist but the demand now does exist the case being reversed §   of the station of the supposed delinquent considered as probabilizing or disprobabilizing delinquency station may be considered as indicative of the disposition and thence of the character of the class viz of the class to which the individual in question belongs of the class composed of the individuals by whom the station in question is occupied to an inculpative purpose this circumstance can scarcely be considered as having any application in every political community the lowest station is that which is occupied by the greatest number of the members it is only in the character of an exculpative circumstance viz on the ground of improbability—psychological improbability as above—that this circumstance is apt to operate with any considerable degree of probative force and thus applied the force i e the disprobative force in respect of the probability of the offence in question on the part of the supposed delinquent in question with which it operates is apt to be very considerable the principal application of this species of evidence is that which obtains in a cause especially a penal cause where the matter in question is an article of property more especially in cases where as in ordinary thefts the value of it is inconsiderable in respect of the habitual pecuniary circumstances of the defendant as indicated by the species of circumstantial evidence in question viz his station in life a man in a station of life thus elevated is it likely that his necessities should be so urgent as to drive him into a channel of supply at once so scanty and so hazardous compared with moral character the presumption    afforded by this circumstance will in general be much more persuasive why because the matter of fact will in general be so much the more notorious so much the less liable to be misrepresented by the force of bias the presumptive evidence of habitual opulence afforded by office visible property education habitual expenditure will in general be much more incontestable than any which can be afforded of moral character by general expressions singly much more if in conjunction a certain degree of opulence and rank in life are enough to render scarcely credible on any evidence a fact for which in another station in respect of rank and opulence slight evidence would be sufficient to gain credence in any of the civilized nations of europe what evidence would be sufficient to convict a prince of the blood or a minister of state of having picked a mans pocket of a dirty handkerchief in a street or in going into a playhouse one particular case there is in which the force of the presumption derived from this source is not quite so great as on general considerations it might appear this is the case of thefts committed on articles possessing a value of affection and in particular thefts committed by amateurs on fancy articles—rare books rare pictures rare plants shells minerals rare anything a man who might be trusted with safety with a heap of untold gold might not be capable of resisting the temptation presented by some choice desideratum which if to be sold might be to be purchased for a few shillings the warning afforded by this observation is happily of no great use in practice thefts of special concupiscence are the offences of the rich thefts of general concupiscence are the offences of the poor thefts of the former description are apt to experience a degree of indulgence in which the principle of sympathy and antipathy will naturally find much to reprobate but to which the principle of utility is by no means equally severe the alarm in this case is extremely narrow few but amateurs have anything to fear from the thefts of amateurs and the mischief which the negligence of an amateur has to fear from the concupiscence of another is confined to simple theft to the more formidable mischiefs of robbery housebreaking and murder the apprehension does not extend hence it is that thefts of this description in the few instances in which they are detected experience commonly a degree of indulgence such as would not be extended to those which have the plea of necessity or at least of indigence for their excuse hence too it is that the indulgence extended to them is not productive of any such general mischief to society as would be the result of the like indulgence if extended with equal frequency to promiscuous thefts in some cases the question in regard to opulence and rank in life enters into the essence of the cause the probability and improbability of the main fact in dispute is in a manner governed by them and in these cases whether character be or be not expressly held up to view it is in a manner impossible to it not to act with more or less force upon the mind of the judge take the famous case of the comte de morangiès in linguets plaidoyers the count—having occasion to borrow money to the amount of  00000 livres—with evident though not unusual imprudence trusts an obscure female moneybroker and through her means a pretended moneylender with bills of his payable to order to that amount and upwards of this large sum no more than   00 livres were really delivered the pretended lender proves the delivery of the whole by the testimony of three pretended eyewitnesses the whole cause of the unfortunate man of quality rests upon circumstantial evidence upon improbability partly of the physical partly of the psychological kind station in respect of rank and opulence on both sides but more especially in respect of opulence on the part of the pretended lender became a necessary subject of inquiry traced out from the time of the pretended acquisition of this large fortune to the time of the disposition thus pretended to have been made of it the whole history of her life and conversation concurred in representing the fact of her having possessed it or anything like it as scarce credible upon any testimony—absolutely incredible upon the strength of the testimony produced chapter xiv posteriora priorum—priora posteriorum fact indicated a prior event evidentiary fact a posterior event in the same series and e converso these two topics are scarcely susceptible of a separate consideration no two can be more intimately connected in any series of facts the existence of acts or other events—the existence of works physical or pyschological the fruit of such acts or events following each other in the character of so many successive means leading to a common end of so many successive effects originating in a common cause—the    existence of a posterior article will naturally serve as evidence of the existence of each prior article and è converso the existence of a prior article will operate though commonly with much less force in the character of evidence of the existence of each posterior article with a view to cases of a penal nature these topics have been already handled under a variety of modifications handled not under their own names but under the names of their respective modifications fear for example fear of punishment being the natural consequence of delinquency operates as evidence of it preparations for a crime being among the causes of the pernicious event operate as evidence serving to fix upon the person who is ascertained to have been engaged in them the authorship of that event the sort of facts that remain for consideration on the present occasion are those that are liable to come in question in cases of a nonpenal nature examples—   a voyage or journey of considerable length evidentiary fact the arrival of the traveller at the terminus ad quem facts indicated his appearance and transactions at the several intermediate stages e converso evidentiary facts his appearance and transactions at any of the intermediate stages coupled with evidence of his intentions of conveying himself to the terminus ad quem fact indicated his arrival there   general settlement of a mans property by deed inter vivos or testament evidentiary fact the execution of the appropriate written instrument fact indicated the existence of transactions and scripts letters papers of instruction c preparatory to that event e converso evidentiary fact the existence of a transaction or script of a nature preparatory to such event fact indicated the ultimate event itself   entrance into a new condition in life e g marriage evidentiary fact the celebration of the marriage ceremony facts indicated preparatory transactions and scripts tete à téte conversations overtures to parents or guardians loveletters bespeaking of the ring and wedding clothes housekeeping preparations publication of banns or obtainment of licence c e converso evidentiary fact any one or more of these preparatory incidents fact evidenced the performance of the ceremony   engaging in a profitseeking occupation engaging in a partnership the preparatory steps will be infinitely diversifiable according to the particular nature of the occupation in each case to pursue the exemplification further seems unnecessary   litigation evidentiary fact the ultimate decision or in cases requiring active execution the extrajudicial transactions designated in each particular instance by that word facts indicated the several preparatory transactions and scripts of procedure according to the nature of the case e converso evidentiary fact the existence of any such preparatory transaction or script fact evidenced ultimate decision of the cause in favour of the demandant or the defendant according to the particular nature of such cause from this general view of the subject several observations may be deduced—observations some if not all of which may appear too obvious to be worth mentioning but there is no observation so obvious as not sometimes to be overlooked—   in every such natural series facts posterior and prior are naturally evidentiary of each other   the probative force of posterior events in regard to prior ones is naturally much stronger than that of prior events with regard to posterior ones in all human affairs execution is better evidence of design than design of execution why because human designs are so often frustrated   when the posterior event indicated by a prior event did not take place it will in most instances happen that the failure will have been proved by some notorious or easilyproved facts by which in this case the probative force of the prior event with reference to the posterior will have been entirely destroyed but sometimes it will happen especially in the transactions of a remote period that no completely satisfactory evidence is forthcoming either of the failure of the design or of the consummation of it as far as this is the case the modification of circumstantial evidence here called for shortness priora posteriorum may beyond question have its use a state of things may be supposed in which the probative force of this species of evidence might be estimated or rather observed with the utmost nicety this is where on the one hand the instances in which the design has proceeded to the stage of consummation—on the other hand the instances in which the execution has stopped short at any of the several preliminary stages have been made the subject of official or other trustworthy registration the case thus put is not absolutely out of the reach of practice in different degrees it has been exemplified in different countries and different courts in the practice of judicial registration it might be and generally speaking ought to be exemplified in the most perfect degree in the practice of all such courts when the ends of justice are taken for the ends of judicature a system of forensic bookkeeping will be employed by which it will appear in what degree fulfilment is given to    those salutary ends it will be apparent in each individual cause at what price in the shape of expense vexation and delay justice or what is given for justice is purchased and likewise what proportion of that price is the result of natural and unavoidable—what of factitious and therefore avoidable causes in that state of judicial bookkeeping the mode and period of termination will in each cause appear of course under such a system of bookkeeping the termination of each cause being manifested by direct evidence there will not it may be said be any demand for any such circumstantial evidence as is here in view the facts of all stages being on record posterior ones as well as prior ones there will be no use in any such operation as that of inferring the existence of either from that of the other but in regard to any given individual cause suppose the memorials of a posterior transaction or script to be unforthcoming—destroyed obliterated lost or inaccessible in this case any prior article of the same series may afford inferences and have its use in another way a rational system of judicial bookkeeping might have a much more extensive use and still in the character of a source of this modification of circumstantial evidence the application given to such a register might not only be prospective but retrospective the negligence of preceding legislators might in some measure be repaired by the diligence of succeeding ones two equal spaces of time are taken—say of ten years each the posterior a period of perfect registration as above the prior a period when registration was more or less imperfect or altogether deficient in the period of imperfect registration a certain cause it is known proceeded to a certain stage what is the probability of its having arrived at the ultimate stage and in that case of its having terminated in favour of the demandant rather than of the defendant turn to the accounts of the period of good bookkeeping the probability of the two events will be respectively found in numbers chapter xv on the probative force of circumstantial evidence §   what ought to be done and what avoided in estimating the probative force of circumstantial evidence on this as on every other part of the field of evidence rules capable of rendering right decisions secure are what the nature of things denies to the establishment of rules by which misdecision is rendered more probable than it would otherwise he the nature of man is prone to put the legislator and the judge upon their guard against such rashness is all that the industry of the free inquirer can do in favour of the ends of justice probative force of the evidentiary fact in question in relation to the principal fact in question—and closeness of connexion between such evidentiary fact and such principal fact—are interconvertible expressions probative force and closeness of connexion as between fact and fact having no more than an apparent and relative existence relative viz relation being had to him by whom the facts are contemplated in this view nothing more can be truly indicated by them than strength of persuasion on his part—strength of persuasion applied to evidence of the description in question—viz to circumstantial evidence on each individual occasion the degree of strength at which the persuasion stands would be capable of being expressed by numbers in the same way as degrees of probability are expressed by mathematicians viz by the ratio of one number to another but the matter of the case admits not of any such precision as that which would be given by employing different ratios i e different pairs of numbers as expressive of so many uniform degrees of probative force belonging one of them to one sort of circumstantial evidence another to another of an evidentiary fact of the same description described in and by any combination whatsoever of general words the probative force will be found different in different individual cases it may be in any degree slight and it may be strong in almost any degree short of conclusive the use of infirmative suppositions is to afford a test of conclusiveness and in some sort of probative force to judge whether with relation to a given principal fact a given evidentiary fact be conclusive or no look out on all sides for all such infirmative suppositions as can be found if with relation to a given fact proposed in the character of a principal fact another fact given in the character of an evidentiary fact appear to you as operating in that character—operating in any degree howsoever slight—look round to see if no supposition operating upon its probative force in the character of an infirmative supposition be to be found—no fact which in its nature is not impossible and with which supposing it on the occasion in question realized the existence of the principal fact in question would be incompatible or in virtue of which the existence of the principal fact would be seen to be less probable if any such infirmative    supposition be found the probative force of the evidentiary fact is not so great as to be conclusive but if after your utmost endeavours you find yourself unable to discern any such infirmative supposition—then in your own particular instance relation had to the state of your own persuasion the probative force may be conclusive supposing one evidentiary fact and only one infirmative supposition applying to it then to estimate i e expression numbers the quantity of probative force remaining to the evidentiary fact—deduct from the ratio expressive of practical certainty the ratio expressive of the probability of the fact the existence of which is by the infirmative supposition supposed the remainder will be the nett probative force to one and the same evidentiary fact suppose a number of different infirmative suppositions applicable and of each of the several supposed facts suppose the probability the same the sum of their infirmative forces will be as their number in an evidentiary chain composed of a number of links of which the first is a fact proved by direct evidence the last the principal fact in question and between them one supposed fact at least of which the fact proved is regarded as evidentiary and which itself is regarded as evidentiary of the principal fact the greater the number of such intermediate links the less is the probative force of the evidentiary fact proved with relation to the principal fact why because of the several facts thus evidentiary one of another in a chain each is hable to have its infirmative counterprobabilities by the disprobative force of each of which as above its nett probative force is liable to be diminished accordingly on the occasion of each such chain let it be your care to see that no intermediate link or links with their respectively applicable infirmative suppositions be omitted from the probative force of each evidentiary fact applying to the same principal fact that of every other will receive an increase but no reason can be given for concluding that the sum of the probative force of such evidentiary facts will be uniformly as the number of the facts themselves on looking over for example a table or list of evidentiary facts having for their common principal fact delinquency—it will be found that in more instances than one two evidentiary facts of each of which taken by itself the probative force would be scarcely worth regarding shall when taken together be found to operate with a very considerable degree of probative force so considerable as to be if unopposed by any counterevidence on the other side conclusive or if two thus unopposed be not sufficient three may and so on    of facts of the psychological class there is no one species of evidentiary fact the probative force of which can with propriety be considered as being in all cases conclusive why because as hath already been seen there is not one the probative force of which is not liable to be weakened by different classes of facts distinguished on that consideration by the appellation of infirmative facts among physical facts one may be evidentiary of another with any degree of probative force and accordingly with a degree of force sufficient to be regarded as conclusive on this head see what under the head of physical incredibility is said farther on of the three modifications of extraordinary facts viz facts amounting to a violation of a law of nature facts devious from the course of nature in degree facts devious in specie if the existence of fact a being supposed the nonexistence of fact b would be a violation of any law of nature or devious in degree or species to such an extent as to be incredible the probative force of fact a in relation to the existence of fact b may be deemed conclusive thus in regard to quadrupeds take the two facts parturition and sexual conjunction between these two facts parturition is the indicative fact—sexual conjunction the fact indicated by it and of the former the probative force in relation to the existence of the latter may be pronounced conclusive among physical facts however even such as are the most completely conclusive the conclusiveness affords no sufficient reason for the establishment of unbending rules imposing on the judge the obligation of forming the conclusion indicated why because in proportion as the rule is safe secure against being productive of erroneous decision it is in the same proportion useless safe it is not effective effective it is not safe suppose a rule laid down that in every cause in which virginity may happen to come in question parturition shall be regarded as a fact conclusively disprobative of it the rule would be innocent enough but where would be the use of it is there any the least danger that by any judge or set of judges by whom parturition has been admitted to have been satisfactorily proved the existence of sexual intercourse should be disaffirmed if the establishment of any one such rule would be proper so would that of as many others as could be constructed but in this way a complete system of physical science would be to be established by authority and engrafted into the system of judicial procedure and limits to the improvement of every branch of physical science and especially of the most important of all—the medical—would be fixed by law no rule ought to be laid down rendering the exhibition of this or that evidentiary fact necessary as a condition sine quá non to a judicial decision affirming or assuming the existence of any other fact in the character of a fact indicated and requiring for the proof of it the proof of such evidentiary fact reasons—if the probative force of the other parts of the evidence is not sufficient to produce persuasion on the part of the judge persuasion will accordingly not be produced and the rule restraining the judge from acting on the ground of such persuasion will be unnecessary and useless if the probative force    of the evidence is sufficient to produce such persuasion and such persuasion is produced accordingly although the proof of the evidentiary fact in question be wanting—the restrictive rule is improper prejudicial to the interests of truth and justice in the history of law be the country what it may—the farther we go back the more numerous the instances we may expect to find of convictions and executions on insufficient evidence but for the opposite reason the longer we go on in the track of civilization the more rare we may expect to find the instances of such errors in judicature as have the weakness of the mental faculties for their cause it is in the strength which by the continuallyincreasing stock of information may be given to the mental faculties of judges by apposite instructions drawn from correct and comprehensive views of the subject that the true preservative against such errors is to be looked for not in the restrictive operation of unbending rules of evidence if there be any cases in which any such unbending rules promise upon the whole to be beneficial to the interests of truth and justice the two following seem to be of the number   where—the mischief of the decision if erroneous being in a certain respect irreparable and by reason of the distance of the tribunal from the seat of government or otherwise the confidence reposed in it by the legislator inferior to that which is reposed by him in some other and higher tribunal—cases are accordingly marked out in which on the ground of evidence of such or such a description or without the concurrence of evidence of such or such a description a decision productive of such irreparable consequences shall not be pronounced or shall not be executed it is upon this same principle that in the austrian code certain offences are marked out such as magic and witchcraft in relation to which the inferior tribunals of distant provinces are forbidden to proceed upon any evidence   the other case comprehends in its whole extent the range of capital punishment—the only species of punishment which is absolutely and totally irreparable but of the consideration of this irreparability what is the true result the impropriety of this mode of punishment not the propriety of those unbending rules in the instance in question it was the consideration of the nature of the punishment—of the property thus belonging to it—that called into action the humane temerity of the judge in every system of law into which this irreparable mode of punishment has been admitted—but most of all in the english system in which the fondness shown to it is so great and so continually upon the increase—the system of procedure in general and of the law of evidence in particular teems with rules and practices tending to the encouragement of criminality in every shape and most of all in such as are most mischievous capital punishment has thus been all along operating and will continue to operate with continually increasing force as a slow poison upon the whole system of procedure including that of evidence thus it is that the work of real inhumanity and of false humanity of folly under that specious name go on together and while substantive law with its favourite and unwearied instrument capital punishment is straining every nerve to tighten the bands of society—adjective law with its prejudices and inconsistencies is as pertinaciously employed in loosening them from the above theoretical propositions the following practical instructions of a monitory nature seem deducible— i warnings tending to prevent undervaluation   reject no article of circumstantial evidence on the score of weakness   much less on the score of its not being conclusive   hold not the aggregate mass insufficient for the separate insufficiency of the elementary articles   hold not an aggregate mass of circumstantial evidence insufficient for the mere want of an article of this or that one description   hold not circumstantial insufficient as such for the mere want of direct evidence viz where direct evidence is not obtainable or not without preponderant inconvenience in the shape of delay vexation and expense   hold not direct evidence insufficient merely for the want of circumstantial ii warnings tending to prevent overvaluation     set down no article nor any aggregate mass of circumstantial evidence as even provisionally conclusive in all cases     much less as conclusive against or what comes to the same thing to the exclusion of all counterevidence     content not yourself with general circumstantial testimony when you can have special direct testimony from the same source  0   whatever evidence in particular circumstantial evidence other than that produced by interrogation of the respective parties presents itself—if the situation of the party be such as to present any probability of his being able to give explanation of it i e to contribute either to give completeness or correctness to it or to the inferences deducible from it—fail not to employ interrogation—judicial interrogation applied to the party—for the explanation of it         reject not circumstantial as needless on account of the abundance of direct §   errors of jurists from neglect of the above rules the warnings given above are it may be said reasonable enough but are they not too obviously so to be of any use among the errors thus pointed at not one perhaps that has not been embraced in practice propagated by lawwriters or what is worse carried into effect by legislators and by judges in each part of the field of evidence after what presents itself as the path of utility and reason has been traced out the course taken in the present work is to bring to view the deviations made from it by the most distinguished systems of established law the roman and the english such accordingly is the course pursued on the occasion now in hand except that—as exemplifications of such deviation cannot be found for every one of the above monitory rules—to supply the deficiency the view given of the established practice in the two systems will here be preceded by a few examples taken from the speculations of jurists whose notions in regard to the points in question do not appear as yet to have been on any occasion explicitly adopted so as to have given birth to practice with a view to this particular subject the order given to the monitory rules should also have been given to the examples but to avoid confounding unauthoritative notions with authoritative practice the particular principle has been sacrificed to the general one   an aggregate body of circumstantial evidence treated as insufficient on the ground of the separate insufficiency of the elementary articles when in a penal cause the charge is supported as is commonly the case by a number of evidentiary facts with or without direct testimony to the principal fact in question—a natural and on the part of the advocate for the defendant a necessary course is to take the body of evidence to pieces—to examine each member of it each evidentiary fact separately—and from the inconclusiveness of each to infer the inconclusiveness of the whole in the case of captain donnellan on the criminative side no article whatever of direct evidence was produced but a prodigious number of criminative facts—articles of circumstantial evidence after he was executed a book was written to prove the evidence insufficient each criminative fact was taken separately how inconclusive this how inconclusive that and so on each being inconclusive of itself the inference was that so they were all of them put together of the individual premises each taken separately the truth was undeniable but the collective conclusion did not follow donnellan practised distillation as a proof of poisoning what did that amount to—next to nothing at that rate all distillers would be poisoners not engaged in that or any other occupation with a view to profit nor yet occupying himself with chemistry in any other shape still he practised distillation what did that again amount to—some small matter perhaps but very little more at that rate all the lady bountifuls a class which though not quite so numerous as formerly is not yet quite extract would be poisoners he distilled what there was reason to think was laurelwater—a known poison not known to be used for any other purpose the proof strengthens though still very far from conclusive thus much as to preparations though there were others in the case go on next to motives the relation of the defendant to the deceased was such that upon the death of the latter a large property was to devolve upon the former here then was temptation—a sinister motive to which he stood exposed what he saw what he could not but see was an advantage and that to a great amount on the point of accruing to him on the happening of that event in that point of view he was urged by a particular species of motive pecuniary interest to use his endeavours for the bringing about of that event in that point of view he stood exposed to the impulsive action of that motive does it follow that he yielded to the impulse here was a survivor who had profit in expectancy upon the death of the deceased does it follow that at the expense of so horrible a crime he used his endeavour for the procuring of such death at that rate the most common of all causes of death is parricide illhumour has been observed between man and wife the woman dies is this a proof that she died by murder and that her husband was the murderer at that rate the few couples excepted who might be capable of making title to the flitch at dunmow all married men and all married women are murderers   an aggregate body of evidence held insufficient for want of a particular article of circumstantial evidence in several instances that have been made public and in a number greater than might at first view have been supposed—a defendant has been convicted of the murder of a man who has afterwards made his appearance in a living state in consideration of the fatal errors in judicature thus brought to light instances have been mentioned in which a judge has declared his resolution never to concur in any conviction    of murder where the dead body has not been found but a resolution known to be thus declared at least if corroborated by a known instance in which such resolution has been acted upon is sufficient to give birth to a rule of jurisprudential law the motive of the determination was evidently a laudable one but the consequences of the determination if converted into a rule and that without exception and known to be so would be in the highest degree prejudicial to justice to secure to himself impunity a murderer would have no more to do but to consume or decompose the body by fire by lime or by any other of the wellknown chemical menstrua or to sink it in an unfathomable part of the sea in any of these ways might the body be effectually got rid of and though it were in the face of any number of witnesses the rule being established without the correspondent exceptions impunity would follow of course nor yet would the rule afford the security it aims at without another condition not expressed upon the face of it the body found—by what evidence is it to be proved to have been found the judge before whom the prosecution for the homicide is to be tried—is it to his eyes that the body is to be produceed this is not in any case what is meant what probably enough is meant though not expressed is that the existence of the body in a dead state should have been ascertained by the testimony of some ocular witness whose trustworthiness is regarded as being exceptionproof for example in english law the coroner with his jury for if any testimony at large is to be regarded as sufficient the intended security is gone i saw the body of titius after he was dead i saw sempronius beat out the brains of titius falsehood may attach with as little difficulty upon the one speech as upon the other†   an imperfect body of circumstantial evidence set down as conclusive for want of due attention to supposable infirmative facts of the need there may be for these warnings an exemplification may be seen in the doctrine of lord coke‡ of his division of presumptions i e of circumstantial evidence into three degrees in respect of force—violent probable and light or temerarious—mention has been made upon another occasion in another place∥ violenta presumptio says he is many times in many instances plena probatio full proof and the instance he gives is this—as if one be run thorow the bodie with a sword in a house whereof he instantly dieth and a man is seen to come out of that house with a bloody sword and no other man was at that time in the house presumption probabilis moveth little but presumptio levis sen temeraria moveth not at all to the probative force of this body or rather article of circumstantial evidence two facts present themselves in the character of supposable infirmative facts   the deceased plunged the sword into his own body as in the case of suicide the  0 accused not being in time to prevent him drew out the sword and so ran out through confusion of mind for chirurgical assistance   the deceased and the accused both wore swords the deceased in a fit of passion attacked the accused the accused being close to the wall had no retreat and had just time enough to draw his sword in the hope of keeping off the deceased the deceased not seeing the sword in time ran upon it and so was killed other suppositions might be started besides these nor do these exculpative ones either of them seem in any considerable degree less probable than that criminative one if so the probability of delinquency instead of being conclusive is but as   to   such is the evidence upon which the father of english jurisprudence would have pronounced a man guilty without seruple what it is he would have found him guilty of—murder or manslaughter—a capital crime or a crime short of capital—he does not say murder probably enough since manslaughter being a sort of alleviation requires special evidence murder accordingly is the verdict which the coroners jury find of course where no alleviating circumstances to reduce it to manslaughter have presented themselves §   defects of established systems from neglect of the above rules   general circumstantial testimony received to the exclusion of special direct testimony from the same source as also of all counterevidence is exemplified in the instance of the several sorts of actions or suits to which the evidence called wager of law† applies—restoration of a specific thing is claimed at the defendants hands by whatsoever body of apposite evidence direct or circumstantial the claim is supported—the defendant is allowed to adduce the counterevidence thus denommated and the evidence in support of the claim becomes inadmissible the defendant comes into court and denies in general terms the fact whatever it be on the ground of which the obligation is sought to be imposed upon him along with him comes a posse of other witnesses number a dozen neither more nor less they know nothing about the matter but by the opinion they have of him they are certain that what he says is true the evidence they furnish is so much character evidence swearers of this denomination are like ghosts and witches nowhere do they exist but in many and many a place they do as much mischief as if they did two or three sorts of actions are altogether laid asleep by them and the effect of it is that for no one moveable thing that he has has an englishman any remedy at law money is given him instead of it the sum is never equal in value to the injury sustained by the want of the thing sought to keep the thing at the price thus put upon it is always at the option of the wrong doer in roman law general circumstantial testimony accepted in lieu of or in addition to special direct testimony from the same source is exemplified in the cases where the oath denominated juramentum expurgatorium‡ was employed the cases being penal and the evidence on the criminative side neither sufficient for conviction nor yet for torture the judge might if he thought fit call upon the defendant to swear to his nondelinquency in general terms of a fixed formulary for that purpose i know no instance the description of the practice is obscure and vague enough like everything else in roman law in these as in all other penal cases interrogation of the defendant himself was in the power of the judge extraction consequently of a full body of confessorial evidence or of the denegatory testimony given by him in lieu of it testimony of which on the supposition of delinquency more or less must have been false was this power employed this was letting off a delinquent upon bad and unsatisfactory evidence when upon better evidence    and in case of confession the very best of all he had been either shown to be not guilty or shown to be guilty this is recurring to inferior evidence after receiving superior evidence from the same source it is like harpagon in the play rends moi sanste foudler ce que tu mas volé the search had already been made and produced nothing has the power remained unemployed this is employing the inferior to the exclusion of the superior evidence it is as if the master persuaded of the guilt of his innocent servant had contented himself with saying to him—tell me whether you are guilty or no forbearing purposely to make search juramentum suppletorium—this was an oath in certain nonpenal cases it possessed in common with the juramentum expurgatorium the feature which renders it applicable to this purpose in different nations on different occasions it appears to have been employed in the character of an evidentiary fact right of some sort or other being the fact indicated—right to some service such as that very extensive sort of service which consists in the transfer of money or moneys worth to the possessor of the right—right to an exemption from an obligation of that or some other nature sought to be imposed on him the error applicable to the present purpose consists in the acceptance of a vague assertion in addition to or to the exclusion of a specific statement of an article of weak circumstantial evidence in addition to or in exclusion of a body of direct evidence from the same source†   evidentiary facts excluded altogether under the idea of their being weak and even under that of their not being conclusive in the case of this as of every other species of evidence the production of it should neither be compelled nor admitted when by such compulsion or admission more evil will be produced in respect of the collateral ends of justice viz avoidance of delay vexation and expense than by the exclusion of it in respect of the direct end of justice viz by danger of indecision except on this ground however there is no evidence presented in the character of circumstantial evidence the production of which ought not to be not only permitted but compelled in particular no such evidence ought to be excluded on the ground of deficiency in point of probative force why should any be excluded operative it is useful inoperative it is innocent the rashness with which on different pretences exclusions—peremptory and inexorable exclusions—have been put upon evidences of different descriptions by men of law will be matter of ample observation in another place‡ the ground which forms the subject of the present book is that on which this rashness has displayed itself with least violence from oral evidence—circumstantial evidence orally delivered—it seems to have abstained altogether in the permanent texture of written evidence it has found as it were solid ground to fasten upon in the shape of parole evidence—be the evidence when of this description ever so slight—be the inference it affords ever so short of being conclusive—there is no objection to the reception of it in this shape imagination cannot frame a circumstance more trifling more inconclusive than many are which have been admitted to be produced in evidence and continue to be admitted in every days practice admitted yes and with great and just effect why because not to speak of greater numbers even two articles of circumstantial evidence—though each taken by itself weigh but as a feather—join them together you will find them pressing on the delinquent with the weight of a millstone give to the evidence in question the form of a written document the treatment it meets with is reversed an inexorable bar is now opposed to it presented by the mouth of a witness be its value ever so small it is allowed to pass for whatever it is worth presented in writing if it fall short of being conclusive it is not allowed to go for anything so it be exhibited vivâ voce no matter how remote and inconclusive the evidentiary fact reported by the circumstantial evidence when received the impression made by it may be slight or amount to nothing but the lightness of it how extreme soever is never made into a ground for the exclusion of it it is only when consigned to writing that it is scrutinized before admission and if not looked upon as weighty enough to be conclusive is thrown out as worthless rash exclusion on one side or equally rash exclusion on the other rash exclusion of the lot of evidence in question or rash exclusion of every other evidence that might have been opposed to it such is the only alternative a record says the immortal gilbert the father of the law of evidence a record is a diagram whereby right is demonstrated∥ to    appear and not to command assent is beneath its dignity where demonstration enters doubt finds no room to stand upon numerous are the instances in which the admissibility of matters of record in proof of the existence of other matters of record has been disputed and in some it has been disputed with success with relation to the fact supposed to be indicated the existence of the document in question has been pronounced no evidence or what comes to the same thing the court has in that character declared it inadmissible—refused to pay regard to it that the ultimate decision which has taken place in consequence of this rejection has been contrary to truth and justice is more than in all or any of these instances i could take upon me to affirm an opinion to that effect well or ill grounded would be of no use materials for torming it are not forthcoming possibly in each one of these instances had the document been received in evidence and its probative force been taken into consideration it would have been found inconclusive that is the whole of the evidence on that side whether the document in question constituted the whole or only a part of it would have been considered in that light nor yet will i take upon me to say for perhaps it may not be to be known and if it were the result of the inquiry would not be worth the trouble whether in the several instances in question the case was that the evidence was rejected without consideration of the tenor of it excluded or no in fact and in that individual cause it appears at any rate in the character of a species of excluded evidence in the books of law accordingly in due form of legal architecture a species of case is built upon the ground of it and thereupon as usual in each succeeding cause in which the same or a similar point presents itself the question is—not whether the fact happened but whether the individual case in hand belongs or does not belong to that species of case what is the consequence though in the individual case in hand not a person concerned that is not persuaded of the existence of the fact indicated—the existence of the document which supposing it to exist would be decisive persuaded and that by the other document the existence of which is exhibited in the character of the evidentiary fact yet still the decision is to be directly contrary—why because the case is of the same species as that in which in the former instance an evidentiary document of the same or a similar species was regarded as inadmissible what then is the practical conclusion here contended for it is this viz that every article of evidence the nature of which is to operate in the character of circumstantial evidence—whether it be presented in the form of oral or of written evidence and if in the form of written evidence whether in the form of a judicial document or any other—ought equally to be admitted the judge of fact being left equally free in all these cases to form his judgment of its probative force that accordingly in those instances where as in england the function of the judge of fact is exercised by a jury the question respecting the probative force of the document in question with reference to the fact alleged to be indicated by it ought to be suffered to be submitted to them—in the same manner as the probative force of any article of circumstantial evidence exhibited to them through the medium of oral testimony circumstantial evidence at large supposing no legal cause of exclusion opposable to the testimony of the reporting witness circumstantial evidence as such is supposed to go to a jury who being simple and unlearned persons are left to judge of it in their own way without any better light for their guidance than the light of common sense but it would be beneath the dignity of the sages of the law to suffer themselves to be led by any such vulgar guidance when they judge it must be by rule and measure practice not reason is their guide to judge of the probative force of evidence is not their practice it is an operation out of the sphere of their practice and beneath it the sort of question to which they are in use to find answer is whether a piece of evidence shall be admitted or excluded between being admitted and being deemed conclusive—between a mans being heard and his exercising an absolute    command over the decision—there is in the nature of things a medium obvious enough but whatever there may be in the nature of things in their practice there is none if admitted says the lawyer to himself it is that sort of evidence that must be conclusive for who is there that shall take upon him to pronounce it otherwise not i it is not our province—it is not our practice to weigh the force of evidence not the jury for being a law document it belongs not to them to judge of it—such matters are too high for them it i considered it as conclusive—insomuch that were i to take it into consideration i should regard it as absolutely demonstrative of the fact indicated yes but could i regard it in that light no i could not what then is to be done with it done with it—why what else can be done with it than what we are so much in the habit of doing by evidence of all sorts and for any the slightest reason or no reason—shut the door against it and refuse to look at it   a single article of circumstantial evidence set out as being of itself conclusive viz of the existence of the fact indicated is an incongruity exemplified in the case where on the score of interest i e exposure to the sinister and seductive action of this or that species of motive a man is excluded from the faculty of giving testimony in the cause titius has such an interest in this cause that supposing him to swear falsely to such or such a fact and thereby commit perjury and supposing his testimony to be believed he would be a gainer by such perjury by the impulse of that motive he is prompted to commit perjury therefore if heard he would perjure himself therefore he shall not be so much as heard the exclusion is just as rational as if donnellan had been convicted of the murder on no other evidence than that of his being next in remainder to the estate if this were reason as well as law no witness ought ever to be heard in the character of a witness no man ought ever to be out of the pillory observe that though the assumption here made were always realized it would not still be sufficient to warrant the exclusion grounded on it for the strongest interest which a witness can have in being guilty of mendacity is inconsiderable in comparison with the interest by which a defendant under examination in a capital case is prompted to incur the same guilt and for this very reason the evidence which a man in this situation yields to his own prejudice is of all evidence the most satisfactory but of this more fully in its proper place §   circumstantial and direct evidence compared in respect of probative force in respect of probative force circumstantial evidence has sometimes been put into comparison with direct both being considered in the lump and on a survey thus superficial the superiority has sometimes been attributed to the one sometimes to the other a few observations for the purpose of clearing up the subject may perhaps not be misemployed possession of either affords as observed above no reason for neglecting the other but it may happen that especially in a penal case on the defendants side evidence of one of the two sorts may be supposed to be wanting or in a cause of any sort on each of the two opposite sides evidence of the one sort may stand single or predominate taking circumstantial in the largest sense so as to include all the several modifications that have here been referred to that head—it has already been observed that in no case perhaps was ever a mass of evidence formed consisting of direct evidence alone without any admixture of circumstantial more especially not in any disputed case and the rather as different portions of direct evidence will operate in support of each other thus acting each of them in the character of circumstantial direct evidence being that which affords not or at least requires not any inferences whereas circumstantial is in a manner composed throughout of inferences but circumstantial evidence is on the other hand presented oftentimes without any admixture of direct and in that pure state decisions are often grounded on it regarded in an abstract point of view—the essence of the species being considered without regard to the quantity naturally found in a state of conjunction in the several individual cases—the inferiority of circumstantial as compared with direct is out of dispute direct evidence requires no inference circumstantial evidence is composed of inferences and as already observed there is scarce an inference to which it may not happen to be fallacious strictly speaking in the case of direct evidence it is to be observed there is always indeed an inference but this inference is in every instance of the same nature—from the report made by the witness the inference that the facts contained in that report are true of circumstantial evidence by way of argument in proof of the superiority of its probative force over that of direct evidence it has been said that it cannot lie but it is only of certain modifications of circumstantial evidence that the proposition is true the evidence and the only evidence which cannot lie is that which without the intervention    of any human testimony presents itself directly to the senses of the judge in this case is real evidence and such involuntary evidence as is exhibited by the deportment of a party or an extraneous witness while undergoing the process of interrogation in this same situation is even lying testimony false responsion itself considered in respect of the inferences which on the supposition of its mendacity it affords—inferences in virtue of which its character is changed from that of direct to that of circumstantial evidence but all evidence which in its way from the source of evidence to the senses of the judge has passed through the lips or the pen of a human being is no less susceptible of that pernicious quality than direct evidence is and in this situation are all the remaining modifications of circumstantial evidence real evidence itself not excepted when by having passed through the lips or pen of a deposing witness it has sunk into the state of supposed real evidence reported but it is only in so far as it is a cause of deception and in so far as it acts with success in that character that lying is productive of effects adverse to the ends of justice and real evidence it has been seen is no less capable of acting in this character than direct personal evidence real evidence like written evidence being in the hands of a forger a source no less capable of producing deception than when passed through a mendacious mouth or pen the direct testimony of a deposing witness is thus much however is true viz that it is only here and there by accident that real evidence is capable of being fabricated or by alteration adapted to a deceptitious purpose whereas there is no case in which it may not happen to a man in the character of a deponent to stain his deposition by mendacity if he sees what to him forms an adequate inducement and is content to run the risk the features of advantage by which circumstantial evidence is in a more particular manner fitted for rendering service to the cause of truth and justice seem to be as follows—   by including in its composition a portion of circumstantial evidence the aggregate mass on either side is if mendacious the more exposed to be disproved every false allegation being liable to be disproved by any such notoriously true fact as it is incompatible with—the greater the number of such distinct false facts the more the aggregate mass of them is exposed to be disproved for it is the property of a mass of circumstantial evidence in proportion to the extent of it to bring a more and more extensive assemblage of facts under the cognizance of the judge   of that additional mass of facts thus apt to be brought upon the carpet by circumstantial evidence parts more or less considerable in number will have been brought forward by so many different deposing witnesses but the greater the number of deposing witnesses the more seldom will it happen that any such concert and that a successful one has been produced as is necessary to give effect to a plan of mendacious testimony in the execution of which in the character of deposing witnesses divers individuals are concerned thus suppose a guilty defendants reliance placed in a false mass of alibi evidence the greater the number of mendacious witnesses who depose to their having seen him at the time in question at a place at which he really was not at that time they having been themselves each of them at a different place at that time the greater the number of false depositions each of which is exposed to be disproved by true ones and so in case of evidence to character   when for giving effect to a plan of mendacious deception direct testimony is of itself and without any aid from circumstantial evidence regarded as sufficient—the principal contriver sees before him a comparatively extensive circle within which he may expect to find a mendacious witness or an assortment of mendacious witnesses sufficient to his purpose but where to the success of the plan the fabrication or destruction of an article of circumstantial evidence is necessary the extent of his field of choice may in this way find itself obstructed by obstacles not to be surmounted one thing may on this occasion have a claim to notice viz that in a great probably the greater number of instances a fact necessary to be established in disfavour    of the defendants side—a fact necessary to be established on the part of the plaintiff—belongs to that class of facts which is scarce capable of being proved to satisfaction without the aid of circumstantial evidence in this situation for example are all those facts of a psychological class the proof of which as against the defendant is necessary to his conviction and which cannot be proved by direct evidence other than that testimony of his own—that confessorial evidence—which nothing but an assured expectation of a sufficient mass of inculpative evidence from other quarters will ever prevail upon him to give criminative or otherwise inculpative consciousness—inculpative criminative intentions—to which is added in some cases the existence and influence of this or that particular sort of motive—to one or other of these heads may be referred the psychological facts proof of which one or more of them is in case of most of the offences occupying a high rank in the scale of criminality or penality regarded and that justly as indispensable but these are among the facts the existence of which no defendant who does not regard his case as rendered desperate by other evidence will ever acknowledge proof therefore whatsoever they are susceptible of if they receive they must receive from extraneous evidence and until the parable of the man with windows in his breast be realized such extraneous evidence cannot be of any other nature than that of circumstantial evidence viz under one or other of the modifications as herein above brought to view    chapter xvi of improbability and impossibility §   improbability and impossibility are names not for any qualities of the facts themselves but for our persuasion of their nonexistence impossibility and improbability are words that serve to bring to view a particular though very extensive modification of circumstantial evidence the occasion on which they are employed—the occasion at least on which under the present head i shall consider them as employed—is this—on one side a fact is deposed to by a witness on the other side the truth of it is denied—denied not on the ground of any specific cause of untrustworthiness on the part of the witness but because the fact is in its own nature impossible impossible or what in practice comes to the same thing too improbable to be believed on the strength of such testimony as is adduced in proof of it what is the nature and probative force of this modification of circumstantial evidence is there any and what criterion by which impossible facts or facts which are to such a degree improbable as to be for practical purposes equivalent to impossible ones may be distinguished from all others if any such criterion existed its use injudicature would be great indeed by the help of it a list of such impossible and quasiimpossible facts might in that case be made out—made    out by the legislator and put into the hands of the judge to know whether the probative force of the testimony in question were or were not destroyed by this modification of circumstantial disprobative evidence the judge would have nothing more to do than to look into the list and see whether the species of fact in question were to be found in it unfortunately there exists no such criterion—no possibility if the word may here be employed without selfcontradiction of making up any such list not only would one mans list contain articles which another man would not admit into his but the same article which would be found in one mans list of impossibilities would be found in another mans list of certainties from a man who sets out with this observation no such list nor any attempt to form one can of course be expected yet on the following questions some light however faint may be and will here be endeavoured to be reflected   what it is men mean when they speak of a fact as being impossible—intrinsically impossible   to what causes it is owing that one mans list of impossible facts will be so different from anothers   different modifications of impossibility different classes of facts which men in general—wellinformed men in general may be expected to concur in regarding as impossible   among facts likely to be in general considered as impossible what classes are of a nature to be adduced in evidence when upon consideration given to a supposed matter of fact a man feeling in himself a persuasion of its nonexistence comes to give expression to that persuasion—he pronounces the matter of fact according to the strength of such his persuasion either more or less improbable or impossible in and by the form of words thus employed for giving expression to that which is in truth nothing more than a psychological matter of fact the scene of which lies in and is confined to his own breast—a sort of quality is thus ascribed to the external phenomenon or supposed phenomenon viz the matter of fact or supposed matter of fact itself upon examination this quality it will be seen is purely a fictitious one a mere figment of the imagination and neither improbability and impossibility on the one hand nor their opposites probability and certainty on the other have any real place in the nature of the things themselves so far as concerns probability and improbability the fictitiousness of this group of    qualities will scarcely when once suggested appear exposed to doubt take any supposed past matter of fact whatever giving to it its situation in respect of place and time at the time in question in the place in question either it had existence or it had not there is no medium between existence and nonexistence there is no medium no other alternative by probability—by improbability—by each of these a medium is supposed—an indefinite number of alternatives is supposed at the same time the same matter of fact which to one man is probable or if such be his confidence certain is to another man improbable or if such be his confidence impossible often and often even to one and the same man at different times all this group of fictitious and mutually incompatible qualities have manifested themselves if his persuasion be felt to be of such a strength that no circumstance capable of being added to the supposed matter of fact could in his view of the matter make any addition to that strength or if on looking round for other conceivable matters of fact he fails of finding any one in relation to which his persuasion of its nonexistence could be more intense—impossible is the epithet he attaches to the supposed matter of fact—impossibility is the quality which he ascribes to it if on the other hand a circumstance presents itself by which in his view of the matter an addition might be made to the intensity of such disaffirmative persuasion or if the supposed matter of fact presents itself as one in relation to which his persuasion of its nonexistence might be more intense in such case not impossible but improbable is the epithet—not impossibility but improbability is the quality ascribed certainty which is the opposite to impossibility or rather of which impossibility is the opposite is applied to the persuasion and from thence to the supposed matter of fact it is not any more than impossibility applied or applicable to testimony as certainty so uncertainty applies itself to the persuasion and the fact and not to the testimony in the scale of persuasion it embraces all degrees except the two extremes the existence of a fact is not matter of uncertainty to me if the fact be regarded by me as impossible certainty therefore has for its opposite uncertainty in one way—impossibility in another uncertainty in the language of logicians is its contradictory opposite—impossibility its contrary opposite the fiction by which in considering the strength of a mans persuasion in relation to this or that fact and the probative force of any other matter of fact when viewed in the character of an evidentiary fact in relation to it occasion is taken to ascribe a correspondent quality indicated by some such words as certainty and probability to the principal fact itself—appears to be like so many other figments among the offspring of the affections and passions incident to human nature it is among the contrivances a man employs to force other men to entertain or appear to entertain a persuasion which he himself entertains or appears to entertain and to make a pretence or apparent justification for the pain which he would find a pleasure in inflicting on those on whom a force so applied should have failed to be productive of such its intended effect were it once to be allowed that as applied to the facts themselves which are in question probability and certainty are mere fictions and modes of speaking that all of which on any such occasion a man can be assured is his own persuasion in relation to it that that persuasion will have had for its cause some article or articles of evidence direct or circumstantial real or personal and will be the result of and in its degree and magnitude proportioned to the probative force of that evidence that of such evidence neither the probative force nor consequently the strength of his persuasion are at his command that it is not in the power of any article of evidence to have acted with any degree of probative force upon nor consequently to have given existence to any persuasion    in a mind to which it has not been applied and that therefore it is not in the power of any evidence to give either certainty or probability to any matter of fact the matter of fact being at the time in question either in existence or not in existence and neither the evidence nor the persuasion being capable of making any the slightest change in it that it depends in a considerable degree upon the mental constitutions of a and b respectively what sort of persuasion if any shall be produced in their minds by the application of any given article of evidence and that it is no more in the power of evidence applied to the mind of a and not to that of b to produce in the mind of b a persuasion of any kind than it is in the power of evidence applied to the mind of b and not of a to produce a persuasion on the mind of a—were all this to be duly considered and allowed neither the existence nor the nonexistence of a persuasion concerning a matter of fact of any sort would have the effect of presenting to any person any other person as a proper object of punishment or so much as resentment but the certainty of this or that fact is assumed as perfect and indisputable and thus he of whom it is conceived that he fails of regarding or of representing himself as regarding that same fact in such its true light is on no better foundation considered and treated as being either mendacious or perverse and obstinate perverse and obstinate if he fails of regarding it in that light—mendacious if it being impossible to him to fail of regarding it in that light he speaks of himself as if he did not when a man is himself persuaded—or though he does but under the impulse of some interest by which he is actuated appear to be or profess to be persuaded—of the existence of a fact—it is matter of pain and vexation to him to suppose that this same persuasion fails of being entertained still more to observe that it is professed not to be entertained by those with whom on the occasion of it he has to deal hence it is that in his mind and in his discourse to entertain it is made matter of merit—to fail to entertain it matter of demerit and blame on the part of others with whom he has to do and to cause them to pursue that supposed meritorious line of conduct the power of reward if within his reach is employed and to deter them from the opposite conduct even the power of punishment of both which powers in the application thus made of them mankind have been unhappily accustomed to see and to feel the exercise carried to a pitch so repugnant to the dictates of humanity and reason §   impossible facts distinguished from verbal contradictions it having been shown that improbability and impossibility applied to a matter of fact are merely terms expressing a certain strength of persuasion of the nonexistence of that fact—what remains is to show what are the grounds on which such a persuasion is liable to be entertained to show in other words in what consists the improbability or impossibility of any alleged fact previously however to entering upon this inquiry it will be necessary to discard out of the list of impossible facts articles that might be in danger of being considered as included in it these are—   contradictions in terms or as they might be termed verbal impossibilities examples two and two are not so many as four—two and two are more than four—the same thing is and is not at the same time the truth is that in these cases no matter of fact at all is asserted consequently none of which it can be said that it is impossible   inconceivable facts sometimes to this class sometimes to the former belong the opposites of a variety of propositions of a mathematical nature e g that two and two should be either more or less than equal to four that two right lines should of themselves inclose a space†  0 §   no facts universally recognised to be incredible before i enter upon the topic announced by the word incredibility a topic the consideration of which does really belong to the subject of judicial evidence it may be of use to clear the inquiry of a topic that does not belong to it viz impossibility on the former it will be at all times in the power of a reasonable man in the station of a judge to form a persuasion sufficient for his guidance on the other it will not he in the power of a reasonable man in that station to form a persuasion sufficient for his guidance in the business of judicature and of the introduction of the topic in argument nothing but perplexity and illusion can be the result in truth the degree of incredibility that can with propriety be the subject of consideration for any purpose of judicature is merely relative and comparative the object of comparison is the probative force of the evidence by which the existence of the fact considered as improbable is indicated and the question is which of the two forces ought to be deemed the greater—the probative force of the testimony by which the existence of the fact in question is indicated or the disprobative force designated or pointed to by the word incredibility as employed to express an attribute of the fact let the disprobative force of the incredibility be but ever so little greater than the probative force of the testimony by which the existence of the fact is maintained it is sufficient for the purpose of judicature the question concerning any superior degree is purely speculative not applicable to judicial practice and as such irrelevant to the business of judicature—to the question whatever it be before the court in a loose and popular sense nothing can be more frequent than the use of the word impossible and its conjugate impossibility frequent and such is the exigency of language we may venture to say necessary but if applied to the subject of judicial evidence to express an idea distinct from and if one may so say superior to that of improbability—a high degree of improbability—it then becomes productive of the confusion above spoken of the impropriety of introducing the word in this strict sense on a judicial occasion not to speak of other occasions may be rendered apparent by this consideration viz that in the use of it in this sense is involved the assumption of omniscience and infallibility on the part of him who uses it examples lending an apparent countenance to the use of it in this strict sense may i am aware not be altogether wanting but upon a closer inspection it will appear that the objects in question either do not come at all under the notion of facts or at any rate not under the notion of such facts as are capable of being made the subject of evidence take the following examples—   it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be the negative or opposite of this it may be said is a fact the incredibility of which will be recognised by everybody and so with the two following—   where there is no property there is no injustice   two and two make four answer—in the first case no fact properly speaking is concerned in that case we have a proposition but it has not any fact for the subject of it examined closely it will be found to be no more than a proposition concerning the signification of words so vague and so inapplicable to any useful purpose is the import it conveys that it is    difficult to say what it does amount to perhaps an observation relative to the use of the word not showing an occasion on which it cannot with propriety be employed no fact at all being indicated by the proposition in question no fact is indicated by it capable of forming a subject of controversy in a court of justice   the second supposed example is brought to view on account of the deserved celebrity of the author and as an instance to show how idle and nugatory may be the language of the acutest mind when dealing with propositions of an extensive import without having as yet scrutinized into their contents and applied them to particulars howsoever it may be with the preceding proposition this one may readily be seen to be neither more nor less than a proposition concerning the import of words where you cannot in the way in question employ the word property neither can you in the way in question employ the word injustice   that the proposition two and two make four is neither more nor less than a proposition concerning the import of words seems evident enough as soon as intimated to these same apples to which when taken together i apply the numeral word four—to these same bodies when divided into two parcels equal in number i apply respectively the numeral words two and two and in both cases with equal propriety and conformity to the usage of language in this then we have another instance of a proposition not enunciative of any fact—of any fact having for its subjectmatter anything other than the occasion on which the words in question have been wont in the language in question to be employed in this example then we do not see any exception to the general proposition in question viz the proposition that of facts liable to be the subject of judicial controversy there is no assignable one which all men would be sure to be agreed in speaking of as incredible—and this for the three following reasons—   the proposition in question—two and two make four—is not properly speaking the enunciation of a matter of fact—only of a manner of employing words   if that which it is an enunciation of were properly speaking a matter of fact it would not be of the number of those facts which are liable to be the subject of judicial controversy or exhibition   although it were a fact and liable to be the subject of judicial controversy or exhibition there would be no assurance that all men would be agreed in speaking of the existence of it as certain or the negation of it as incredible did any such thing exist as a catalogue of universallyacknowledged impossible or even incredible facts and these facts liable to be brought to view in judicature—the facts being arranged in alphabetical order open the dictionary the cause is at an end unfortunately so far from a collection of such facts whether any one such fact be to be found is more than i would venture willingly to determine and if forced to answer my answer i suspect would rather be in the negative if among physical facts there should be one that presented a fairer chance than another of being allowed to occupy a place in such a catalogue it should i think be this viz the existence of any body in two distinct places at the same time but this which by the greater part of mankind would i suppose be admitted into the catalogue of incredible facts is by one portion of mankind    nor that an inconsiderable one held not to be incredible without one exception and in the case to which that exception extends it is held to be not simply not incredible but certain and indisputable far be it from me to mention this deviation from the more common opinion as matter of reproach to the deviators i mention it only in proof of the discrepancy—perhaps the incurable discrepancy—of opinion that prevails among mankind and as one out of so many other considerations which concur in impressing the impropriety of precipitate exclusions and conclusions on the mind of an upright and zealous judge as to the exception in question whether in point of truth it be warranted or no it belongs not to the present subject to inquire fortunately supposing it unwarranted—so long as the proposition how paradoxical soever confines itself to the highly extraordinary case to which alone it seems to have ever hitherto been applied—no error if it be one can be more innocent to every purpose of judicature as there is nothing whatever supposing it possible that men cannot be made to do—so there is no fact whatever that men may not be made to speak of as certain or as incredible—no proposition which they may not be made to speak of as certainly true or certainly false—by interest real or imagined—by hope of pleasure or fear of pain from a source conceived rightly or erroneously to exist in the particular case in question two and two make four—this subjection of discourse as of all other modifications of human agency to interest—this consequent versatility and ununiformity of discourse has not perhaps been exemplified but in an example that stands next to it the exemplification has actually and notoriously taken place that two and two make four has perhaps never been denied but that one and one and one make three has been denied that in its application to most subjects it has been generally spoken of as true is evident enough otherwise the known usage of language and the known import of the word three could not have obtained but that there is a subject in relation to which this agreement does not obtain is in many countries matter of equal notoriety agreed as applied to apples agreed as applied to men not agreed as applied to gods i mention it not as meaning to take a part in such a controversy i mention it only as a striking proof as well as illustration that there is no fact whatever real or nominal that is out of the reach of controversy—a proposition which to the present purpose has already been shown to be of no small practical importance in vain would it be to say that the exception here is in language merely not in persuasion as a general proposition it is but too true that persuasion and language are but too often at variance but in the instance of no one individual person would i take upon special grounds that any such variance had place in this particular case granting however that on the present occasion persuasion were not conformable to language what would it signify to the present purpose it is in language and in language only that the catalogue in question the supposed catalogue of facts universally agreed to be incredible would be expressed by these same considerations it may be rendered equally apparent that if at any given moment an article were in existence fit for entering into the composition of such a catalogue the next moment might at any time expunge the article and leave the catalogue a blank neither over internal persuasion nor over exterior discourse is the power of interest less at one time than another today men are agreed that to the truth of the proposition one and one and one are equal to three there is but this one exception let human laws or opinion of divine command or any other efficient cause of interest experience an appropriate change there shall be no exception at all or any number of exceptions and so in regard to the proposition two and two make four or any other proposition of grammar mathematics or physics under the influence of interest so far is what may be termed the natural incredibility of a fact from excluding it from a place in the catalogue of credible facts and vice versâ that its tendency may be and seems to be to provide it with a place in that same catalogue and a place even in the class of certain facts for let the expectation of reward be annexed to the practice of regarding or speaking of facts naturally incredible as if they were certain and let this reward be to be obtained pure earned without sacrifice in the shape of reputation or any other shape what should hinder it from being embraced credo quia impossibile est is the oftenmentioned and natural result of the determination generated and enthusiasm lighted up by prospects of this kind for at what cheaper rate can the matter of reward be earned in any shape and so of punishment a principle of action the force of which when applied in adequate quantity is in its operation still more certain and irresistible what the influence may be beneficial or otherwise of the matter of reward or punishment so applied to the interests of morality knowledge or social harmony belongs not to the present place when of the abovementioned proposition which does belong to the present place the truth is established the inquiry is at an end    §   improbability and impossibility resolvable into disconformity to the established course of nature an incredible fact as contradistinguished from a verbal contradiction whether improbable or impossible be the epithet by which the particular strength of the belief in its nonexistence is designated owes its incredibility to one cause and to one cause only this cause admits of a variety of appellations on the part of the matter of fact deposed to by the affirmative evidence disconformity as supposed to the established course of nature thus may be expressed what seems to be the most apposite and the clearest designation of which in any such small number of words it is susceptible from the course of nature at large that of the mental part of mans nature requires to be distinguished hence disconformity in a physical respect and disconformity in a psychological respect the remarks which follow will in the first instance refer more particularly to physical as contradistinguished from psychological facts but they will for the most part be found applicable equally to both as it is only from evidence coming under one or other of the descriptions already brought to view that any notion whatever concerning the established course of nature can be derived and consequently any notion concerning what is conformable to that course so neither from any other source can any notion be derived respecting the disconformity of any supposed matter of fact to that same course the evidence thus characterized will therefore be composed of an indeterminate and indefinite multitude of matters of fact drawn from all the evidence of every description that to the mind of the person in question viz the judge have happened to present themselves during the whole course of his life and composed of all such facts as present themselves to him as bearing the sort of relation in question to the matter of fact in question to produce disbelief of the existence of the matter of fact in question this disconformity must be such as in his judgment to render its existence incompatible with a certain portion at least of those other numberless matters of fact of the existence of which he has been persuaded by the indeterminate but ample mass of evidence above indicated when the improbability that is the apparent the relative improbability of an alleged fact is set in the balance against testimony it is still at bottom little more than testimony against testimony of the facts of the existence of which a man is persuaded the knowledge the persuasion is derived partly from his own perceptions partly from the alleged perceptions of others but in the unmeasurable mass of facts which at least in a country where civilization is tolerably diffused the    most ignorant man is said to know the number of those of which his knowledge is derived from his own immediate perceptions—from his own individual experience is small in comparison with those for the knowledge or supposed knowledge of which he stands indebted to the experience or supposed experience of others concerning individual facts—so far as mere perception exclusively of inference drawn from perception by judgment is concerned—no force of exterior evidence can either increase or diminish the degree of persuasion of which such perceptions cannot but have been productive but in regard to species of facts there is not one perhaps concerning which the persuasion derived by a man from his own experience would not be capable of being overborne by allegations of contrary experience on the part of other men what makes our confidence so entire as it is in regard to the existence of those species or classes of individual facts the existence of which is announced by the phrase which exhibits as the cause of it this or that law of nature is—that so often as it falls in his way to make the trial a man finds his own perceptions in relation to them confirmed by the reputed perceptions of all other men without exception §   on the three modes of disconformity to the course of nature—viz   disconformity in toto   disconformity in degree   disconformity in specie it has been seen that in all cases without exception in which any matter of fact is supposed by any person to be incredible the ground of the supposition is a supposed disconformity between this matter of fact and what is by the person in question considered to be the established course of nature but this disconformity is of three kinds and corresponding to these three kinds of disconformity are three classes into which facts supposed to be incredible may be divided   facts disconformable in toto facts which supposing them true would be violations of some manifest and generallyrecognised law of nature e g a body at the same time in two different places   facts disconformable in degree true perhaps in every days experience in certain degrees false in the degree in which by the testimony in question they are stated as being true e g a man sixty feet high   facts disconformable in specie facts altogether different from any which have ever been observed but which if true would not be violations of any generallyrecognised law of nature e g the unicorn it is manifest that in the two last of these classes the incredibility of the fact rises only to a greater or less degree of improbability not to that of impossibility the supposed facts are not repugnant to the established course of nature they are only not conformable to it they are facts which are not yet known to exist but which for aught we know may exist though if true they would belong to the class of extraordinary facts and therefore require a greater degree of evidence to establish their truth than is necessary in the case of a fact exactly resembling the events which occur every day though facts of these two classes can never be properly said to be impossible they may be improbable to a degree little short of practical impossibility i facts disconformable in toto facts repugnant to the course of nature to give a complete list of facts impossible in toto would be to give a complete list of those general observations which have been or use to be characterized by the appellation of laws physical laws of nature to give any such complete list will i suppose be universally recognised as beyond the limits of human knowledge in its present state a complete system of physics might be considered as included in it by way of illustration i will venture to propose a few articles as a specimen of what might be the contents of such a list specimen of the laws of nature common to all matter as far as hitherto known—   no two bodies can be in the same place at the same time cases of penetration and inclusion not excepted   no one body can be in two places at the same time   all known bodies are in proportion to their quantities of matter affected by the law of gravitation   all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation except in so far as an exception to that law is created by any of the other known causes of motion or rest in other words   for each instant of time the place of every body of every particle of matter within the reach of our observation is determined by the law of gravitation modified by the other known primum mobiles or causes of motion and rest these seem to be as follows—   the centrifugal force   the force of cohesion—the attraction observed to take place amongst the homogeneous parts of the same whole   the force of chemical attraction to which perhaps may be to be added repulsion the attraction and repulsion observed to    take place amongst the contiguous heterogeneous parts of the same whole   the force of repulsion or elasticity given to the particles of other matter by caloric when being united with them it forms a gas   the force of expansion and contraction repulsion and reattraction produced by the addition and subtraction of caloric to and from other bodies in the states of solidity and liquidity   the force of electrical and galvanic attraction and repulsion   the force of magnetic attraction and repulsion   the force of muscular motion put in action by the will   the force of muscular motion put in action by the vital power in the case of the involuntary motions that take in living animals  0 the force of muscular motion put in action in the way of animal galvanism    the force of vegetation of these forces setting aside the centrifugal force the existence of which is rather matter of inference than observation the influence of gravity is so much more extensive and powerful than the rest that the observation expressive of its existence seems entitled to be distinguished by the appellation of the general or universal law of nature applicable to all bodies of which we have any sort of cognizance while the other laws of nature as above brought to view may be considered as constituting so many exceptive clauses with reference to that general law in most of these instances the force is not perceptible but in the case where the distance between the particles concerned is extremely small and accordingly in few if any can it be clearly perceived to have place beyond the limits of the planet which we occupy taking this for arguments sake as a complete list of primum mobiles and i am inclined to think it would not be found to be very far from a complete one any motion which being in a direction opposite to that of the attraction of gravitation should not be referable to any one of those particular causes of motion may be pronounced impossible the existence of any such motion on any given body upon or near any part of the earths surface for and during any given space of time an impossible fact a particular example may here help to explain the nature and probative force of impossibility—physical impossibility and that impossibility in toto—as adduced in the character of an evidentiary fact disprobative of the supposed fact supposing the existence of it averred by direct testimony in one or more of the many books formerly current on the subject of witchcraft and apparitions i remember reading the following stated as a fact in a room somewhat lofty not by any muscular exertions either of his own or of any other person other persons being however at the same time in the same room a man finds himself gradually raised up to the height of the ceiling and let down again his body all the time not being in contact with any other except those of which his apparel was composed this i would venture to give as a specimen of a sort of fact practically speaking impossible viz such an one as i could not be persuaded of the truth of not only upon the testimony of any one single witness but upon the testimony of any number of witnesses that ever found their aggregate testimony contradicted by other witnesses in any court of justice the supposed fact impossible—why impossible because it is in repugnance to the law of gravity and not in conformity to any of those particular laws which operate as so many exceptions to that general law be it so it cannot be brought under any of these particular laws but supposing these to be the only particular laws or say causes of motion as yet known—can you take it upon you to pronounce it impossible there should be any others the steamengine as a source of power is but a century and a half old the    knowledge of electricity as to the great bulk of its effects not so much as a century galvanism but of yesterday—till the other day there were but six primary planets moving round our sun now there are eleven are new primum mobiles less possible than new planets i answer—as to the discovery of new causes of action—causes apparently distinct from and not referable to any of those above enumerated—i am not disposed to regard it as in any degree improbable yet as to any causes adequate to the production of any such effect as the effect in question—in the discoveries just spoken of there is not anything that would prevent me from regarding it as being in the sense above determined practically impossible why because it appears to me practically impossible that after so long a course of physical experience and experiment any primum mobile of a force adequate to the production of an effect of such magnitude can have remained undetected as to the power of steam the application of it to any useful purpose is not so old as a century and a half but the existence of it as a source of motion could never have been altogether a secret to any one who ever boiled a pot with a cover to it ii facts disconformable in degree of facts impossible in degree meaning always    by impossible such as would generally be accounted so the exemplifications that might be given are innumerable these consist in deviations from the ordinary quantities deviations extending to such a degree as on that account to be regarded as incredible let us take those which regard the manner of being of the human species—     extent of human stature     quantity of human force     duration of human life     duration of life without food     time of gestation     number of children at a birth various are the grounds on which facts having like the above the human species for their subject present a claim to preference being more interesting than any others they are more open to observation and more likely to attract it and they are wont on a variety of occasions some of them more than others to come in question on judicial occasions in particular time of gestation and duration of life without food but most of all the former legitimacy or illegitimacy depending upon it of the six examples thus taken for the purpose of illustration two admit of deviations at both sides viz extent of stature and time of gestation in the other cases there is no room for deviation but on the side of increase the minimum being in the ordinary course of nature in relation to facts objected to as incredible in consideration of the magnitude of the degree in which they deviate from the ordinary course of nature erroneous judgment on the part of the judge seems rather more to be apprehended in disaffirmance of the supposed incredible facts than in affirmance why because in most instances of facts the credibility of which is liable to come in question in judicature the judge especially supposing him a man of a mind cultivated in a degree at all approaching to what befits a man in such a situation will naturally be more or less apprized what is the ordinary course of nature but of the known deviations—of the degrees of deviation known by men possessed of appropriate information in the line in question—it may well happen to him to be very imperfectly if at all apprized if then without having recourse to scientific evidence viz to such as applies in particular to the species of fact in question he takes upon him to decide in disaffirmance of the fact error on his part may be but too naturally the consequence take for instance the question—of what length of time passed without food the patient surviving may the existence be regarded as credible anno      at the old bailey london elizabeth canning was convicted of perjury of the mendacity of her testimony the whole evidence taken together i have not the smallest doubt but one part of it consisted in an affirmation on her part of her having passed a certain length of time almost without food in the course of the history of that cause several persons it appears regarded the extraordinariness of this supposed fact as sufficient to render it incredible this judgment i should not expect to find confirmed by the opinion of wellinformed scientific witnesses why because at different times i remember reading different accounts of the protraction of animal and in particular human life without food for much greater lengths of time—accounts that did not appear on the face of them to present any suspicious circumstances in the list of cases above exhibited there are few if any in which it might not happen in one way or other to come into question in the course of judicature and this without having recourse to wagers by means of which if legalized there is no sort of fact whatever that may not be made to call for the decision of a judge   duration of life titius is nominee in a lifeannuity or sends to put in a claim of property in a distant country the age of titius    is   0   0   0 parr is said to have passed his    st year jenkyns his    th but the judge either has never heard of the reputed age of jenkyns or of parr or disbelieves it in some periodical print an article appeared some years ago stating as still in existence a man who had passed the age of   0   duration of the time of gestation this is a question of no very unfrequent occurrence and in respect of the legitimacy of children and the honour of parents of the utmost practical importance there are wellattested instances of women whose pregnancy has continued ten eleven or even twelve months in the case of a pregnancy protracted for the term of ten months a rash judge too decided to suffer the exhibition of scientific evidence on this point might do a cruel injustice   number of children at a birth of three children born at the same time of the same mother the existence suppose has been put out of doubt by other evidence comes another person claiming property on the ground of succession and says my mother had four children at a birth and i am one of them four at a birth says the judge that i never can believe three i can believe for i have known instances of it i will not hear your evidence five at a birth i remember reading of in newspapers with individualization of names times and places   number of children born of one woman the like precipitation is capable of taking place in this case as in the last preceding one between thirty and forty i am clear that i have read of   duration of fecundity in women delivery some years after seventy i think i have read of an estate is claimed on behalf of a child whose mother it is alleged and confessed when she was delivered of him was turned of sixty no says our rash judge the fact is impossible it is needless to hear evidence but such rashness—such irrational refusal to hear evidence—is it to be supposed—alas the rashness here supposed as credible on the part of this or that individual judge is nothing in comparison to the rashness which continues to be exemplified to this day in the most enlightened countries by the whole fraternity of judges in regard to facts devious in degree it is impossible to fix upon any point of the scale as being the point which separates the incredible degree from the credible at a large distance above the ordinary or mean level to a person determined to take the distance large enough there will commonly be no difficulty but begin with the most devious degree allowed to have been exemplified—propose the next degree and then the next scarce any man that will not find himself perplexed and even in an inextricable degree to say at what degree credibility ends incredibility begins—  stature a man a hundred feet high incredible but nine feet in london nominal nine feet has been exhibited to make allowance for exaggeration say eight feet but eight feet being certain shall eight feet and an inch be incredible the credibility of eight feet and an inch being admitted add an inch more and so on without end—  force no man living who is capable of lifting upon his shoulders a fat and fullgrown ox of the largest breed few men who would not have been able to deal in that same way by that same animal when just born take any man and propose it to him or to any one else to say at what age of the animal or at what precise weight in pounds and ounces the mans power of lifting him will cease—  fecundity at a birth or total according to the legend in consequence of the imprecation of a beggar woman the countess of desmond had as many children as there are days in a year whether at one or more births i cannot take upon me to recollect a delivery of five at a birth has been mentioned with all the circumstances within these few years in the english journals taking this number for certain will six be incredible thus we get on one by one till we come to the countess of desmonds number only the more there are of them the smaller they must be a treatise on the deviations from the ordinary course of nature has been spoken of as a necessary part of an encyclopedical system by bacon in the synoptical table prefixed to the first french encyclopedia the mention of it has been revived by dalembert of a treatise on this subject the fundamental part would consist of a statement of the alleged facts in regard to such facts as are more particularly apt to come in question in a court of judicature—such above all on the belief or disbelief of which as in some of the above examples the property and honour of families may depend—might it not be of use that arrangements should be taken by governments for their authentication and registration at present the credit of facts of this description rests in general on no firmer foundation than that of a paragraph in this or that periodical publication and who can say but that it may sometimes happen that a false fact of this description shall have been inserted in the view of its being on an individual occasion employed in evidence in the character of the best and only evidence which the nature of the case admits of the paragraph may or may not be listened to by the judge but—though it should not be admitted in a direct way—in an indirect and circuitous way it may nevertheless operate in the character of evidence    the judge will at any rate not refuse to hear scientific evidence—but the opinion of the witness is drawn for from what better source can it be drawn from this or that paragraph which he has read in a newspaper with or without the faculty of recollecting the source from whence he took it iii facts disconformable in specie when on a survey of the catalogue of incredible or supposed incredible facts we come to the class of those which if incredible are so on this ground and when accordingly on this ground we set about the task of drawing the line between the credible and the incredible—we find ourselves on an ocean without a compass and that ocean without bounds by what consideration can any bounds be set to the modifications of matter—to the modifications that may have been exemplified in this place in that place or in any place take any one of the species of men spoken of as existing by pliny or mandeville—who shall say but that in some place or other at some time or other that species may have existed—who shall say that in no place whatever at no time whatever the existence of such species would be other than absolutely incredible by anatomists some of them if examined might perhaps be found to involve physiological incompatibilities but such incompatibilities will not be unapt to be too hastily assumed angels are painted by adding gooses wings—devils by adding bats wings—to an ordinarilyshaped human body judging from birds an anatomist may pronounce the use of such an appendage incompatible with such a shape yes supposing no greater quantity of muscular force capable of being exerted by a given quantity of matter than what is exerted by men or birds but what will he say of fleas at this moment i have before me a copy of the book known to antiquaries by the name of the nuremberg chronicle this work contains in a folio volume in the latin language the history and geography of the known world printed in that city in the years      and      exhibited at the same time to the corporeal as well as to the mental eye by a multitudinous series of graphical representations taken from wooden plates amongst these are cuts of twentyone devious species of men or as we should say monstrosities from pliny and other authors some of them appear to involve incompatibilities of the anatomical kind as above others have actually been exemplified—some nearly some ever strictly the cyclops eye the horns the redundant arms and hands in these instarces however the exemplification has not been known to extend beyond the individual but species are they anything but individuals multiplied in the case of the porcupine man the deviation would naturally at first be thought confined to the individual but it was found to extend to the race gulliver upon his return from lilliput consigned as he tells us to greenwich park some of the neat bulls and cows of that country till he read on to the account of this source of permanent real evidence which converted his doubts into belief i forget what bishop mentioned by swift and others was induced to regard the whole history as a fable at the leverian museum fullgrown neat cattle much about that size were to be seen in glass cases among the nurembergchronicle men are to be seen the cranes with their classical enemies the pigmies the prototypes of the lilliputians is not the incredibility of the lilliputians lessened more or less by the leverian buffaloes the relative incredibility i think beyond dispute the relative incredibility that is our propensity to regard the existence of such a race in that light but the absolute incredibility the impossibility—how can that be affected by the analogy in question or any other—the absolute incredibility supposing any determinate idea to be capable of being found to annex to the expression a discovery which to my view does not i must confess present itself as easy to make the fact being given—the incredibility of it—the relative incredibility is lessened by remoteness in respect of place the propensity to disbelieve is certainly by what cause the imagination would probably be found to bear a considerable part in the production of the effect but neither is reason without her share the more remote the country the less explored had races of cyclops of horned men of manyhanded men of pigmies existed in england could they have thus long remained undiscovered so far as this consideration operates the relative incredibility of these and other devious varieties of the human species would evidently be much less in the interior of new holland than in old england antecedently to the importation of the kangaroo and the two species of ornithorynchi suppose a paragraph in a newspaper speaking of an animal of any one of those descriptions as found in a wood in england—the first propensity would have been to regard the statement as fabulous or incorrect the next to take for granted that the animal had been imported from some distant country and had by accident got loose from remoteness in point of place analogy conducts us naturally to remoteness in point of time on this ground imagination and  0 reason act in opposite directions the imagination to diminish the incredibility meaning always the relative—reason to increase it in time as in place as the scene grows more and more remote to the minds eye it is more and more obscure ghosts devils vampires hobgoblins of all sorts may exist in darkness in the light we see clearly there are no such things reason does not in this case diminish the incredibility as in the former when the first impulse given by the imagination is resisted it seems difficult to say why in the case of an alleged fact devious in specie the incredibility of it should be lessened by this cause as far back as history supported by sources of permanent real evidence skeletons statues sculptured portraits drawings pictures or human works goes can any material difference be found between our predecessors and ourselves on the other hand so far as the incredibility of any devious fact depends upon the causes of untrustworthiness the increase which it receives from remoteness in point of time is abundantly notorious in the track of experience and civilization the further back we go the greater the proportion of incorrectness as well as mendacity the greater the ratio of fable to history till at last it is all pure fable in distant times histories melt at last into fables as in distant plains hills do into clouds it is with the infancy of the species as with the infancy of the individual dreams mix themselves with realities in effect remote times are virtually present to us in remote places the different generations of mankind at their different stages of civilization are at once present to our eyes we may view our ancestors in our antipodes in japan sorcerers are still seen riding in the clouds in negroland witchcraft is even now the most common of all crimes half a century is scarce past since hungary has been cleared of vampires yet even in time as in place experience forbids our regarding the present as cast in exactly the same mould with the remote if new holland has presented us with its kangaroos and ornithorynchi cuvier and others have presented us with their parallels in the extinct inhabitants of an antediluviar world in this line of investigation as in others errors concerning past times might in a practical work like the present pass unnoticed if the application of them confined itself to past times the misfortune is that when facts mischievous as well as fabulous have under favour of the clouds of the morning been planted in past times they are apt to be transplanted into present there to take root and yield a poisonous increase if blackstone refuses a part of his credence for it is but a part to modern witches it is because they are not old enough a few years more over their head and then his faith in them becomes entire a little while and the imagination of some successor or pupil of the departed sage may beget upon the ghost of the witch of endor a succession of modern witches and then comes the reign of terror again if not of blood for the conspicuous sufferings that have been produced by witchcraft at the foot of the fatal tree or in the water or in the fire are as nothing in comparison with the horrors which it has planted in the pillow and in the chair which but for them would have been an easy one how much better directed has been the zeal of those enlightened divines who to conquer peace for flesh and blood reflecting that the accident of being bound up with history does not give truth to fables have made war upon the sorceress and devoted to annihilation that queen of terrors has not farmer in the same generous view converted demoniacs into madmen and did not priestley to the same end and in a sense peculiar to himself wrestle with the prince of darkness nature makes her mock of those systems of tacties which human industry presents as leadingstrings to human weakness in so far as difference in specie is constituted by difference in proportion which is as much as to say difference in degree this latter division of devious facts must be confessed to coincide with the former the existence of pigmies and lilliputians being incredible is it so in the character of a fact devious in specie or devious only in degree dwarfs are devious in degree only and without difficulty why because the race being the same the difference is in the botanical sense only a variety but dwarfs it is believed may be found not above four times the height of lilliputians and much less superior in height to pigmies than inferior to ordinary men at the worst imperfect order is better than total chaos amidst so thick a darkness the faintest light is not altogether without its use further remarks by the editor after an attentive consideration of the characters by which mr bentham endeavours to distinguish his three classes from one another the reader will probably join with me in reducing these three classes to two—viz   facts repugnant to the course of nature so far as known to us and   facts merely deviating from it or to express the same meaning in more precise language   facts contrary to experience   facts not conformable to experience the discovery of a new species of animal presents a specimen of a fact not conformable to experience the discovery were such a    thing possible of an animal belonging to any of the already known species but unsusceptible of death or decay would be a fact contrary to experience this distinction was pointed out by hume but having pointed it out he knew not how to apply it and the misapplication which it seemed to me that he had made of it led me at first sight to imagine that there was no foundation for the distinction itself having however by further reflection satisfied myself of its reality i will attempt if possible to make my conception of it intelligible to the reader all that our senses tell us of the universe consists of certain phenomena with their sequences these sequences that is to say the different orders in which different phenomena succeed one another have been discovered to be invariable if they were not so—if for example that food the reception of which into the stomach was yesterday followed by health cheerfulness and strength were if taken today succeeded by weakness disease and death—the human race it is evident would have long ago become extinct those sequences then which are observed to recur constantly compose what is termed the order of nature and any one such sequence is by rather an inappropriate metapher styled a law of nature when a new discovery is made in the natural world it may be either by the disruption of an old sequence or by the discovery of a new one it may be discovered that the phenomenon a which was imagined to be in all cases followed by the phenomenon b is in certain cases not followed by it or it may be discovered that the phenomenon c is followed by a phenomenon d which till now was not known to fellow it in the former case the newlydiscovered fact is contrary to experience in the latter case it is merely not conformable to it in the first case it is repugnant to what had been imagined to be the order of nature in the second case it merely deviates from it the first time that the sensitive plant was discovered its characteristic property was a fact not conformable to experience a new sequence was discovered but no sequence was broken asunder the plant had not been known to possess this property but neither had it been known not to possess it not having been known at all but if a stone projected into the air were without any perceptible cause to remain suspended instead of falling to the ground—here would be not merely a new sequence but the disruption of an old one a phenomenon projection of a stone into the air which from past experience had been supposed to be universally followed by another phenomenon the fall of the stone is found in the case in question not to be so followed here then is a fact contrary to experience the error then as it appears to me of hume did not consist in making the distinction between facts contrary and facts not conformable to experience it consisted in imagining that although events not conformable to experience may properly be believed events contrary to experience cannot that an event is not fit to be credited which supposes the nonuniversality of a sequence previously considered to be universal is so far from being true that the most important of all discoveries in physics have been those whereby what were before imagined to be universal laws of nature have been proved to be subject to exception take mr benthams own list pp       of the exceptions to the law of gravitation suppose all these unknown the law might have been supposed universal and the exceptions when discovered would have been so many violations of it but do not these exceptions with the exceptions again to them and so on compose by far the most valuable part of physical science §   the improbability of a fact relatively to a particular individual depends upon the degree of his acquaintance with the course of nature the improbability of any alleged fact consists in its deviation from the established and as supposed unvaried and invariable course of nature of what nature—of irrational nature or rational—of the nature of things or of men—according to the nature of the alleged fact deposed to according as it is a mere physical event or a human act the result of the operation of a human mind according as the fact belongs to the one or the other class the description of the improbability will admit of correspondent differences does the fact exhibit any such deviation if yes in what degree considerable enough or not to preponderate over the force of such testimony as the case presents what in respect of the supposed fact in question is the unvaried and invariable course of nature immediately or ultimately it is from the opinion of the judge determined by the knowledge of the judge that the answer to these questions and the decision grounded on it must come it must always be borne in mind that probability and improbability are not in strictness qualities of nature they are qualities attributed to supposed natural facts in the way of fiction for the convenience of discourse—attributed to the facts themselves in consideration of the persuasion entertained    concerning them in the mind of him by whom they are spoken of in this point of view the alleged fact—is it in his view of the matter completely unconformable to the ordinary course of nature he sets it down as improbable in the highest degree or in other words as impossible is it in a less degree unconformable he sets it down as simply improbable and not altogether impossible and so downwards till the improbability presents itself as productive of no other degree of negative persuasion than what is capable of being subdued and made to give way to positive affirmation by the force of such affirmative evidence as the case affords the improbability being thus recognised to be purely relative—relative on each occasion to the idiosyncrasy of the individual by whom the fact in question is set down as improbable—it is easy to see that in this point of view the probability or improbability of the fact will depend upon the degree of relative knowledge possessed by the individual judge and thence upon the degree attainable and generally attained in the age and country and rank in respect of mental cultivation in which he is placed a fact which in paphlagonia or palestine might in the augustan age not have been too improbable to be established by testimony in the estimation of the most knowing minds of those respective countries might have presented itself as impossible to the same class of minds at rome or athens at that same time a fact which in that same age might not have been incapable of establishing itself in the character of a probable one at rome or athens even in that highest class of minds might at this time be rejected as improbable by minds of the same class in paris or london a fact which would be established by a given force of testimony without a dissentient voice in the minds of the highest class at tombuctoo and without many dissentient voices in minds of the same class in constantinople might find nothing but incredulity in minds of equal relative superiority in london or paris even in our own times and within the hearing of bow bells stockwell or cocklane might on the strength of hearsay evidence afford a temporary credence to a fact to which no force of immediate testimony would be able to afford so much as a momentary credence in st stephens chapel by the relative credibility or incredibility of a fact i understand the chance it has of being believed or disbelieved by a given person the relative incredibility as regards a particular person of an antiphysical fact—a fact amounting to a violation of a law of nature—will be in proportion to his acquaintance with the laws of nature suppose a person altogether unacquainted with the laws of nature yet not altogether unaccustomed to hold converse with mankind he would upon the credit of a bare assertion uttered by any person of his acquaintance give credit to one fact as readily as to another to the most flagrantly antiphysical fact as well as to the most common fact to a fact the most devious and extraordinary in degree or species as well as to the most ordinary fact to the existence of a ghost or a devil as well as to that of a man to the existence of a man sixty feet or no more than six inches high as well as to that of a man of six feet to the existence of a nation of cyclops with but one eye each and that in the middle of the forehead as well as to the existence of a nation with two eyes in their ordinary place in this respect all nations as well as all men are children for a time among savages not to speak of barbarians the mental state cannot be regarded but as a state to which this supposition is in a great degree applicable what is there that would not be believed in a nation in which it was generally understood—so generally as to be a position acted upon by law that guilt or innocence mendacity or veracity was to be determined by a mans walking blindfold hurt or unhurt in a maze of redhot ploughshares of a given apparently antiphysical fact the relative incredibility will be apt to increase not only with a mans acquaintance with the laws of nature but with his acquaintance with the history—the correspondent part of the history of the human mind with the observations he has had occasion to make of the extreme frequency of incorrectness and mendacity among mankind or rather of the extreme rarity of the opposite phenomena of the extreme frequency of the instances in which either the one or the other has been reduced to certainty sometimes by irreconcilable contradictions as between divers reports of the same transaction—sometimes by selfcontradiction on the part of each in the case of an apparently antiphysical fact reported by a writer or a number of writers in a distant period—to render it more credible that he should either have been a deceiver or deceived than that the fact was true it is not necessary that it should appear that he was acted upon by this or that particular cause of delusion or that he had this or that point to gain this or that specific advantage to reap from the lie all men are occasionally exposed to seduction in this way to the temptation of swerving from the truth by all sorts of motives true it is that in this case there are two suppositions to make for one that there is in the other but take each of these suppositions—what can be more probable go back to distant ages we shall find men of the very first reputation for sagacity for    insight into the human heart very imperfectly apprized to appearance at least of the causes of untrustworthiness to which extrajudicial testimony is exposed speaking of the two miraculous cures ascribed to the emperor vespasian utrumque says tacitus qui interfuere nunc quoque memorant postquam nullum mendacio pretium by persons who were privy to the two transactions both are still related now that understand by the extinction of that emperors family mendacity has no longer any reward to hope for no reward to hope for as if punishment was not a still more irresistible principle of seduction than reward as if forfeiture of reputation of reputation for veracity were no punishment by tacitus both these miracles were believed the remark could have had no other object than to communicate that persuasion to his readers unless his intention was to deceive he was himself deceived in england miracles of the same kind but prodigiously greater in number and beyond comparison better attested were believed—within these hundred years very generally believed and now perhaps anno      not by a single human being—not even by any of the multitudes that still believe in witches and apparitions it was among the attributes of the stuart dynasty to cure their subjects of the species of scrofula called the kings evil a piece of coined gold being touched by the monarch for the purpose the patient wore it thereafter by a string upon his neck for which purpose a hole was pierced in it by family inheritance i have three of these pieces still by me it was not by the vision of a god—the god serapis—that so many beneficent monarchs were determined to exercise for the benefit of their subjects this healing power it was by the experience of ages under james i the practice began or at least existed with the   th century under anne it continued for the first fourteen years of the   th—omitting the reprobate charles and the usurping william all of them monarchs of exemplary faith and piety would sovereigns such as these have lent a hand to an imposture thus it is that in many instances improbability is relative the same fact is at once probable and improbable—probable to some persons improbable to others and this without any necessary imputation on either side on the judgment of those by whom such opposite decisions are pronounced ignorance though perhaps more exposed to erroneous judgments on the side of belief is by no means unexposed to erroneous judgments on the side of disbelief† inasmuch as the analogies by which extraordinary incidents are brought within the sphere of probability are in proportion to the degree of their ignorance apt to be without the compass of their knowledge the less extensive a mans acquaintance is with the ordinary course of nature the greater is the number of those facts which by him are not seen and understood to be within the ordinary course of nature—facts which in his view of the matter belong to the predicament of extraordinary things the greater therefore is the number of those things which being to him extraordinary things are by others reported and by him as occasion presents them to his observation found and proved to be true supposed facts which besides being to him extraordinary are really out of the course of nature and not only so but actually untrue are by him neither seen nor suspected to be untrue why not because by their being extraordinary to him little cause is presented for suspecting them to be untrue for many facts which to him are extraordinary are by the general consent of those with whom he is acquainted held to be and upon trial found to be true nor by their being really out of the ordinary course of nature are they presented to him as being in a proportionable degree if in any degree improbable for with the extraordinary course of nature as distinct from the ordinary he has little or no acquaintance suppose a turk of the ordinary class of turks in point of education to have been told of the elevation of a number of persons in the air and of the aërial voyage performed by them and this by a bare statement of the fact so far as above described and without any indication given of the cause by which the elevation was produced probably enough neither disbelief nor so much as any considerable surprise would in his mind have been the result to his disposition to give credence to this or any other fact of the extraordinary class no great addition could probably remain to be made by occular demonstration whatever fact of this description could be related to him would be rendered sufficiently credible by a word whatever it be of which in english the words magic or sorcery serve for representatives    by the turks christians are considered either as being in general magicians workers of wonders or at least as abounding in magicians and by magic one thing may be done as well as another the contents of the machine by which this wonder was achieved were in fact composed of rarefied air—had this account of it been given to him would he have credited it not unlikely and so would he as likely had they been represented to him as composed of lead to a people to whom the face of nature is not visible through any other medium than that of the koran one fact is not more unconformable to the course of nature than another when an airballoon on the hydrogen gas principle performed for the first time at st petersburg an aërial voyage—certain japanese who having been shipwrecked somewhere in kamschatka had from thence been conveyed to petersburg were of the number of the spectators all the rest were wrapped up in amazement the japanese alone remained unaffected a russian noticing their unconcern and asking for the cause of it—oh said a japanese this is nothing but magic and in japan we have practitioners in magic in abundance in the longestablished empire of japan it is probable as in the longestablished and neighbouring empire of china they have jugglers whose art consists in the production of whatsoever phenomena seem most unconformable to the known course of nature in england as well as in other superiorlyinformed nations such appearances are exhibited by jugglers as it requires a better acquaintance with the course of nature than falls to the lot of the bulk of the people to distinguish from impossibilities and in china the art of juggling having been longer in use than in any european country appears by the instances given by travellers to have been carried in some particulars to a still higher degree of perfection than anywhere in europe the art of travelling in the air being referred to jugglery and considered as no more than a particular branch of that commonlypractised art all cause of wonder was at an end in the character of a faithful picture of real life the arabian nights entertainments to an arabian understanding are upon a par with other histories and if in some points they differ from histories strictly and properly so called it is only in the same respect as robinson crusoe differs from actual biography though not actually true they contain nothing but what might have been true and if in any instance they are not to be believed to be true it is only because upon a close inspection it may be found that they are not given for such the author being in the autumn of      on board a turkish vessel on a voyage from smyrna to constantinople a storm arose in the sea of marmora which made us glad to take refuge in a port on the asiatic side called kiemed where the first object we saw as soon as we could see anything was the wreck of a vessel just driven on shore within a stones throw of us there being several franks of us on board the master of the vessel through the medium of an interpreter examined us all for the purpose of knowing whether any such article as a fragment of an egyptiam mummy existed in the possession of any of us and if so whether we could favour him with a sight of it the answer having been universally in the negative—when the storm was over it was observed to us by the interpreter that our deficiency in this curious article was perhaps a fortunate circumstance for us mummy being among the implements known to be employed by christians in the practice of divers magical arts and amongst others of the art of raising storms whereupon had any such article been found in our possession it would have been matter of consideration as a means of abating the fury of the storm whether to be satisfied with throwing overboard the magical implement or to throw over the magicians along with it the theoretical principle being established on the ground of notoriety the practical inferences seemed to follow from it consistently enough if by a piece of a dead body preserved in a particular manner and introduced on board a ship a storm could be raised—what more natural than that by throwing it out of the ship the storm should be appeased the cause taken away the effect will follow moreover if upon the removal of the supposed cause the effect should not follow—if after this magical implement had been thrown overboard the storm should continue unappeased—the continuance of it would be a proof that the cause of the storm if removed in part was not removed completely it would be a sign that along with this known implement the magician was in possession of some other implement or implements not equally known but equally well adapted for the purpose of raising storms and under the difficulty of ascertaining what were the other implements by the help of which the magician might be enabled to fulfil his wicked purpose the surest course was to rid the ship of the magician himself which done his tools were they ever so numerous would do no mischief be this as it may the sagacious turk might have placed his argument on ground absolutely impregnable by calling in to his aid the principle of the scotch philosopher i have a propensity he might have said to believe    whatever i hear probable or improbable and this propensity is innate for who can tell me when it first began to show itself but being innate it is not derived from experience and being older than experience it is stronger than experience nor therefore can any argument drawn from probability or improbability stand against it for an argument drawn from probability or improbability rests on no other basis than that of experience and when experience or anything that rests upon it is encountered by the opposing pressure of the preestablished propensity which it is that must yield is manifest enough the better acquainted we are with the course the ordinary course of nature the better qualified we are of course for judging whether a given fact be conformable or unconformable to it as between credulity and incredulity belief of false facts and disbelief of true ones the former will naturally present itself as being in the greatest plenty the fruit of ignorance it certainly is so in so far as ignorance is accompanied with the consiousness of its own existence such consciousness is a natural and perhaps predominantly frequent accompaniment of ignorance but it is by no means an inseparable one much will depend upon the opportunities a man has of being witness of the proofs of a degree of knowledge superior to his own much will also depend upon the particular temper and cast of mind of individuals carrying with them the productions of european arts the voyagers that from time to time have within the two or three last centuries visited the newlydiscovered parts of this our globe have in general found the inhabitants well enough disposed to give credit to their visiters for reported wonders on the strength of the wonders presented to their eyes but this facility of credence has not been altogether without its exceptions the case of the king of siam is old enough to have been noted and commented upon by locke† when in reporting the state of things in their own country the dutchmen who visited his dominions came to speak of the frozen scenes presented by their winters—water hardened to such a degree as to bear men and waggons like dry land—a laugh of scorn was the reply and they were set down for impostors at that time of day the advances made in natural science were as yet but inconsiderable and the strangers by whom the wonder was reported were perhaps not much more than upon a par with his siamese majesty in respect of their advances in the career of science or at any rate were not provided with any ready means of displaying any proofs of their superiority in his view the fact was not conformable to the course of nature in any such state of things as his opportunities of observation had presented to his view he had therefore the same reason for disbelieving that fact as we have for disbelieving facts which by thousands and thousands that could be mentioned a european instructed or not instructed in the rudiments of physical science would at this time of day be disposed to reject as incredible at the first word in london itself that great metropolis which disputes with paris the title of metropolis of the scientific world his siamese majesty found within the compass of my own experience a not unworthy representative in the person of an english physician at that time about twenty years or thereabouts had elapsed since the publication of the first experiment by which mercury by the help of the russian ice had been exhibited in a solid state in company with the learned doctor i happened on i forget what occasion to make allusion to this experiment with an air of authority that age is not unapt to assume in its intercourse with youth be pronounced the history to be a lie and such a one as a man ought to take shame to himself for presuming to bring to view in any other character solidity liquidity and gaseosity appear now for some time to have been considered in natural philosophy as the three states of which by combination with an appropriate portion of caloric bodies in general such as we are acquainted with may be regarded as susceptible insomuch that—although instances and those pretty numerous are not wanting in which this or that modification of matter has not as yet been seen assuming or made to assume this or that one of the three states—yet its being presented though for the first time in such hitherto unknown state would no more be regarded as repugnant to any law of nature or as an instance of an incredible deviation from the ordinary course of nature than the existence of water in the state of ice or steam one of the most interesting remains of grecian antiquity is the narrative which lucian who though not the most ingenious may be set down as by far the wisest among the grecian philosophers—lucian an eyewitness has left us of the pranks played by the impostor alexander a sort of sidrophel in a higher sphere who upon the strength of a worm enclosed in an eggshell a tame real snake and the head of an artificial one set up for a prophet and prime minister of the god æsculapius had any man paid a visit to lucian and said to him yesterday i saw alexander with his serpentgod sailing in the air in a boat and mounting up to heaven    taking with him a globe of not less than thirty feet diameter—saw him and watched him till his approach to the seat of jupiter had rendered him invisible—what would have been the reception given by the philosopher to his informant probably much the same that the king of siam gave to the story of the solid water and the english physician to the lie about the solid quicksilver but suppose the next day lucian himself had been witness to the ascent of æsculapius with his favourite to his native heaven—he would either have been a convert to the godhead of the serpent and the divine mission of the prophet alexander or have borrowed some such term as magic as a cover to his obstinacy to a disbelief for which he would not have been able to have given any tolerable reasons a fact which when viewed through the medium of a mans actual stock of physical science for even the new hollanders are not without some presents itself as rendered incredible by its nonconformity to the known course of nature may if his mind be open to reasoning and passion do not shut the door be rendered credible to him by showing its conformity to this or that fact rendered for the purpose present to his observation or which though not altogether foreign to his memory had not happened to present itself in that point of view neither the frigorific saline mixtures we are acquainted with—nor ether which by the promptness of its evaporation stands in lieu of all—could at that time have been exhibited to the king of siam by his batavian visitants but a handful of nitre which being disolved in boiling water had been converted in appearance into its aqueous solvent might on its cooling have been made to exhibit to the eyes of the incredulous monarch the transformation of the liquid into that semitransparent stone which in the regions of the north affords natural bridges capable of conveying the heaviest elephants over extensive rivers or—unless in the climate of siam there be something which there does not seem likely to be to prevent the success of an experiment which in bengal is so commodiously subservient to wholesome luxury—a set of porous and shallow earthen pans with or perhaps without an artificial current of air might without any extraneous additament have sufficed for converting in any moderate quantity that could be required the fable into fact not quite so easy might have been the task of him who should have had to reconcile the facetious philosopher of greece to the evidence of his senses the favourite fluid he might have said of minerva rides triumphant and unsullied upon the element of neptune when from the summit of ida a pine is rolled down and precipitated into the waves it not only rides upon the water but communicates its buoyancy to the hands that severed it from the parent earth what the oil or the wood is to the water an air which you are not yet acquainted with but which nature prepares already in great quantities is to the air in which we move and breathe inclose this light air in a bag of sufficient size it will carry up as you see not the bag only but boats and men and gods along with it exactly as the pine when by the force of the fall it has been driven to the bottom of the lake rises by its own levity and would still rise though men and other heavy bodies were attached to it it is not that the new air is devoid of weight any more than the old air by the impulse of which vessels are drawn by design along the surface and by accident to the bottom of the waters but—the lighter air not being so obedient to the unknown power by which the effect we call weight is produced—the lighter air which were it alone would cling to the earth is drawn off from it by its more powerful antagonist carrying with it its receptacle and the burdens you see attached to it would this analogy have satisfied the scoffing philosopher or would nothing less have satisfied him than the setting up a manufacture of hydrogen gas before his eyes this would have depended upon his particular frame of mind upon the humour he happened to be in and more or less perhaps upon the state of his quarrel with the imposter whose pranks he has detailed to us in so agreeable a narrative opinions recognised at present among the enlightened classes in enlightened nations as being unsupported by fact and in opposition to those laws of nature which have been built on fact have been erected into what may be styled so many false and spurious laws of nature from these spurious laws evidence which on account of the extraordinariness of it would be deemed false by reason of the circumstantial scientific evidence opposed to it by the science of the age and country may derive and in many instances has derived but too effectual a support at no time have even the most enlightened classes been altogether exempt from the delusion spread by such spurious laws of nature the station of a judge how high soever it may rank in the scale of mental illumination has at no time been everywhere sufficient to exempt a man from false persuasions grounded on the false laws of nature above spoken of among these so unhappily prolific opinions the most conspicuous and persuasive not to say the only ones are those which have had the religious sanction for their support the persuasion generated has been produced not by any facts by which the opinion has been seen to be supported but by a persuasion of    a very different sort viz that he in whose breast the principal persuasion in question should fail of being produced would by reason of such failure be consigned to inconceivable and endless tortures if a clear line could be drawn and were actually drawn between time and time insomuch that the dominion of these spurious laws of nature were understood to be confined to time long since past the real law of nature reigning with undisputed dominion in time present and to come—the error might not in this point of view be attended with any pernicious consequences in practice but by no man has any satisfactory or so much as plausible reason been ever given why any such line should be thought capable of being drawn anywhere much less has it been shown that for any precise and satisfactory reason it should be understood to have been drawn at this or that precise point of time things being thus circumstanced—opinions enunciative of false laws of nature opinions that have received their birth at some widelydistant point of time have in times little anterior to the present been productive of judicial decisions by which much mischief has been done and a degree of alarm propagated through the community such as could not have been spread by the most atrocious crimes it has been the effect of such opinions not only to give support to the false evidence which would otherwise find itself resisted and with effect by the circumstantial scientific evidence of the age and country but even to give birth in the first instance to such false evidence in the seventeenth century urbain grandier for having employed devils to take possession of certain nuns at loudun and enable him to take possession of them for carnal purposes was roasted alive by a slow fire after having undergone other tortures of this catastrophe the immediate authors were certain corrupted magistrates and corrupted witnesses of that time but the original authors were the devils who in a distant age and country were cast into the herd of swine together with so many others who in that age and nation found in such abundance such easy entrance into the human breast in england not many years afterwards sir mathew hale a judge of even proverbial probity—a judge superior to all corruption but not superior to delusion if the belief in witchcraft be delusion—hanged an individual for witchcraft by the assistance of a jury whose delusion had probably not waited for his but at any rate was confirmed by it of this catastrophe the immediate authors were the judge and jury and the either corrupted or deluded witnesses of that place and time but the original author was the witch of endor and those predecessors of hers in the same profession for whose punishment a law had been inserted into the mosaic code the general evidence applied by scientific information to the direct evidence of particular extraordinary facts is not always necessarily and without exception though it is most apt to be on the negative side in opposition to such direct evidence direct evidence the truth of which is rendered suspicious by this circumstance—viz that the fact reported by it would if true be a violation of some acknowledged law of nature—may be exempted from suspicion by showing that it is in conformity to some other less extensive law of nature which operates as it were as an exception to that which is more extensive by magnetism by electricity by chemical attraction by galvanism by expansion and contraction produced by the action of caloric on bodies in their several states of solidity liquidity and gaseosity motions are produced in a direction opposite to that in which the body in question is drawn by the more extensive law of gravitation of the attraction of gravity some sort of conception must have been entertained in every the rudest age but in the ancient world even in its most enlightened period the conception entertained of this universal property of all matter was but imperfect and was not expressed by any sufficiently comprehensive name of the other laws which as just mentioned stand as it were as so many exceptions to that more general law scarce any conception was in those days entertained of the laws of magnetic in particular and electrical and galvanic motion none whatever in the museum at oxford may be seen or at least might once be seen a natural magnet by which a mass of iron weighing   00 lbs is or was kept suspended at the lectures there delivered on natural philosophy might at the same time be seen an exhibition which i suppose is commonly enough repeated in other such lectures—a plate of gold kept suspended for some moments in a state of absolute rest by the antagonising forces of gravitation and electricity of late in presence of numerous companies different parts of a dead body have received from the so recently discovered power of galvanism motions opposing and overpowering the action of gravity in our own times and country scarce a journeyman or a milliners apprentice in a country town to whom these particular and recentlydiscovered laws of nature are altogether unknown even to these inferior ranks a fact of any of the classes above exemplified would therefore at present be as far from appearing improbable as the fact of a stones falling to the ground after being    dropt or projected from the hand by a person now sitting in the station of a judge even though he were selected from no higher rank in the scale of illumination these facts would any of them be received upon any the slightest evidence in the age of lucian had lucian sat as judge and any of these facts been exhibited to him in evidence without any previous explanation—lucian notwithstanding all his knowledge and sagacity or rather by reason of that very knowledge and sagacity could never have failed to reject it as incredible facts then which were true have been rejected and with reason rejected as improbable when a fact presents itself as improbable does this experience afford any reason for crediting it as if it were true nothing like it disbelieving improbable things we shall deceive ourselves once believing them we shall deceive ourselves nine hundred and ninetynine times deceived we shall be not unfrequently do what we can all that is left for us to aim at is so to order our judgment that the number of instances in which we are deceived shall be as small as possible of eleven witnesses exhibited before a court of justice and possessing as far as appears equal title to credit ten may perjure themselves and the remaining one may speak truth in this case if the judge gives credit to the ten witnesses misdecision will be the consequence but does it therefore follow that cæteris paribus ten witnesses are not to be believed in preference to one in practice no difficulty is found in believing one fact and disbelieving at the same time another though both of them standing on the ground of the same evidence propensity leads to such distinctions judgment reports the reasonableness of them in the nuremberg chronicle two facts are reported in the same breath one that of the armies fighting in the atmosphere to which at present no wellinformed mind will afford—the other that of the stones falling from the same region to which none will refuse—its belief why this difference the reason is obvious and convincing the fact disbelieved is a fact unconformable to the known course of nature and to such a degree unconformable that the better a man is acquainted with the ordinary course of nature and the more close the attention which in this view he pays to it the more strongly he will be persuaded that the reporter or reporters be they who they may were either deceived or deceivers rather than that such a fact should have been true the fact believed is a fact conformable to the course of nature in former times not known to be so but of late years ascertained to be so by a multitude of examples many of which have undergone the most attentive and most scientific scrutiny §   improbability is a particular case of counterevidence the case of improbability or impossibility on the part of the fact the existence of which is asserted by the testimony delivered in the first instance will when closely looked into be seen to coincide with the case of counterevidence improbability is constituted by a mass of evidence of a mixed and in a considerable degree subtle and recondite nature—an article of circumstantial evidence deduced in the way of inference out of an immense mass of direct evidence improbability or impossibility consists it has been seen in the inference deduced from a supposed disconformity more or less wide on the part of the affirmed fact in question as compared with the ordinary and known course of nature the direct evidence from which this inference of the nonexistence of the affirmed fact is deduced is composed of the several supposed reports or relations added to the several supposed perceptions of the deposing witness himself whereby the existence of the several supposed analogous facts of which the course of nature in this behalf is composed has been supposed to be affirmed operating thus in the way of counterevidence with relation to the fact affirmed this immense and in a manner infinite mass of direct evidence may for distinctions sake be termed general counterevidence the other evidence antecedently designated by the appellation of counterevidence being at the same time named special counterevidence certain facts are considered as disaffirmed certain negative facts in infinite multitude are considered as affirmed by the perceptions and reports extrajudicial reports indeed of mankind in general without any known exception and from all these facts put together in the character of evidentiary facts the nonexistence of the individual fact in question in the character of principal fact is inferred thus supposing down to the time in question say the year      the greatest length    of way known within the bounds of the country called england to have been travelled by any one man in the compass of twentyfour hours to have been   0 miles—the existence of a man in a spot  00 miles distant from the spot in which the act in question is known to have been committed and that within twentyfour hours of the time at which it is known to have been committed will be sufficient to render the fact of his having been the person who committed it to a certain degree improbable of all the instances of dispatch on journeys that ever came within my observation here we have perception and of all that i ever heard of here we have an indefinite mass of evidence extrajudicially indeed not judicially delivered evidence none ever exceeded   0 miles within the twentyfour hours here if the witnesses are to be believed we have a rate of dispatch equal to  00 miles in twentyfour hours the supposed fact thus affirmed is therefore out of the ordinary and known course of nature and so widely distant from it as to be improbable and so great is the improbability that notwithstanding the affirmative testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution the fact of their being either mendacious or under a mistake seems the less improbable fact of the two my decision therefore is that the criminal act charged upon this man was not committed by him—such in the case in question if developed at length would be the language of the judge under english law the jury by whom in the case in question the fact affirmed by the firstdelivered evidence was on the ground of its improbability disbelieved to illustrate the nature and effect of improbability in the character of an article of circumstantial evidence opposed to and adduced in disaffirmance of the existence of the fact which howsoever affirmed by testimony is thus charged with being improbable—i will bring to view three examples the case of water brought by cold into the state of ice the case of airballoons and the case of stones falling upon the earth from immeasurable heights in the atmosphere a circumstance by which these examples are rendered all of them the more instructive is that in every one of these instances the fact that was or might have been rationally and properly objected to as improbable was nevertheless and is now universally acknowledged to be true the case of the water and the ice as reported by locke has already been brought to view† in siam water is never in that state the position of the country is in the torrid zone and there is no elevation in it anywhere of sufficient height to produce the degree of cold necessary to surmount in that respect the effect of exposure to the suns heat admitted to the presence of the monarch of that country an ambassador from holland in describing the state of things in his own incidentally found occasion to speak of ice—of water reduced to that state in masses of such thickness as to bear men and carriages at this point of the narrative he was stopped what you have been saying till now said his majesty may be true but by this i am satisfied you are false water turned into stone was ever any such thing or anything like it seen or heard of the monarch was perfectly in the right water turned into stone he had never either seen or heard of liars be had seen as many as he had seen men to him the supposed fact was altogether unconformable to the course of nature much more so than any instance of mendacity to us it is altogether conformable in his eyes it opposed an insuperable bar to the probative force of the testimony in ours it would have opposed none was he then in his situation condemned to give everlasting discredit to facts thus indubitably true by no means supposing his understanding powerful enough to comprehend the force of analogy the conversion of water from a liquid to a solid state by the abstraction of heat might have been shown to be conformable to facts in abundance that either already had been or easily might have been brought within the reach of his own experience—of his own perceptions when an asserted fact is disbelieved as improbable—the ground of its rejection the efficient cause of the persuasion by which the existence of it is disaffirmed is the notion of its being unconformable to the ordinary course of nature show that there is no such disconformity the improbability is removed altogether show that the disconformity is not so wide as it had appeared to be the improbability is diminished the diminution is more or less considerable according as the  00 analogous facts brought to view to show the conformity are more or less numerous and in the instance of each the analogy more or less close in the eyes of the king of siam the improbability of the conversion of water from a liquid into a solid might have been diminished by indicating to him the case of metallic substances in the furnace of the founder the gold with which your palace is decorated is in a state of liquidity like that of the water in which your barges float when being removed from the fire it becomes comparatively cold it resumes then a state of solidity like that which during one part of the year water resumes so regularly in our canals by this one example the improbability might in the monarchs eyes at any rate have been lessened as to the degree in which it would have been lessened that would have depended on the cast of his mind and his opportunities of information the improbability might have been still further diminished had the medical chest of the ambassadors physician happened to be furnished with a corresponding pair of those saline substances which being separately dissolved in water present each of them the appearance of water but immediately on being mixed together constitute a solid and to all appearance a stony mass the redundant water of the one being absorbed in crystallization by the other—supposing always that while the chest of the medical man supplied the substances themselves his mind furnished him at that early period with the knowledge of the properties which on this occasion required to be displayed in the case of the airballoons no particular instance in which for any length of time the fact of their ascension found any person to disbelieve it ever happened to fall within my knowledge the unbelievers if any were from the first more likely to be found among the uninitiated than among the initiated in the physical branch of science the rarefaction and levity which is the longknown result of increase of temperature—this added to the known possibility of abstracting from an inclosed space the whole weight of the air that would have been contained in it were sufficient to reduce very much if not to remove altogether the improbability of the fact in the first instance the discovery of a gas which under an elasticity and power of resistance equal to that of common air possessed no more than from a tenth to a fifteenth part of its weight brought it not long after within that class of facts which oppose not in any degree the objection of improbability to the testimony of him by whom they are related as having fallen within the compass of his perceptions the case of the stones that of late years have in so many wellattested instances been stated to have fallen in different parts of the world from the sky upon the earth at too great a distance from the nearest volcano to have had any such earthly seat of explosions for their source brings to my own recollection the feelings which at different times reports to that effect presented to my mind the nuremberg chronicle was the first source of information by which a fact or supposed fact of this kind was presented to my notice among the wonders exhibited by graphical representation in this work is a shower of stones which on a day therein recorded is mentioned as having fallen upon the earths surface† on a glance bestowed which was all that seemed worth bestowing on the point in question with the few words that served for the explanation of it the stones were set down in my own mind as having being the missiles employed by the combatants in one of those pairs of armies whose combats in the air used at that time of day to be so frequent‡  0  a general recollection remains with me of having read many years ago in one of the london newspapers a paragraph stating a stone or a number of stones to have fallen from the clouds in england at some place remote from the metropolis i think it was in yorkshire this was the first instance that had met my observation of an occurrence of this kind related as having taken place at a point of time near to that of its publication a statement published in a london newspaper with mention of time and place exposed thereby to immediate scrutiny and contradiction presented a very different claim to attention from any that could be presented by the production of a barbarous age in which facts possibly true and facts unquestionably false were intermixed in every page is it true this story—or is it not is the question i remember putting to myself that it is altogether false was the answer is more than i could take upon myself to pronounce with full assurance my acquaintance with the several branches of science concerned is not such as to afford sufficient warrant for any such peremptory conclusion but within the time of scientific scrutiny this is the first report of the kind that ever met my observation whereas in the periodical publications of the day statements more or less erroneous occur every day and erroneous reports relative to facts lying within the division of physical science are not unfrequent if therefore i were obliged to lay a wager with liberty to choose my side it would be on the negative side and on that side i should be content to lay considerable odds by the comparative degree of intelligence prevailing in modern times the range of the species of evidence here in question has been considerably reduced the question now is—not whether upon the credit of this or that article of human testimony the existence of a fact confessedly out of the ordinary course of nature shall be believed—but rather whether of the fact said to exist the existence would be out of or what comes to the same thing repugnant to the ordinary course of nature when credit was given to the existence of witchcraft sorcerers and ghosts and judicial decisions were grounded on evidence attesting or supposing the existence of such facts the question concerning the intrinsic probability of such facts was a question of great frequency and of the highest practical importance in those times of terror women were punished and always with death for acts of witchcraft men for acts of sorcery human creatures of both sexes for being possessed or causing others to be possessed by devils all were punished or might have been punished for all sorts of crimes on the supposed evidence of ghosts†  0  if ever it should happen that a man should be in danger of suffering punishment or injustice in any other shape on the credit of any such supposition it would then be necessary to enter into a serious comparison of the two counterforces the improbability of the alleged supernatural fact on the one hand on the other hand the probative force of the testimony on which the probability of the existence of these supernatural facts rested happily in the present state of the public mind this danger does not present itself as being seriously formidable on the last occasion on which the notion of a ghost presented itself upon the judicial stage his existence was not brought to view in the character of a subjectmatter of proof or argument but his nonexistence i should have said her nonexistence—for it was a female ghost was assumed and the assertors of it considered as having by the assumption of that character subjected themselves to legal punishment at present the prevailing impression seems to be that no fact of a nature confessedly supernatural is to be believed on the credit of human testimony or at any rate of any such mass of human testimony as hath ever found itself outweighed by a preponderant mass of countertestimony composed to wit of an assemblage of witnesses superior in number and value taken together in any court of justice while this mode of thinking if i am correct in considering it as prevalent continues in force—as often as the topic of impossibility or improbability approaching to impossibility is introduced the question will be—supposing for arguments sake the existence of the alleged fact would it be a supernatural one or in other words a violation of any known law of nature if it would it is admitted on all hands that the fact that is the allegation whereby the existence of it is asserted is not true but my proposition is that however extraordinary it may appear it does not import the violation of any law of nature there is nothing therefore to prevent it from being believed on the credit of special human testimony and in particular of such testimony as on my side has been adduced such at this time of day is the language of the party on whose side an article of testimony has been adduced the probative force of which is on the other side encountered by the objection grounded on the intrinsic improbability of the alleged fact the same progress of intelligence by which the mind of the judge is rendered better able to defend itself against any deceptions that might be attempted to be put upon it by false evidence brought forward in support of impossible or improbable facts operates as a bar to prevent the bringing forward of such facts and preserves his judicial faculties from being exposed to the attempt numerous as are the instances in which the discernment of the judge is put to the trial by false evidence by evidence of false facts—facts which to the stain of falsehood add the characters of physical improbability are seldom found of the number it is not at present as in the days of magic and witchcraft when the extraordinariness of the fact so it did but derive its characters from that source would instead of diminishing serve but to increase its chance of being believed false witnesses in the planning of their tales of falsehood take care to render them not unconformable in any respect but on the contrary in all respects as conformable as possible to what is understood to be the ordinary course of nature when all is done that can be done to varnish the false tale is the taint of improbability still visible in it—the counterevidence opposed to it is little in danger of operating with less than its due weight the reign of religious impostures i mean impostures grounding their prospects of success on notions derived from religion seems throughout the field of scientific civilization or which happens to be the same thing of christendom pretty well at an end judges are nowhere prepared to give credence to them and this being understood suitors are as little prepared to hazard them when in the last century the cocklane ghost afforded entertainment to an english court of justice it did not present itself spontaneously—it was dragged into the light of day by persons who called down the hand of avenging justice upon the lying ape that gave it birth §   an objection answered on a loose and hasty survey the case of impossibility or improbability—of intrinsic impossibility or improbability on the part of the supposed fact in question—might be apt to present itself in a different point of view from that in which it has been above exhibited in a point of view in which the objection to the fact might be apt to appear not to belong to the head of circumstantial evidence but to be constituted by a body of distinct evidence brought forward on the other side this conception is accordingly in a manner implied in the import of the term  0  intrinsic applied as above it may seem implied in the words impossibility and improbability even when taken by themselves impossibility it may be said is a property that may with propriety be ascribed to the fact itself look at it by itself—every one sees it at first glance to be impossible look at it in this point of view you see it by itself what you do see is the single fact in question but seeing this what other facts do you see what other facts do you look for what other facts have you need to look for absolutely none this view of the matter is what seems likely enough to be entertained it being presented to the mind and in a manner warranted by the turn of the language which on the occasion in question is commonly employed upon closer examination however the propriety of it will vanish it will be seen that the nature of the case indispensably requires that other facts should be taken into the account in which case such other facts not being brought forward by any direct testimony or other evidence cannot but come under the head of circumstantial evidence take one of the vulgar cases of witchcraft—at present in civilized countries a ludicrous one—in most christian countries not very long ago in some parts of some such countries perhaps even now but too serious a one an old man or to take the more common case an old woman travelling at pleasure with prodigious velocity and in every direction through the air without any assistance at all for the journey or none better than what may be supposed to be afforded by a broomstick—do you believe it no why because it is impossible it is a fact in itself impossible are you in your senses you will say so too would you have us go out of the subject call in other facts and attempt to reason about it the very attempt to reason would be an irrational one the firmness of my persuasion on the subject can hardly be exceeded by any that could be entertained by a person who speaking of it should employ such language as is above but as to the source of that persuasion upon examining it i do not find it quite so simple were a fact of the description in question to be reported to me i should regard it as not true for what reasons because not to look out for any mere repugnancies it stands in contradiction for example to two physical laws one is that no body ever changes its place without some specific cause of motion another is that even when exposed to the action of any such specific cause of motion no body suffers any such change of place unless the force of such specific cause be in a degree sufficient to overcome the impediment opposed by the attraction of gravity such are the two laws in question but in alleging as i do for shortness the existence of these two ideal and as they might be termed verbal laws what is it that i allege in substance in truth nothing more in either case than an assemblage though that an immensely multitudinous one of facts agreeing with each other in a certain point of view—with which facts the extraordinary phenomenon in question is seen to be unconformable all bodies that i know anything of tend towards the centre of the earth by what consideration is it that i am led to form a proposition so general and exclusive by these which follow every motion i make or experience every minute of time i sit or stand without any considerable motion every motion i feel or see on the part of other bodies concurs in giving me a confirmation of the truth of it so far as depends upon the evidence of my own senses do i apply for further information to the presumed experience and observation—to the actual relation and declaration of other individuals my fellowcreatures—the information runs constantly and without any the least exception in the same strain oral evidence and written evidence—men and books—books touching on this particular subject directly and professedly—books touching on it incidentally and collaterally—all concur in giving evidence on the same side all this body of information all this immense and continually accumulating body of information may at any time so far as it were worth while to pursue the thread of analysis be resolved into so many distinct articles of evidence ranged under the heads of distinction already exhibited in this work after all what does it amount to not any direct evidence disaffirming the existence of the supposed magic journey what then so many articles of circumstantial evidence neither more nor less but this circumstantial evidence this supposed disaffirming evidence it may again be asked—how does it disprove the truth of the supposed affirmative evidence in no other individual instance was motion ever produced without a distinct assignable cause referable to some one or other of the enumerated heads—in no other individual instance was the force of gravity ever overcome by a force less considerable than its own to come to the point at once in no other individual instance was an old woman ever carried through the air either without any assisting instrument or with an instrument of no greater degree of appropriate efficacy than a broomstick by the exertions either of her own volition or by the exertions of the volition of any other being such for example as a devil applying itself to her bodily faculties for that purpose  0  but from the nonexistence of any such extraordinarily produced motions in those instances numerous as they are how does it follow that no such motions have been produced in this instance in none of those instances has there been any direct evidence affirming the existence of such extraordinarily produced motions but in this instance such affirmative evidence does exist continue then to disbelieve the existence of such extraordinarily produced motions in those several instances but think not from their nonexistence in those instances to prove their nonexistence much less their impossibility in this think not that because their existence is not to be believed without evidence therefore their existence can be reasonably disbelieved against evidence i should not expect to find in the person of any reader of these pages an individual in whose mind a persuasion of the existence of any such aërial journey would by the above train of reasoning be produced on the other hand neither do i see how it is possible to contest the truth of it so far as concerns the position it rests upon—to wit that all the argument that is adduced or can be adduced in disproof of such supposed fact amounts to no more than this observation viz the want of consistency conformity agreement analogy take what word we will it makes no difference between this extraordinary supposed fact and the other ordinary facts above brought to view of the truth of which we have been sufficiently persuaded by direct evidence yet upon no stronger nor other ground than this disconformity we scruple not to disbelieve such extraordinary facts and that with so firm a degree of persuasion as without difficulty and almost without thought to pronounce them to be impossible so far so good but this propensity in our minds does it alter does it influence in any respect the nature of the facts themselves by disbelieving the existence past present or future of any fact whatsoever is it in our power to destroy to annihilate its existence to cause a fact never to have existed for example that in truth has existed unquestionably not most certainly not any influence on the existence of the facts themselves can be exercised by the opinion such beings as we entertain of their existence yet after all when we come to inquire what is the nature of the effects which any such disconformity or rather our observation of the existence of such disconformity which is all we have of it is capable of producing—the answer is a disposition on our part to disbelieve the existence of the supposed extraordinary fact a tendency in our own minds not any tendency in the facts themselves thus much indeed may be added viz that so often as a man in his proceedings assumes the falsity of such facts so often will he in that respect act rationally and find his conclusions warranted by experience so often as he assumes the truth of them and acts upon that foundation so often will he find himself deceived—completely and deplorably deceived this argument after all will upon a strict scrutiny appear to amount to nothing to be in appearance perhaps a distinct and additional argument but in truth so much of it as is true no more than the same represented over again in another point of view as to everything that is to come—as to all supposed future results—it is mere surmise mere opinion without facts without evidence a mere assumption of the matter in dispute as to all past results it amounts to no more than the already alleged and admitted disconformity served up only in another shape what then is the true reply to the argument in question supposing it adduced by a believer in witchcraft—adduced for the purpose of weakening our confidence in the proof afforded by the disconformity in question of the nonexistence of that practice it is this—viz that whatever argument is capable of being brought forward for the purpose of weakening our confidence in the argument indicative of the nonexistence of that practice applies in like manner but with much greater force to every argument that can be brought forward in favour of its existence the travelling of old women with or without broomsticks through the air is that sort of event which even you who affirm the existence of it in this or that particular instance admit not to be a common one but the existence of persons who by any one of a great variety of motives are impelled and eventually compelled to exhibit relations of facts ordinary as well as extraordinary which on examination prove not to be true is a fact unhappily but too often verified the action of old women in the character of witches is a fact which according to your own statement has happened but now and then at this or that particular time and place but the action of men and women old and young with brooms and without in the character of liars is that sort of event which has been happening at all times and in all places of which we have any account this is so true that a wager for though a wager is no direct proof of any fact which is the subject of it it is however a proof of the real confidence of him who joins in it and a punishment for rash confidence on the part of him who loses it in the character of an argument ad hominem at least a wager on this subject might be brought forward not altogether without congruity show witches on your part while i on my part show liars for the space of a term in westminister hall at so  0  many guineas ahead and see whose purse will be fullest at the end of it when i have to choose between believing a common and believing an uncommon event i believe the former in preference to the latter why because in the very words which i make use of it is implied that the event called common has hitherto been of more frequent occurrence than the event called uncommon and to suppose that having been hitherto more frequent it will continue to be so is only to believe what all experience testifies that the course of nature is uniform the conclusion seems to be that in support of a persuasion of the impossibility of any fact the best and utmost proof which the nature of the case admits of is the indication of its disconformity with some class of facts indicated by those propositions which for the convenience of discourse have been received under the appellation of laws of nature and that such proof so given of such disconformity may with propriety be referred to the head of circumstantial evidence certainty absolute certainty is a satisfaction which on every ground of inquiry we are continually grasping at but which the inexorable nature of things has placed for ever out of our reach practical certainty a degree of assurance sufficient for practice is a blessing the attainment of which as often as it lies in our way to attain it may be sufficient to console us under the want of any such superfluous and unattainable acquisitions §   untrustworthiness of the evidence by which facts disconformable to the course of nature have been attempted to be proved the accreditation of antiphysical or supernatural facts is by no means a matter of indifference to justice—even of facts which with relation to the fact upon the carpet have no other circumstance in common than their being on the supposition of their truth supernatural facts every such fact if admitted for true opens the door for the admission of every other it establishes the precedent it establishes this generally applicable proposition viz that repugnancy to the obvious laws of nature is no bar to credibility give credit to any one instance of witchcraft—with what consistency or reason can you on the mere ground of natural incredibility refuse to give credit to any other such being the tendency of credit given to supernatural facts—such the mischievous influence of supernatural facts in themselves indifferent and innoxious—it may be not unuseful to bring to view such considerations as tend to diminish the credibility of antiphysical facts in the lump i no fact of this class was ever established by that sort of evidence which under the best system of procedure in respect to evidence is considered as the best evidence extracted in the best manner and which though termed the best sort is not to be considered as an extraordinary sort but the sort which is ordinarily required and obtained in ordinary cases ii accordingly antiphysical facts are seldom represented anywhere—never in the face of justice—as having manifested themselves in the presence of divers persons at the same time in the instance of ghosts and apparitions this has already been matter of general observation why so   a persuasion of this sort has in many instances been sincere—the consequence of delusion in the instance of a celebrated author of berlin to whom we are indebted for a most curious and instructive account of his own case the appearance was the result of bodily indisposition and the unreality of the existence of a correspondent external object known by the patient at the time the apparition appears not to two persons at once why because two persons are not subject to the same indisposition bodily or mental manifesting itself in the same manner at the same time   where the reported perception has not had delusion but selfconscious mendacity for its cause it has never happened that two persons have concurred in the utterance of such report on any judicial† or solemn—though extrajudicial occasion why because of the extreme and manifest difficulty of carrying through any such plan of imposition with success subjected to examination they could not hope to escape contradicting themselves as well as one another accordingly when a man embarks in a plan of this kind he chooses the company and the occasion and takes care not to expose his tale to contradiction designed or undesigned from a confederate iii the antiphysical facts thus reported are never of the permanent but always of the evanescent kind why because were they of the permanent kind the production of the object constituting the material source of the real evidence would of course be called for nor could credence be expected unless it were produced this case when looked nearly into is found resolvable into the preceding one why because supposing the source of evidence produced and the evidence extracted from it under the eye of the judge the antiphysical fact manifests itself in the presence of divers persons at once if in any instance the exhibition of the antiphysical fact in the presence of divers persons has been undertaken or attempted it has been in the way of legerdemain and imposture  0  what then is legerdemain it is the apparent violation of some law or laws of nature the circumstances which if known would show that no such violation existed being concealed upon this view of the matter it should seem that those who maintain in the character of a universal proposition the nonexistence of such physical facts as above described may safely and even consistently admit their existence in the event of their being deposed to by a considerable number of unexceptionable witnesses some or all of them of good character their testimony being extracted by a judicial examination conducted with competent ability in the best mode that the evidence should be extracted in the best mode is a condition altogether essential for if you will accept of a bad mode—of a mode which english judges knowing the best and the value of the best accept of not only in preference but to the exclusion of the best—you may prove witchcraft in the manner in which witchcraft has been proved and conclusively to the destruction of the defendant in any quantity you please in the closet of a judge or other person having mercy or destruction in his power you may transform old women into witches by confession in any number that you please and by taking upon yourself the wording of the confession leaving nothing to do to the witch besides the signing with her mark you save her so much trouble of course you will not in this case fall into any such inconsistency as that of calling for the personal evidence to be corroborated as in other cases by real evidence that is of the permanent kind as above §  0 motives tending to produce affirmation of and belief in facts disconformable to the course of nature in the case of a fact in regard to which its apparent antiphysicality its apparent incompatibility with the laws of nature operates as a disprobative circumstance—the probative force of the evidence on the other side—the probative force of the testimony deposing in affirmance of the fact—is on various occasions apt to be subjected to diminution from the same cause in determining whether any degree of credence ought to be given to an apparently antiphysical fact regard must be had not only to the circumstantial evidence afforded by its apparent antiphysicality but also to the probability of seductive motives acting upon the witnesses by whom the fact is affirmed various are the occasions on which by the inordinate and seductive influence of this or that species of motive men are led to represent as true facts which if they were true would be antiphysical but which are not true various are the classes of antiphysical facts to the truth of which men are on those occasions led to depose coupling together the nature of the fact and the nature of the occasion i proceed to bring to view some of the principal instances in which this cause of deception has been observed to operate in all these several cases it may be of use here to premise that the seductive power of the species of motive in question applying as it were to two different quarters of the mind at once the understanding and the will operates upon it with a double influence what is not true it prompts a man to regard as true and what is neither true nor so much as by him regarded as being so it prompts him to report as if it were true i facts promising wealth transmutation of less valuable metals into gold seductive motive in the character of a cause of delusion applying to the understanding of the person addressed—the person to whom the report is made—the love of the matter of wealth seductive motive applying to the understanding of the original reporter the supposed operator in case of delusion simple incorrectness without mendacity—the same also the pleasure of curiosity the pleasure of reputation and of the power attending it seductive motive applying in case of mendacity to the will—love of the matter of wealth viz the wealth to be gained by the sale of the false secret transmutation of a less valuable metal into gold is in itself neither more nor less credible—a fact neither more nor less antiphysical nor devious in specie—than transmutation of gold into a less valuable metal yet the probative force of a testimony asserting the transmutation of another metal into gold would be less than that of a testimony asserting the reverse why because the aggregate force of the seductive motives above mentioned is so much greater in the latter case than in the former in the latter case the most powerful of all the desire of wealth does not apply ii cure of diseases by supposed inadequate means seductive motives applying in the character of a cause of delusion to the understanding of the person addressed—aversion  0  to the pains of sickness love of life seductive motive applying in the case of delusion to the understanding of the original reporter the supposed operator—the same as in the case of the transmutation of metals seductive motive applying in the case of mendacity to his will—the same as in the case of delusion in this case the fact of the cure of the disease in question by the operation of the supposed remedy in question is one of seven contending facts of all which the comparative probability requires to be weighed   no real or at least such disease the symptoms really existing but the result of the imagination   no real disease the symptoms mendaciously reported   the disease cured but by the mere influence of the imagination not by the operation of the supposed remedy—or by some other remedy   the disease gone off of itself cured without the assistance of the imagination by the unknown healing power of nature or by the cessation of the action of the morbific cause   the disease not completely cured i e not ultimately cured but the symptoms mollified or removed for a time viz by either of the two preceding causes nos   and     the disease not cured in any degree the cessation of the symptoms being falsely reported whether through delusion or mendacity and whether on the part of the patient or of the medical practitioner   or lastly the disease cured and by the operation of the supposed remedy of the delusive influence of the imagination exemplifications may be found in the choice made formerly of medicines gold it was thought must be a sovereign remedy and all the efforts of industry were employed to make it potable a remedy for diseases why because it was so valuable—because it was so rare diamonds are still more valuable happily they were never employed for the cure of diseases partly perhaps because they were so much more difficult to come at than gold partly because there was no hope of rendering them potable iii facts promising happiness threatening unhappiness both in the extreme the fact in question spoken of as evidentiary of a commission given by a supernatural being to a man to issue commands to any or all other men those commands converted into laws by threats as well as promises by prediction of pains to be endured in this or a future life in case of disobedience—of pleasures in case of obedience take even the promises alone without the threats—the seductive force is already beyond comparison greater than in the case of the making of gold or the supernatural cure of diseases add the threats it receives a further and prodigiously greater increase prudence suggests and requires the yielding to the probative force of this fact—the giving credence to it without staying to inquire into the intrinsic credibility of it—into its coincidence or deviousness in degree or specie with reference to the usual course of nature—into its conformity or repugnancy to the obvious laws of nature in this way—by the help of an instrument of seduction which seems to be ready made courting the hand of whoever has confidence enough to take it up and use it—any man it might seem would have it in his power to impose laws and those irresistible ones upon any and every other such accordingly might have been the result if the operation had been confined to one person or if the operators in whatever number had agreed among themselves happily for human liberty at least not to speak of happiness and virtue no such concord has existed in different nations sometimes even in the same nation legislators seeking to rule men by this instrument have come forward opposing and combating one another with this instrument no less decidedly and strenuously than others with the sword each has proclaimed to the world—these of mine are the true wonders all others—all those others that you hear of are false these that i promulgate to you are the genuine commands all others all those others that you hear of are spurious divided thus and opposed to itself the seductive force how seldom soever effectually resisted ceased to be absolutely irresistible such are the motives by which a man may be urged to give credit to untrue facts but how comes it to be in his power such is the force by which the will of man is subdued but by what means is the understanding itself brought into subjection by the will i answer—judgment opinion persuasion is in a very considerable degree under the dominion of the will discourse declared opinion altogether but it is the nature of opinion declared truly or falsely declared by one man to produce real opinion on the part of another judgment in the power of the will by what means by these means—to bestow attention on one consideration to refuse it to another is altogether in the power of the will it is in the power of a judge to hear one man speak in the character of a witness to refuse to hear another to hear one paper read in the character of an evidentiary document to refuse to hear another the power which in the station of a judge a man thus exercises in relation to persons and papers the mind of every man sitting in the tribunal established in his own bosom exercises at pleasure over arguments and ideas over the  0  contents of evidentiary discourses in the state in which through the medium of the perceptive faculty they have been introduced into the memory an idea to which a mans attention refuses itself is to every practical purpose during the continuance of such refusal as completely excluded and thence rendered as completely inoperative as the testimony of a witness whom before he has begun to speak the judge has sent out of court or a paper which he has disposed of in the same way before any part of it has been read that discourse of all kinds more especially discourse declarative of opinion is completely in the power of the will is manifest enough but he who is completely master of mens discourses is little less than completely master of mens opinions it is by the discourse of a that the opinion of b is governed much more than by any reflections of his own to take upon trust from others that is from the discourses of others his own opinions is on by far the greater part of the subjects that come under his cognizance and call upon him in one way or other for his decision the lot the inevitable lot of the wisest and most cautious among mankind how much more frequently so that of the ignorant the rash the headstrong the unthinking multitude how wicked it is frequently said—how absurd and hopeless the enterprise to make war upon opinions alas would it were as absurd and hopeless as it is wicked and pernicious upon opinions in an immediate way yes to crush the idea in the mind to act upon it by mechanical pressure or impulse is not in the power of the sword or of the rod in an unimmediate though for efficacy not too remote way through the medium of discourses no for what in the case of opinions unhappily for mankind is but too much in the power of the sword and of the rod is to crush the enunciating and offending pen or tongue to cut asunder the muscles by which they are moved unhappily the power of the will over opinion through the medium of discourse is but too well understood by men in power meantime thus much is plain enough the more credible the facts in themselves are the less need has a man to seek to gain credence for them by such means by such means credit may be given to facts the most absurd currency to opinions the most pernicious facts which are true opinions which in their influence are beneficial to society have no need of such support if this be to be admitted the consequence seems undeniable to employ such means for the securing credence to any fact is to confess its falsehood and absurdity to employ such means for the support of any opinion is to confess its erroneousness and mischievousness to pursue such ends by such means is to betray and virtually to confess the practice of imposture the consciousness of guilt the propensity to give credence to false facts to give adoption and currency and practical influence to opinions howsoever absurd and pernicious wheresoever reward or punishment is conceived as annexed by supernatural and irresistible power to the operation of giving credence or discredence to any alleged fact is of itself too strong to need strengthening by any factitious means—by the application of political rewards or punishments to that same purpose ascribe merit to belief—belief will naturally be upon the lookout for the most difficultly credible facts to attach upon in the belief of facts which present themselves as true there can be no merit since there is no exertion no opportunity given to any one man to distinguish himself from any other—no opportunity to the  0  most obsequious to distinguish himself from the most refractory the difficulty as far as there is any consists in the giving credence to facts which of themselves present themselves as incredible and the more incredible the more merit because without exertion there can be no merit and the greater the exertion whatever be the line the greater the merit as every man is ready to acknowledge the more obvious and obtrusive the considerations by which if attended to the fact would be shown to be incredible the greater the exertion necessary to keep them out not that the difficulty such as it is is a difficulty which any one need despair or doubt of being able to surmount it is a contention in which in proportion to a mans weakness of mind he will have the advantage over the strong in proportion to his ignorance over the knowing in proportion to his folly over the wise in proportion to his improbity over the upright it is not wonderful that motives and interests should have the power of producing belief in antiphysical facts since they are found by experience to have the power of producing belief even in selfcontradictory propositions upon the face of the matter eyes being closed against experience it would seem that belief in selfcontradictory propositions is impossible on the contrary it is altogether natural and so natural as to be very generally exemplified it has already been shown in what manner the expectation of reward or punishment as connected with particular opinions operates upon the judgment through the medium of the attention when the idea of merit comes to be attached to the act of belief the degree of merit will naturally be supposed to be in proportion to the difficulty of believing and the consequent exertion required for the production of belief but to the eyes of an observer the existence of exertion bestowed on the endeavour to produce belief has no surer test—the intensity of it in the character of an operative cause has no more correct measure—than the magnitude of the opposing forces which must have been overcome ere the effect has been accomplished and the more repugnant to reason any proposition is the more powerful are the obstacles which it opposes to any exertions that are made to cause it to be believed consequently if the obstacle has been overcome the more powerful must have been the exertions by which it has been overcome—by which the effect thus aimed at has been produced and the greater it is therefore supposed will be the reward attached to such meritorious exertions thus it is that the more absurd any proposition is the greater efforts are naturally made to believe it be the subject what it may if the proposition proposed for belief be a proposition of the affirmative cast belief will depend partly upon the probative force of the affirmative evidence partly upon the weakness of the disaffirmative evidence or the nonexistence of any such evidence meaning always by existence relative existence—existence in the place in question—the judicatory in which the cause is heard and is to be determined as to affirmative evidence in the case here in question an authority that is the opinion   0 real or pretended of some other person or persons whose situation affords a ground more or less strong for supposing them conversant with the subjectmatter in question will always operate with more or less probative force in the character of affirmative evidence but—for the exclusion of all disaffirmative evidence and thence of all disprobative force—the power of the will applied in that direction with the degree of exertion required by the nature of the case will of course suffice finding therefore no disprobative force to oppose it the prevalence of the probative force of the affirmative evidence and the production of the correspondent affirmative persuasion become alike a matter of course the probative force of authority in the character of evidence will be on the one hand as the plenitude of ascribed knowledge—on the other as the completeness of selfconscious ignorance if by hope of reward alone the effect in question viz belief is thus capable of being produced how much more surely by punishment an instrument which apparent proximity and certainty being the same in both cases acts with so much superior force if by either of itself how much more surely by both together and if by either at an ordinary degree of apparent magnitude how much more by both together each at an infinite apparent magnitude thus stands the matter in regard to matters of fact in general and in particular in regard to such as are improbable these being the only ones and that in proportion to their improbability in respect of which there can be any need for applying in this partial way     the force of the will to the operations of the understanding what remains to be shown is why selfcontradictory propositions—which when examined as above are found to be not improbable propositions concerning matters of fact but propositions still less fitted to be credited upon rational grounds—should find so much more easy and extensive evidence than propositions assertive of improbable matters of fact even such as are so in the highest degree the reason seems to be that if duly examined every selfcontradictory proposition would be found to be an assemblage of words void of sense—a mass of downright nonsense but in proportion to the apparent respectability and trustworthiness of the authority of the instructor will be the assurance of the pupil that from such a source nothing that is capable of bearing so degrading an appellation can emanate what in this case he will therefore tacitly assume and take for granted is that under this veil of apparent nonsense there lies enveloped some exquisite sense too valuable to be made manifest to eyes so impure and dull as his are issuing or appearing to issue from such a source a proposition of this complexion will thus be upon a footing with a proposition taken from a foreign language a language with which he has no acquaintance from an elderly man of good reputation in the capacity of an instructor suppose a young pupil to hear delivered in the character of an uncontrovertible truth la illah allah mohammed resoul allah to him it would in itself be so much nonsense to a person acquainted with the arabic language if a pious christian it would present itself as a blasphemous falsehood—if a pious mahometan as a sacred and fundamental truth thus easy is it for a mass of nonsense by which no matter of fact is in truth asserted to become the subjectmatter of a severe and unshakeable belief and this for the very reason that it is nonsense compare in this point of view this nonsense with any of those propositions which are enunciative of an intelligible matter of supposed fact which we have the strongest reason that man can have for believing not to be anywhere realized such as that of an old womans moving in the air at pleasure on a broomstick or a mans introducing his body into a quart bottle though in regard to either of these propositions we have as full proof of its falsity as for the governance of human conduct a man needs to have—it is only by a mixture of ignorance and rash confidence that either of them could be pronounced in the strict sense of the word impossibility impossible since to the production of either of these effects there needs but the existence of some power in nature with which we are not as yet acquainted true it is that in my view of the matter at least the existence of any such power would be a matter completely disconformable to everything that at present we are acquainted with respecting the established course of nature of this so full is my persuasion that in the way of wagering i would for the value of a shilling stake upon it without scruple everything i possess but for the reason above intimated in the consciousness i feel of my not being in possession of universal science i find a reason altogether sufficient to prevent me from regarding it as being in the strict sense of the word impossibility impossible §    distinction between facts impossible per se and facts impossible si alia of alibi evidence there are two occasions on which the evidence or argument indicated by the words impossibility and incredibility are capable of presenting themselves   on the one side say that of the demandant a fact is deposed to by a witness on the other side viz that of the defendant no testimony is adduced but it is averred that the supposed fact as thus deposed to is in its own nature incredible or what comes to the same thing improbable to such a degree as to be incredible say for example a fact pretended to have taken place in the way of witchcraft a man lifted up slowly without any exertion of will on his part or connexion with any other from the ground into the air or an old woman by an exertion of volition on her part riding in the air at pleasure on a broomstick on the one side say again that of the demandant a fact is deposed to by a witness as before on the other hand it is averred to be impossible—impossible not in its own nature as before but for this reason viz that the existence of it is incompatible with the existence of another fact which in this view is deposed to by other evidence say the testimony of a superior number of witnesses the defendant cannot at the time alleged have been committing the offence in london for at that same time he was at york a place above two hundred miles distant the instance here given is that which is commonly known by the name of alibi it supposes the incompatibility of a mans existing in one place at any given point of time with the existence of the same man in any other place at the same point of time or in other words of a mans existing in two places at once     for the purpose of the present inquiry these two kinds of impossibility are exactly alike the nature of the impossibility is in both cases the same in both cases it consists in disconformity to the established course of nature the difference is that in the first of the two cases there is but one event mentioned and that event is one which taken by itself cannot be true—in the second case there are two events mentioned either of which taken by itself may be true but both together cannot in the first case therefore the impossibility being supposed we immediately set it down that the testimony of the affirming witnesses is false in the second place we have to choose which of the two testimonies we shall disbelieve—that of the witnesses who affirm the one fact or that of the witnesses who affirm the other fact if i am told that on such a day at such an hour john brown leaped over the moon i at once reject the assertion as being incredible this is impossibility of the first kind if a tells me that on such a day at such an hour john brown was in london and b tells me that on the same day and at the same hour the same individual was at york i pronounce with equal readiness that both stories cannot be true but it remains a question for subsequent consideration which of them it is that is false and this is impossibility of the second kind the plea of alibi although the fact should be regarded as established by satisfactory evidence will not always be regarded as conclusively disprobative with regard to the fact to which it is opposed why by reason of the uncertainty that may attach upon the point of time the identity of the point of time in the two cases being assumed—let it be proved that at that time titius was in the first floor of the house in question it is thereby proved to be perfectly incredible that at that same point of time he should have been in the second floor but from the size of a second or third of time enlarge the temporal seat of the fact to twentyfour hours—on that supposition and in that sense of the word time proof of a mans having been at london will not disprove the fact of his having been at york at the same time as in the case of the celebrated flying high wayman hence it is that in the case of the plea of alibi—though admitting the truth of the evidence in support of it the incredibility of the fact in the character of a fact incredible in toto never comes into dispute—this is not the case with it in the character of a fact incredible in degree if it be satisfactorily proved that on the  st of january      at noon titius was in the choir of westminster abbey—it is out of dispute that on the  st of january      at noon he could not have been in the choir of york minster but if all that has been proved is that on the  d of january      at noon titius was in the choir of westminster abbey—whether on the  st of january in the same year at the same time of the day he was at york minster is not put out of dispute the fact of his being at york minster on the said  d of january if spoken of in the character of an incredible fact will not be spoken of as being such in toto but only in degree titius is not said to have been in both places at once what is said of him now is that at the one time he was in the one place at the other time in the other and the question is whether the degree of quickness with which he is said to have passed from the one place to the other be credible under all the circumstances of the case of the plea of alibi the possible use is evidently without limit it may alike be employed in penal causes and in nonpenal causes in both the subjectmatter of it may be the person of the defendant the person of the demandant or any other person—or instead of a person it may be a thing but the sorts of causes in which in practice it is most in use to be employed are penal causes and the subjectmatter of which the alibi is most in use to be predicated is the person of the defendant it cannot be true that at the time charged i committed the offence charged for at that time i was in another place and it is not so much as charged that at the place where i then was any such offence was committed by me or by any one else the system of procedure in which this plea occurs with a degree of frequency far beyond what is exemplified in any other is the english—more particularly in the case of the causes belonging to the higher penal classes in which trial by jury is employed in these cases for one instance in which it is true there are perhaps some hundreds in which it is false the cases in which it is believed i should not expect to find so numerous as those in which it is disbelieved but setting aside the one extraordinary case as often as it is advanced perjury is employed in the support of it and as often as it is believed so often is that perjury successful and guilt triumphant and the criminal taught by experience how he may proceed with impunity to the commission of other crimes should the prevention of crimes ever become a primary object with the powers that be this source of turpitude together with so many     others might without much difficulty be dried up but as yet fiat justitia ruat cælum has been the maxim meaning by justitia not the essence but the forms of justice   one remedy that presents itself is the not receiving any witnesses to a point of that sort without their coming accompanied with a certain number of persons of whom a part to be householders in the nature of the compurgators of the old law to give an account of their character there is no one in such a country as this be he who or what he may who is not known to several an objection to this is that there are many persons who have no good character but who for all that may chance in good truth to have seen a man in one place at the time when he is charged to have committed a crime at another this is true but if the case with respect to their character be so it is still fitting it should appear but he may be a stranger either an absolute stranger a foreigner or a native just arrived from a distant country but if this be the case it is fitting it should appear and the making it appear may be accepted in excuse for the want of compurgators but how is this to appear not by the single oath of the witness himself for he who will perjure himself in the immediate matter of the cause where he is liable to confrontation will still more readily do so in the preliminary matter where he is not the testimony concerning him of that person or those persons with whom he has lodged within a certain interval should be required in corroboration of his own or lastly if he is an absolute vagabond who has lodged nowhere and is known to nobody this also it is very fitting should appear   another remedy might be the requiring notice to be given to the prosecutor a certain number of days before the trial of the names and places of abode of such intended witnesses—a practice already established as to all evidence on the side of the prosecution in cases of treason—a practice much less liable to abuse in this instance than in that in treason there is always a common cause and a common purse a cause which sanctifies all means and which moreover sets to work all means of obtaining acquittal with at least as much alacrity in behalf of guilt as of innocence in ninetynine cases out of a hundred of ordinary prosecutions the prosecutor has no wish to impress the judge with a persuasion of the guilt of the accused any further than he is penetrated himself with that persuasion   but the only adequate remedy and one perhaps which may supersede the other two is a power in the judge after hearing all the testimony but whether after or before the verdict given may be made a question to adjourn the trial to a further day or what comes to the same thing to appoint a new one taking such securities as the nature of the case may require for the forthcomingness of the defendant by holding to bail or by recommittal in the mean time all such particulars as may give a clue to the discovery of the situations and characters of such witnesses will have been drawn out of them by interrogation and the prosecutor will be furnished with such lights as may guide him to the discovery of more numerous and unexceptionable witnesses who may prove that the first set were themselves at the time in a place other than that wherein they pretended to have seen the accused or may in some other way prove the falsity of their story such a regulation being established—men who now for the sake of hire or an unrighteous friendship venture upon a perjury which rarely admits of detection as knowing that it is but bearing on and all is over will shrink from the thought of encountering such a scrutiny as after such lights if well elicited it is scarcely possible that anything but veracity should bear i do conceive that the apprehension of such a scrutiny would in by far the greatest number of those instances in which such machinations would otherwise be put in practice prevent the attempt from being made at all and should it be made from being unhappily successful nor will these precautions if rightly considered be found to be less favourable upon the whole even to those at whose expense they are taken the escaping by evidence of this suspicious kind when unsifted and unexamined never fails to leave a stain on a mans character which a thorough discussion with such assistance would effectually wash out §    of improbability as regards psychological facts on passing from physical facts to pyschological facts a change of language becomes necessary where physical facts are concerned the repugnancy between the alleged fact and the facts corresponding to the law of nature from which it is considered as deviating or of which it is considered as a violation is sometimes considered as existing in a degree which attaches to the alleged fact in question the character of improbability in this or that degree sometimes in that superlative degree which stamps the alleged fact as impossible in the case of the pyschological class of facts this highest degree is not considered as having any place in the scale in such and such circumstances it is improbable that a man should have acted or thought so and so—thus much is said continually but that in any such case the improbability should have risen to the height of impossibility     is a degree of intensity to which the assertion has seldom been raised by the utmost heat of altercation for expressing the conformity the uniformity observable amongst physical facts laws of nature have been long ago laid down as above observed to the purpose of denoting conformity among psychological facts the application of that fictitious mode of speech appears not to have been ever yet extended the cause of this difference is obvious and simple amongst psychological facts no such close conformity is commonly observed as amongst physical facts they are not alike open to our observation nor in so far as they have happened actually to be observed has the result of the observation been such as to warrant the supposition of a degree of conformity equally close the sort of internal perception or consciousness we all feel of what is called the freedom of our will is of itself sufficient to put a negative upon the application of any such term as impossibility to any of the facts which present themselves as flowing from that source to assert the impossibility of any given act is to assert the necessity of the opposite act and in a proposition asserting the necessity of this or that act on the part of any human agent a denial of the freedom of his will is generally understood to be involved examined to the bottom this consciousness of the freedom of our will would it is true be found to amount to neither more nor less than our blindness as to a part more or less considerable of the whole number of joint causes or concurrent circumstances on which the act of the will and with it the consequent physical acts depend nor is this the only instance of a false conception of power growing out of impotence but the question is not as to what sort of expression might be best adapted to the case but what the expression is that is in actual use and here too we see a further confirmation of the observation already made viz that it is only by a sort of misconception and verbal illusion that such attributes as necessity impossibility probability improbability are considered and spoken of as if they were attributes and properties of the events themselves the only sort of fact of which they are really and truly indicative is the disposition of our mind of our own judgment to be persuaded with a greater or less degree of assurance concerning their existence or nonexistence to entertain an assurance more or less intense that at the place in question at the time in question the fact in question was or was not in existence physical improbabilities—facts rendered incredible to enlightened minds by their deviation from the course of irrational nature have seldom of late years come upon the carpet in any court of judicature the alleged improbabilities which on that theatre are so much more frequently brought forward and opposed to direct evidence are of the psychological or mental kind alleged or supposed acts or states of the mind—consciousness or nonconsciousness of this or that fact recollection or nonrecollection intention or nonintention operation or nonoperation of the idea of this or that pain or pleasure in the character of a motive conduct of such or such a description under the influence of such or such an intention—any of these acts or modes of being are alleged as having exhibited themselves in the mind of some individual in circumstances in which to an unbiassed mind judging from the known constitution of human nature the existence of such alleged phenomena would present itself as incredible inconsistencies—inconsistencies in thought or action—is the denomination in common use under which these psychological improbabilities may perhaps with sufficient propriety be comprised by the improbabilities of this description with which a narrative appears pregnant it will frequently lose its credit—if not as to the entire substance of it at least as to the particular points to which the improbability appears to extend the credibility of it will in this case be said to be overthrown by its own internal evidence without its being capable of being supported or requiring to be opposed by any external evidence in cases of this description the apparent improbability as in the abovementioned physical cases will be susceptible of an indefinable multitude of gradations insanity may be considered as marking the highest point in this scale according to the degree in each case will be the force with which it acts against the direct evidence—the persuasive force with which it operates upon the mind of the judge such as its relative force is in each instance such in that instance will be its effect in one instance it will prevail over the direct evidence and the direct evidence will be effectually discredited by it in another instance the decision will be governed by the direct evidence though in proportion to the apparent improbability it is but natural that the persuasion on which the decision is grounded should be lowered and weakened by it to class these cases of psychological improbability under heads each head being illustrated by apposite examples taken from the most remarkable causes that have been determined on questions of fact among the most enlightened nations would be a work of considerable curiosity and notwithstanding the impossibility of marking out and distinguishing the different degrees and shades of     improbability would be of no inconsiderable use but the task would be a work of itself too laborious as well as voluminous to be comprised within the limits of the present work the advances that within the few last centuries have been made in the study of these psychological laws of nature—these advances though not so describable nor perhaps so considerable as those made in relation to the physical laws of nature have however been by no means undiscernible in their effects to weigh evidence against evidence—to weigh particular evidence against general probability—requires a proportionable skill in the science of psychology it is to a deficiency of skill in this useful science accompanied with a consciousness of this deficiency that the system of procedure may ascribe so many altogether inapposite or imperfect and now exploded contrivances for the investigation of legal truth trial by ordeal trial by battle wager of law oaths expurgatory and suppletory to the same cause may moreover be ascribed those defects which may still be observed in such abundance in the system pursued with respect to evidence among the most enlightened nations to investigate these defects step by step is the direct object of the present work but in the meantime a presumptive only but not unimpressive proof of their existence is the diversity of the courses pursued on this ground as between nation and nation in the pursuit of the same end and not only as between nation and nation but between province and province nay between court and court in the same nation and the same province† chapter xvii atrocity of an alleged offence how far a ground of incredibility‡ a crime is the more improbable it has been said the more atrocious and the practical inference is— the more atrocious the offence the greater the force of evidence requisite to prove it thus nakedly given as we see it frequently without the requisite explanations the observation is fitter for a play or a novel than for a treatise on jurisprudence it proceeds from an indistinct view of the subject and in respect of the practical conclusions pointed at it requires explanation and distinctions to be made to prevent it from being productive of pernicious errors in practice the imputation is an incredible one why because the man on whom it is cast bears so excellent a character—such is the argument in the case mentioned in a preceding chapter the imputation is an incredible one why because he is a man—such is the argument in the present case this is what is called sentiment and being so is addressed it is said to the heart the depravity of human nature and the dignity of human nature are among the topics on which the practitioners in the arts of rhetoric that is of deception have been fond of skirmishing some on the one others on the other some on either or both according to the purpose of a man who brings forward this observation the first question to be asked is what he means by atrocity but this is that sort of question which the sort of writer in question takes care not to put to himself his readers would not thank him for it nothing is more troublesome to a man than to be obliged to know what he means no error so pernicious that he would not rather adopt and give currency to than load himself with so much trouble to explain or to inquire what it is a man means is metaphysics—light is an object of hatred to all owls and to all thieves definitions under the name of metaphysics to all rhetoricians i hate metaphysics exclaims edmund burke somewhere it was not without cause what then is on this occasion meant by atrocity—the atrocity of the offence—no     not of the offence that would not be sentimental enough—of the crime the word crime being incurably indistinct and ambiguous is the word to be employed upon all rhetorical occasions does it mean the mischievousness of the offence if it does the proposition is in a great degree erroneous of all offences by far the most mischievous are those which owe their birth or tend to give birth to civil war treason rebellion sedition and the like—suppose a civil war—subject of dispute title to the throne question on which the title turns legitimacy the nation is equally divided today one half are traitors tomorrow the other half whichever half is for the time being on the unsuccessful side and composed thereby of seditionists rebels traitors it is on that side that you find the most disinterested the most generous the most heroical of mankind if then by atrocity we mean mischievousness the proposition that an offence is the more improbable the more atrocious it is is not true by atrocity is not unfrequently perhaps most frequently meant neither more nor less than odiousness meaning of course by odious that which is so no matter for what reason no matter whether with or without reason to the individual by whom the appellation is employed in a word that which is the object of his antipathy to one set of men the man who differs from them in some peculiarly tender point bearing relation to religion is the most atrocious character to another or to the same the man who has been drawn into some devious path by the impulse of the sexual appetite the existence of the christian the theist the atheist i have thus heard successively denied by their respective abominators in printed books i have observed doubts next in force to denial expressed with relation to the existence of those nonconformists who in company with the wearers of linseywoolsey are consigned to destruction in the second edition of the mosaic law all passions are cunning antipathy not less so than any other on the part of the antipathist the profession of incredulity is but a pretence and a disguise to enable him with more decency to give vent to his rage and with more effect to point the rage of others against the odious object if the existence of these monsters is so incredible the practical consequence should be not to be so ready to devote to perdition this or that individual under the notion of his being one of them but the antipathist knows better than to be thus cheated of his prey the existence of the monster is to be incredible or next to incredible for the purpose of rendering him proportionably odious the odiousness being the medium of proof for the demonstration of the improbability is assumed of course and forasmuch as an attempt to prove supposes the necessity of proof and assumption the nonnecessity of proof assumption of a fact is still more persuasive than the strongest proof of it to screw up the odium against a man to the highest pitch you begin with declaring his existence—the existence of so odious a character—next to impossible having thus pointed against him the rage of the judge you make use of that rage for disposing the judge to believe him guilty while louis xiv was persecuting the huguenots it was an established maxim a fiction of french law that there were no such persons in existence by atrocity may again be meant cruelty—cruelty displayed in the commission of the offence this sense is of all the most literal and proper sense but if the import given to the word atrocity is thus confined the application of the maxim the description of offences to which it is applicable is proportionably confined it is almost confined to personal injuries homicide included if wilful destruction by fire or water be included it will be either because homicide or the imminent danger of that mischief and upon a large scale are involved—or because in its application to property the amount of the mischief or danger is so indefinitely extensive consider then the maxim in this sense in the case of an offence characterized by cruelty the seducing motives have to contend with the motive of humanity sympathy general benevolence take which name you will—to contend with it in its character of a restraining a tutelary motive the disposition of the individual in question being given that is the effective force with which it habitually acts upon his mind—the greater the degree of cruelty said to be displayed in the offence said to be committed the greater the force with which on that particular occasion the motive in question must have opposed the perpetration of it but the principle of humanity is but one of several principles which on every such occasion are acting upon the human mind in the character of tutelary and restraining principles there are besides this the three respective forces of the political the moral or popular and the religious sanctions neither is this by any means the most intense and uniform in its operation of the four tutelary forces it may or may not be stronger than the force of the religious sanction—it may or may not be stronger than that of the moral—but it never can be accounted comparable in strength to that of the political sanction many men fear the wrath of heaven many     men fear loss of character but all men are acted upon more or less by the fear of the jail the scourge the gallows the pillory and so forth in this point of view whatever improbability is given to the supposed offence in question by those other restraining motives the additional improbability given to it by the circumstance in question seems scarce worth taking into the account on the other hand stands a circumstance which must not be overlooked the force of the political and moral sanctions acts upon a man in the character of restraining motives only upon the supposition of discovery the force of humanity has this in common with that of the religious sanction that the supposition of discovery is not necessary to the application of it and besides the comparatively greater extent of its operation when contrasted with the religious sanction the principle of humanity whatever may be the force with which it acts is surer to be present to the mind the suffering of which the injury meditated threatens to be productive can scarcely fail to be present to the mind of the offender especially where the pleasure of enmity—the pleasure expected from the suffering of the intended victim constitutes the motive to the offence this is what cannot fail to be in a mans thoughts whereas the fear of god may be altogether out of his thoughts but whatever may be the degree of cruelty displayed in the commission of the offence or even on whatever other score it may appear psychologically improbable a most material consideration is this supposing the imputation unfounded—does the innocence of the defendant import as of necessity consciousness of such innocence and consequently mendacity criminative perjury on the part of any person in the character of an accusing witness if yes the presumption operating in favour of the defendant from this source seems completely destroyed by the counterpresumption in favour of the witness for as there will be more occasions than one for observing with the exception of the imaginary offences invented by superstition there is no offence so improbable because in practice so unfrequent but that the offence of him who by criminative perjury seeks to fasten upon another the imputation of that offence is still more so thus if for example it be always improbable that murder should be compassed in any of the ordinary ways in which that crime is perpetrated—it seems at least as much so that it should which it would be by a false accusation of that crime be so by this hazardous expedient of calm and deliberate malignity within the compass of the last and present century the number of persons who have committed robberies has been many thousands but there will scarce be found ten who have given false evidence of that or any other capital crime there remains therefore for the only case in which this maxim whatever may be the force and value of it can have any application that in which the evidence operating in crimination of the defendant is purely of the circumstantial kind unless it be worth while to add those sorts of offences witchcraft and so forth which are not capable of being rendered probable by any quantity of testimonial evidence what degree of exculpative force may be proper to be given to the circumstance thus denominated will rest for a judge to determine upon a review of all the other circumstances belonging to the case the essential practical consideration—the essential warning is this not to think of employing it as the foundation for any inflexible rule requiring as necessary to conviction this or that particular dose of evidence such as the testimony of two witnesses the confession of the defendant or in a word any other determinate mass of criminative evidence     book vi of makeshift evidence chapter i of makeshift evidence in general §   makeshift evidence what thus much concerning that description of inferior evidence the inferiority of which consists in this—viz that the fact the existence of which is immediately indicated by it is not the very fact in question—the fact of the existence of which a persuasion is endeavoured to be produced in the mind of the judge—but some other fact which though distinct from that principal fact is so connected with it as that with a greater or less degree of assurance the existence of such principal fact is inferred and considered as being rendered more or less probable by the existence of the evidentiary fact we come now to that description of inferior evidences the inferiority of which consists in this—viz that be the fact what it may principal or evidentiary the information which it conveys has some circumstance belonging to it which—by rendering inapplicable to it some one or more of the securities that are applicable to ordinary evidence—renders its probative force in a greater or less degree inferior to that possessed by ordinary evidence when those securities such of them as are applicable to it are actually applied to it of the different powers qualities and operations serving as securities for correctness and completeness—securities against deceptitious incorrectness and incompleteness—a view has been already given by the inapplicability or nonapplication of these several securities and the groups which by ringing the changes might be formed out of them may be constituted so many species of evidence of inferior shape—of evidence the probative force of which is lessened by the imperfection thus produced in the shape in which it presents itself to the mind to which it belongs to judge when the nonapplication of them has for its cause the mental weakness or corruption of the man in power—of the legislator or the judge—the principal of the shapes in which this imperfection has displayed itself have under the head of extraction been already brought to view† but cases exist—and cases the exemplification of which is abundantly frequent—in which this imperfection has for its cause not any failure on the part of the man in power but the unchangeable nature of things in the imperfect shape in question the article of evidence is to be had in any other shape it is not to be had—at least as matters stand at present agreeing in this one common character—viz that of imperfection and of imperfection the origin of which is traceable to the source just indicated—being employed only because from the same source better evidence evidence of a more trustworthy complexion of greater probative force is not be had—these several species of evidence how dissimilar soever in other respects may be brought together and designated by one common appellation—viz that of makeshift evidence on this subject three distinguishable tasks present themselves to the eye and conscience of an honest and intelligent legislator—  to take an inventory of those species of inferior yet not the less indispensable evidence   for the information of the judge to hold up to view their several features of infirmity and   by apposite powers and instructions to do whatsoever the nature of things admits of towards the removal of their several infirmities by completing in each instance the requisite assortment of securities or by so ordering matters that testimony in a more trustworthy shape may in future take place of testimony in these less trustworthy shapes §   of the different species of makeshift evidence under the denomination of makeshift evidence are comprehended two divisions or subclasses the contents of which as compared with one another have nothing in common except the infirmity in consideration of which the term makeshift is alike applicable to both these are unoriginal evidence and extrajudicially written evidence i extrajudicially written evidence susceptible alike of this common denomination will be found three sorts or genera viz   casually written   exparte preappointed   adscititious or imported ii unoriginal or as supposed transmitted evidence susceptible of this common denomination will be found five distinguishable sorts or genera   supposed oral delivered through oral   supposed written or say scriptitious delivered through written or say scriptitious thence termed transcriptitious     or transcriptural   supposed oral delivered through written   supposed written delivered through oral   reported real evidence the different modifications for the expression of which these denominations have been devised will all of them receive further explanation each of them in its place in every instance that inferiority in respect of probative force in consideration of which the term makeshift was found applicable with equal propriety to them all will be seen to have for its cause the absence of one of the principal securities for correctness and completeness—viz interrogation ex adverso at the hands of a party whose interest in the event of its being incorrect or incomplete may in proportion to that incorrectness or incompleteness be made to suffer by it in the case of unoriginal evidence the word supposed forms in the instance of each of the genera contained under it as above an indispensable adjunct if not expressed it must at any rate be borne in mind or confusion and misconception will be the result in the case of every such article of evidence there are at least two different statements in question one the existence of which is certain the other such that though the existence of it is asserted viz in and by the statement which as above is certainly known to exist it may happen notwithstanding in the whole or in any part not to have had existence that which is certain is that which to a certainty viz by the very supposition is presented to the mind of him to whom it belongs to judge to his hearing if it be oral to his sight if it be scriptitious titius standing before the judge says—i heard sempronius say so and so this is supposed oral through oral evidence the oral evidence is that which is said by titius the supposed oral evidence is that which by titius is said to have been said by sempronius by the judge it will naturally be supposed to have been said by sempronius because generally speaking it will be more likely that what was said by titius was true than that it was false but in speaking of this supposed statement to employ the same unqualified expression as that which as above is employed in speaking of the statement made before the judge would be to assume as indisputable that which in general will in case of litigation be among the matters in dispute that in the presence of the judge titius said to the judge sempronius said in my hearing so and so is out of dispute but what may happen is that in saying thus what titius said was altogether false sempronius not having in his hearing ever said anything at all or at least not having said anything to any such effect omitting the adjunct supposed had the denomination been in this case oral evidence through oral—in this case the truth of what was supposed to have been said by sempronius would not indeed have been represented as out of dispute but the truth of that which was said by titius in saying sempronius in my hearing said so and so would have been represented as being out of dispute whereas in the nature of this species of evidence this point is no less open to dispute than the other of the three sorts of evidence here comprehended under the general denomination of extrajudicially written evidence the points of coincidence and difference may be thus stated— whatever a man writes that is capable of being employed in evidence but without any expectation unless with a fraudulent intention of its being so employed—if being addressed to any other person it is designed to be communicated to him—comes in common language under the denomination of a letter if it be not so addressed it may be and is included under that of a memorandum in both cases if it happens to the document to be employed in the character of judicial evidence it may be designated by the common appellation of casually written evidence but there are cases in which—not wearing the form of evidence nor as such antecedently to their creation called for by authority of a court of justice—letters as well as memorandums are written for a purpose analogous to that for which evidence is so called for that is for the giving effect to rights and obligations and not altogether without a view towards their being made in so far as the established rules respecting evidence will admit subservient to the purposes of evidence of this genus the most striking and in respect of their extent and application the most important species are—in the shape of memorandums all those entries which form the matter of a mercantile book of account—in the shape of letters those which are written or received by mercantile men in the course or for the purpose of their commerce these therefore being written not without a view to their being eventually made subservient to the purposes of evidence may appear in that consideration to rank themselves under the head of preappointed evidence—but not being endowed with either of those qualities by one or other of which whatsoever has been ranked under that head stands distinguished so much to its advantage viz the being produced by the concurrence of every party whose rights would be injured   0 either by spuriousness or by any deceptitious incorrectness or incompleteness in its tenor or else by some party whose situation bating casual fraud places him out of all danger or suspicion of any sinister interest capable of engaging him in the design of giving to it any such deceptitious character—it becomes necessary that this inferior sort should by a term expressive of the distinguishing circumstance be distinguished from that superior sort of evidence it has therefore been called evidence preappointed ex parte by the term adscititious or imported evidence is meant to be expressed any statement in writing which on the occasion of its being written was not designed to be employed in the character of evidence in the cause in question but was designed to be employed whether actually employed or not in the character of evidence viz in some other cause and it is with reference to such other cause that it is termed adscititious or imported as having for the purpose of the cause in question been borrowed as it were from that other cause in the case of evidence borrowed from another cause it may happen that some or all of the appropriate securities for the trustworthiness of evidence were applied to it in that cause but it will scarcely happen that a set of securities was applied to it the same in all respects as that which in the cause in question might be applied to it interrogation for example yes but not at the instance of all the same parties or even if at the instance of every one of those same parties yet one or more of them perhaps were not at that time possessed of all the material sources of information and consequent grounds for interrogation which they possess at present this is the most favourable case but in respect of probative force this species of evidence which at the worst seems to have all the advantages of both the extrajudicially written species of evidence just mentioned may be rendered by any number of degrees weaker and weaker by the several defects which if the judicatory be different are liable to have place in the course of procedure pursued in such other judicatory in relation to evidence with imperturbable composure we shall see judges after judges employing and in the english system which judges shall we not see employing and taking for the sole grounds of decision modes of collection of the unsuitableness of which to the purposes of justice they are themselves and ever have been perfectly and confessedly convinced—evidence altogether uninterrogated in the shape of affidavit evidence evidence interrogated not by any of the parties nor yet by a judge but by a clerk who being alone with the witness in a private room makes him sign what he pleases under these circumstances supposing the procedure of the judicatory directed to any such ends as the ends of justice it may be imagined with what varied degrees of distrust it cannot but regard whatever masses of evidence may have been imported into it from any of those judicatories in which the convenience of the judge is substituted to the ends of justice aliâ in causâ—inter alios—alio in foro—alieno in foro by these adjuncts an idea may be given of so many obvious specific modifications of the genus adscititious evidence casually written evidence evidence preappointed ex parte and adscititious evidence these form as it were a class apart from that for the designation of which the term unoriginal is employed not but that evidences partaking of the qualities in consideration of which they have been designated respectively by those several denominations are capable likewise of partaking of that quality for the designation of which the word unoriginal is employed not that casually written evidence evidence preappointed ex parte and the evidence termed adscititious evidence are less capable than any other sorts of adding to the qualities designated by those several appellations the quality of unoriginality in which case they will add each of them to its own characteristic infirmity the infirmity that forms the character of that fourth species but of all evidence here comprised under the appellation of unoriginal evidence this of nonoriginality constitutes an essential and inseparable quality whereas in those several other cases if it be present it is but as an accidental one §   properties common to all the kinds of makeshift evidence—topics to be touched upon in relation to each species of every one of the several objects comprehended as above under the common denomination of makeshift evidence the following propositions seem capable of being predicated with equal truth—   of the information respectively conveyed by them the truth has not been provided for by any or at least not by all of the securities which as above are capable of being and ought to be applied to evidence—ordinary evidence when presented in its best shape   the shape in which the information contained in them is presented renders them respectively inferior in point of trustworthiness to ordinary evidence   by the circumstance by which they are respectively distinguished from ordinary evidence each of them is liable to have been employed as an instrument of a particular species of fraud a particular modification of     what in speaking of all or any of them may be termed the characteristic fraud—the characteristic fraud incident to makeshift evidence   this fraud consists in the fabrication and utterance of the evidence the pretended information in question—in contemplation and under the assurance of the inapplicability or nonapplication of the securities for trustworthiness viz sanctionment or interrogation one or both of them   though the more formidable part of the mischief is composed of the deception and consequent misdecision of which the characteristic fraud may be the instrument it is not the whole since for want of the security afforded by the safeguard in question against incorrectness and incompleteness the same evil consequences may take place through temerity or even without blame   they are all of them indicative of the existence present or at least past of ordinary regular evidence such as is or at least at one time was or ought to have been obtainable in the best shape from the same source i e either from the same thing as in case of real evidence or from the same person as in case of personal evidence   they are therefore unless for special causes not fit to be admitted any of them by itself in its essential shape the information conveyed by them is not fit to be admitted unless being drawn from the same source it be presented provided it be capable of being so presented in the ordinary—i e in the superior and more trustworthy shape   the information respectively contained in them may in such its inferior shape be presented and by itself if in its regular and ordinary shape the presentation of it is either altogether impracticable or not practicable without preponderant inconvenience viz in the shape of delay vexation or expense   by and after the indication and warning thus given of the characteristic fraud of which they are respectively liable to become the instruments—if it be in the will as well as in the power of the judge to possess himself of it the danger of deception by means of such fraud is lessened the probability of succeeding in any attempt and thence the probability of the attempt itself is diminished shall it in any and what cases be admitted the danger of deception attached to the admission of it can it by any and what means be diminished such are the subjects of inquiry which present themselves as proper to be considered in relation to each of the several species of makeshift evidence hereinabove brought to view previous explanation of their respective natures and submodifications will in so far as deemed necessary come in of course chapter ii of extrajudicially written evidence §   of casually written evidence to a private letter or memorandum this appellative is applied for the purpose of distinguishing this from other species of written evidence widely different in point of trustworthiness viz preappointed written evidence at large and judicially written evidence—to which last belong ready written evidence delivered spontaneously ditto delivered ex interrogato delivered in the epistolary form on being called for by interrogation in the same form and evidence judicially delivered in the oral form whether spontaneously or ex interrogato and thereupon forthwith consigned to writing on the spot evidence preappointed ex parte though extrajudicially can scarcely with propriety be said to be casually written it being written for particular purposes and those always uniform in their nature of the characteristic fraud as above considered under a general aspect the particular modification of which extrajudicially and casually written evidence is liable to become the instrument may be thus described— under the assurance of not being exposed by it to punishment no punishment being in case of mendacity attached to it through the medium of an oath or otherwise nor yet to ill repute or at any rate not of the degree of public shame the author not being about to be subjected to interrogation in respect of it—a man utters in this form a fallacious statement adapted to a deceptitious purpose it is either incorrect or incomplete or both incomplete in the way of partiality and thereby calculated to produce deception and misdecision in consequence fraud is not the only source in which the inferiority of extrajudicially written evidence as compared with ordinary evidence judicially extracted from the same source is to be looked for neither of the main securities against incorrectness and incompleteness—neither the fear of eventual punishment in case of falsehood nor the scrutiny of interrogation     and counterinterrogation—have been applied to it without other blame than that of temerity or even without any blame at all both sources of deception incorrectness and incompleteness more particularly incompleteness may therefore have crept into it whose is the discourse which it conveys or purports to convey—that of an extraneous witness or that of a party in the cause if that of a party at whose instance is it tendered or called for—that of the party whose discourse it is or that of another party on the same side or that of a party on the adverse side according as it happens to it to stand in one or another of these different predicaments the propriety of giving admission to it will it is evident stand upon a different footing as well as in case of admission the expedients to be employed for reducing the danger of deception and consequent misdecision to its lowest terms in what case if in any shall evidence of this description be admitted when admitted by what expedients may the danger of deception considered as producible by the admission of a species of evidence thus liable to be vitiated by incorrectness and incompleteness be diminished to provide an answer to the above questions is the object of the following rules— i case the first he whose discourse the script appears to be not a party in the cause the evidence therefore which it contains extraneous rule   except in the cases excepted in the next rule admit it not question why not admit it answer because by excluding it deduction made of the cases in which it is proposed to give admission to it no information stands excluded the person whose discourse it purports to be being forthcoming and interrogable in a mode less exposed to incorrectness and incompleteness it rests with you to obtain whatever information it contains and more read by itself he not forthcoming or not interrogated in respect of it the substitution will naturally be a cause of incorrectness and incompleteness and misdecision the more or less probable consequence he interrogated and this supposed written discourse of his read notwithstanding the addition is superfluous inconvenience in the shape of delay vexation and expense all useless—the certain consequence rule   the evidence extraneous as before in the following cases admit it   on him whose discourse it purports to be the process of interrogation viz oral interrogation rendered either physically or prudentially impracticable physically as by death or incurable mental infirmity physically or prudentially as by expatriation or exprovinciation the interrogation effectible either not in any terms or not without preponderant inconvenience in the shape of delay vexation and expense   on him whose discourse it purports to be the process of interrogation performable and performed the reading of it called for on either side viz either for an affirmative or a confirmative purpose for the purpose of showing that at the time of framing the written discourse in question the statements contained in it were in any point discordant or on the whole concordant with the testimony now by interrogation and counterinterrogation extracted from the same source† question why give admission to evidence in a shape thus liable to be vitiated by incorrectness and incompleteness answer because were it excluded whatsoever information were not attainable from any other source would thereby stand excluded here then supposing that the information is necessary to a decision in favour of that side here would be deception and consequent misdecision to a certainty whereas by admission given to it certainty of being credited would not be given to it even supposing it true still less supposing it false not being unless in case of fraud which is comparatively an improbable case framed for the purpose—the probability is that taken singly how correct soever it will be in relation to the whole of the facts in the cause taken together more or less incomplete that accordingly it will be composed in great part if not in the whole of circumstantial evidence and since without danger or suspicion of danger circumstantial evidence is received how slight soever how weak soever its probative force so therefore may evidence of the description here in question not to speak of any other note—that if the species of makeshift evidence here in question be incorrect or incomplete to the degree of utter or material     falsity it will of course be counterevidenced by the direct and strenuous evidence of the party against whom it operates instruction to the judge for avoidance of deception considered as producible by the observance of rule second in the first of the two cases therein contained— it will on this occasion be matter for inquiry whether at the time of the utterance of the written discourse in question he whose discourse it is was not exposed to the action of some interest of a pecuniary or in any other way of a selfregarding nature and whether his interest did not at that time stand connected by some special tie of dependence or affection with the interest of the party by whom in the character of evidence the paper in question is produced and this in such sort and degree the quantum of profit being moreover taken into consideration as to render the practice of the characteristic fraud more or less probable in this case a bookkeeper for example charges with goods a customer or supposed customer of his masters knowing that by the person so charged the goods were neither received nor ordered the bookkeeper not to speak of death an event not likely to have been intended ceases viz by expatriation or exprovinciation to be forthcoming for the purpose of justiciability joined to the fabrication of the written document—the expatriation or the exprovinciation may it not have had for its cause the design of putting the undue profit into the pocket of the master the testimony delivered by the paper is incorrect to the degree of total falsity and the falsehood is endeavoured to be screened from detection by the noninterrogation of the author while the author himself is effectually secured from punishment by his nonforthcomingness and that nonjusticiability which is the result of it in a case of this sort against the probability of the characteristic fraud note this dilemma if the claim the unjust claim for the support of which it was designed be made soon after the fabrication of the evidence the expatriation or exprovinciation must have taken place in the mean time and being so timed the nonforthcomingness of the fabricator will operate in the character of circumstantial evidence giving probability to the supposed actual fraud—if the claim be not made till long after the nondemand for such a length of time is another article of circumstantial evidence pointing the same way and here as above note that this disprobabilizing circumstantial evidence will be seen to have for its support the direct testimony if received as it ought to be of the party against whom the fraud in question operates and not only the particular accountbook in question but all the others kept by the same dealer will be or at least ought to be producible at the instance of the party so charged† ii case the second he whose discourse the script appears to be a party in the cause the person at whose instance it is called for a party on the opposite side the tendency of the evidence consequently confessorial or otherwise selfdisserving rule   in this case let the script be admitted but upon condition that the party on recognising the discourse as his shall he at liberty to deliver his own testimony subject to interrogation in explanation of it‡ question   why give admission to evidence of this description thus liable to be rendered in respect of incorrectness or incompleteness an instrument of deception answer because in so far as its tendency is to operate against him whose discourse it is i e in so far as its tendency is confessorial it is the most trustworthy and satisfactory species of evidence that can be produced no person being so little in danger of prejudicing a man in this way either purposely through mendacity or heedlessly through temerity as the man himself and that the tendency of it true or false justly or unjustly is not in the opinion of the person best qualified to judge to operate to the prejudice of him by whom it is called for is sufficiently proved by the circumstance question   why annex as a condition that at his own instance he may subject of course to interrogation be admitted to testify in explanation of it answer because evidence of this description is in a particular manner liable to be if not incorrect at any rate incomplete to admit it to receive explanation is to allow what misstatements it may contain to be corrected—what deficiencies it may contain to be supplied to refuse to it the faculty of receiving such explanation is to keep it by force of law in a state the tendency of which     is to produce deception misdecision and injustice rule   although by death or other cause such as incurable infirmity of mind or expatriation he whose discourse this selfdisserving testimony is be incapable of testifying in explanation of the script—admit it notwithstanding question why admit it under the danger of incorrigible incorrectness and unsupplyable incompleteness as above answer first because the danger of misdecision for want of information in case of exclusion put upon the evidence thus circumstanced appears in this case to be preponderant over the danger of misdecision by reason of information rendered deceptitious for want of such explanation as had the party been forthcoming it might have received suppose the information necessary to warrant a decision in favour of that side—from the exclusion of it misdecision takes place as a certain consequence whereas on the other hand it is not certain that the information contained in it will be either incorrect or incomplete and if either incorrect or incomplete it is not so likely to be so to the prejudice of the authors side as to the prejudice of the other nor though it should be both incorrect and incomplete is it certain but that the effect of the incorrectness may be corrected and the deficiency supplied by inferences drawn partly from the script itself partly from whatsoever other evidence there may be in the same cause the safety with which admission may be given to evidence of this description seems to be indicated by experience even without any such security against deception as is here proposed selfdisserving evidence is admitted in this shape—admitted without reserve—in english practice even thus the mischief though doubtless it cannot be unfrequent seems never yet to have become prominent enough to have been presented as an object of notice to the public mind much less considerable would it be were the means of amendment suffered to be applied to it as above iii case the third he whose discourse the script appears to be a party in the cause as before but he himself the party at whose instance it is proposed to be produced the tendency of it consequently selfserving rule   in this case likewise let the script be admitted the party being of course subject to interrogation on the subject of it and in explanation of it viz by interrogatories propounded on the other side and having consequently the effect of counterinterrogation question why give admission to evidence so obviously liable in so high and manifest a degree to be mendacious or through bias or temerity incorrect or partially incomplete and thence to become an instrument of deception answer in the case of an extraneous witness interest can never be in any case a sufficient ground for exclusion† moreover in the same case interests as strong as any that are most apparent may exist without being known without a possibility of being brought to light while of the interest which a party has in the cause the existence is known of course in the case of a party the sinister mendacitypromoting interest may in itself be no greater than in the case of an extraneous witness and in particular in one of those instances in which being undiscoverable it cannot be taken for a ground of rejection but in the case of a party the interest whatsoever be its effect in respect of the production of mendacity is much less liable to be productive of deception than in the case of an extraneous witness because being more manifest presenting itself the more readily to the observation of every even the most undiscerning observer the suspicion it excites will be stronger—its probative force consequently weaker whatsoever may be the danger the probability of mendacity selfserving mendacity and consequent deception attached to the admission of the testimony of the party in his own behalf deposing in the ordinary mode of oral responsion to oral interrogations—that danger cannot from the admission of a written discourse of the same tendency though of a prior date receive any increase he is subject to counterinterrogation in the one case and by the supposition so he is in the other his extrajudicially composed written statement will in his conception at least operate in confirmation of the testimony he has to deliver in answer to interrogatories but so and without prejudice to his veracity or title to credence it very well may especially when so it happened that at the time of his framing it he had not either in fact or in prospect any such interest as that in virtue of which he became at a subsequent point of time a party in the cause rule   although by death or other cause as above he whose discourse this selfserving testimony is be incapable of testifying in explanation of the script admit it here also notwithstanding question why give admission to evidence     liable in a degree still so much higher to be mendacious or through bias or temerity incorrect or partially incomplete and thence to become an instrument of deception answer for the same reasons as those brought to view in support of rules     and   though not operating with so great a force in some cases as above it may be as well entitled to credence as evidence from any other source and at the same time of material and indispensable use towards bringing to light and explaining the facts that have application to the cause and in this case as in the case mentioned under the last preceding rule so palpable are the considerations that operate in diminution of the probative force of the evidence that the danger of its being estimated at a value over and above that which properly belongs to it does not present itself as naturally preponderant no doubt but that in general a man will be more strongly disposed to make false evidence to serve himself than to serve another but under the impression of his remaining under the eventual obligation of being counterinterrogated on the ground of this extrajudicially written selfserving evidence no less sharply than on the ground of oral evidence of the same tendency delivered on the spot—counterinterrogated and with time in abundance to frame the plan of interrogation or in the case here supposed under the assurance that such counterinterrogation cannot be escaped from definitively but by death nor for a time but by expatriation or exprovinciation—both of them facts operating in the character of circumstantial evidence to the discredit of such his written testimony the sort of fraud in question does not present itself as likely either to succeed if attempted or so much as likely to be attempted where exclusion of evidence would be improper precautionary regulations to diminish the chance of deception from such evidence are very often proper and in a high degree let the danger of misdecision the result of deception produced by casually written evidence be in comparison with the danger of misdecision from exclusion ever so inconsiderable whether in point of magnitude or probability—still no expedient ought to be neglected by which without its being productive of preponderant inconvenience in any other shape the danger from admission promises to be diminished to an effect thus desirable the following regulations present themselves as promising to be conducive—   in every instance in which evidence of the description here in question is in any of its possible modifications as herein above enumerated produced—let it be an instruction from the legislator to the judge to state at the time of his giving judgment the infirmity of so much of the evidence as comes under this description and in the case of his having given credence to it notwithstanding the consideration by which such his credence has been determined and this if judging without a jury for the satisfaction of the parties the audience and the public at large if sitting with a jury for the instruction of the jury   whensoever in consequence of the nonforthcomingness and noninterrogability of him whose discourse the script appears to be it is admitted notwithstanding—the judge having thought fit rather to give admission to it at that time than to put off the decision in expectation of the forthcomingness and interrogation of the supposed author of such testimonial discourse let it be a rule of law that so soon if ever as the means shall exist of performing the interrogation without preponderant inconvenience in the shape of vexation and expense such interrogation shall at the instance of any party in the cause be performable   if upon admission and consideration given to any such article of makeshift evidence it shall seem good to the judge to determine in favour of the party at whose instance such evidence was received—power should be given to the judge on the declared ground of the infirmity of this part of the mass of evidence to require at the hands of the party in whose favour such judgment is pronounced such security for eventual restitution ad integrum and to take such other measures of precaution by sequestration or otherwise as may in his judgment be necessary and sufficient to prevent the happening of irreparable damage such damage as might afterwards be found to have taken place if in consequence of the facts brought to light by such subsequent interrogation or any other means it shall have turned out that the provisional decision so pronounced as above was in point of fact illgrounded in ancient french law casually written evidence appears not to have been considered in the light of makeshift evidence it was considered on many occasions at least as more trustworthy than ordinary testimonial viz judicially exhibited testimonial evidence it appears to have been designated by or at least comprehended under the term commencement de preuve par écrit mentioned in one of the fundamental codes the business of which is in certain cases to exclude testimonial evidence as insufficient in itself—insufficient unless fortified by the support of an article of this species of written evidence the impropriety of this preference was not quite so great under that actually established technical system as it would be under a natural and rational system in testimonial evidence under that system an infirmity     produced by the insufficiency of the mode of receipt and extraction there employed has been already brought to view vol vi p     it might be superior in trustworthiness to testimonial evidence so extracted and yet deserve no better appellation than that of a species of makeshift evidence the species of written evidence in question is what it is—is the same thing under all systems but under the original roman the romanogallic system testimonial evidence was bereft of part of its natural trustworthiness another circumstance that helps to give colour to the preference and operates even in diminution of the impropriety of it is that in a certain point of view i e with reference to a matter of fact of a particular description casually written evidence is really better than testimonial evidence what it does not prove so well is the truth of any of the matters of fact asserted in and by the assertion made by the script what it does prove however and still better than any testimonial evidence prove viz upon the supposition of the authenticity of the script is the fact that assertions to that effect were by the person in question actually made—viz made in and by the script at that time in itself supposing always the authenticity of it it has as to this point all the trustworthiness that belongs to the best sort of preappointed evidence the difference lies only in the property of authenticity the proof of which is in the case of preappointed evidence made the object of special care instead of being left to chance as in this other case in respect of the source and therefore of the grounds of comparative untrustworthiness or trustworthiness derivable from that quarter casually written evidence is it has been seen susceptible of whatever modifications testimonial evidence is susceptible of it may be extraneous it may be selfregarding selfregarding it may be selfdisserving or selfserving extraneous as well as selfregarding it may be lowered by particular exposure to sinister interest or by habitual improbity to all these differences important as they are french practice grounding itself on the ordonnance was in a manner insensible a commencement de preuve par écrit a something upon paper there must be but what that something should be seems scarcely to have been considered as worth thinking about even a lot of judicial testimonial evidence appears to have been considered as constituting a commencement de preuve par écrit judicial evidence and casually written evidence were thus completely confounded so loose in french law was mens conception of the different species of evidence† §   of ex parte preappointed written evidence‡ the order adopted requires that something should now be said on the subject of ex parte preappointed written evidence but it is only in respect of its not being with propriety comprisable under the same denomination as extrajudicially and casually written evidence that it demands a separate head for in respect of trustworthiness i e of probative force it partakes of the same nature and the same natural infirmities as have been seen operating in diminution of the probative force of casually written evidence preappointed it is preappointed it cannot therefore but be denominated but in respect of probative force not to speak of other properties it partakes not in any degree of the trustworthy character of the great mass of preappointed evidence viz that which is the work either of all parties concerned in interest acting in conjunction or of some single but naturally impartial and commonly highlystationed hand     in comparing ex parte preappointed with casually written evidence the reader cannot but observe that unintentional incorrectness is more probable in the case of casually written than of ex parte preappointed evidence for exactly the same reason which renders such incorrectness still more probable in the case of common conversation than in either viz the greater probability of a deficiency of attention on the other hand intentional incorrectness for the purpose of the characteristic fraud is for this same reason more probable in the case of ex parte preappointed than it is in the case of casually written evidence of the same import because if a man sets himself to forge evidence the greater apparent trustworthiness of ex parte preappointed evidence arising from the cause above brought to view would naturally induce him to give that form rather than the form of casually written evidence to the forged document the practical rule in regard to ex parte preappointed evidence is the same with that which has been already laid down as applicable to casually written evidence is the person by whom it was committed to writing in existence and accessible for the purposes of justice let him be examined vivâ voce in open court subject to counterinterrogation and let not the written evidence be admitted otherwise than in the character of notes to assist the memory of the deponent is the writer deceased or the subjecting him to interrogation physically or prudentially impracticable admit the document making allowance for all the circumstances which can operate in diminution of its credibility hear everybody who can tell you anything concerning the document that can afford you any help in judging of the degree of confidence which it deserves and make the same provision as in the case of casuallywritten evidence for the ultimate interrogation of the writer should it at any future period become practicable the grounds of all these arrangements being precisely the same in the case of ex parte preappointed as in that of casually written evidence it would be superfluous to present them a second time to the reader §   of adscititious evidence i e evidence borrowed from another cause what is meant by adscititious evidence as also in what its characteristic infirmity consists has been seen in the preceding chapter it remains to show what is the part which ought to be taken in relation to it by the legislator and by the judge adscititious evidence divides itself into two kinds which are not indeed mutually exclusive of one another but which for reasons that will appear as we advance require to be distinguished   evidence inter alios evidence already exhibited coram judice in the character of judicial evidence but in a cause between other parties i e in which the list of the parties on both sides was either in the whole or as to some one or more of the persons contained in it different from the list of the cause in question the posterior cause   evidence alio in foro evidence already exhibited in the character of judicial evidence but in a cause which whether carried on by the same list of parties or by a list in any respect different was carried on before a different tribunal understand by a tribunal in which the rules of evidence are known or suspected to differ more or less from those observed in the tribunal in question but the other tribunal before which the evidence in question had thus on a preceding occasion been exhibited may either have been a tribunal acting under the government of a foreign state or a tribunal acting under the same government and in the latter case a tribunal of a different province or a tribunal of the same province and in either case a tribunal governing itself by the same rules of evidence or a tribunal governing itself by rules of evidence in any respect different between these two lastmentioned modifications of makeshift evidence—viz evidence inter alios and evidence alio in foro—there exists a very wide and material difference of evidence inter alios the inferiority as compared with the opposite case that of evidence inter eosdem is produced by an universally operating and irremoveable cause—viz a deficiency more or less considerable in respect of that interest on which the efficiency of the instituted securities for trustworthiness is apt to be in so considerable a degree dependent on the other hand in the case of evidence alio in foro the inferiority real or supposed depends altogether upon the accidental difference between the rules of evidence actually observed in one court and those actually observed in another court its root lies in the diversities of practice that prevail as between court and court in matters in which if it were rational in all the practice would with very slight differences be the same in all it lies in the wretchedly imperfect state of this branch of procedure not to speak of any other in every nation hitherto existing upon earth the course proper to be taken in respect to adscititious evidence will be found to vary     according as the document in question is a previous decision or the whole or some part of the minutes of the evidence delivered in a previous cause in respect of the propriety of admission both these species of adscititious evidence stand nearly on the same ground neither of them ought to be admitted when better evidence from the same source is without preponderant inconvenience to be had neither of them ought to be rejected when it is not there is not probably that system of judicial procedure in existence how bad soever the mode of taking evidence that it employs which does not afford a greater probability of right decision than of wrong and in general the presumption of right decision is a very strong one true it is that no decision of a court of justice certifying the existence of a fact affords ground for believing it any further than as such decision renders probable the existence at the time when it was pronounced of evidence sufficient to support it and if the original evidence on which the decision in the former cause was grounded were forthcoming in the present that evidence would be preferable as a foundation for decision to the mere opinion formerly pronounced on the ground of that same evidence by a judge but it scarcely ever happens that evidence which has once been presented admits of being again presented in as perfect a form as before all that important species of evidence which is constituted by the deportment of the witness in the presence of the judge is in most cases irrecoverably lost such evidence as can be obtained now might not be sufficient to warrant the former decision and yet the decision when pronounced may have been perfectly borne out by the evidence on that occasion adduced on the other hand it is true that in very many cases by recurring to the original sources sufficient evidence of the fact might even now be obtained not however without more or less of delay vexation and expense for the avoidance of which it is often proper that the previous decision though an inferior kind of evidence should be received as a substitute in the place of a superior kind as to the minutes of the evidence delivered in the former cause it is sufficiently manifest that they ought not to be admitted if recurrence to the original sources of evidence be practicable without preponderant inconvenience—if the witnesses in the former cause be capable of being examined or such written or real evidence as it may have afforded be capable of being exhibited in the present unless when there may be a use in comparing two testimonies delivered by the same witness on two different occasions but if no matter from what cause recurrence to the original sources be either physically or prudentially impracticable the minutes of the former evidence should be admitted and taken for what they are worth if the evidence in question be oral testimony being generally upon oath subject to punishment in case of intentional falsehood and to counterinterrogation it is at any rate better than hearsay evidence which at its origin had none of these securities if it be real evidence the official minutes of it are the very best kind of reported real evidence—of which hereafter a question of greater nicety is whether in any and if in any in what cases adscititious evidence shall be taken for conclusive in the case of minutes of evidence the short answer is never the testimony of a witness or of any number of witnesses even if delivered in the cause in hand and under all the securities which can be taken in the cause in hand for its correctness and completeness ought not to be nor under any existing system of law that i know of would be taken for conclusive much less a mere note of the testimony which they delivered on a former occasion subject perhaps indeed to the same set of securities but perhaps to a set in any degree inferior to those which there may in the cause in hand be the means of subjecting them to the case of a decision is more complicated for the purpose of a prior cause a decision has been given which supposes proof made of a certain fact and the question is whether on the ground of such decision such fact shall be taken for true—shall be considered as being sufficiently and conclusively proved—for the purpose of the decision to be given in a posterior cause it must of course be assumed that the prior decision necessarily supposes evidence of the fact in question to have been presented to the judge sufficient to create in his mind a persuasion of its existence for there would be manifest impropriety in making the decision conclusive evidence of any fact not absolutely necessary to its legality with whatever degree of probability the existence of such fact might be inferred from it   let the parties be the same and the tribunal either the same tribunal or one in which the same or equally efficient securities are taken for rectitude of decision in this case unless where a new trial of the former cause would be proper the decision in the former cause ought to be taken as conclusive evidence for the purpose of the posterior cause of every fact proof of which it necessarily implies a lawyer would say quia interest reipublicæ ut sit finis litium not choosing to content myself with vague and oracular generalities which are as susceptible of being employed in defence of bad arrangements     of procedure as of good ones i place the propriety of the rule upon the following more definite ground that as every person who would have an opportunity of applying the security of counterinterrogation in the second cause has had such an opportunity in the first—and as the rules of evidence which were observed in the former trial were by supposition as well calculated for the extraction of the truth as those which would be to be acted upon in the present—the judge on the second occasion would have no advantage in seeking after the truth over the judge on the first to counterbalance the disadvantage necessarily consequent upon lapse of time and the decision of the first judge though strictly speaking it be only evidence of evidence is more likely to be correct than that which the second judge might pronounce on the occasion of the posterior cause the case is different if fresh evidence happen to have been brought to light subsequently to the first trial or if there be any reason for suspecting error or mala fides on the part of the first judge but in either of these cases a new trial of the former cause would be proper if the fact be sufficiently established for the purpose of the first cause it is sufficiently established for the purpose of any subsequent cause between the same parties it is only when there appears reason to think that it was improperly considered as established in the first cause that there can be any use in going through the trouble of establishing it again in the second the above remarks apply also to the case in which the parties to the second cause are not the actual parties to the first but persons who claim in their right—their executors for example or heirsatlaw or even persons claiming under the same deed or in any other way upon the same title all those in short who in english law language are quaintly called privies in blood in estate and in law for though these have not had an opportunity of crossexamining the witnesses in the former cause other persons representing the same interest have   suppose the parties different that is with different interests and the same reasons do not apply the deficiency in respect of securities for trustworthiness which constitutes the inferiority of adseititious evidence may now have place to an indefinite extent and is always likely to have place to some extent it will very often happen that there was some part of the facts known to the witnesses in the former cause which would have made in favour of one or other party to the present cause but which did not come to light because there being no one among the parties to the former cause in whose favour it would have made it found no one to draw it out by interrogation the former decision therefore although conclusive against the parties to the former cause and all who claim under them ought not to be conclusive against a third party if it were an opportunity would be given for a particular modification of the characteristic fraud a feigned suit instituted by one conspirator against another and judgment suffered by the latter to go against him with the view of establishing a false fact to be afterwards made use of in a suit against some other person the above observations constitute what foundation there is for the rule of english law that res inter alios acta is not evidence—of which hereafter note en passant the character of jurisprudential logic a decision inter alios is not conclusive evidence therefore not admissible   lastly suppose the tribunals different and governed by different rules and let the rules of the tribunal which tried the first cause be less calculated to insure rectitude of decision than those of the tribunal which tries the second in this case with or without the deficiency in point of security arising from the difference of the parties there is at any rate the deficiency which arises from the imperfection of the rules the impropriety therefore of making the decision conclusive is manifest its probative force will evidently vary in proportion to the imperfection of the rules which govern the practice of the court by which it was pronounced always considered with reference to the main end—rectitude of decision the probative force will be greater cæteris paribus when the court from which the evidence is borrowed is in the same than when it is in a different country on account of the greater difficulty in the latter case of obtaining proof of the existence of the characteristic fraud but this presumption is much less strong than that which arises from a difference in the mode of extraction we shall see hereafter to how great an extent nearly all the above rules are violated in english law chapter iii of unoriginal evidence in general the quality of unoriginality seems applicable to an article of evidence in either of two cases   where it is so with relation to persons—to persons considered as sources of the evidence   when it is so in respect of signs it is so as to persons wherever the perceptions stated by the person whose evidence is rendered present to the senses of the judge are stated by him as being not his own perceptions or opinions but perceptions or opinions communicated to him by some other   0 person as and for the perceptions of that other had the perceptions or opinions been stated by him as his own they might have been termed original not being stated by him as his own they cannot with propriety be termed original—they are termed not original but unoriginal in himself if he says truly they did not originate but in the other person so spoken of the evidence is unoriginal in respect of signs when the signs i e the collection of visible and permanent signs viz written characters presented to the senses of the judge are not the same collection of signs by which the discourse in question stood expressed when consigned to writing for the first time not these but some others which—having been transcribed from those in the design of rendering so far as both go the signification of the copy thus made exactly the same as that of the original—may accordingly be termed transcriptitious the evidence orally delivered and of the nature of what is called hearsay evidence—the evidence delivered in writing and of the nature of a transcript—in both these cases it may alike be termed unoriginal in both instances it is understood at once that in point of probative force the unoriginal evidence will be in a greater or less degree inferior to the original but in the two cases the defalcation made by the circumstance of nonoriginality from the probative force of the evidence will immediately be seen to be generally speaking widely different such as our conceptions are such ever must language be in vain on any subject will that man seek to add anything material either to the correctness or to the amplitude of the current stock of conceptions who fears the reproach of the endeavour to make additions to the language a subject must have a name before anything can be predicated of it and of the subject be it what it may till something is predicated nothing will be understood among nonlawyers as well as among lawyers the word hearsay is already in use among lawyers the word original and the word copy are in use with so slender a stock of the instruments of discourse has the business of argumentation and thence the business of judicial decision been hitherto carried on in this part of the field of law even of so slender a stock—a stock comprised of three words and no more—there exists one which is not fit for use by reason of its ambiguity the word copy is not fit for use does it mean transcript in contradistinction to the original script or does it mean exemplar as in the case when in a mass of letterpress all may be equally originals or all equally transcripts such as yet is the supply here follows a part at least of the demand in the case of want of originality it has already been observed the seat of the defect may be in the person by whom the evidence is delivered or in the case when at the time of delivery it wears the form of writing in the collection of signs of which the writing is composed when the seat of the defect is in the person—when upon his own showing the deposing witness is a different person from him by whom the matters of fact in question were observed—in this case there are at least two persons upon whose trustworthiness the probative force of the testimony depends—two persons so connected that by the reduplication the probative force far from being increased is lessened of the deposing witness the existence is by the supposition certain of the alleged percipient witness—of any percipient witness the existence is necessarily and constantly a matter of doubt on this account it is that without some such prefix as the word supposed he ought never to be mentioned instead of supposed percipient witness the occasion may sometimes require us to say the supposed extrajudicially stating or narrating witness for neither are the terms synonymous nor the persons in every case the same in the character of a percipient witness a man will not generally speaking have made himself known to the deposing witness unless by having made himself an extrajudicially narrating reporting or stating witness but in the character of an extrajudicially narrating reporting or stating witness a man may easily have certified himself to the deposing witness without having been a percipient or observant witness notions other than such as can strictly speaking be termed perceptions may moreover be not altogether without their use in evidence and useful or useless they may serve to constitute the matter of which evidence is composed of the persons through whose mouths the supposed statement of the supposed percipient or originally extrajudicially narrating witness may from one to the other have passed or be supposed to have passed the number may to any amount be great under french judicature in the famous case of calas between the supposed precipient and the deposing witness there were no fewer than five so many of these supposed successive narrators including the deposing witness so many media through which the supposed perception has been transmitted in its way to the ear or the eye of the judge so many     media of which one alone is judicial the others extrajudicial by every extrajudicial medium the evidence is removed—removed by one remove—from that degree of proximity which it were desirable it should possess and which in the case of ordinary evidence it does possess with reference to the eye or the ear of the judge equal to the number of media as above may be said to be the number of degrees equal to the number of media and degrees minus one may be said to be the number of removes media degrees removes with equal propriety and in the same sense though with very different effect and with much less force does this nomenclature apply to the case of transcriptitious evidence and thus it is that in either case constitutive of so many modifications or species of unoriginal evidence we have unimedial bimedial trimedial and so forth in a word multimedial evidence the two sources or causes of inferiority the two modes of unoriginality may be combined in the same lot or article of evidence thus for species or modifications of multimedial evidence we have simple composed either of multipersonal alone consisting of person supposed to have spoken after person or of transcriptural alone and complex composed of both those modes of unoriginality put together not of personal evidence alone but of real also may originality and unoriginality be both predicated real evidence is original—is originally delivered—when the thing which is the source of it is itself presented to the senses of the judge unoriginal when all the conception he can entertain concerning it is that which is conveyed to his mind through the medium of the testimony of a witness—commonly a deposing witness the shape in which the testimony of the deposing witness is conveyed to the senses of the judge may be either the oral or the written shape hence it is that when there has been no transcription scriptitious may stand exactly upon a footing with hearsay as well as with original evidence when the testimony being unoriginal is composed of that of two persons one as it were behind the other—the form in which the respective testimonies have been delivered viz oral or scriptitious is a circumstance by which differences which require to be noted may be produced in the probative force of the compound testimony in the case where the supposed original evidence is of the real kind in that case the species of inferiority which in the case of personal evidence requires two persons two witnesses to the production of it is produced by the testimony of a single witness interposed between the thing which is the source of the evidence and the senses of the judge after these explanations the following modifications of unoriginal evidence may it is supposed be rendered sufficiently intelligible by the denominations here employed for giving expression to them   supposed oral through oral supposed orally delivered evidence of a supposed extrajudicially narrating witness judicially delivered vivâ voce by the judicially deposing witness this is the only species of unoriginal evidence which the term hearsay evidence is strictly speaking competent to the expression of   supposed oral through scriptitious   supposed scriptitious through oral   supposed scriptitious through scriptitious in other words transcriptitious evidence in all four cases the supposed original testimony must in whichever shape delivered be supposed to have been extrajudicially delivered in all these four cases an interval of considerable length must moreover be supposed to have intervened between the supposed extrajudicial statement and the judicial one suppose no such interval and the evidence stands to every practical effect undistinguishable from original evidence   thus in the case of supposed oral through oral a percipient witness being in or near the judicatory delivers his testimony in a low tone and this evidence not being sufficiently audible is by some other person suppose an officer of the court repeated in a more audible tone for the convenience of the judge   so again in the case of supposed oral through scriptitious this would be the common case of notetaking deposition of a percipient witness extracted vivâ voce before a judicatory notes or minutes thereof taken by a clerk and the minutes delivered in to another in this case the word supposed would it is evident be regarded as superfluous or illplaced the notetaker unless specially interrogated would not be considered in the character of a distinct deposing witness   so again in the case of supposed scriptitious through oral this would be no more than the common case of written evidence read in court for example an affidavit here too the use for the adjunct supposed vanishes   lastly in the case of supposed scriptitious through scriptitious the witness having read to himself on one day a document capable of being adduced in evidence parts with it immediately out of his hands on the next day from memory he in a judicial     form interrogated or not writes an account of what according to him are the contents this is supposed scriptitious through scriptitious and he the writer is a witness but while he is thus writing his account of the contents suppose the paper to be lying before him this is no longer the case of a reporting witness simply reporting if extrajudicially or deposing if judicially to the contents of a statement made by another person who is considered in the character of a percipient and extrajudicially narrating witness it is the case of a scribe and according as in his script words the same as those employed in the original or words more or less different are employed his script is a transcript an extract or an abridgment thus various and thus faint are the shades of difference by which one modification of unoriginal evidence is distinguished from another all modifications of unoriginal evidence that are of the nature of or bear similitude to hearsay evidence as above have this in common—that for every remove mendacity and fraud out of the question they afford an additional chance of incorrectness and incompleteness but besides this—supposing admission to be secured to them and known to be so—they afford all of them invitation to one and the same plan of fraud which fraud is moreover equally applicable to casuallywritten and ex parte preappointed evidence secure not only against punishment but against adverse interrogation the extrajudicial narrator and supposed percipient witness delivers his statement vivâ voce or in writing as the case may be that statement being tinctured with mendacity in the shape that seems best adapted to the sinister purpose whatever that may be the extrajudicially narrating witness has contrived for the purpose to place himself if he be not so already out of the reach of punishment the judicially deposing witness so long as he reports nothing but what has to his knowledge been expressed by the extrajudicially narrating witness is not punishable since by the supposition he says nothing that is not true chapter iv of supposed oral evidence transmitted through oral or hearsay evidence so many features belong in common to extrajudicially written and to hearsay evidence that what would have been necessary to have been said on the subject of this lastmentioned species of evidence had it been considered before the other is by what has been already said on the subject of the other rendered unnecessary to be said here it is of the essence of hearsay evidence to present to the notice of the judge two distinct persons in the character of witnesses a supposed percipient and extrajudicially narrating witness stating at some antecedent point of time in the hearing of any person not on that occasion invested with the authority of a judge some matter of fact as having had place and a deposing or say judicially narrating witness who hears testimony not to the truth of that matter of fact but to its having actually been asserted on the extrajudicial occasion in question by the extrajudicially stating or narrating witness so distinct are the two characters and to the purposes of truth and justice so material to be distinguished that while the one viz that of the deposing witness is in every individual instance filled by a really existent person—the other viz that of the percipient or extrajudicially stating or narrating witness may happen to be a character altogether fictitious the person it may happen is fictitious or though the person be at the time in question a person really existing the statement or narration and alleged perceptions attributed to that really existing person may on the whole or as to any part be fictitious to the statement or narration judicially delivered by the deposing witness and to that alone belongs therefore in propriety of speech the denomination of hearsay evidence     supposed extrajudicially stating or narrating witnesses may have stood in a series of any length one behind another the causes of untrustworthiness applying to every human being and to every being of which nothing more is known than that he or she is human with equal force—it is evident that the longer the line of these supposed witnesses the less is the probative force of their supposed testimony of the case which exhibits more such supposed extrajudicial witnesses than one what little requires to be said will be said in another place throughout the course of the present chapter no more than one will be supposed of whatever is said under this head it will be easy to make application to the whole possible series of those other cases supposing as above one and no more than one supposed extrajudicially stating or narrating witness—the character of the testimony will be found to admit of nine variations the supposed testimony of the supposed extrajudicial witness under each of three characters being capable of being deposed to by the deposing witness under each of the same three characters thus i by an extraneous deposing witness may be related the supposed extrajudicially delivered testimony of the three sorts of extrajudicial witnesses viz   another extraneous witness   a party on that side of the cause on which the hearsay evidence is not called for   a party on that side of the cause on which the hearsay evidence is called for ii by a party on that side on which the hearsay evidence is not called for may in like manner be related the supposed extrajudically delivered testimony of the same three descriptions of persons viz   an extraneous witness   another party on that side of the cause on which the testimony of the hearsay witness is not called for   a party on that side of the cause on which the hearsay evidence is called for iii lastly by a party on the side of the cause on which the hearsay evidence is called for may in like manner be related the supposed extrajudicially delivered testimony of the same three descriptions of persons viz   an extraneous witness   a party on that side of the cause on which the hearsay evidence is not called for   another party on that side of the cause on which the hearsay evidence is called for in the case of hearsay evidence the particular description of the characteristic fraud above mentioned the fraud applying in common to every species of makeshift evidence is as follows under the assurance of his not being subjectable to eventual punishment or to counterinterrogation a man utters vivâ voce on some extrajudicial occasion and place a statement or narration of the incorrectness or partial incompleteness of which he himself is conscious† in regard to admission and the terms on which it shall take place the rules which have been seen applying to extrajudicially written evidence will be found to apply to hearsay evidence without any difference considerable enough to render it worth while to exhibit those rules in the case of hearsay evidence at the same length as those regarding extrajudicially written evidence the considerations from which in the character of reasons these rules were deduced being the same so of course will be the rules the only difference which there is turns so far as concerns admission upon the magnitude of the danger the danger from admission under the two species of makeshift evidence of which difference the delineation will constitute the matter of a following chapter in rule the sixth and last may be seen that     which presents itself as the only instance in which the reasons in favour of the admission recommended by it seem to require in the case of hearsay evidence ulterior delineation over and above such as correspond with those that have been already brought to view under the head of extrajudicially and casually written evidence insulated the alleged extrajudicial statement or narration of an alleged percipient witness will be little in danger of obtaining credence to such a degree as if false to be productive of deception in connexion with other evidence it may be necessary for the explanation and completion of an aggregate body of connected evidence as in the case of a chain of facts following each other in a series and composing together a body of circumstantial evidence such may in some degree be the use of the makeshift document even in the case of extrajudicially and casually written evidence but more particularly it may be observed in favour of the proposed admission of hearsay evidence that if on the occasion of what passed in a conversation between two interlocutors the discourse of one be excluded that of the other will frequently be unintelligible an incident the probable frequency of which is the same whether relation had to that one of the interlocutors whose discourse it might be proposed to exclude the tendency of the discourse were selfdisserving or selfserving chapter v instructions concerning the probative force of extrajudicially written and hearsay evidence that which ought in scarce any case to be done and is most abundantly done it has already been observed is to put an exclusion upon evidence on the ground of danger of deception that which ought throughout to be done and nowhere has been done is—if legislation be the work of reflection and reflection pointed to right ends—to give the benefit of it in the form of instructions to the judge to bring to view such considerations as on the occasion in question present themselves as capable of being in that character assistant to the judge if not in the way of information in the way of reminiscence—is the object of the present section i supposing admission given to both and on the same conditions—hearsay evidence is less likely than extrajudicially written evidence to have originated in the characteristic fraud and in so far as its incorrectness or incompleteness is regarded as not to be apprehended otherwise than as the result of such plan of fraud is less untrustworthy—may with propriety be considered as acting with a greater degree of probative force the only case in which from either species of makeshift and thence uninterrogable evidence any advantage would be to be hoped for is that of a posthumous advantage—an advantage not looked to as capable of accruing during the lifetime of the contriver to be reaped by the contriver himself but after his death to his family or some other person whose interests are dear to him for as to the man himself if he be in esse a reasonable condition to require of him wheresoever he be at home or abroad is that he submit to counterinterrogation which if he do his doing so makes in both cases an end of the makeshift evidence in this case to make a species of evidence which shall be exempt from counterinterrogation as well as eventual punishment he has his choice between casually written evidence and hearsay evidence suppose him to choose casually written evidence this it being by the supposition admissible is that one of the two that will afford him the best chance if he writes it himself in the name of another person not privy this will be an act of forgery a punishable offence committed in the first instance in prospect of a benefit expected to accrue to others and at a time when he will not be able to enjoy it if for the writing it he engages an assistant who is privy to the fraud and who writes it in his own character—here indeed is no forgery but here is a fraud with an accomplice in whose power the contriver puts himself if he writes it himself in his own person—here is no forgery nor is there any person in whose power he puts himself this supposing both species of makeshift evidence receivable viz casually written and hearsay     is in both points of view probability of success and security against punishment the most eligible thus stands the plan of fabrication by means of makeshift evidence on the supposition that casually written evidence is to be the instrument employed in it in this way a man may use his endeavours to render an undue service to persons dear to him even without subjecting the evidence to the discreditive observation of its being selfserving evidence if it be a case in which their title cannot be derived but through himself they taking in quality of his representatives no but the right which he thus fraudulently conveys may be drawn by him from another source a father for example may by a fraud thus shaped convey to his son an estate derived not from the fathers side but from the mothers suppose revenge or gratification of causeless enmity the posthumous benefit—the sole benefit—in view here the testimony stands not exposed to any such discreditive observation as the above in this may be seen by far the most promising in other words the most deceptitious shape which the characteristic fraud can assume if in this it be not too deceptitious to be admitted in no other can it be hearsay evidence renders an assistant necesary the contriver of the fraud utters the statement or narration in the hearing of the assistant so long as the contriver lives the assistant is silent for such silence is what as above the nature of the fraud requires the contriver dead then for the purpose of giving effect to the benefit which though to him a posthumous one the contriver had in view comes the assistant forward with his hearsay evidence the inferiority of this species of makeshift evidence in comparison with the other may be seen in more points of view than one if the assistant dies before the contriver or though not till afterwards before his hearsay evidence has been judicially derived—the plan is defeated so if he expatriates or forgets his lesson or quarrels with the contriver so much as to comparative probability of success meantime the contriver exposes himself to loss of character and if the law has done its duty to punishment through the infidelity of his assistant the assistant it is true so it may easily be managed need not be privy to the fraud to the intended assistant the false story is narrated as if it were true in this way danger of punishment through infidelity is avoided but danger of ill success by reason of death and expatriation remain the same danger of ill success through quarrel not much less but the danger from forgetfulness is much greater the cause of remembrance being wanting taking a memorandum might it is true be recommended by the contriver to the intended innocent assistant or a memorandum put into his hand but this circumstance would be still more likely to be remembered than any other and in the mind of the judge if not in that of the innocent assistant in his character of deposing witness it would cast a shade of suspicion upon the scheme the number of innocent persons thus taken for intended assistants might be multiplied to any amount but by no such multiplication could hearsay evidence in the character of an instrument of this fraud be raised to an equality with a letter or memorandum in writing framed with a view to its officiating in the character of an article of extrajudicially written evidence of the authenticity of a script framed for any such express purpose proof cannot in the nature of the case be wanting where adequate cause of rememberance is wanting a story told is liable to be lost whatsoever be the number of the hearers in point of probability of remembrance the difference between the seeing of a fact and hearing a relation of it is plainly infinite ii setting aside in both instances the characteristic fraud and purposed mendacity to whatever purpose directed hearsay evidence seems in general more likely to be fainted and moreover in a higher degree with material incorrectness and incompleteness than extrajudicially written evidence is extrajudicially written evidence presents but one witness in whose person the causes of untrustworthiness intellectual and moral sinisteraction of interest included are liable to have place it requires indeed to be authenticated a distinct purpose for which evidence is necessary but in general authentication is a matter little exposed to doubt and moreover proveable by witnesses in abundance none of whom are exposed to the action of any of the causes of untrustworthiness hearsay evidence presents always two witnesses viz the deposing witness and unless when the deposition is a mere fiction the supposed extrajudicially stating or narrating witness two witnesses and the causes of untrustworthiness repeatable upon each in case of mendacity on the part of the deposing witness the evidence is exposed to a cause of falsehood against which the extrajudicially written evidence is comparatively secure the fact that by such or such a person such or such words or words to such or such an effect were spoken is a fact of the evanescent kind—not of a nature to leave behind it in any case any physical traces capable of operating if it be true in confirmation of it in the character of circumstantial evidence     even in case of veracity on the part of the deposing witness the evidence is exposed to a cause of error to which extrajudicially written evidence is not exposed in the case of extrajudicially written evidence the discourse being in written or other permanent characters the tenor of it is fixed whereas in the case of hearsay evidence especially if the discourse run into length it is frequently impossible for the deposing witness to speak to the very words and then comes the uncertainty whether of the words really spoken the purport attributed to them by the deposing witness be a faithful representation—whether and how far the interpretation put upon them by the deposing witness is correct to multiply in this way the number of hearers not under any engagement of secrecy will be to multiply the number of persons by whose conversation the story may be conveyed to some who will know it to be a lie viewing at the same time in the person of the contriver the author of that lie thus of a story which can be of no use to his purpose till after his death the credit will have been destroyed in his lifetime upon the whole it appears that so long as the supposed extrajudicial witness is not exempted from crossexamination mischief in the way of misdecision would often ensue from the exclusion either of casually written or of hearsay evidence and no adequate danger is to be apprehended from the admission of it if indeed the extrajudicial witness were exempted from crossexamination and his unsanctioned and unscrutinized statement or in the case of hearsay evidence his supposed statement were received during his lifetime in the place of his judicial testimony much danger of misdecision would be the result—for in this case as any sort of man the most untrustworthy might for the purpose of any suit whatsoever without any the smallest danger to himself make evidence either for his own purpose or for the purpose of any one who suborned him—such evidence being on every occasion at the command of any person would in point of trustworthiness in the eye of reason be worth nothing if then on this consideration it were never to receive credence in any case justice would be deprived of the benefit of it in all such cases in which had it been adduced it would have been true and as such conducive to the ends of justice if on the other hand it were in general to be admitted and receive credence it would be but too apt to be received in cases in which it would be false and deceptitious the known security with which it might be manufactured and exhibited would occasion its being manufactured in a multitude of instances without stint false claims in a number altogether unlimited would be set up on the mere ground of the support to be given to them by this evidence and since the nature of the evidence admits scarce any means or chance of distinguishing false from true the number might be so great that in every instance in which credence were given to this sort of evidence deception and consequent misdecision on the part of the judge would be a result more probable than the contrary here then would be a double mischief the two opposite mischiefs of undue credence and undue discredence running on at the same time out of twenty false claims set up on the ground of this evidence suppose it to obtain credence in one only and to be discredited in the nineteen others the amount of the injustice thus done in the one case out of twenty would itself be an enormous evil this evil would be the result of undue credence but the nineteen instances in which it were discredited would be sufficient to throw a general and to a considerable degree indiscriminating discredit upon this species of evidence the consequence would be its being discredited in a number of instances in which it being true the discredit thus cast upon it would be productive of misdecision and injustice true it is that—on the supposition that it were generally known to be admissible when from death or other causes the extrajudicial witnesses were no longer exposed to crossexamination—motives for the fabrication of it in the hopes of its serving a mans purpose after his death would not be altogether wanting but as in such case the inducement for the fabrication of it would in comparison be extremely feeble the quantity of it fabricated if any would be proportionably inconsiderable the instances if any in which it were thus fabricated and false would scarcely be equal in number to the instances in which it would be true and conducive or even necessary to the fulfilment of the ends of justice but in the instances in which it were false it would not follow by any means that because admitted it must obtain credence and be regarded as conclusive the possibility of its having originated     in the characteristic fraud would be an obvious objection—a species of psychological circumstantial evidence that could never fail to be opposed to it and being by the supposition false it would find itself counterevidenced and opposed at the same time by as many true facts as happened to be brought forward by whatever true evidence the cause happened to afford under these circumstances there seems little danger of its being taken for more in each given case than in that same case it were really worth no more in the case of this transmitted evidence than in the case of immediate evidence chapter vi of supposed written evidence transmitted through oral or memoriter evidence the supposed written evidence may either be of the nature of casually written evidence or of written preappointed evidence private or public contractual or official its trustworthiness will accordingly be varied according to the nature of its supposed source the medium through which it is transmitted being supposed the same in both cases when the alleged writing supposing it oral is of the nature of casually written evidence the report thus made of it from memory it is evident be the reporter who he may be he in all respects ever so trustworthy must in trustworthiness be inferior to what the article of casually written evidence would have been had it itself and without passing through any such medium been presented to the senses of the judge in the case of memoriter evidence of this description the characteristic fraud is this—for his own advantage or for the advantage of a person dear privy or not privy stellio having fabricated or altered a script puts it in the way of memor and then withdraws it again to the end that memor having informed himself of the contents may on being judicially examined report them in the character of a memoriter witness in respect of trustworthiness the characteristic fraud out of the question in a general point of view this species of transmitted evidence may be apt to appear scarce distinguishable from the more ordinary modification supposed oral through oral i e hearsay evidence in the supposed source of information consists the only difference the medium the chief source of deception is the same on a closer examination it will present some not altogether inconsiderable differences resulting principally from the nature of the script as above diversified to understand the relation and measure the difference a distinction must be made between the danger of mendacity and the danger of incorrectness in the case of a supposed script amounting if genuine to no more than an article of casually written evidence much of course will depend upon the particular nature of the script if it be altogether anomalous such as a letter or a loose memorandum made not in the way of any regular business—the difference in this respect between feigned memoriter evidence and feigned hearsay evidence will be scarce discernible if it belong to any regular class of scripts such as the shopbook of a shopkeeper or any book of accounts kept in regular form though by a person not embarked in any profitseeking occupation—the sphere of mendacious invention will be proportionably confined to obtain credit the supposed script according to the mendacious account given of it must wear a certain degree of conformity to scripts of the like sort it must be so far consistent with those true facts which the nature of the case cannot but afford as not to be exposed to receive contradiction on the ground of improbability from circumstantial evidence in the case where the script was or if it had been really existing would have been an article of preappointed evidence—say an article of contractual evidence a deed of conveyance—the field of mendacious invention is in general still more narrowly limited though in this respect much of course will depend upon the nature of the deed and so in the case of official evidence in the case of an article of contractual evidence a mans chance for succeeding in his plan of imposition will depend not only on his acquaintance with the circumstances of the parties or supposed parties but on his acquaintance with the dispositions made on that subject by the law in like manner in the case of an article of official evidence his success will naturally be more or less dependent on his acquaintance with the course of business as carried on in the particular office by this necessity of appropriate information as a condition sine quâ non to the planning     and carrying on an imposition of this kind with any promising prospect of success—not only is the source of danger reduced to the testimony of a comparatively narrow description of persons but to that sort of description of persons who by reason of mental culture and situation in life may naturally be expected to be above the ordinary level in point of trustworthiness in respect of the danger of incorrectness mendacity out of the question where as here the source of the evidence is a discourse fixed by the permanent signs of written discourse it seems to possess a probative force considerably stronger than ordinary hearsay evidence never consigned to writing in the case of a purely oral discourse the original received its birth and death at the same instant the impression left by it on the conception however faint cannot at any subsequent time be strengthened however incorrect it can never afterwards be corrected in the case of a discourse committed to writing what is possible indeed is that the glimpses caught by the eye may have been as faint or as incorrect as the glimpses caught by the ear in the other on the other hand nothing hinders but that the view taken of it may have been as attentive as correct and as often repeated as could be desired for the reason given above the chances in favour of correctness may naturally be expected to be in general somewhat greater in the case of the preappointed the contractual or official script than in the case of the purely casual article of written evidence in the case of the contractual species of script the deed of conveyance more especially the memory of the idiosyncratic particulars will naturally to a professional or in other words practised mind be assisted and the field of recollection narrowed by the general form of the species of deed—by those parts of the context which belong in common to deeds of that sort chapter vii of supposed oral evidence transmitted through written or minuted evidence if the person by whom the minute is supposed to have been taken be an official person acting in virtue of his office—and the discourse which he is committing to writing be the discourse of a person by whom on the delivery of it he is addressed in his official character—such evidence is a species of preappointed evidence—preappointed official evidence and in a word if the purpose for which or occasion on which the minute is thus made be a judicial purpose or a judicial occasion the discourse thus orally exhibited and minuted is neither more nor less than a mass of judicial testimony the minutes taken of the deposition of a judicial witness whether spontaneously exhibited or extracted by interrogatories—taken whether by the judge himself or by a scribe of his in his presence—belong to this head of evidence if the person by whom the minute is supposed to have been taken be not an official person this species of evidence is of a nature that presents itself as having been already included or at least as capable of being included under the denomination of casually written evidence if in a memorandum or letter mention be made of a supposed fact that fact may as well consist of a discourse supposed to have been holden by another person as of anything else if mentioned as being holden by another person it may be mentioned as being holden by him either at the very time of its being thus committed to writing as in the case of a judicial deposition or examination as above mentioned or at any preceding point of time separated from that point of time by any distance in general the judicially scrutinized testimony of any given person will in all points taken together be more trustworthy than the casually written evidence of the same person—a memorandum or letter written by him yet instances are not wanting in which casually written evidence will present a preponderant probability of standing the closest to the truth in the presence of oculatus a transaction takes place of which on that same day he gives an account in a letter to a friend suppose oculatus a man of probity and either not exposed to the influence of any sinister interest or too firm to be drawn aside by it and suppose at the same time that either discernment or accident has rendered his account of it not only correct as far as it goes but complete nothing can be more evident than that such a letter will present a much more satisfactory account of the matter than could reasonably be expected from the judicial testimony of the same person examined though in the best mode at a distance say of twenty or thirty years after the event cæteris paribus the chance which an article of casually written evidence has of being superior in trustworthiness to the judicial testimony of the same person will be in the direct ratio of the interval of time elapsed between the day of the event and the day of the examination†     the length of time as above being given—the advantage of the casually written evidence in comparison with the judicial testimony will be inversely as the apparent relative importance of the transaction the importance which it possesses in his eyes the real absolute importance will no otherwise contribute to strengthen in his mind the impression made by it than in as far as its eventual importance happens to be apparent to him and to be the same in the instance of that particular individual as it would be to an average individual in his place nor in ordinary instances at least will the importance of the fact any other than its relative importance with respect to the percipient witness himself that is to say its connexion real or supposed with his own happiness afford security for permanence and accuracy of recollection the state of the witnesss mind at the time is another circumstance by which the strength of the impression made by the transaction at the time and thence the strength and accuracy of his recollection of it cannot but be in a very considerable degree influenced if by business of a more interesting nature to himself his attention be pointed another way—especially if by the urgency of it in point of time his mind have been put into a hurry—the impression made by the transaction in question may be slight indistinct and fleeting and his recollection of it proportionably uncertain and confined although in other circumstances the impression made by a transaction of that same nature might have been sufficiently strong distinct and permanent a still better and in every case without exception a more trustworthy lot of evidence than can be constituted by judicial testimony alone how well soever the examination be conducted is that which consists of the judicial testimony of the same person with an article of casually written evidence of his inditing a letter or memorandum of his penning at the time or if after the sooner after it the better for his assistance the script being at the same time produced or at the demand of either party ready to be produced against incompleteness on either side there is the security afforded by examination and crossexamination against mendacity and bias on one side there is the security afforded by crossexamination against simple incorrectness on either side there is the security afforded by the fortunate script the fortunate letter or memorandum the article of casually written evidence this composite sort of evidence when the written element happens to present itself may be regarded as a sort of superordinary lot of evidence still better than that which in general passes under the denomination of the best but eligible as it is when it is to be had it would evidently be a vain arrangement to exact it in all cases or even to place it upon the footing of regular and ordinary evidence since the existence of it is merely fortuitous depending altogether upon the free pleasure and accidental disposition as well as literary endowments of the witness if it could be required by law it would come under the notion of preappointed evidence chapter viii of supposed written evidence transmitted through written or transcriptitious evidence §   a transcript what—modes of transcription on the occasion of this as of other modifications of transmitted evidence the main objects of inquiry are still two—  what shall be received and   whatever comes to be received by what consideration shall the estimate formed of it in respect of comparative trustworthiness be directed but previously to our entrance into this inquiry the bounds of the object must be previously fixed and its several modifications distinguished by a transcript taken in its largest sense may be understood any discourse which being expressed by permanent signs or characters is proposed as capable of producing in the way of evidence the same effect as another discourse which being also expressed by permanent signs is with reference to it termed the original under this most general description are comprehended three modifications—   a transcript which is such in tenor a copy taken verbatim et literatim   a transcript in purport only without being such in tenor couched in a set of words more or less different it contains what is looked upon as conveying precisely the same sense to this head belong translations made into other languages   a transcript in effect only not professing to contain so much as the purport of the original at any rate not the whole of the purport it professes to contain that which with reference to the purpose in question is sufficient for the purpose to this head belong extracts and abridgments   0 a transcript in tenor is a transcript both in purport and effect a transcript in purport is also a transcript in effect a transcript in tenor is that modification which seems the most apt to be presented by the word but the others have little less claim to consideration and they also may be naturally expected to be considered under this head let this be examined in the first place whatever is said in relation to this principal and most proper modification will serve as a model and standard of reference for whatever there may be occasion to say of the two others for making transcripts understand transcripts in tenor the word transcript being taken in the most extensive sense there are divers modes performed by so many correspondent operations not being altogether upon a par in respect of probability of correctness they require on that account to be distinguished—   one is writing in the more common and confined sense of the word writing with pen and ink this is the most in use except in the case where transcripts of the same original are required in large numbers as in the case of   printing including the oldestablished mode by moveable types and the mode of modern invention in solid masses called stereotypage   engraving in the case where the characters are to be taken off in the way of impression as in the ordinary case of engraving on copper pewter wood glass c   sculpture in the case where no impressions are meant to taken off   painting in various ways which is but an elaborate mode of writing comparatively of little use in the case of the recently invented mode of writing with two or more pens at once the distinction between original and transcript has it is evident no place except in so far as by an independent act of authentication one or more of such draughts or copies should come thus to be distinguished from the rest so in the case of the anteriorly invented mode of taking off impressions from writing as between one mode of transcription and another the probability of correctness fraud apart will depend on the following circumstances—   the number of persons employed in the making and verification of the transcript   the degree of attention requisite and naturally to be expected on the part of each   the degree of publicity with which errors in general will in the instance of each be likely to be known and noticed on all these accounts taken together printing seems to present a superior chance for correctness in comparison with writing† as by writing a transcript may for practical purposes be by means of due examination and verification put upon a level with the original so may printing and with still greater facility and certainty in the case of laws and all other documents of a public nature that are consigned to print the printed copies ought to be placed by appointment of law upon the same level as the original reason in the case of laws the printed copy is the only standard to which access is rendered possible to the people who at their peril are bound to pay obedience to them in whatsoever cases forgery in the way of writing is made punishable forgery in the way of printing for the same purpose ought to be made punishable in the same manner examples—   forgery of laws whether in the way of fabrication or falsification   forgery of a deed of administration such as proclamations nominations to offices orders issued to public functionaries   forgery of articles of intelligence or     advertisements in a newspaper published under the direct orders of government   forgery of articles of intelligence or advertisements in any private newspaper the appearance of the paper current under that title being counterfeited by a person other than the accustomed publisher reason in the case of fraud if any one of the possible modes of transcription were left unincluded in the penal consequences fraud in that shape would be without a check and being as often as it succeeds alike mischievous in whatever shape there is no reason why it should be exempted in one shape more than in another in regard to a transcript professing to be such in tenor a distinction must be taken between a transcript verified and a transcript unverified or which comes to the same thing not known to have been verified by a transcript verified in tenor i understand a transcript the conformity of which i e of the tenor of it to the tenor of the original has been sufficiently established for every judicial purpose at least for the judicial purpose to which on the occasion in question it is proposed to be applied verification is to a transcript what authentication is to an original by what means this effect may most advantageously be produced is a topic of consideration that may be posted off to a separate head with as much advantage and with as little inconvenience in this case as in that other and for the same reason supposing the transcript verified—verified according to the import of the term as just fixed—it thereby becomes dismissed in effect from the present subject it is alter et idem a perfect equivalent for the original it can no longer be considered with propriety—with consistency at least in the light of makeshift evidence what follows is therefore to be confined in its application to the case of a transcript not verified either not known to have been verified by any means or at least not known to have been verified by sufficient means §   sources of untrustworthiness in transcriptitious evidence hearsay and transcriptitious evidence compared in respect of probative force applied to transcriptural evidence the description of the characteristic fraud—the fraud liable to be practised without detection if the transmitted evidence were to be received on the same footing as the original—is as follows a man falsifies a real original or fabricates a spurious one to the end that a transcript here understand in tenor being made of it the effect of a forged script may be produced at the same time that the falsified or spurious original being destroyed and thence no longer producible the fraud may by that means pass undetected in the case of the characteristic fraud as above described the falsity so far as the written evidence is concerned is confined to the extrajudicial part of the evidence the object is distorted or a fallacious object is fabricated or the true one falsified but the medium for anything that appears is correct and pure here however as elsewhere though complicity on the part of the writer of the transcript privity which is as much as to say complicity is not of the essence of the fraud neither is it excluded by it the fraud may have been committed and having been committed may ultimately or for the time have succeeded whether the vice of the original was or was not known to the maker of the transcript at the time of his making it setting aside the characteristic fraud—in the case of this as of other transmitted evidence for one source of true information there are two sources of untrustworthiness and deception   if there be an original from whence the transcript was made that original may have been spurious fraudulently altered or simply incorrect   the pretended transcript may have had no original or being taken from an original may by fraud or by accident be incorrect to be spurious or incorrect whether from mendacious design or from accident is what may have happened it may be said to any single script considered in the character of an original or pretended original and on that account these causes of untrustworthiness ought not to be set down to the account of the supposed transcript as such true but in the case of a script purporting to be an original and chargeable either with spuriousness or incorrectness it may happen to it to wear upon the face of it marks of the spuriousness or marks of the incorrectness such as upon the face of a transcript would not be equally open to observation moreover—in the case where the script to present the appearance of an original would require to present the appearance of being authenticated for example by the person or persons whose discourse it purports to be with or without the signature of any other person or persons in the character of attesting witnesses—if the supposed transcript were without having been verified to be received on the same footing as an original—a person intending fraud would find a much better chance of success and safety in the making of a pretended transcript of the tenor in question than in the fabrication of a spurious original or the fraudulent alteration of a really existing one since the means of     detection capable of being afforded by the spurious signatures in the one case and the obliterations additions or substitutions in the other would all be avoided by the expedient of the pretended transcript so far as simple incorrectness the result of accident clear of design and mendacity is concerned this species of transmitted evidence supposed written through written will appear much superior in trustworthiness to hearsay evidence and that whether the supposed script which is the supposed source of the evidence or the indubitably existing script constituting the medium through which the other is supposed to be conveyed be considered   as to the supposed original whether really existing or not it may either be of the nature of preappointed evidence or of the nature of casually written evidence if it be of the nature of preappointed evidence the trustworthiness of the discourse contained in it is by the supposition placed in one way or other upon a superior footing the lowest footing on which it can stand is that of casually written evidence and this as hath already been seen presents in the nature of it a security against incorrectness superior to that which naturrally belongs to oral discourse writing in the very nature of the operation requires a degree of attention and recollection more than is required in speaking   on the part of that one of the two persons concerned whose writing constitutes the medium through which the supposed tenor of the original is transmitted—the superiority of this modification of transmitted evidence as well over supposed oral through oral as supposed written through oral is easily discernible   in the case of supposed oral through oral—the judicially reporting witness at the time when the supposed extrajudicial statement presented itself to his ear caught it as he could—caught it as it flew he may have misconceived it from the first—he may have forgotten it in any part or misrecollected it afterwards the writer of the transcript has the original all along before him and commits not to writing so much as a word till he is satisfied that his conception of it is just and no sooner is a word thus fixed than the preservation of it is placed on a ground much stronger than any that could be given to it by the firmest memory   in the case of supposed written through oral—the judicially reporting witness may or may not have had his own time for the forming of his conceptions in relation to the contents of the script but let the time actually taken by him have been ever so sufficient—whether with any and what degree of correctness those conceptions have at the time of his deposition been preserved depends altogether upon the power the relative power of his memory supposing fraud entirely out of the question—in a practical view the trustworthiness of a transcript will be but little inferior to an original there are two cases in which an error is of no practical importance   when the words it falls upon are of no practical importance   when though the importance of the words it falls upon be ever so considerable the correction requisite for it is sufficiently indicated by the context the oftener a series of words comes to be repeated the less probable it is that an unintentional error in respect to any given words should be repeated in each instance and if there be but a single instance in which it fails of being repeated the true reading remaining in that instance will commonly serve for the correction of the false readings in all the others this of course will hold equally good whether in the original script the repetitions were or were not necessary to the purpose hence an advantage resulting from repetitions that otherwise would be useless an advantage though such a one as shrinks to nothing when compared with the disadvantages the more rare it is for a mere unintentional error of the transcriber to be productive of an incurable error in the sense the stronger the indication given of fraud where the error is material and material in such a way as to be subservient to any assignable sinister purpose on the part of the transcriber the faculty of conception being so amply assisted and the use of the faculty of remembrance superseded—whatever danger of incorrectness from this source remains open depends upon the accidental deficiency of the faculty of attention from the consideration that this is the faculty most exposed to fail some light may be thrown on the question which of the three shapes omission substitution addition in case of honest incorrectness the inaccuracy seems most likely to take   omission presents itself as being the most natural on the part of any given word in the original a momentary failure of attention to that word may have a correspondent omission for the result and in this case if a failure of the conception be altogether out of the question a larger portion of a line may with almost equal probability—an entire line with still greater probability be the result   substitution of one word for another in general by means of the substitution of this or that particular letter for another seems nearly if not altogether as probable as simple omission what renders it the more probable is that this species of inaccuracy is     more apt than the preceding to originate in misconception it may be referable in a greater or less degree to misconception if the transcriber being a man sufficiently acquainted with the subject to form a judgment the transcript deviating in this way from the original presents notwithstanding an intelligible sense if the sentence altogether presents either no sense at all or none but what is plainly absurd and irrational the transcriber not being altogether disqualified from judging it is to a failure of attention and that alone that the inaccuracy seems referable   addition of a word—insertion of a word to which no correspondent word exists in the original—is a mode of inaccuracy not altogether without example but much less frequently exemplified than either of the two others judgment attention applied to the subject applied to the original script cannot be the cause of an inacuracy of this nature the cause of it when it does take place must be sought for in the imagination it must be considered as a product of the imagination a production which finds its way into the transcript for want of that attentive comparison with the original which by showing the original to have no such part in it would be sufficient to prevent it from being admitted into the transcript the use and object of the above distinctions in so far as they may be found just is to give facility to the detection of fraud—to serve for the distinguishing of a case of fraud from a case of honest incorrectness if in general insertion be in any degree less apt to originate in accident than either omission or substitution—then—if in any individual instance insertion should happen to have been discovered—in that instance should any marks of design which here is as much as to say of fraud be discovered this particularly may perhaps be added to that side of the account §   in what cases and on what conditions shall a transcript be received in evidence a script being tendered in evidence in the character of a transcript from another that other spoken of in the character of an original—shall it or shall it not be received for the purpose of an answer to this question seven cases must in the first place be distinguished— i the alleged original is in existence producible or consultable and known to be so ii the alleged original is in a state of expatriation iii the alleged original is in a state of exprovinciation iv the alleged original is known to have existed but is known to be no longer in existence v the alleged original is known to have existed but whether it be still in existence or not is uncertain vi it is not known whether the alleged transcript be a transcript or not i e whether there ever existed a script from which in the character of a transcript its existence was derived vii the alleged original is known to be in existence but in the power of the adverse party to meet these possible modifications in the relative situation of the lot of evidence there are three modifications of which the conduct of the judge in relation to it is susceptible   it may be received absolutely and unconditionally   it may be rejected absolutely and unconditionally   it may be received conditionally or according to circumstances say received sub modo this last course will upon the whole he found in most cases the most advantageous one case i the original known to be producible or consultable rule   where the original is at the time producible or accessible no transcript or alleged transcript ought to be received without some special reason reason because in point of trustworthiness and with a view to the danger of misdecision no transcript can ever be strictly speaking exactly upon a par with the original if then the original be produced at the same time the transcript except in the cases immediately following is superfluous and the     vexation and expense incident to the production of it uncompensated if the original be not produced the transcript may be deceptitious rule   where on the occasion in question the original cannot without a considerable degree of difficulty be referred to and perused—in such case a transcript in tenor purport or effect as the case may be may be exhibited in addition to the original and at the same time—examples   the original in respect of obsoleteness of language or handwriting or both difficult to be conceived or perused and read with fluency   the original conceived in a language dead or living other than the current language in this case the transcript will be a transcript not in tenor but in purport or effect   where not the whole of the original but a particular part or parts only are applicable to the purpose in question in the character of evidence especially if the relevant portions be more or less scattered and distant from each other in this case the transcript is of the nature of an extract or abridgment a transcript neither in tenor nor throughout at least in purport but only in effect rule   so where on the hearing of the cause for the convenience of consultation a number of copies are wanted at the same time rule   for special preponderant reason a transcript may in every instance under appropriate conditions be received instead of the original rule   such reason will in every instance be reducible to some one or more of the modifications of collateral judicial inconvenience viz delay vexation or expense considered as resulting from the production or consultation of the original over and above what would result from the production or consultation of the supposed transcript rule   of the cases in which it may happen that the production of the original in the first instance shall be productive of preponperant inconvenience in the shape of delay vexation and expense the following may be examples—   where at the time in question it happens to be lodged in a place out of the dominions of the state   or in a place within some province beyond sea or other widely distant province—viz with reference to the seat of the tribunal to which the evidence is to be presented   where the original script in question forms part of a volume which cannot conveniently be removed from the repository in which it is kept by reason that other parts of its contents are requisite to be kept in that same place for other purposes rule   when for the avoidance of delay vexation or expense a transcript is received in the place of the original its faithfulness ought to have been previously established in the most trustworthy manner or—if for the avoidance of delay vexation and expense not in the manner the most trustworthy of all—in the manner the next most trustworthy that shall be compatible with the avoidance of a preponderant degree of such collateral inconvenience rule   with reference to the adverse party—the party against whom the lot of evidence is produced—its fidelity will have been established in the most satisfactory manner when such adverse party by himself or his more competent agents having upon sufficient opportunity of access compared the transcript with the original finds the transcript equivalent in every respect to the original in point of effect rule   but no script ought ever to be received except as by the next rule in the character of a transcript in lieu of the original as above from the hands of any suitor without a declaration upon oath on the part of him or his lawagent declaring the fact of his having examined it by the original and of the persuasion he entertains of its fidelity rule  0 if the transcript—having been examined by the original and appearing upon the face of it so to have been by some appropriate official person—has thereupon been certified to be correct—the party so tendering it in evidence is not bound so to reexamine it but neither in this case should the declaration of his own persuasion respecting the fidelity of it be omitted although such persuasion have no other ground than the general consideration of the security afforded by this species of preappointed evidence reason   a possible case is fraud on the part of the official examiner by collusion with the party tendering the evidence   error on the part of the official examiner viz to the advantage of the party and discovered by him by accident case ii the original known to be in a state of expatriation this case is upon the very face of it a modification of the first case but presenting a demand for an appropriate set of arrangements it requires to be arranged under a separate head in the case of transcriptural evidence expatriation of the script is analogous to expatriation of the person in the case of casually written and hearsay evidence the arrangements demanded—though by reason of the different nature of the subjectmatter they will not in terminis coincide with the arrangements suitable to those two preceding cases—will under the guidance of analogy be naturally indicated by them     rule where in regard to a script proffered in the character of a transcript it is ascertained or believed that the original is in a state of expatriation—let the following arrangements await the option of the judge—   to cause the transcript to be sent abroad viz to the place where the original is kept for examination and attestation of verity   to cause a fresh transcript from the original duly verified to be imported and produced   to cause the original itself to be imported and produced if practicable and without preponderant inconvenience any one of these arrangements to be taken or none according to the importance of the cause the importance of the article of evidence in question in relation to the cause the degree of persuasion respecting the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the transcript and the comparative degrees of inconvenience in the shape of delay vexation and expense attached to the three respective courses a time to be declared subject to abbreviation or enlargement for sufficient cause at the expiration of which if the intended operation chosen as above be not performed it shall be regarded as impracticable the provisional decision to be in favour either of the party proffering the evidence or of the adverse party and in either case with or without security taken for eventual reinstatement observations unless the nonexistence of the alleged original or the unfaithfulness of the transcript in all material points he believed—even although there should be no other direct evidence of the existence of the original than the judicial testimony of the party nor of its faithfulness than his declared belief—the judge will scarcely refuse to pronounce the provisional decision in favour of the faithfulness of the transcript taking security for reinstatement in case the result of the reference so made to the original should prove unfavourable for the reasons why see the examination of case vi further on case iii the original known to be in a state of exprovinciation this case is also upon the face of it a modification of case i a modification closely analogous to the last preceding case the case of expatriation the arrangements requisite to be taken will in their general description coincide with those already brought to view in that lastmentioned case but in detail the description of them will obviously require to be in various particulars different in the case of expatriation everything that can be done is more or less dependent upon the facilities given or withholden by the government in the foreign state in the case of exprovinciation it depends upon the arrangements taken in that behalf by the government in the state in question—in the same state rule where in regard to a script proffered in the character of a transcript it is ascertained or believed that the original is in a state of exprovinciation—let the same arrangements as in the case of expatriation await the option of the judge subject to such arrangements if any as may have been taken in this behalf by the legislator the common sovereign of both provinces observations as far as local distance is concerned the quantum of delay vexation and expense attendant upon that circumstance may be as great in the case of exprovinciation as in that of expatriation—the only uniform difference between the two cases consists in this viz that in the case of exprovinciation access to the original or the production of it will be at the command of the government of the country in which the transcript is thus proffered in the case of expatriation not case iv the original known to have existed but to be no longer in existence rule where in regard to a script produced in the character of a transcript it is known that an original script from whence it was transcribed was once in existence but that it is no longer in existence let the transcript be received in place of the original subject to whatever considerations may be alleged in diminution of its trustworthiness reason neither fraud nor material incorrectness are to be presumed both cases are in comparison extremely rare in this case forgery in the way of fabrication is by the supposition out of the question an original to the transcript there really was the only question is whether the representation given of it by the transcript be substantially a faithful one if for every thousand transcripts there have been one unfaithful one and no more on this supposition the probability of misdecision even supposing the unfaithful transcript to obtain credence is but as a thousand to one whereas on the other hand if the transcript be necessary to warrant the decision prayed for on the side of him by whom it is proffered and being so is rejected misdecision in case of rejection is a certain consequence or say thus if in every ten transcripts of each of which the original has ceased to be in existence whereupon the transcript has been proffered in evidence in its stead there has been one unfaithful and no more then in case of admission the probability of misdecision is at the utmost but as one to ten whereas in case of rejection it is certain previously to the deperition of the original no fraud in any shape can have existed unless at the time of the fraud the deperition     had been foreseen which it could hardly have been unless an intention of procuring such deperition had formed a part of the fraudulent contrivance no fraud in any shape either by or by the help of purposed infidelity on the part of the transcriber or by the like on the part of an examiner or by forgery in the way of falsification committed by another person at a time posterior to the examination always understood and supposed that according to the known dispositions of the law so long as the original is in being the transcript cannot be received on any terms or not but upon the terms of being confronted with the original in case of dispute no sooner however is the deperition known than the check which the existence of the original opposed to forgery in the way of falsification is at an end the transcript becomes in that event at that period exposed to falsification to wit as much as an original would have been but no more the transcript as such is not on this score less trustworthy than an original would have been in its place here if the author of the falsification was the party by whom the transcript is proffered in evidence the most natural case is that for the purpose of giving room for the falsification it was by him or by his means that the deperition of the original was procured but another possible case is that the deperition took place without his participation for example by accidental fire or in some other way by mere accident and the opening to fraud being thus made then it was that it occurred to him to take advantage of it if it be clear that from the time of the deperition of the original down to the time of the production of the transcript the transcript has never been either in his custody or to any such purpose in his power—all suspicion of fraud on his part of course falls to the ground as to mere accident in one point of view it should afford no reason at all for the rejection of a proffered transcript in this case for design being by the supposition out of the question an incorrectness even supposing it material is not more likely to operate to the prejudice of one party than of another the chances of advantage and disadvantage being therefore equal and that with reference to each party their situations are respectively the same as if there were no chance either of advantage or disadvantage on either side but this circumstance is not altogether destructive of all probability of misdecision from this source whether the incorrectness be taken advantage of or no will depend upon that one of the parties in whose custody or power the transcript is if the error be to his disadvantage and he aware of it he will either not produce the transcript at all or not without pointing out the error and claiming the benefit of its being corrected if it be to his advantage and his disposition be to such a degree dishonest he will in that case take advantage of the error although he had no part in the production of it if from the above considerations the cases on which the investigation turns seem farfetched and improbable—the more farfetched and improbable the cases appear on which the investigation turns the clearer will be the impropriety of any rule which in the case supposed should pronounce the exclusion of transcriptural evidence case v the alleged original known to have existed but whether it be still in existence or no is uncertain rule when in regard to a script produced in the character of a transcript it is known that an original script from whence it was transcribed was once in existence but whether it be still in existence is uncertain—let the transcript be received in evidence but in the framing of the decision grounded on the evidence for the avoidance of irreparable injustice let the same arrangements await the option of the judge as in the case where as above the original is known to be in a state of expatriation case vi a script purporting upon the face of it to be a transcript is proffered as such but the existence of the supposed original has not been ascertained rule it may sometimes happen that a script purporting or appearing upon the face of it to be a transcript taken from some original of the same tenor purport or effect shall be proffered in evidence to serve in place of the supposed original at the same time that no other direct evidence of the existence of such original is producible in such case let such supposed transcript be received in evidence for what it appears to be worth subject always to the double uncertainty whether any such original as it purports to have been transcribed from ever existed and whether supposing such original to have existed the supposed transcript in question be a sufficiently faithful transcript of it in some modifications of this case the persuasive force of an article of evidence of this description may be of itself very slight and inconsiderable at the worst however it will operate as a lot of circumstantial evidence evidentiary of the existence of a correspondent original and it is of the nature of circumstantial evidence to be susceptible of any degree of persuasive force and as circumstantial evidence be it in what shape it may cannot be too slight to be received in company with other evidence so neither can it in this     if the supposed original be an article of casuallywritten evidence it may be extremely difficult to determine whether the script in question be a transcript of an original of the same tenor or effect or whether it may not itself be an original not having been transcribed from any other see below §   in the case where the supposed original supposing it to exist must have been an article of preappointed evidence it will in general be sufficiently apparent that the script in question—the alleged transcript if it had not an original could not itself be an original why because the original being by the supposition an article of preappointed evidence for example an instrument of agreement or conveyance will have been furnished with some intrinsic marks of authentication prescribed or customary such as could not without forgery be given to a transcript in this case another doubt may also arise concerning the alleged transcript—viz whether it be a transcript from an original actually authenticated or only a preparatory sketch or draught of an instrument to the same effect not at that time authenticated in the former case a correspondent original must by the supposition have existed in the other case though intended it may never have existed in the former case it is of the nature of that species of circumstantial evidence distinguished on a former occasion by the name of posteriora priorum evidence on the other of the opposite nature priora posteriorum evidence if upon the face of an original of the nature in question a certain formulary of attestation whether by positive appointment of law or by custom be generally to be found—the difference between a transcript and a preparatory draught will in general not be difficult to decide if it be a transcript the formulary of attestation will hardly have been omitted in it if it be but a preparatory draught no such formulary can make part of it the most suspicious modification of this case is where a party proffers in evidence a script which according to his account of it is a transcript in tenor purport or effect made from an original instrument of the nature of preappointed evidence contractual for instance or say an agreement or conveyance which instrument he says was once in his possession or in the possession of some person to whose interest he succeeds in quality of representative—suppose his ancestor or testator but is now to use the common expression lost i e not that he knows of its having perished or has any particular reason for supposing it to have perished but that after every search he can make he has not been able to find it nor can think of any place as yet unsearched or uninquired at at which he sees any probability of its being found this sort of case lies obviously open to the characteristic fraud it may be that no such original instrument was ever in existence and that the party not choosing to run the hazard of forging in the way of fabrication any pretended original to the same effect makes and produces this pretended transcript regarding the fraud in this shape as being more promising in point of success or less exposed to danger what on the other hand may also be is that a genuine original to that same effect was once and perhaps still continues to be in existence but by the operation of some cause altogether out of the reach of his knowledge or conjecture either was destroyed or was concealed or removed out of his knowledge but as neither judicial mendacity nor fraud in any other shape ought to be presumed—i e regarded as certain without special inquiry and consideration into the idiosyncrasy of the case—the state of things in question though a ground of suspicion forms no sufficient ground for the absolute rejection of the evidence this in the most suspicious form that it can assume is but a modification of selfserving evidence of which even in its most questionable and least trustworthy shape it has already been in some degree and will hereafter be more fully shown that it ought not in any case to be absolutely excluded much less where as here supposed the party is subjectable to vivâ voce crossexamination upon oath by whose hand was the alleged transcript made by that of the party by whom in the character of a transcript it is proffered in evidence it is in this case so obviously exposed to suspicion that it seems little in danger of being accepted for more than it is worth is it in the handwriting of another person then there must have been some other person concerned in the business and if not imposed upon privy to the fraud if in respect of punishment a fraud of this kind is placed as it ought to be upon a level with ordinary forgery—in such case the danger incurred by the admission of this transcriptural kind of evidence differs but inconsiderably from the danger inseparably attached to the admission of preappointed but unregistered contractual evidence in general since all such evidence being unregistered is liable to be forged if the party disguises his hand to make it look like that of another person a question that cannot fail to be put to him is who the writer is in this case whether he names a particular individual or declares that he     knows not who it is here at any rate is a case of judicial mendacity superadded to a fraud which ought likewise to be considered as a modification of forgery if the person named by him be a living individual then the individual is living to contradict him if an individual now dead there will be other writings the genuine writings of that same individual to confront with this forged and spurious script if it be an individual of whose hand no specimens are to be found then comes the species of counterevidence constituted by the improbability of the alleged fact viz that of a hand expert in writing this and no one other production should be to be found supposing the instrument genuine it will seldom happen that no circumstantial evidence evidentiary of the occasion of executing it and the probability of its having been executed should be to be found in proportion as the existence of this sort of confirmative circumstantial evidence appears probable the unforthcomingness of it will constitute an objection to the trustworthiness of the supposed transcript and an objection too obvious to be in danger of being overlooked by all these considerations not only the danger of deception in case of fraud but the probability of an attempt at deception by fraud will surely appear to be reduced very considerably below—i will not say certainty—but below an even chance to facilitate conception—out of a hundred cases in which evidence of this sort is proffered in ten and no more than ten it is accompanied with fraud and in one out of these ten the fraud succeeds thus stands the matter on the supposition of the admission of the evidence in ninety cases out of every hundred right decision—justice is the consequence in one only misdecision—injustice next suppose a peremptory exclusion put upon this species of evidence here the proportions are reversed in one instance misdecision—injustice is prevented in ninety instances right decision is prevented injustice is produced if the above ratios appear too great take lesser ones but they will hardly be taken by anybody so small but that in his view of the matter the probability will be still on the same side—the practical result will be still the same case vii the original in the power of the adverse party observations in this case so long as the party in whose hands the original is does not produce it the existence of the alleged transcript being notified to him the fidelity of the transcript is thereby proved as against such detainer by a most satisfactory species of evidence—the virtual admission of the party interested in the proof of unfaithfulness on the part of the transcript if in truth it were chargeable with any such defect that a script or anything else should have been in the power of the party in question or any other individual is one of those events against the happening of which be they ever so undesirable no industry on the part of the law can afford security but that a script or anything else the forthcomingness of which is requisite for the purposes of justice should continue unforthcoming notwithstanding and at the same time continue in existence is a state of things which cannot have place from any other cause than an inexcusable imperfection—a voluntary imbecility in the system of procedure supposing it for arguments sake put out of doubt that a man having any such article in his custody or power wilfully persists in the nonproduction of it—no torture that he chose to submit to rather than comply in this respect with the obligations of justice could be too severe at no price should it be permitted to a man to purchase the privilege of flying in the face of law and committing a known injustice a possible and not very extraordinary case is this the original having been in the hands of the adverse party has passed out of his hands and altogether out of his power without any design of eluding the probative force of the transcript and in a word without any default of his in any shape in this case he will naturally be able to show if it has perished that it has perished if not into what other hands it has passed if instead of this he declares being of course judicially examined that he knows not what is become of the original—in such case although the declaration should be true no injustice can reasonably be to be apprehended from considering the verity of the transcript as between them two at least as sufficiently established if after this declaration he declares moreover under the same securities for veracity as are applied to the testimony of an ordinary witness that he does not believe the alleged transcript to be faithful but to be unfaithful in such or such specified points—here comes a contrariety of evidence a difficulty under which the judge must form on this as on other cases the best judgment in his power in this case—as between these two parties the withholder of the original and the holder of the transcript—it manifestly makes no difference whether the original be produced that by comparison with it the transcript may be verified or whether on the nonproduction of the original the verity of     the transcript be declared to be sufficiently ascertained as between them two yes supposing the holder of the transcript satisfied of its verity—satisfied consequently that the original itself if produced would not be more favourable to his cause as between them two yes but not as between other persons if it were understood that on the terms of establishing the verity of an alleged transcript the possessor of the alleged original had it absolutely in his power to protect it from the scrutiny of the judge and to make the alleged transcript good evidence against other persons in the same or other suits—the effect of forgery might thus be rendered attainable without any of the risks in pursuance of a preconcerted scheme of collusion in an action brought on purpose a pretended transcript of a deed of any description and to any value is proferred in evidence by the plaintiff notice for the production of the original is given to the defendant the defendant forbears to produce it and thereupon the character of an original—an original confirmed by judicial inquiry is given to the fraudulently pretended transcript §   arrangements for securing the fidelity of transcripts rule   upon every transcript made by a public scribe in the course of office let a pledge of correctness be entered upon the face of it as follows—   the name of the transcriber written by his own hand   the designation of the actual time of taking the transcript expressed by the day month and year   the designation of the place at which the transcript was taken rule   if of the same transcript one part be written by one hand another by another the designation should be repeated every time in thus changes hands but the name once given at length the initials will afterwards be sufficient rule   this obligation ought equally to be extended to professional scribes for example to notaries conveyancers attorneys and their clerks rule   where either at the time of making the transcript or afterwards it comes to be examined by any person other than the transcriber the same pledge of correctness should be given by such examiner likewise rule   and this whether on the part of the transcriber the transcript bears on the face of it any such pledge of correctness or not rule   of every such official as well as of every such professional transcript as well the writer as the examiner should at all times be subject to judicial examination touching the fidelity of the transcript and the truth of their respective marks of verification as above rule   if notwithstanding all such external evidence the fidelity of the transcript be in dispute and the original be still forthcoming—the examination of the transcript by the original as touching the points in dispute may be made at any time by or under the eyes of the judge taken on the whole the uses of these entries are not unobvious   to afford a security against incorrectness through negligence if error appears it appears at the same time who the person is to whom it is to be imputed   to afford a security against fraud if fraud have any share in the production of the error—being the work of design it cannot but be a material one so as to operate to the prejudice of some right but the more material it is the more strongly it points the eye of suspicion upon the person of the transcriber and there he is to answer for it if the entry be not the writing of the person whose writing it purports to be it is then a forgery and in this case the punishment and peril of forgery attach upon the fraud   a collateral and inferior use in the case of the transcriber is to serve as an index and measure of his capacity and diligence by showing the quantity of business dispatched by him in each given portion of time the use of the designation of the time coupled with that of the place is to throw difficulties in the way of forgery the forgery will be detected if it should appear that on the day in question there was no such person writing in that office in that place and as to the clerk himself whose hand is thus forged it will be easier to him to say with assurance that he wrote no such paper on this or that particular day than that he never wrote any such paper in the whole course of his life at the particular time in question it may happen to him to recollect that his whole time was occupied about other business in the case of the examiners mark of attestation an effectual indication of forgery will be afforded should it ever appear that before the time therein specified the original had perished in the case of an official transcript the designation of the place may at first sight appear superfluous the situation of the official house is a matter of universal notoriety and the official books and documents are kept at the official house but   in some cases the office itself is ambulatory as in the case of military offices by sea and land   the transcript may be of the nature of   0 those which are destined to be sent out of the office such as circular letters and the like   the document in question though designed to be kept in the office may on some unforeseen occasion be sent out of it or by accident separated from it the designation of the place will in this case serve for the replacement of it   the designation of the person is scarcely complete without the designation of the place of the names called proper names there are few but what are in fact common to many persons of the aboveproposed arrangements the description is simple the efficiency obvious and the trouble not considerable the application of them may at least be considered as forming the matter of a general rule if in this or that particular instance the labour should appear to outweigh the utility—in every such particular instance it will be easy to discard them by a special rule of exception adapted to the case in the case of an official transcript as above a transcript having for its writer or examiner or both a public functionary—if the above arrangements for the security of individual responsibility be established the security afforded as above by the relative date of the judicial deposition will be the less material inasmuch as the certificate or attestation of transcription or examination will never have been attached to the transcription but under the persuasion of eventual liability to judicial scrutiny on that supposition the case to which it applies with particular efficiency is that where the examiner has not been any such public functionary but some unofficial individual—such for instance as a professional agent of this or that one of the parties in the cause or in case of an instrument of conveyance or other contract the man of law or the clerk of the man of law notary attorney or conveyancer by whom the original was drawn or who in the way of his professional functions had had occasion to advert to the contents of the original for any other purpose with the help of this check so strong is the collective body of security thus afforded that the trustworthiness of an examiner of the least trustworthy description may be raised by it to a level superior in the eye of reason to a person of the most trustworthy description to whom for want of the requisite arrangements the security for individual responsibility is found not to apply for example the testimony of the party by whom and consequently in favour of whom the supposed transcript is proffered in evidence will under these circumstances present a better claim to credence than can be presented by any supposed official transcript—nay even by any transcript of which though it be known that it was made or examined in this or that particular office and consequently by one or other of the clerks that at one time or other have been employed in that office it is not known by what one in particular of those clerks it was written or examined §   how to distinguish between original and transcript in the case of preappointed evidence all difficulty from this source is or at least naturally will be endeavoured to be provided against and prevented but in the case of casuallywritten evidence the case may remain exposed to every difficulty if it be a letter that letter will naturally be signed by him whose discourse it is but among persons in habits of intimacy with each other and perfectly acquainted with each others hands the formality will often have been omitted but a script appears in form of a letter and that letter signed by a name to a person sufficiently acquainted with the handwriting it may be proportionally clear that it is the handwriting of the individual whose name it bears but to the persons interested in the business that person and his handwriting are suppose alike unknown in that case fraud of every kind apart it cannot assuredly be known to a certainty whether the script be an original or a copy all that can be said is that its being an original is the more frequent and thence in each individual case setting aside idiosyncratic indications the more natural and probable result for   considered in an aggregate point of view the number of letters of which no transcripts are taken exceeds it may well be thought in a prodigious degree the number of those of which transcripts are taken but the strength of this consideration will depend upon a variety of circumstances—  upon the importance of the subject of the letter commercial or noncommercial—relative to business purely private or to business more or less public c   upon the prevalence of the faculty and habit of taking copies of letters in the country in question at the time in question   when a transcript of a letter is taken fraud apart it is common and natural that upon the face of it it should be so intituled or at any rate that in some way or other an indication should be given of its not being meant for anything more on the other hand this indication is a circumstance to which it may easily happen to be omitted a letter lies before me i take a copy of it no matter for what purpose for my own use i know     it to be but a copy what need have i to give the information to myself suppose other persons are meant to share with me in this use—all of whom are acquainted either with me or with the writer of the original and with our respective hands even in this case the indication will be apt to appear alike superfluous and as such to be omitted   if the original be no more than a memorandum written by the writer for his own use and not addressed to anybody or meant to be sent to anybody—in that case if a transcript be taken of it by another person it may be impossible for any third person otherwise than by examination of one of the persons—the writer of the original or the transcriber to give so much as a guess which was the original which the transcript either presenting itself without the other would of course be taken for an original from the sight of the original alone no person would be led to conclude that any transcript had been made of it from the sight of the transcript alone no person would be led to conclude that it was not an original but a transcript such would generally be the case supposing both of them equally free from alterations and slips of the pen on the other hand where alterations and blemishes are visible from the nature of these blemishes some sort of indication or ground of conjecture respecting the script in question taken singly as to the question whether it be an original or a copy may every now and then be discoverable in an original whatever alterations occur will naturally have arisen from a correspondent change in the thought and plan of the discourse if one word be struck out and another written over it the word thus substituted will commonly have no resemblance in physical appearance to the word to which it is substituted especially if a clause composed of three or four words in connexion being struck through another clause embracing also a number of words be put to serve instead of it in a transcript where any such alterations are perceptible if the error consisted in the omission of a word or series of words the correction will consist in the insertion of such omitted word or words which insertion the error not having been discovered till the line is finished will commonly be made in the way of interlineation if the error consisted in the substitution of one word for another the improper word will in general be a word more or less nearly similar in physical appearance to the proper one in short—in an original if any alterations are perceptible they will be such as being the result of a change of thought will be indicative of such a change in a transcript if any alterations are perceptible they will not be indicative of any change of thought on the occasion of these and all other such diagnostics a caution as useful as any or all of them put together is not to place too implicit a confidence in them and this for two reasons—  because even frand apart their conclusiveness is susceptible of an infinity of gradations   because if any one were understood to be conclusive fraud would naturally bend its endeavours to take advantage of the rule—example in the natural state of things fraud apart an original brouillon may swarm with substitutions and interlincations to any degree of complication a transcript will not naturally be infected in any considerable degree with any such blemishes but if this were to be understood in the character of a peremptory rule to which the judge were obliged to conform—a man who making a transcript wished for any sinister purpose to make it pass for an original would fill it with such blemishes on purpose rule where as between divers scripts emanating from the same original source a doubt arises which is to be considered as the authentic draught as for instance between two such scripts whether the first be a rough sketch preparatory to the original and the second the original or the first an original and the second a transcript viz either in tenor or in substance—let not the claim of any such script to be considered as the more authentic be regarded as fixed by any general rule applicable to all sorts or to any sorts of scripts except so far as in the instance of this or that particular species of script the distinction may have been fixed by an appropriate provision of statute law but in each instance let all such of the contending scripts as can be produced be produced accordingly and from a joint comparison of them all let the true import of the discourse be collected examples—   shopbooks several shopbooks kept by the same shopkeeper in some the order of the entries will have been purely chronological in the wastebook and journal in others the primary principle of arrangement will be logical the transactions being classed in groups sometimes according to the persons sometimes according to the things to which they relate the chronological principle of arrangement being secondary with relation to these logical ones in general an entry belonging to that book in which the transaction is entered before it is entered in any other will be more trustworthy than the correspondent entry in any other of the books because the former one will be of the nature of an original the others no more than transcripts entered on so many different principles of arrangement but it may happen that a mistake was made in the     prior entry and that it received correction in a posterior one   official books of any public office the documents usually entered in the office being known—the document as made out in proper form will naturally have been preceded in many instances by a short minute or memorandum indicative of the species of the document which is to be made out and serving for instruction to the clerk by whom it is to be made out   the documents if more than one serving to exhibit a mans last will—viz if no sufficient care has been taken by the legislator to stamp the character of anthenticity upon a document of a particular description to the exclusion of all others that are liable to come into competition with it or if a document upon the face of it authentic should come to be impugned on the ground of spuriousness falsification or unfairness in respect of the mode of bringing it into existence chapter ix of reported real evidence i e supposed real evidence transmitted through oral judicial testimony or through casuallywritten evidence the inferiority of transmitted evidence as compared with immediate evidence from the same source is as manifest in the instance of this as of any other species of transmitted evidence this species of evidence cannot therefore but be ranged under the head of makeshift evidence at the same time the cases are numerous and the description of them extensive in which the correspondent immediate evidence is not to be had yet in which evidence from that source is so material that in a general view the admissibility of it even in the secondary and reported form is altogether out of dispute of the instructiveness and importance of real evidence a general view has already been given under the head circumstantial evidence of which it constitutes a species on the present occasion what remains to be brought to view is the specific description of the characteristic fraud and the modifications which this species of transmitted evidence is susceptible of according to the nature and trustworthiness of the medium through which it may happen to be transmitted to the conception of the judge the species of fraud to which this species of makeshift evidence stands exposed may be thus described—a person suppose the defendant or any other person on his behalf in an expected criminal cause—applying himself to the thing which with relation to the principal fact in question is already become or which he proposes to convert into a source of real evidence—either obliterates or alters the evidentiary appearances presented by it in the state in which he found it or superinduces upon it fresh appearances of his own production such as appear to him conducive to his purpose viz in the present case that of exculpating him from the charge this it is evident is neither more nor less than the sort of fraud which there has already been occasion to bring to view to wit in the book on circumstantial evidence under the denomination of forgery of real evidence alterative or fabricative as the case may be one circumstance is remarkable as being peculiar in relation to this modification of transmitted evidence exposed as it has been seen to be to a characteristic fraud it is so no otherwise than as the corresponding immediate evidence is the real evidence afforded by the same physical object—issuing from the same source the cause of the difference is that in the case of the other modification of transmitted evidence there are at least two persons concerned or supposed to be concerned in the character of witnesses or sources of evidence two persons the one of which viz the extrajudicial witness may under favour of his exemption from the sanction of an oath and from crossexamination put a deceit upon the other viz upon the intended judicial witness such a deceit from which the judge armed as he is with those instruments for the extraction of truth is proportionably defended but to the fraud liable to be practised upon or in relation to real evidence the situation of one cause stands no less exposed than that of another—that of the judge no less than that of any reporting percipient witness on whose report through choice or necessity he rests his conception of the fact—instead of the testimony of his own senses with his own judgment for their assistance for this same reason everything that relates to the examinability of the supposed extrajudicial witness has no place here here there is no extrajudicial witness in the case in the room of the interrogable or uninterrogable person we have the uninterrogable thing the personal evidence by which the supposed real evidence in question is transmitted to the conception of the judge may wear any of the forms which have already been brought to view—  oral evidence judicial testimony delivered or extracted in the judicial that is by the supposition the most trustworthy mode   casuallywritten evidence minutes taken descriptive of the appearances exhibited by the thing—by the source of the real evidence taken by a private individual in the situation of an extrajudicial and not an official witness—taken consequently at the time when the evidentiary appearances     are freshest and most instructive or at any late period if any when by the agency of time they have been rendered less correctly instructive taken again either at the very moment of inspection or at any succeeding period and at the end of any longer interval of time   written evidence taken by a preappointed and quoad hoc at least an official witness not by the judge himself but by some person of chosen trustworthiness appointed for the purpose either by general and permanent designation of the law or by special appointment from the judge   judicial testimony delivered and extracted in the judicial mode but grounded and supported by written minutes containing the result of the inspection the view itself taken and the result committed to writing at a period earlier than that at which the business could have been performed by a judicial presentation or examination in the first instance comparing with each other the two species of evidence the original and reported hearing in mind the several causes of inferiority observable in makeshift evidence with relation to the correspondent species of regular evidence we shall find the difference much less in this than in any other instance   the person by whom the reported real evidence is reported may always be a preappointed witness—and that witness preappointed even by the judge here then vanishes all danger of fraud of all the several species of makeshift evidence this is the only one which is not exposed to any variety of what we have called the characteristic fraud   the person appointed thus to act in the character of reporting witness may be and naturally will be a person possessed of that appropriate stock of information which with relation to the subjectmatter of the deposition will place him in the predicament of a scientific witness the danger of deception on the part of the judge without fraud on the part of the deposing witness—without any symptom of weakness in his rational faculties—without any other than such of which his intellectual faculties may be the seat—is thus reduced to its minimum to the moral trustworthiness of official evidence viz of judicial the most trustworthy species of official evidence he may and naturally will add the intellectual trustworthiness of scientific evidence if no appropriate modification of physical science be requisite the person selected for this purpose will naturally be appointed by the judge a person known to him through the medium of official relation and intercourse in the opposite case some person recommended by the general reputation of appropriate science it follows then that if between the immediate and the thus reported real evidence there be in any case any practically material difference in point of trustworthiness it can only be in so far as there is something in the particular nature of the real evidence in question that disqualifies it from being transmitted with accuracy through the medium of personal report the perceptions which it affords to a percipient witness being such as cannot without material alteration be transmitted through the medium of language but even in this case the difference in point of trustworthiness will not be so great as upon the face of the above statement it might at first sight appear to be the judge—the official permanent judge—is not upon the footing of this arrangement so correctly and fully informed as in the case where the information is presented to him in the shape of immediate real evidence true but though he is not his nominee his deputy—the person selected by him on the ground of his appropriate trustworthiness as qualified for the purpose in question to officiate in his place—receives and contemplates the information in its character of immediate real evidence the decision of the case does not in effect lose the benefit of immediate real evidence the result of the arrangement is no more than this viz that the decision in effect is transferred from the judge in ordinary to another judge who though but an occasional one may on the particular occasion in question for anything that appears be regarded as equally fit and competent upon this footing stands the disadvantage which reported real evidence lies under when compared with immediate real evidence considered in another point of view it may at least in certain circumstances appear possessed of an advantage for the judicial trustworthiness of the official judge—for the probity attention and intelligence brought into action by him on the occasion—the public possesses in this case a sort of security which it possesses not in the other suppose in the place of the judge an allperfect human being and at the same time on the part of the proposed occasional judgedepute ad hoc a character considerably inferior in these respects to his principal the difference and the disadvantage on the side of the reported real evidence in its comparison with the immediate may be very considerable on the other hand suppose any considerable degree though it be no more than the ordinary degree of deficiency in point of trustworthiness on the part of the ordinary judge or what is at once an equally natural and less invidious supposition suppose but on the part of the public a degree though it be no more than the ordinary degree of suspicion of a deficiency of trustworthiness in any of these points on the part of the judge the advantage capable of being possessed by the information when in the shape of reported evidence     may be not inconsiderable the judge supposing him to repair to the spot alone sees as much of the evidence as he pleases and no more than he pleases pays what attention to it he pleases and no more than he pleases contemplates it if he pleases on one side only and with no other intention than that of discovering what pretences can be found what excuses can be made to the public and his own conscience for deducing from it inferences favourable to that side of the cause which his affections induce him to espouse with these eyes it is that he views it and it is after thus viewing it in his character of a witness that he reports it—to whom to himself in the character of a judge it is the judge himself who is the witness and that witness examined in secreto judicis in the recesses of the judges own conscience examined and without crossexamination by the judge turn now to the opposite case and see upon what footing stands the case of information from the same source when reported to the judge through the medium of some other official or at any rate a preappointed witness his report is delivered—it may at least be and therefore at the instance of either party ought to be delivered—upon the same footing in every respect as that of any ordinary witness—in public and subject to crossexamination with the several attendant securities it is from this completely scrutinized evidence delivered under the eye of the public that the judge himself speaking and acting under the eye of the public draws his inferences in the one case the judge decides upon data not before the public and the public in consequence has no controul over him in the other case the judge decides as in ordinary cases from data which are as completely before the public as before himself with respect to the option the question therefore seems to be brought to this point—in the case where the information presents itself to the judge in the shape of immediate real evidence the judge conveying himself to the spot for the purpose of contemplating it in that shape can he or can he not take the public a sufficient portion of the public with him if he can and does—in such case the immediate evidence preserves its superiority over transmitted evidence if he does not—in that case the transmitted evidence instead of being inferior is in fact in a practical view superior to the immediate evidence the transmitted evidence though in itself it possesses the characteristic property of makeshift and irregular evidence to the regular chapter x of evidence transmitted through an indefinite number of media we come now to the case where the information in question presents itself as if transmitted through media simple or complex as above described and in each case with repetitions in any number of any one or more of the elements the modifications of which this case is susceptible are evidently infinite happily the conduct that seems proper to be observed in relation to them will be found capable of being determined by a few simple principles the first point to be ascertained under this head is the influence exercised by the number of the media upon the probative force of the information thus conveyed for this purpose instead of the word medium there may on some occasions be a convenience in employing the word degree the mode in which this is to be done is by reckoning for every medium through which the evidence passes a degree thus hearsay evidence through one medium is of the first degree through two media of the second degree and so on   in every succession from one medium     to another by which a supposed extrajudicial statement passes in its way from the supposed percipient or other primary extrajudicial narrator to the ear or eye of the judge—it loses a portion of its probative force   this it does of course from the mere consideration of the general chance of incorrectness and without taking into the account any peculiar chance of incorrectness capable of being produced by the idiosyncratic character of any of the supposed intervening relators   the circumstance of mendacity or bias affords likewise at every step an additional chance or probability of incorrectness as well as of falsehood in toto but this chance depending upon idiosyncratic character and circumstances is incapable of being estimated any further than as the situation and character of individuals is taken into the account and made the subject of special investigation   conceive divers supposed extrajudicial witnesses of the same remove or degree each represented as confirming in tenor or in purport the supposed statement supposed to have been given by the rest—for each such witness credit given to the fact of their having existed in that character the evidence acquires a portion of probative force   but the greatest additional portion of probative force capable of being thus acquired can never be great enough to raise the probative force of a lot of hearsay evidence standing at that degree to a level with one standing at a higher degree i e in which the number of media it is supposed to have passed through is less   deponens for example states that on a certain occasion a number of persons whom he names john middleman thomas middleman and others concurred in assuring him that they were present when percipiens was giving an account of a duel fought in his presence between the defendant and occisus in the course of which occisus received his death wound it is evident that so far as deponens is believed the fact of defendants having been the cause of the death of occisus will acquire an additional and setting aside idiosyncrasy a determinate portion of probability for every additional person of which this number is stated as consisting but if there were a thousand such supposed intermediate and mutually confirmative extrajudicial relators this could never impart to the hearsay evidence of deponens any such degree of probative force as if deponens instead of representing himself as having taken his information through these thousand media all at the same degree were to represent himself as having himself taken it immediately from the lips of percipiens recapitulation—i in the case of transmitted evidence the probative force of the information presented immediately to the judge is inversely as the number of degrees   supposing at each degree one witness and no more at each degree it is therefore inversely as the number of media or witnesses   but at any given degree it is directly as the number of witnesses standing at that same degree and supposed to have agreed with one another in their respective extrajudicial statements in relation to the same fact hence it appears how inconsiderate and inadequate the provision is of those laws which without entering into any such explanations as above take upon them to obviate misdecision by requiring as a necessary ground to the validity of the decision a specified number of witnesses the number may be completed and the probative force of the evidence may in fact instead of greater be but so much less than if there were but one on the part of the judge common honesty enlightened by common sense would it may be thought be sufficient to supply any such deficiencies on the part of the legislator and thence to prevent misdecision on this ground but the instances in which the light of common sense has been extinguished by the vapours of jurisprudential science are as it will be seen throughout but too abundant and to obviate in that quarter some apprehended deficiency in the article of common honesty is the undisguised object of the legislator in the framing of such restrictive and exclusive regulations†     transmitted evidence purporting to have passed through more media than one may still be received whatsoever be the number of such media to wit in every case in which makeshift evidence transmitted through no more than one medium would be received—always under the same conditions and restrictions so likewise in the case where the individual description or even the number of the media cannot be ascertained to a mind impregnated with the principle of the excluding system a proposition to this effect cannot but appear in the highest degree alarming what let in upon the mind of the judge a deluge of evidence to the untrustworthiness of which there is no bounds reasons in support of the rule—arguments à priori supported and well supported by arguments à posteriori—are however by no means wanting reasons and such it is believed as will be found satisfactory upon the whole   the main and most striking reason is that by the alleged increase in the number of the media no new facility is given to fraud on the contrary it can never answer the purposes of fraud—it would be unfavourable to the purposes of fraud falsely or even truly to represent any such increase that assurance of correctness cannot but be diminished in proportion to the number of media the evidence has passed through is a truth the force of which cannot but be felt by every mind to which it is presented but a man actuated by fraud intending deception to be brought about by mendacity will of course give to the information the most plausible the most trustworthy form of which it is susceptible he will never spontancously and unnecessarily multiply causes of untrustworthiness and distrust in regard to it a man says what is not only sooner said but more likely to be believed and yet not more likely to be detected if false if he says i had the fact from titius who said he saw it but is now dead—than if he says i had the fact from titius who is dead and who says he had it from sempronius who if titius is to be believed gave titius to understand that he saw it but being dead also cannot be called upon for his testimony take for example a case from english jurisprudence the validity of a will being in question—a will purporting to have been executed in the presence of three witnesses whose names were entered upon the face of it in the character of attesting witnesses—two of these supposed witnesses were proved to be dead the third on her crossexamination deposed that on her attending one of the other two in his last illness about three weeks before his death he pulled the will from his bosom and acknowledged to her that it was forged by himself† this evidence it appears was received was credited and the decision—a decision pronouncing the will a spurious one—grounded upon it this supposed oral evidence transmitted through oral—this evidence hearsay evidence as it was was received and credited it was regarded as not only veracious but true by the proper judges judging from the whole complexion of the evidence on both sides now to the point in question suppose that instead of being deemed true it had been deemed false and mendacious and had been so accordingly the will was on this supposition a genuine one the story of its having been declared by one of the attesting witnesses to be spurious spurious as having been forged by himself was a mendacious story trumped up by this witness who it being false could not but have been conscious of its being so now then suppose that instead of saying that what she heard as above     she heard from the supposed forger himself she had spoken of it as having been heard from john middleman now also dead who said he heard it from the supposed forger under the same circumstances as above would the fraud in this shape have presented any more plausible title to credence than in the other the answer it should seem will hardly be in the affirmative   the danger of fraud i e of deception by fraud not being increased by the number of supposed media—there remains the danger of incorrectness i e of deception by incorrectness but in this case in whatsoever proportion the danger of incorrectness may be thus increased the danger of deception does not increase with it for whatsoever be the danger of incorrectness it is apparent to every eye upon the very face of the evidence—apparent to all eyes alike and in no danger at all of being set down at any value below its real value in regard to fraud a possible observation on the other side is this—information being according to your observation more likely to be incorrect when transmitted through several media than if transmitted through no more than one and so in that light likely to appear to everybody—a man who meaning fraud were to represent the information as having passed through more media than one might by that device exempt his testimony from the imputation of fraud and by that means gain for his false testimony in this complex shape a degree of credence beyond what could be gained for it by its being presented in the more simple shape the propriety of this observation might perhaps be admitted but at any rate it does not seem worth controverting on one side or worth relying upon on the other side for a lot of evidence to gain credence it is not sufficient that it appear exempt from fraud it must appear correct and true it is not sufficient that it be regarded as being pure from material error from this or that particular source it must be regarded as pure from material error from whatever source but the fresh degree of untrustworthiness it is necessarily tinged with by every medium through which it passes is essential to its very nature and it is only in part and not in the whole that it can be done away by any marks of comparative purity in no more than one out of whatever may be the number of the media through which it is supposed to flow add to which if it be worth adding that this supposed receipt for putting a varnish of veracity upon mendacious evidence is on no other supposition a promising one than that of its remaining a secret—a secret in mendacious hands but the secret being now published not to say that it is of itself sufficiently obvious the virtue of it if it ever possessed any or would have been capable of possessing any is already at an end the eventual offspring of fraud has been torn from her womb and been rendered abortive the truth of the above conclusions will be found to receive ample confirmation from general and it may be added even necessary practice turn to any established system of judicature an extensive class of cases may be found and that the same or nearly the same in all in which transmitted evidence is received without scruple whatsoever may be the number of media through which it purports to have been transmitted or even although the very number as well as the individuality of such media be undiscoverable—the class of cases in question is that in which the principal fact in question the principal fact to be proved or disproved belongs to the class of what may be called ancient facts a fact which supposing it to have happened happened so long ago that it would be in vain to look to any witnesses forthcoming and consequently still living from whose examination it might be proved in the regular and most trustworthy mode but there is nothing in the mere date of a fact and that relative measured from a particular point of time the time in which the proof of it comes to be called for that is capable of rendering it credible upon weaker evidence than would be requisite to gain equal credence for it at another time that a man of such or such a name living at such a place should at that place have been married to a woman of such a name and had by her children of such and such names is not a whit more credible if placed at the end of the seventeenth century than if placed at the end of the eighteenth but except in so far as the application of preappointed evidence may have happened to extend itself to the instances in question in former ages there are no sort of facts that are capable of being established by any other than this weak and longspun sort of evidence and yet for the purposes of legal decision facts of various descriptions—facts though placed at ever such remote periods are under every system of established law continually adduced and credited nor can it be said that if such evidence be at all admissible no causes except what are of light moment can with propriety be rested upon such slight evidence in the case where the fact in question belongs to the class of ancient facts none of those questions of which the great mass of questions of light moment is composed—small debts slight assaults and verbal injuries—can ever come upon the carpet questions of the greatest moment—questions relative to the title to estates to immoveables to any amount to     hereditary powers and honours—of this sort are the questions that come to be tried upon the ground of this slight evidence truths of the mathematical class—truths in any number might be heaped together in this field but in every instance if attempted to be employed in practice they would be found either altogether inapplicable or if applied more likely to lead to misdecision than to justice suppose for example that a mathematician taking up the observations brought to view above were to set to work in his own way and because demonstration is the fruit of his own science fancy he had given certainty to the conclusions capable of being formed in relation to the trustworthiness of evidence in a series of remotelytransmitted hearsay evidence every article standing at a degree indicated by a higher number is lower in the scale of trustworthiness than an article standing at a degree indicated by a lower number expressed as of course it would be in mathematical shorthand by single letters instead of words or combinations of letters a proposition to the above effect might put in a specious claim to the character of irrefragable truth yes but in what way on the supposition of a matter of fact not announced but gratuitously assumed and in a mathematical sense altogether incapable of being proved viz that in each instance—an article of hearsay evidence at a lower degree being compared with an article of ditto at a higher degree—in each medium or rank of mediums the idiosyncratic trustworthiness of the intermediate witness or witnesses were on the same level suppose a suit having for its subjectmatter a pecuniary object of inconsiderable value suppose on both sides a lot of hearsay evidence on the side of the plaintiff evidence of the second degree the deposing witness and the supposed intermediate witness both of them universally known and known as of the highest rank as well in the scale of moral reputation as in that of opulence on the side of the defendant hearsay evidence only of the first degree but     the reporting witness—the judicial witness—a pauper notorious for mendacity by the mathematician the superior weight of evidence would be demonstrated to be on the side of the defendant while by everybody but the mathematician it would be regarded and though without demonstration yet with more reason as being on the side of the plaintiff add to this that in many instances in which not without good cause hearsay evidence of many removes from the supposed source has been employed for example in english practice not only the persons of the supposed intermediate witnesses but even the number of the degrees has not been ascertained nor been capable of being ascertained the general sense conception understanding of the neighbourhood in the case of a testimony to this effect supposing the conception just there must in every instance have been a matter of fact at bottom—some determinate matter of fact the conception of which must through the respective relations of a certain number of intermediate witnesses singly or in ranks have been transmitted to the ears of the deposing witnesses in a case of that description the number of degrees not being ascertained the requisite data not being given matter for the hand of the mathematician would not be to be found truth however would be but the better served by the deficiency for the mathematician with his scientific mode of deceit not being capable of being set to work no deception could flow from that source chapter xi what ought and what ought not to be done to obviate the danger of misdecision on the ground of makeshift evidence §   impropriety of excluding any kind of makeshift evidence it has been seen how various in specie and how abundant probably in number are the instances in which makeshift evidence of one description or another is habitually received and must ever be received in judicature it has been seen that a danger of deception and consequent misdecision is in every instance naturally attached to the reception of makeshift evidence it has been seen on the other hand how—by the influence of a principle common to human nature and in particular to men in the situation occupied by men of law—the danger of deception has been generally exaggerated or what comes to the same thing such arrangements have been produced as could not be justified on any other supposition than that of a degree of danger beyond the danger really existing in each case that this exaggerated estimate has had for its cause an assumption which upon a closer examination turns out to be decidedly erroneous viz that the danger of deception on one part is as the danger of falsity on the other that the erroneousness of this assumption is proved by every instance in which the prevalence of it is exemplified in practice for the exemplification of it in practice consists in the determination formed and executed in each instance—the determination not to pay any regard whatever to the lot of suspected evidence to consider the falsehood of it as certain instead of being more or less probable in a word to regard it as certain that in each instance the disposition of the judge is to overvalue it whereas the truth is that by every instance in which an exclusion is thus put upon a lot of evidence a fresh proof is given that the disposition of men in judicial situations is to undervalue it—to treat as if it were incapable of having any weight at all that which is never altogether without weight in any instance that under the most natural and extensively prevalent constitution of the judicial establishment in which the tribunal is composed of one or more permanent and official judges nothing can be more extravagant or inconsistent than the distrust of which the practice of exclusion is the practical result—whether the object of the distrust be the judge himself by whom the exclusion is pronounced or his colleagues and successors so prone am i to give too much credence to evidence of this description that i give it no credence at all—that i determine to disregard it altogether so prone am i to decide on insufficient evidence on the one side that i decide without evidence and against evidence in favour of the opposite side so prone are all my colleagues—so prone will all my successors be to give too much credence to such untrustworthy evidence that i who alone am proof against such delusions—i in order to preserve them against the influence of it am determined for their sake to pronounce a decision which in the character of a precedent shall tie up their hands and prevent them from throwing open the door to any such delusive evidence i who cannot trust myself with the faculty of pronouncing from the evidence—i confident in that exclusive portion of sagacity in which i have none to share with me have determined by this means such is my prudence to impose on my colleagues and successors   0 to the end of time the obligation of deciding in every such case without and in despite of evidence the only instance in which this system of exclusion has any colour of rationality is that in which as in one of the many forms of english judicature the tribunal is composed of a set of ephemeral unofficial unprofessional unexperienced judges placed under the tutelage and in some respects under the controul of one or more permanent official experienced judges the jury were they to be trusted with such evidence would to a certainty be deceived with it therefore they never shall be trusted with it supposing the conception of unfitness on the part of the professional judge to be trusted with such evidence—supposing this conception just in its application to himself and his experienced brethren—the extension of the same imputation to this unexperienced class of judges seems at any rate clear of the charge of inconsistency—the absurdity is gross and palpable but it is all of a piece on the other hand suppose the professional sort of judge to be proof against the influence of this species of delusion—suppose the danger of being deceived by it not universally extensive but confined to the nonprofessional class of judges—the system of exclusion even in this limited application of it is still precipitate and indefensible you conclude they will be deceived by it why so hasty in your conclusions to know whether they have or have not been deceived by it depends altogether upon yourself what can you not so much as stay to hear their verdict condemn men unheard—condemn thus your fellow judges apply where as yet there is no disease a remedy and a remedy worse than the disease—a remedy worse than the disease when had you but patience to wait for the disease a remedy is in your hands as safe and gentle as it is infallible day after day you annul the verdict of a jury without disguise and send the cause to be tried by another jury on the alleged ground of its being a verdict against evidence would it cost you anything to extend the allegation to cases of this description or to add to the cases calling for a new trial that of a verdict grounded on untrustworthy and deceptitious evidence thus much for supposition and argument in fact however no such distinction has had place the manacles once constructed unexperienced and experienced hands are alike confined by them peers have been not less ready not to say eager to impose it upon themselves than yeomen and shopkeepers to submit to it it is by such easy means and at so cheap a price that favour when agreeable and convenient is seated upon the throne of justice nor is the application of the system of exclusion by any means confined to english judicature under the auspices of roman jurisprudence it is perhaps upon the whole still more extensive what difference there is seems to be to the advantage of the english system on the ground of personal untrustworthiness at least the causes of exclusion are on the one hand still more abundantly extensive than in the english system on the other hand the adherence to them seems to be much less steady the range of cases that afford to the judge the faculty of putting an exclusion upon the witness is still more extensive but in each instance it is rather a power than an obligation is it his pleasure to put an exclusion upon a witness he may find a warrant for it is it his pleasure not to exclude the witness he may likewise and equally find a warrant for it in the english system the cases in which by the advantage of the conflict between preceding decisions judges have been at liberty to decide either way are but too abundant but on the other hand in the cases to which the conflict has not extended the option and the licence fails where the decision that stands nearest to the individual case in question is not opposed by any other usage will not permit its being disregarded adopt the principle of exclusion in the character of a security against deception—adopt it in any case whatsoever there is not any point at which its application can with any consistency be made to cease exclude for this reason any one lot of evidence whatsoever by the same reason you are alike bound to exclude all evidence and along with it all justice discard the principle of exclusion altogether that is in all cases where the exclusion of the lot of evidence in question would have the effect of excluding all evidence from that source—from the source from which the information issues—adopt in its stead the principle of universal admissibility—you do no more than give extension to a principle the innoxiousness of which in every point to which the application of it has been extended has been made manifest by undeviating experience among the cases to which it remains to be extended there cannot be any in which the evidence can be so weak but that cases in which being equally weak it is admitted notwithstanding abound and have ever abounded and without objection or complaint to an extent the magnitude of which affords a conclusive proof of the safety with which this sort of liberty may be allowed the cases in which weak evidence is admitted—weak to every imaginable degree of weakness—are cases in which whatever danger may be attached to the admission is altogether out of the reach of remedy—  weak     circumstantial evidence evidence in the case of which the connexion between the principal fact and the supposed evidentiary fact is loose and remote to any degree of remoteness   weak direct evidence in the case where the veracity or correctness of the testimony is endangered by some cause of illusion or by some sinister interest which either in specie is not taken into the account or in the individual instance is out of the reach of observation the inconveniences attached to the observance of the principle of exclusion are altogether out of the reach of all remedy palliative as well as curative the dangers attached to the principle of universal admissibility are not only in themselves inferior in a prodigious degree to the mischiefs attached to the principle of exclusion but whatsoever they may amount to at the worst arrangements are not wanting by which in one way or other defalcations may be made reductions may be applied and at any rate certain limits may be set to the mischief that is to the number of the instances of misdecision capable of flowing from this source these arrangements such as the nature of the subject has suggested remain to be brought to view in this place §   arrangements for indicating the amount of the danger arrangements having for their object to lessen the danger of misdecision from the admission of makeshift and other weak evidence may be distinguished in the first place into such as have for their more immediate object the making known the actual amount of the danger and such as have for their more immediate object the lessening the amount of it arrangements having for their immediate object the lessening the amount of it may combat it in either of two ways by lessening the frequency of it or by lessening the amount of it when it happens provisions having for their result the bringing to view in the shape of experience the utmost possible amount of the mischief from this source that is the limits of that amount would in a variety of ways be of unquestionable use—   they will constitute a sure and the only sure basis of legislation in this as in so many other cases facts showing by the light of experience the effects of existing institutions   they will form a natural proper and most satisfactory accompaniment of any such arrangements as might be thought fit to be made on this part of the ground of evidence tending to do away or narrow the application of the excluding system   they will form in the first instance a visible security against any durable and considerable inconvenience considered as derivable from any such defalcation from the authority of the excluding system should deception and consequent misdecision be suspected justly or unjustly or running in any increased stream from any branch of the newlyopened and apprehended source—measures may thereupon be taken for remedying the mischief at any time and at its earliest stage they will also serve as an anodyne to any panic terrors that might otherwise be produced by the contemplation of an innovation which to some eyes may be apt in spite of the clearest deductions of reason and even experience to appear a formidable one   on the supposition of the adoption of the other proposed remedial arrangements—they will serve to give a correct view—the only tolerably correct view that can be given of the degree in which those arrangements prove conducive to their intended purpose if the different modifications of makeshift evidence and the other sorts of evidence particularly liable to prove weak and by their weakness deceptitious have been here delineated and explained with sufficient clearness—a judge and the scribes his subordinates will find no difficulty in committing to paper as often as a lot of evidence appertaining to any of these heads presents itself the head to which it appertains in such or such a cause naming it on the side of the plaintiff the evidence was of this or that description naming it and no other on the side of the defendant there was no evidence or evidence of this or that description naming it the decision was in favour of the plaintiff or vice versâ referring a lot of evidence to the species to which it appeared to belong in a system of nomenclature thus constructed would be a sort of exercise analogous to that scholastic exercise which in the language of grammatical instruction is called parsing referring each word to that one of the genera generalissima of grammar the eight or nine parts of speech to which it appears to belong if the principle thus brought to view—the principle of methodical registration—were applied to every suit without exception whether turning or not turning upon any suspicious species of evidence—the sort of register thus produced would in more ways than one be conducive in no inconsiderable degree to the ends of justice as has been shown in treating of preappointed evidence from a register of this kind the utmost possible amount of the mischief produced by the admission of evidence of a suspicious complexion as thus distinguished—produced by the aggregate of suspicious evidence of all sorts taken together and of each sort in particular—may     be indicated with the utmost degree of exactness that can be desired and by comparing year with year it will be seen whether it be in a stationary state in a state of increase or of decrease suppose for example that in a given year the number of instances in which on one side no other evidence was exhibited than what belonged to one or another of the species of makeshift or other suspicious evidence amounted to  00 and of this number in  0 instances the decision went in disfavour of the side on which the suspicious evidence was exhibited in the  0 other instances in favour of that side this last number would represent the utmost possible amount on one hand of the mischief as likewise on the other hand of the good produced by the leaving or throwing open the door to evidence of this sort thus much as to the aggregate of the cases of all sorts put together and the same instruction would be afforded in relation to each sort taken by itself though the number of the instances in which benefit or mischief has been produced by the admission of evidence of this description would thus be given yet to exhibit the aggregate quantum of the benefit on the one hand and of the mischief on the other would require another head or two having for their object the indication of the quantum of benefit or mischief thus produced in each cause to furnish this information would require a statement of the species of causes to which the individual cause belonged in each instance for example penal or nonpenal and if penal relative to what species of offence and in the cases where money or moneys worth was at stake the amount of the value adjudged or claimed and refused to be adjudged to either side §   arrangements for diminishing the amount of the danger we come now to the second class of remedial arrangements applicable to the diminution of the quantum of mischief from this source arrangements aiming in a direct way at the diminution of the frequency of it i oath of credence or sincerity on the part of the exhibitant the party by whom the article of makeshift evidence in question is exhibited his declaration to this effect viz that according to his persuasion the information presented by the article of evidence is so far as concerns the purpose for which he presents it correct and true such declaration being given under the sanction of an oath where that ceremony is in use or solemn declaration and subject to vivâ voce examination as to the grounds and causes of such persuasion the test of sincerity thus proposed is no other than what on a former occasion was brought to view in the number of those securities the refusal of which on any occasion whatsoever was represented as an omission altogether repugnant to the ends of justice it nevertheless seemed to call for a separate mention here partly lest on an occasion on which the use of it is so manifest it should fail of presenting itself to view partly because on the occasion of its application to the present purpose it finds the case attended with material circumstances such as do not apply to it in other cases—with circumstances which call for particular observation the cases in which the demand for this security is most imperative are those in which the evidence presented immediately to the judge presents itself not in the oral but in the written form viz casuallywritten evidence and minuted evidence with any number of media interposed in the cases where the evidence presented immediately to the judge is in the oral form whatever security for sincerity is afforded by judicial examination in the usual manner is applied of course to the judicial witness where there is no extraneous witness this security is wanting and hence the demand for a supply to the deficiency by the examination of the party by whom the evidence in this case the written evidence is exhibited no good reason could be given why this same security whatever be the worth of it should not be applied in like manner to those modifications of transmitted evidence in the case of which the evidence immediately presented to the judge is presented in the oral form viz hearsay evidence and memoriter evidence indeed unless excluded by special appointment of law the general liberty of examination applying itself to selfregarding as well as extraneous evidence would involve the points in question in the present case in the way of distinction all that can be said here is that where there is another person viz the extraneous witness to whom the security applies the demand for the application of the like security to the testimony of the party in the character of a selfregarding witness is not quite so great in a certain point of view the security thus afforded may be apt to present itself as little worth a party who having been dishonest enough to procure or fabricate an article of evidence of this sort is dishonest enough to make use of it will come prepared for all the consequences nor will he shrink from perjury—from the scarce punishable perjury necessary to give this support to it true but in regard to the written evidence of this kind many a man who either knowing or suspecting the falsity or incorrectness of it would present it notwithstanding and thus     let it take its chance would at the same time be far enough from supporting it at the peril of the punishment of detected or though it were only the shame of suspected perjury and in regard to the oral evidence of this kind not only would many a man notwithstanding any secret suspicion entertained by him of its falsity or incorrectness suffer it if proffered to take its chance as before but there are also others who though not bold enough to support a tale of perjury with their own lips would yet be dishonest enough to send other lips upon the adventure thus in two cases both of them but too common the arrangements proposed would afford considerable security at present under every system of technical procedure this security is altogether wanting when judges on so many occasions as we have seen not only apply no discouragement to insincerity but apply encouragement and even compulsion to the production of mendacity—when judges by the whole tenor of their practice proclaim a predilection for insincerity—can it with any reason be expected that suitors in general or more particularly that their professional guides and agents the worshippers of the judicial hierarchy should in general be averse to it or when employable with safety backward to employ it ii to this head also belongs another arrangement all along proposed for allowing to the judge to be exercised at his discretion the power of exacting from the party in whose favour the decision operates in the first instance security for eventual reinstatement for affording to the other party completely adequate satisfaction in case by the subsequent exhibition of more trustworthy evidence from the same original source the decision having the makeshift evidence for its ground should turn out to be erroneous on those occasions the description of the contingency was confined to the particular event bearing a special relation to the case then in contemplation—the event of the disproof of the makeshift evidence by other evidence emanating from the same original source but from what source soever any such subsequently corrective evidence may have issued—if it be true and the decision called for by it be different from that which it finds in force the practical inference it is evident is precisely the same iii in what cases for the remedying of the injustice liable to be produced by the decision of one tribunal liberty should be granted or obligation imposed of submitting the cause to the cognizance of another is a question that belongs not to the present subject nor to the present work in the extraordinary sort of case here in question that of a decision grounded on such weak and comparatively untrustworthy evidence—such reference might perhaps with propriety be prescribed or allowed of in causes and circumstance in which supposing the decision grounded on evidence of the ordinary stamp such reference might not be eligible without attempting at present to decide upon the eligibility of any of these arrangements the present indication will be confined to such remedies of this stamp as the nature of the case admits of the question of their ultimate eligibility properly appertains to another subject that of procedure   liberty of appeal i e of appealing to another tribunal whose decision shall have for its ground this same body of evidence without either addition or defalcation the person by whom such appeal if preferred at all will be preferred is of course a party and that party to whose prejudice the decision having the supposed insufficient evidence for its ground is regarded by him as having operated   liberty of reference power given to the judge to refer the decision in a case of this sort to another tribunal naturally a superior tribunal if he thinks fit with or without a provisional decision of his own annexed to it an arrangement of this description is superseded it may be thought by the one immediately preceding it if appeal be allowed the party in whose disfavour the decision the decision grounded on the comparatively untrustworthy evidence operates will if he considers it as being injurious to him appeal of course if he does not regard it as injurious to him the case calling for a reference does not exist so that in each and every case such reference is of no use to this it may be answered—  the party howsoever willing to appeal may be disabled by the expense   he may be deterred by the contemplation of the expense and vexation added together   he may be deterred by the consideration of the weight and authority of the opinion declared by the court below the court above—whether if it had to frame a decision on the subject in the first instance it would or would not have pronounced the same as that which has been pronounced below—may not regard the case as clear enough to warrant the reversing a decision already pronounced by a competent judicature upon all these considerations taken together it will probably appear that the demand for the power thus proposed to be given to the judge would by no means be superseded by the power of appeal if given to the party moreover in case of appeal argument and consequently expense or vexation on the part of the appellant and consequently on the part of the adversary would be naturally though it should be added not necessarily allowed whereas in case of a reference made as above by one tribunal to another such     argument with the vexation and expense attached to it would not be so much in course   obligation of reference—obligation superadded to the power above proposed to be given to the judge the reference in this case being or not being accompanied by a provisional decision previously pronounced by himself   in the case of trial by jury—power to the judge the professional directing judge to order a new trial if dissatisfied with a verdict given on the ground of the suspicious evidence this arrangement takes for granted a previous charge or direction from the judge warning the jury against the error into which the order for a new trial assumes them to have fallen by deciding in favour of the evidence the insufficiency of which is thus assumed in english law it has already been observed new trial granted at the instance of a party on the ground of the verdicts being against evidence is in familiar use the extension would be a very slight one were the power extended to the case of a verdict supposed to be grounded as above on insufficient evidence in the case of exclusion in general the assumption is that if the jury were suffered to hear the evidence they would be sure to be deceived by it experience had judges but patience to consult her would have superseded the demand for this rash suspicion will they be deceived by it stay and see should their decision prove erroneous then and not till then it may be proper to take measures for obtaining a new one §   importance of admitting makeshift in the character of indicative evidence the principle employed for fixing the conditions to be annexed to the admission of makeshift evidence was this—viz not to admit any such comparatively untrustworthy evidence where evidence to the same effect is to be had in a more trustworthy shape from the same source but supposing the sources of information to exist will the information be always to be obtained from them in any such more trustworthy shape he whose interest it is to bring forward the information in question will it be in his power to draw it forth from those superior sources this will depend upon the sagacity and industry displayed on this ground by the legislator—upon the care taken by him to afford the requisite powers to him whosoever he be whose inclination and will is in a state of preparation for this service the powers in question are those which are requisite to the investigation of a chain or thread of evidence—to the discovery of such evidence as the individual nature of the case may have happened to afford and when discovered to the securing of its forthcomingness for the purposes of justice to take the arrangements adapted to this purpose constitutes one of the principal functions of the system of procedure to that subject accordingly they belong and not to the subject of the present work a brief intimation of the mode in which evidence fit or unfit to constitute a ground for definitive decision may be applied to this incidental purpose may not without reason be expected to be found here by the term indicative evidence i understand not any particular and separate sort of evidence such as circumstantial direct selfregarding and so forth—but evidence of any sort considered as being productive of a particular effect viz the indicating or bringing to view the existence certain or probable of some other article of evidence indicative evidence is evidence of evidence to apply the distinction to the subject of makeshift evidence if the rule above laid down in this behalf be a proper one no article of makeshift evidence ought to be received viz into the list of the articles constituting on that side the ground for decision where evidence in a more trustworthy form is to be had from the same source in other words no such article of evidence ought to be received into the budget of documents designed by the judge for ultimate use be it so but neither of this description nor of any other conceivable description can any sort or article of evidence be named which it may not be proper to employ in the character of indicative evidence viz as a help to the discovery or procurement of other evidence such as may be fit for ultimate use thus for example in the instance of hearsay evidence—hearsay evidence of the second degree—supposed oral evidence transmitted through two media says deposing witness in his examination before the judge—middleman as he said to me heard percipiens say that he was by and saw what passed when the defendant gave occisus his deaths wound and there ends his evidence now then middleman and percipiens are they both alive the evidence is plainly unfit to be received into the budget for ultimate use accordingly neither would it in any case be so received into any such collection under english law but ought such information to be altogether unemployed and lost by no means unfit in the character of evidence for ultimate use it is not the less fit for serving in the character of indicative evidence let percipiens be convened before the judge and if on being examined he gives evasive answers or says he knows nothing about the matter let middleman be convened to confront him—that     by means of middlemans testimony the misrecollections if any in the evidence of percipiens may if possible be corrected—the deficiencies in his recollection may if possible be supplied the same explanations are alike applicable to every other modification of makeshift evidence casually written evidence is indicative with relation to the judicially extractable oral evidence of the writer of the script transcriptural evidence is indicative with relation to the original script minuted evidence is so with relation to the writer of the minute as well as to any extrajudicial witness whose oral statement or narration is the subject of it memoriter evidence is so with relation to the script the supposed tenor purport or effect of which is thus reported reported real evidence is so with relation to the real evidence which is the subject of the report and in case of the interposition of divers media transmitted evidence of any degree is indicative of course of all superior degrees of evidence from the same original source from the bare description of this species of evidence that is of the use thus to be made of any species of evidence it will be manifest beyond dispute that any system which for the purpose of any sort of cause penal or nonpenal should unless for the avoidance of preponderant delay vexation and expense omit to make use of makeshift or other evidence in this way—to make use of it to the utmost for the purpose of discovering and obtaining such information as is to be had in a state fit for ultimate use—is to the amount of such omissions defective and unconducive to the ends of justice the proposition is not a purely hypothetical one in the instance of the english system of procedure exemplifications of it but too extensive may be observed in the penal branch in cases of felony unclergyable and clergyable or to speak without nonsense in first and second rate crimes evidence applicable or not to ultimate use becomes by accident applicable to this use it serves for the discovery and thence perhaps for the obtainment of evidence ultimately employable this incidental use is extendible always by accident—for design design at least directed to the legitimate ends of justice is an incident still wanting to the jurisprudential system of english procedure—this use is extendible to a certain degree to inferior offences but to causes nonpenal carried on in any branch of the regular mode whether it be the branch called the commonlaw branch or the branch called the equity branch it is scarce in any case extendible if the evidence which the witness whom you have summoned has it in his power to give happens to be of that sort which is applicable to ultimate use well and good—it may be put to use accordingly if not the arrangements of procedure will not suffer it to be put to the other use if you have no evidence from any other source be the evidence obtainable from this source ever so conclusive you lose your cause chapter xii aberrations of english law in regard to makeshift evidence such are the arrangements such the rules of judging that have been suggested by a regard for the ends of justice the avoidance of misdecision on one hand and on the other the reducing on every occasion to their least dimensions the collateral and never completely avoidable inconveniences of delay vexation and expense if the above arrangements are well adjusted to such their ends—and if the arrangements actually pursued by english jurisprudence were also well adjusted to these same ends—those actually existing arrangements could not in any point he very widely distant from the above proposed ones so much for the argumentative picture of things the picture next to be given must be taken from life if on this occasion the reader has prepared his mind to view a system of arrangements suggested by and bonâ fide directed to the ends of justice great indeed will be his surprise and disappointment if on the other hand the coutrary hypothesis be assumed—if on considering the natural opposition of interest on this ground between the governors and the governed his assumption should be that in the views and wishes of the authors of these arrangements the difference between right decision and misdecision has been in general a matter of indifference—and that in so far as was conducive to the profit of the governing profession not the minimum but the maximum of delay vexation and expense has been the object of endeavour—he will find every object consistent with that assumption—every arrangement flowing naturally from that source an explanatory hint must in this place be given to the nonprofessional and more particularly to the nonenglish reader observing one copy of the same document rejected at the same time that another copy of the same instrument is admitted—if for anything that appears both are in existence and producible it may naturally enough appear to him that the rejection of either however illfounded in principle would be matter of indifference in practice reasonable as it is the supposition would be erroneous and delusive under a different system of procedure—under     the system drawn from roman law and generally prevalent on the continent of europe—it would either be agreeable to or at least less widely distant from the truth but in english procedure no option thus made if it be exclusive is ever a matter of indifference the document thus excluded is always the document whatever it be that happens to have been tendered the consequence of the exclusion is not a simple reference to the approved document without further delay vexation or expense but an actual loss of the cause to the party whose document is thus rejected the direct injustice thence resulting as to the main point in dispute is not indeed in this case in every instance irreparable but in many and many an instance it is either because under the existing arrangements the door is not left open to a fresh demand on the same ground or because in the interval and before it can receive a decision either some necessary evidence has perished or the fund necessary for the alimentation of the suit has been exhausted be this as it may and according to the least calamitous result a fresh trial hearing or whatever be the name of it is necessary—in a word a fresh suit in consequence of which the delay vexation and expense bestowed upon the preceding one are in a great part or as the case may be in the whole wasted and thrown away here then once for all let this deplorable and but too indisputable truth be borne in mind that—howsoever it might be under a natural system and even in the technical system of any other country—in the technical system of english jurisprudence there are no innoxious no completely reparable nor anything like completely reparable mistakes and that whatsoever absurdity is discernible—fraud and the spirit of extortion may or may not have been the cause—plunder oppression and affliction are infallibly the result on this ground as on every other part of the vast demesne of jurisprudence whatever is at variance with the ends of justice will be to be referred in proportions not always to be distinguished to the two grand sources of misdecision—improbity and folly the improbity has for its cause the as yet unremedied but not irremediable opposition of interests between this class of governors and the governed the folly has for its cause at least for a very principal one of its causes one of the essential characters of jurisprudential law—the taking the conceptions and practice of a less experienced and less informed as a standard for the notions and practice of a more experienced and better informed age i proceed to bring to view the most important of the aberrations from the above rules exemplified in english law together with the inconveniences with which they respectively appear pregnant   the first consists in admitting at the instance of the plaintiff to the prejudice of the defendant in the lifetime of the defendant a letter or memorandum in his hand the defendant though alive being neither compelled nor permitted to stand forth himself in the character of a deposing witness to be examined upon oath as a nonlitigant witness would be touching the facts brought to view in such written discourse and so in the case of a written statement of the plaintiffs at the instance of the defendant by the influence of a superstition which has been already touched upon and which will be more thoroughly discussed in another place the evidence of a defendant is not permitted to be extracted in the mode recognised to be the best but the objection confines itself to the best mode no sooner does a bad mode present itself than the prohibition is taken off refusing to hear the testimony of a defendant extracted in the way of vivâ voce examination the law refuses as may well be imagined to receive the testimony of the same person exhibited in the form of written nonjudicial evidence—in the form of a letter or memorandum not designed at the time of writing it or at least not purporting to be designed to be exhibited as evidence so far at any rate it is consistent and admitting the propriety of not suffering the defendant to be examined in the character of a witness unexceptionable but when the plaintiff having by any accident possessed himself of a letter or memorandum in the handwriting of the defendant thinks fit on his part to exhibit it as evidence then the rule goes for nothing and the evidence is admitted in this admission the law considers itself as safe against deceit and so it undoubtedly is viz on one side the side of the plaintiff—the only side to which on this occasion its views appear to have extended to the prejudice of the plaintiff the admission of it will not be productive of injustice why because it is he who produces it so far is right the reason is a conclusive one but the defendant are his interests taken equal care of the answer is no they are entirely neglected in a multitude of cases—each of them capable of being realized each of them doubtless every now and then realized—conclusions as contrary to truth as they are prejudicial to the defendant will every now and then be drawn necessarily drawn when a deaf ear is turned to those vivâ voce explanations by which the truth of the case might in its whole extent be brought to light       the second aberration consists in the exclusion put upon the like written testimony of a witness litigant or nonlitigant after his decease a point of time after which on the one hand the examination of such witness is become impossible on the other hand the capacity of profiting in his own person at least by such his testimony supposing it false and fraudulent is at an end such it will be seen is the course taken in general by the english law a course crossed indeed by a multitude of exceptions the propriety of which can by no other arguments be maintained than by such the validity of which is the condemnation of the general rule in the whole field of evidence which is as much as to say in the whole field of justice few points can be of greater importance under this head come the books of a shopkeeper including the register kept by him of the monies due to him that these books should not of themselves and during the masters lifetime be conclusive evidence in his favour the evidence unsanctioned and the author uncrossexamined is a proposition too plain to stand in need of argument each shopkeeper might at that rate impose a tax to any amount on any number of persons at his choice that the written evidence even of his servant in his behalf should not be received as conclusive—should not be received at all during the lifetime of such servant such servant being capable of being examined in the regular mode and yet not examined—is another proposition which i have endeavoured to establish but if after the death of such servant the entries made by him were not permitted so much as to be received in the character of evidence what would be the consequence that every tradesmans title to the monies owing to him for his goods would be dependent completely dependent on the life of the servant the bookkeeper the journeyman the porter by whom they had been respectively delivered to his customers the death of the servant and the ruin of the master would be the effect of the same inevitable cause a word a phrase a broken hint an uncompleted and perhaps uncompleteable sentence—such is the garb in which reason clothes herself on those great and rare occasions on which she vouchsafes to visit the shelves of english law sometimes the word necessity sometimes the phrase course of trade is the fragment of a reason under favour of which a pretence is sought for the breach made upon this ground in the irrational and intolerable rule but to what use introduce necessity—what justification can necessity afford for the breach of any rule laid down by reason—of a rule prescribed by any comprehensive view of the dictates of utility the species of evidence being admitted one or other of two opposite results—deception or nondeception is the most probable if admitted would it be oftener productive of deception and thence of erroneous decision than of a just persuasion and thence of a decision according to truth and justice in this case where is the necessity let what will be understood as signified by that vague appellation—where or what is the necessity that can warrant the admission of the fallacious light apply the same observation to the compound term the course of trade trade is a good thing it is universally agreed to be so great sacrifices though not always very advantageous ones are made continually in its service but is it in the nature of trade any more than of any other desirable object to be benefited or promoted by the letting in a species of light of which injustice oftener than justice will by the supposition be the consequence is it in the nature of trade any more than of justice to receive advancement by a system of decision of which the effect will be to put the fruits and profits of trade more frequently into the pocket of a cheat than of the lawful owner of two things one the evidence admitted either promises to be most frequently productive of justice or of injustice if of justice no such word as necessity or trade can be necessary—if of injustice no such word can be sufficient to warrant the admission of it† it has been observed already that there is a whole class of facts for the proof of which in spite of all excluding rules a door is thrown wide open to all sorts of evidence without scruple not only to this but too suspicious evidence but to the much more suspicious and fallacious evidence which by english lawyers has so often been confounded with it i mean hearsay evidence and what are these facts i can think of but one attribute by which indeterminate as it is they can be designated and that is ancient ancient facts—facts tending to the establishment of family relation locally obligatory custom ancient possession of rights of partial ownership and the like if on one part of the ground more than another the argument from necessity can be said to apply with peculiar force it will be on this on this sort of ground exclude this sort of evidence you exclude all evidence the witch of endor the sibyl once so complaisant to the curiosity of ulysses are not now in office ghosts cannot now be brought into court obtorto collo to be sworn and crossexamined an interval     of a certain length has it elapsed between the present time and the time of the fact or supposed fact—such evidence as the nature of things furnishes you must admit or none written extrajudicial evidence if it be to be had howsoever it happens to present itself it is your best chance failing this even hearsay evidence—hearsay evidence remote from the fountain head by any number of degrees and with or without being able to trace it to the fountain head or so much as to number the degrees such is the choice in respect of sorts of evidence one of these two or none but even in this case of what avail or even import is the plea of necessity any more than in any other as to the import here indeed it is plain enough that such is the case—this evidence or none but in this case as in every other is not the absence of all evidence a preferable result to the presence of a species of evidence which be the case what it will is more likely to give birth to a wrong judgment than to a right one in vain would it be to say that in this case the danger of deception is in any respect less than in any other on the contrary it is even greater recent testimony—testimony concerning recent facts if mendacious or otherwise incorrect possesses its chance of receiving confutation or correction in the regular and most satisfactory mode from the sanctioned and scrutinized testimony of persons still alive circumstantial evidence will in the character of indicative evidence afford a clue to this or that lot of vivâ voce evidence—a clue which fraud with all its cunning may not have suspected but in the case of ancient facts who shall follow out the clue that has been broken by the same hand that cut the thread of life it may be thought superfluous after this to add any such reflections as the following—  that in point of distance of time no determinate line has been so much as attempted to be drawn nor could easily be drawn between these ancient facts and facts of more ordinary occurrence   that among the facts thus treated as ancient facts are facts that may have been but as of yesterday   that in particular in a case that has given birth to a decision pronouncing the admission of even hearsay evidence the length of interval extended not beyond twenty years   that the length by which in the proposed rule the place of the line which separates admission from exclusion is proposed to be determined is the length of human life—a length which though in one case it may be but that of an atom may in another case be some number of times the above recorded and admitted length of twenty years and   that the true criterion between cases for admission and cases for rejection is constituted not by the length of time considered in itself but by the existence or nonexistence of the faculty of submitting the testimony to the action of the scrutinizing and purifying tests the witness in mind as well as body is he still ready at the call of justice admit not his written statement though it have an antiquity of sixty of eighty years to plead for it has he taken his departure from the world we live in admit the paper though the ink have scarce yet ceased to wet it but may it not then be false false and fabricated for the purpose indubitably it may though in our own times at least such fraud or any mark of such fraud committed by a hand so circumstanced is neither natural nor common but is the presence of such fraud in each case more probable than the absence and where present is the success of it more probable than the failure after all the warning recommended to be given of it and which so naturally will be given of it and are these the only times in which the propensity to fraud has been to be found in the nature of man forged deeds and other fruits of lettered fraud are they in greater proportion to true and authentic writings in these our times such as they are than in the times of monkery and monkish charters such are the questions of minor account that present themselves as applicable to this particular case but have they not been already superseded and rendered superfluous by that broadest and allcomprehensive line of argument which covers the whole of the ground to which the species of evidence now before us is applicable   a third aberration consists in receiving the testimony of a witness in the unsatisfactory form of casually written evidence upon the ground of a mere unforthcomingness on his part at the time without any inquiry into the cause whether temporary or perpetual and without provision for reparation of the wrong in the event of its being proved false by subsequent vivâ voce examination in the regular and proper mode the admissibility of this evidence under these circumstances being established what would be the consequence that where the value at stake was sufficient to pay the expense of the fraud a man would procure his witness in the first place to fabricate a piece of written evidence adapted to the circumstances of the case in the next place to keep out of the way till after it had been put to its judicial use and a decision had been grounded upon it or by procuring the like testimony from a man whose known intention it was never to revisit     the country in which it was to be fabricated the expense of purchasing absence might thus be saved not that it follows by any means that if under favour of the rule protested against the characteristic fraud were even to be frequently attempted the attempt would be as frequently or anything like as frequently successful with the warning which it is here proposed should be given of it and which without any such proposal would naturally be given of it to the judge of fact by the judge of law i should not expect to see such evidence frequently productive of a decision on that side even where the truth of the case was on that same side much less to see any frequent reason for suspecting that fraud had by this means been rendered triumphant but where without incurring any such risk the purposes of substantial justice might in an equal degree be accomplished the danger whatever it may amount to seems to have nothing to compensate it symptoms of a tendency at least to admit in this unguarded way evidence in its own nature so suspicious—so apt to be fallacious has been here and there betrayed by english law   in regard to the admission of transcripts the aberrations of english law are still more remarkable in the case where the original is not absolutely unproducible the question respecting the admission of transcripts will be apt at first to present itself as of little or no practical importance if the transcript will serve let it be admitted—if not let the original be produced thus in effect the matter will stand taking the world at large but in english procedure the spirit of chicane has on this part of the ground as on so many others contrived to raise a cloud of frivolous distinctions under the influence of which the interests of justice have in numerous instances gone to wreck in that system of procedure so far as the use of trial by jury extends whatever evidence is capable of contributing to form the ground of decision must be presented every part of it within the compass of a given part of a given day at that period a transcriptural document being presented if it be a case where a transcript is allowed to be received in place of the original well and good if not and the document is a necessary one to the side of the party by whom it was produced the cause is lost for that time at least i e in respect of the action then depending and whether the loss be reparable or no depends upon a variety of circumstances if the transcript be presented on the defendants side and essential to it—and if the case be of the number of those in which a transcript or that sort of transcript happens to be found inadmissible—woe to the man whose lot it happens to be to occupy the station of defendant if it be the pleasure of the judge to grant him a new trial on condition of taking his chance for that expensive remedy the omission may be repaired—the original may be produced but at the best and even at that expense the reparation of the omission—the saving his cause from perdition and injustice and himself perhaps from ruin—depends not upon himself whereas were his station in the cause that of the plaintiff it would depend upon himself to suffer what is called a nonsuit and at the price of a fresh action to substitute the admissible document for the inadmissible one on the ground of transcriptural evidence among the inconveniences by which suitors are apt to be tormented those which consist in undue decision or failure of justice having the spuriousness or incorrectness of this species of evidence for their cause constitute but a small proportion of the aggregate mass it is in the triple shape of delay vexation and expense that the principal part of the mischief displays itself transcripts are made of a mass of writing to any extent where a glance of the original would be sufficient of a mass of writing of which but a small part is relevant or at least necessary to the purpose the whole is transcribed without distinction transcripts are made by an official hand at an extra expense—an expense sometimes altogether arbitrary and most commonly excessive as being at a monopoly—where transcripts made at an ordinary expense might afford a lot of evidence equally satisfactory to an impartial or candid mind originals are fetched from unlimited distances in official or other appropriate and consequently highpaid custody—when transcripts in the way of extract or even entire might be obtained and sufficiently authenticated at an inferior price the mass of delay vexation and expense which has for its cause any real bonâ fide disbelief or suspicion as to the genuineness or correctness of a lot of transcriptural evidence is perhaps not a tenth not a twentieth not a hundredth part of that which has mala fides on the one part or the other for its cause in the view of guarding against spuriousness and incorrectness certain regulations are established if in any the most minute particular party a is found departing from these regulations party b takes advantage of the flaw each party sure of being opposed by morally unjust though legally just objections on the part of the other heaps paper upon paper expense upon expense a party though secure in his own mind against objection on the part of his adversary will for the sake of inflicting vexation on him pretend   0 to apprehend vexation from him or rather without so much as the necessity of any such pretence act as if he apprehended it agents of the parties on both sides and of all descriptions official scribes of all descriptions all have an interest in increasing the load by additions in themselves unnecessary all have pretences for giving birth to such increase all have it more or less in their power to give birth to it judges by whom such abuses should be watched with a sleepless eye and averted by an inexorable hand contribute not so much to reduce the load as to increase it by useless and groundless punctilios the result of some caprice of the imagination—of partial views in which the contemplation of some illchosen means has eclipsed the prospect of the ultimate and proper end the prevention of the inconveniences so often mentioned parties their agents and the subaltern officers of justice each on his own part aims at profitable injustice judges second the endeavours of all   few questions have been more agitated in english law than those which relate to the admissibility of and the effect to be given to different articles of adscititious evidence† the subject occupies sixty closely printed nominal octavo real quarto pages in phillippss exposition of the law of evidence of a subject thus extensive more than a very general view cannot be expected to be given in the present work nor is it necessary for our purpose to go beyond the more prominent features one remarkable circumstance is that the whole body of the rules of law relating to this subject are with a very small number of exceptions exclusionary either the decision given in a former cause is said not to be evidence and then it is that decision which is excluded or it is said to be conclusive evidence and then an exclusion is put upon the whole mass of evidence howsoever constituted which might have been capable of being presented on the other side in saying this enough has already been said to satisfy any one who has assented to what was said in a former chapter concerning adscititious evidence that nearly the whole of the established rules on this subject except to the extent of the single and very limited case in which it was there seen that exclusion is proper are bad accordingly the rule that a judgment directly upon the point is conclusive in any future cause between the same parties is a good rule—it is almost the only one that is even this rule is cut into by one exception that verdicts in criminal procedings are not only not conclusive but are not even admissible evidence in civil cases‡ for this exception two reasons are given the one founded on a mere technicality—the other on a view though a narrow and partial one of the justice of the case the first is that it is res inter alios acta the parties in the civil cause cannot it is said have been also the parties in the previous criminal one the plaintiff in a criminal proceeding being the king it is obvious however that the kings being plaintiff is in this case a mere fiction although the party in whose favour the previous verdict is offered in evidence was not called the plaintiff in the former proceeding there is nothing whatever to hinder him from having been the prosecutor who is substantially the plaintiff now if he was the prosecutor and his adversary the defendant it is evident that the cause is between the same parties that it is not in reality res inter alios acta and that if it be treated as such justice is sacrificed as it so often is to a fiction of law the other reason is that the party in the civil suit in whose behalf the evidence is supposed to be offered might have been a witness on the prosecution∥ this is true he might have been a witness and the previous verdict might have been obtained by his evidence but it might be that the contrary was the case whether he was a witness or not is capable of being ascertained if he was not a witness why adhere to a rule which cannot have the shadow of a ground but upon the supposition that he was but suppose even that he was a witness and that the verdict which he now seeks to make use of was obtained from the jury by means of his own testimony this will often be a very good reason for distrust but it never can be a sufficient reason for exclusion under a system of law indeed which does not suffer a party to give evidence directly in his own behalf it is consistent enough to prevent him from doing the same thing in a roundabout way a proposition however which will be maintained in the sequel of this work is that in no case ought the plaintiff to be excluded from testifying in what lawyers indeed would call his own behalf but which by the aid of counterinterrogation is really if his cause is bad much more his adversarys behalf     than his own should this opinion be found to rest on sufficient grounds the reason just referred to for not admitting the former verdict as evidence will appear to be on the contrary a strong reason for admitting it thus much may suffice as to the first rule relating to this subject in english law—a rule which has been seen to be as reasonable as the abovementioned exception to it is unreasonable we shall find few instances in the succeeding rules of an approach even thus near to the confines of common sense for first a judgment is not evidence even between the same parties of any matter which came collaterally in question nor of any matter incidentally cognizable nor of any matter to be inferred by argument from the judgment by the words not evidence lawyers sometimes mean one thing sometimes another here however not admissible in evidence is what is meant that it ought not to be conclusive as to any fact but such as the judgment if conformable to law necessarily supposes to have been proved is no more than we have seen in a former chapter that however because it ought not to be made conclusive it ought not to be admissible is an inference which none but a lawyer would ever think of drawing a common mans actions are received every day as circumstantial evidence of the motive by which he was actuated why not those of a judge the next rule is that a verdict or judgment on a former occasion is not evidence against any one who was a stranger to the former proceeding that is who was not a party nor stood in any such relation to a party as will induce lawyers to say that he was privy to the verdict the reason why a judgment under these circumstances is not evidence is that it is res inter alios acta but we have seen already† that its being res inter alios acta though a sufficient reason for receiving it with suspicion is no reason for excluding it the more special reason by which in the case now under consideration this general one is corroborated is that the party had no opportunity to examine witnesses or to defend himself or to appeal against the judgment‡ this being undeniable it would be very improper no doubt to take the judgment for conclusive on this ground what is the dictate of unsophisticated common sense a very obvious one as the party has not had an opportunity to examine witnesses to defend himself or to appeal against the judgment at a former period let him have an opportunity of doing all these things now let him have leave to impeach the validity of the grounds on which the former judgment was given and to show by comments on the evidence or by adducing fresh evidence that it was an improper one but do not shut out perhaps the only evidence which is now to be had against him merely because it would be unjust on the ground of that evidence to condemn him without a hearing in the nature of a judgment is there anything which renders a jury less capable of appreciating that kind of evidence than any other kind at its just value but it is useless to argue against one particular case of the barbarous policy which excludes all evidence that seems in any degree exposed to be untrustworthy the proofs which will be hereafter∥ adduced of the absurdity of the principle are proofs of its absurdity in this case as in every other another curious rule is that as a judgment is not evidence against a stranger the contrary judgment shall not be evidence for him if the rule itself is a curious one the reason given for it is still more so—nobody can take benefit by a verdict who had not been prejudiced by it had it gone contrary a maxim which one would suppose to have found its way from the gamingtable to the bench if a party be benefited by one throw of the dice he will if the rules of fair play are observed be prejudiced by another but that the consequence should hold when applied to justice is not equally clear this rule of mutuality is destitute of even that semblance of reason which there is for the rule concerning res inter alios acta there is reason for saying that a man shall not lose his cause in consequence of the verdict given in a former proceeding to which he was not a party but there is no reason whatever for saying that he shall not lose his cause in consequence of the verdict in a proceeding to which he was a party merely because his adversary was not it is right enough that a verdict obtained by a against b should not bar the claim of a third party c but that it should not be evidence in favour of c against b seems the very height of absurdity the only fragment of a reason which we can find in the books having the least pretension to rationality is this—that c the party who gives the verdict in evidence may have been one of the witnesses by means of whose testimony it was obtained the inconclusiveness of this reason we have already seen the rule that a judgment inter alios is not evidence which like all other rules of law is the perfection of reason is in a variety of instances set aside by as many nominal exceptions but real violations all of which are also the perfection of reason to the praise of common sense at least they might justly lay     claim if they did no more in each instance than abrogate the exclusionary rule but if the rule be bad in one way the exceptions as usual are bad in the contrary way one of the exceptions relates to an order of removal executed and either not appealed against or if appealed against confirmed by the quartersessions this as between third parishes who were not parties to the order is admissible evidence and therefore such is jurisprudential logic conclusive the officers therefore of a third parish in which the pauper may have obtained a settlement have it in their power by merely keeping the only witnesses who could prove the settlement out of the way till after the next quartersessions or at farthest for three months to rid their parish for ever of the incumbrance the reason of this is that there may be some end to litigation—a reason which is a great favourite with lawyers and very justly litigation—understand in those who cannot pay for it—is a bad thing let no such person presume to apply for justice one is tempted however to ask whether justice be a thing worth having or no and if it be at what time it is desirable that litigation should be at an end after justice is done or before it would be ridiculous to ask for what reason it is of so much greater importance that litigation between parishes should have an end than litigation between individuals since a question of this sort would imply what can by no means be assumed that reason had something to do with the matter what is called a judgment in rem in the exchequer is as to all the world admissible and conclusive the sentence of a court of admiralty is in like manner as against all persons admissible and conclusive so is even that of a foreign court of admiralty the sentence of ecclesiastical courts in some particular instances—this like the others is admissible and like the others conclusive it is useless to swell the list equally useless would it be to enter into a detailed exposition of the badness of these several rules the reader by whom the spirit of the foregoing remarks has been imbibed will make the application to all these cases for himself the law recognises no difference in effect between the decision of a court abroad and that of a court at home the sentence of any foreign court of competent jurisdiction directly deciding a question is conclusive if the same question arise incidentally between the same parties in this country in all other cases it is inadmissible the case of debt in which it is admissible but not conclusive is partially and but partially an exception for even in this case the foreign judgment is as to some points conclusive† to make no allowance for the different chance which different courts afford for rectitude of decision would be consistent enough as between one court and another in the same country in england at least the rules of the several courts howsoever different among themselves being each of them within its own sphere the perfection of reason any such allowance as is here spoken of would be obviously absurd that must be equally good everywhere which is everywhere the best possible of foreign judicatories however taken in the lump similar excellence has not we may venture to affirm been ever predicated by any english lawyer nor is likely to be by any englishman for englishmen how blind soever to the defects of their own institutions have usually a keen enough perception of the demerits whether of institutions or of anything else if presented to them without the bounds of their own country were a consistent regard paid to the dictates of justice what could appear more absurd than to give the effect of conclusive evidence to the decisions of courts in which nearly all the vices of english procedure prevail unaccompanied by those cardinal securities—publicity and crossexamination—which go so far to make amends for all those vices and which alone render english judicature endurable yet the rule which in so many cases excludes those decisions altogether errs nearly as much on the contrary side for the difficulty of bringing witnesses and other evidence from another country being generally greater than that of bringing them from another and perhaps not a distant part of the same country there is the greater probability that the decision in question may be the only evidence obtainable after what has been observed concerning the admissibility of prior decisions in english law little need be said on that of prior depositions wherever the decision itself is said to be res inter alios acta the depositions on which it was grounded are so too and are consequently excluded in other cases they are generally admissible though to this there are some exceptions happily nobody ever thought of making them conclusive ‡among the causes which have contributed to heap vexation upon suitors on the ground of evidence one has been the scramble for jurisdiction i e for fees between the commonlaw courts and the courts called courts of equity such was the hostility the commonlaw courts refused to give credit to whatever was done under authority of their rivals depositions in equity were not admissible evidence at common law when the work of iniquity is wrought by judicial     hands there must always be a pretence but no pretence has been too thin to serve the purpose it consists always in some word or phrase and any one word that comes uppermost is sufficient the pretence on this occasion was—a court of equity is not a court of record a better one would have been to have said it is not a tennis court the consequence would have been equally legitimate and the defects of the commonlaw courts and the effrontery of the conductors of the business would not have been placed in so striking a point of view with much better reason if reason had anything to do in the business might the equity courts have refused the application of courts of record to the commonlaw courts in every cause the evidence and that alone is the essence of the cause in it is contained whatever constitutes the individual character of the cause and distinguishes it from all other causes of the same species to a cause the evidence is what the kernel is to the nut in a court of equity this principal part of the cause though not made up in the best manner is at any rate put upon record or in plain english committed to writing and preserved in a court of law this is never done the evidence like the leaves of the sibyl is committed to the winds what goes by the name of the record is a compound of sense and nonsense with excess of nonsense the sense composed of a minute quantity of useful truth drowned and rendered scarce distinguishable by a flood of lies which would be more mischievous if they were less notorious in the court of exchequer the same judges constitute one day a court of equity another day a court of law what if the occasion for the rejection of the evidence had presented itself in this court in the hands of an english judge the jus mentiendi is the sword of alexander on the declared ground of iniquity stopping every day their own proceedings why scruple to refuse credit to their own acts it is now however fully settled that the answer of the defendant as well as the depositions of witnesses in chancery are evidence in a court of law and that a decree of the court of chancery may be given in evidence on the same footing and under the same limitations as the verdict of judgment of a court of common law the exemplifications which we undertook to give of the defects of english law in relation to makeshift evidence may here end to what purpose weary the reader with the dull detail of the cases in which casuallywritten or ex parte preappointed evidence are excluded with the equally long and equally dull list of the cases in which though exclusion would be just as reasonable if it were reasonable at all admission and not exclusion is the rule to know that the established systems are everywhere radically wrong—wrong in the fundamental principles upon which they rest and wrong just so far as those principles are consistently applied—this to the person who regards the happiness of mankind as worth pursuing and good laws as essential to happiness is in a preeminent degree important and interesting but for one who by a comprehensive survey of the grand features has satisfied himself that the system is rotten to the core for such a person to know that it is somewhat more tolerable in one part than in another part—that principles which are mischievous in all their applications are a little more or a little less mischievous in one application than in another—that in this or that portion of the field of law vicious theories are consistently carried out and yield their appropriate fruit in equally vicious practice while in this or that odd corner they are departed from—would in general be a sort of knowledge as destitute of instruction as it always is and necessarily must be of amusement     book vii of the authentication of evidence chapter i authentication what connexion of this subject with that of preappointed evidence in the book having for its subject preappointed evidence—in bringing to view the uses or advantages derivable from that kind of evidence considered as applied to instruments expressive of contracts taken in the largest sense—prevention of spurious or falsified instruments i e spurious in the whole or in part was stated as being of the number of those uses the function then considered as belonging to the legislator was so to order matters that in so far as contracts have been entered into genuine instruments expressive of them shall be in existence and that spurious instruments instruments expressive of discourses that were never uttered by the persons by whom they purport or by some one are pretended to have been uttered may not be in existence so to order matters as that when an instrument so framed as above is genuine it shall be believed to be and recognised as genuine and that when an instrument purporting or appearing or pretended to be so framed as above is not genuine but either spurious in toto or falsified it shall be understood that it is spurious or falsified and in case of falsification what are the parts in it that are falsified is another of the legislators functions which remains to form the subject of this book on that former occasion room and demand were seen to exist for something in the way of regulation—something how little soever in comparison with that which has so commonly been done on this occasion there is no demand for anything whatsoever to be done in the way of regulation whatever is to be done consists wholly of instruction—instruction from the legislator delivered for the information and guidance of the judge chapter ii subjectmatters of authentication what modes of authentication in the case of real and of oral evidence three main species or parcels have again and again been mentioned as comprising together the whole possible matter of evidence—real oral and written the same term authentication may be employed with reference to each of them but the import of it in the three cases differs to a certain degree according to the different natures of the subjectmatter to which it is respectively applied   in the case of real evidence to authenticate the evidence is to establish the identity of the body whatever it be which is the source of the evidence—the body the appearances of which constitute the evidence—together with the authenticity of those appearances to make it appear to the satisfaction of the judge that the body exhibiting certain appearances at the time of its being produced in court or subjected to the examination of a scientific witness acting on that occasion in the character of a subordinate and deputed judge is the same body as that by which the evidentiary appearances were exhibited in the first instance   that the appearances exhibited by it at the two points of time and during the intervening interval are the natural consequences of the principal fact and have not been either fabricated or materially altered either by design or negligence in the case of real evidence safe custody will commonly besides have another object viz insuring the existence and forthcomingness of the object—preventing it from being destroyed or lost but this purpose belongs not to the present head but to the head of securing the forthcomingness of evidence   in the case of personal oral evidence to authenticate the evidence is to establish the identity of the person who in the character of a deposing witness is subjected to oral examination—who in the character of a deposing witness is admitted to give his testimony in the presence of the judge to make it appear to the satisfaction of the judge   that he who speaks of himself as being such or such a person is really that person   that the person who at the time in question in presence of the judge speaks of himself as having been present on a certain past occasion on which a person known by a certain name was actually present is that same person whether on the occasion in hand he calls himself or is called by the same or by a different name   in the case of written evidence to establish the genuineness of the document is to make it appear to the satisfaction of the judge     that the document exhibited as containing the discourse expressed by a certain person on a certain occasion does really contain the discourse of that same person and where the occasion is material that this discourse did really issue from him on that same occasion correspondent to the respective nature of the respective species of evidence will be the several courses requisite and proper to be taken for establishing their authenticity   the case of real evidence admits of safe custody an expedient that applies not at all or not with equally and uniformly unexceptionable propriety in either of the other cases for this purpose a particular sort of person is not unfrequently appointed by law in contemplation of his presumed trustworthiness with reference to the purpose he takes charge of the article keeps it in his possession till the time comes for its being produced in the character of evidence before the judge and it is partly by the fact of his having thus kept it in his custody partly by the testimony he gives or is considered as giving of its having been so kept without any fallacious alteration that its authenticity is established   the case of personal oral evidence that is of a person appearing before the judge to give his testimony admits not of any appropriate mode of authentication his being the same person as he who commonly under the same name is stated by him as having been present on the occasion in question—been present in the character of a percipient witness—is included of course in the testimony he gives the fact of his identity if there be any doubt about it will like any other matter of fact be to be proved or disproved as the case is by such evidence of any kind or kinds as the occasion furnishes it is not often that in this case the demand for authentication will present itself a case the most likely to give rise to doubts is when for a purpose innocent or criminal the witness has on the two different occasions called himself or suffered himself to be called by different names†   it is in the case of written evidence that the business of authentication admits of the greatest diversity and demands a proportionable degree of attention the task will be found to be attended with very considerable differences according to the differences of which the nature of the written document in question is susceptible—differences that have already been distinguished by appropriate names i speak of the different modifications of written evidence that have been already marked out and separately considered under the general heads of preappointed and makeshift evidence all these will in their order be now for this new purpose brought again to view a distinction must here be observed between evidence of authenticity and evidence of fairness authenticity may be proved by similitude of hands it may be proved provisionally at least ex tenore with or without the other presumption ex custodiâ to the question of fairness none of these media of proof it is evident can apply the document may have been brought into existence by any modification of fraud or force for any indication that can be afforded to the contrary from any of those sources a bond is produced in evidence—the obligor may have been in a state of insanity or intoxication when he executed it he may have executed it with the fear of a pistol or a dagger before his eyes or in a state of illegal imprisonment to which he had been subjected for the purpose of none of these modifications will the signature or the custody of the instrument or the tenor of it afford any sort of warning chapter iii modes of authentication in the case of written evidence §   topics of inquiry on the subject of authentication as applied to written evidence two more questions present themselves for discussion   what with reference to the main end of justice is in each distinguishable case the best the most trustworthy evidence in other words what is the best with reference to security against deception or simply thus what is in each instance the most trustworthy mode of authentication   what inferior modes of authentication may in the several different     cases be admitted in place of the most trustworthy mode   which is the most trustworthy mode the authenticity as above explained of this or that piece of evidence is a particular species of fact whatever sort of evidence is most trustworthy with reference to facts in general—to facts taken without distinction—will be so with reference to this that sort of evidence is the most trustworthy which will admit of being extracted in the most trustworthy mode of extraction what mode of extraction is most trustworthy has been shown at large in the books entitled securities and extraction oral examination accompanied with crossexamination and the other securities naturally and usually attendant on it this being the most trustworthy the most satisfactory and with reference to the main end of evidence security against deception the best and most eligible two circumstances concur in preventing it from being employed on all occasions   there are occasions on which it is not obtainable such is the case where at the time when the demand for the evidence arises the witnesses from whose mouth it should have been extracted are not forthcoming   there are causes in which though obtainable the employment of this most trustworthy species of evidence would not upon the whole be eligible why because if obtianed in this most trustworthy mode the collateral inconvenience which in the shape of vexation expense and delay would inevitably result from the extraction of it in this mode would be more considerable than the inconvenience consisting in what is lost in point of trustworthiness by the difference between the most trustworthy mode and the next most trustworthy that may be to be obtained free from that collateral inconvenience as to unforthcomingness in evidence the modifications of it and their respective causes have already been exhibited to view modifications irremovable and removable causes of irremovable unforthcomingness death and incurable insanity causes of removable unforthcomingness—  insanity or other indisposition not incurable   expatriation   latency see vol vi p     §   modes of authentication in the case of private contractual evidence i proceed to bring to view such modes or sources of authentication as present themselves in regard to the different species of written evidence beginning with private contractual evidence it is that which affords the greatest variety of modes the order in which i arrange them is that of superiority meaning by superiority preferability on the score of trustworthiness—the most trustworthy standing first upon the list i authentication by direct evidence   testimony given by the attesting witness or witnesses the greater the number of such witnesses and the larger the proportion of them that appear in the character of deposing witnesses the more satisfactory of course will be the proof as to the mode of taking the deposition—the mode of examination—nothing particular requires on this occasion to be said of it on this occasion as on all others it will be less and less satisfactory according as it varies from that which is considered as the most satisfactory the mode so often described   testimony of nonattesting witnesses—representing themselves as having been percipient witnesses of the act of recognition in that case the perception taken by any such nonattesting percipient witness may have been as complete as it naturally will have been in the case of an attesting witness or it may be less and less complete in a variety of gradations a man may have seen and heard what was passing through a chink or keyhole he may have heard without seeing without seeing the act of recognition he may have seen the instrument in the first instance without the signature and presently after with the signature and so forth in this way the direct evidence may insensibly degenerate into circumstantial evidence   testimony of the party or parties—all of them or any inferior proportion of the number proof from this source supposing all apprehension of mendacity out of the question will on all other grounds be preferable to that of extraneous witnesses attesting or nonattesting the transaction was their own they are the less exposed to the danger of having forgotten it the dispute relative to the transaction is their own they need the less grudge the trouble of coming forward to give their testimony in relation to it but especially in the case where the death or unforthcomingness of one of the parties would leave mendacity on the other side without controul it is partly on account of the danger of mendacity from such interested evidence that recourse is had to the less suspected evidence of extraneous witnesses and to parties as well as to extraneous witnesses it may happen at any time to die or to be on any other account unforthcoming if the testimony of attesting witnesses is produced the testimony of nonattesting witnesses will naturally be considered as superfluous but if the authenticity be disputed and be rendered more or less doubtful by the evidence or arguments adduced by the adverse party and at the same time testimony of nonattesting witnesses happens to present itself it cannot it is plain on the ground of superfluity be excluded     if upon the face of it the instrument appears to have been furnished with attesting witnesses nonattesting witnesses cannot reasonably be tendered unless some special cause as hereinafter mentioned be assigned for the nonproduction of any attesting witness for the attesting the preappointed witnesses—being upon the face of the transaction the chosen and the only chosen witnesses—cannot therefore but be regarded as more trustworthy than any witnesses taken without choice unless some special reason be assigned to show how it happened that this or that other witness being also present and being by station in life or character more trustworthy than this or that attesting witness was notwithstanding not called upon to put himself upon the list ii authentication by circumstantial evidence   the handwriting proved by similitude of hands asserted by the testimony of a witness who on other occasions has observed the characters traced by the party in question while in the act of writing presumption from similitude of hands established by view of the act of writing presumption ex visu scriptionis   the handwriting proved by similitude of hands asserted by a witness who without having ever seen the party write is sufficiently acquainted with his hand by correspondence i e by having received from him letters purporting whether by their signature or by their contents to be of his handwriting or by having seen other writings which by indications sufficiently persuasive appeared to have been written with his hand presumption from similitude of hands established by view of other writings of the same hand presumption ex scriptis olim visis   the handwriting proved by similitude of hands asserted by a witness who without any such previous acquaintance with the handwriting of the party as above pronounces the handwriting in question to be the handwriting of the party on a comparison made of it with other specimens of his handwriting now for the purpose of the comparison produced to him for the first time presumption from similitude of hands established by comparison pro re natâ or more briefly presumption from comparison of hands—presumption ex comparatione scriptorum or ex scripto nunc viso the two former modes may be characterized by the common description of authentication by acquaintance the latter may be termed authentication by scientific opinion the persons called in to give their opinions on a point of this sort depose in the character of scientific witnesses they will naturally be persons who by office profession or pursuit have been in the habit of regarding handwritings with a particular degree of attention with a view to their authenticity or unauthenticity their similitude or dissimilitude the handwriting of the party may it is evident form as proper a subject of authentication as that of any attesting witness it is so even in a more direct way it is only for the sake of establishing the concurrence of the party that the attestation and deposition of the witness are called in suppose the authenticity of the partys signature sufficiently established that of the witnesss signature is not worth considering the causes of suspicion which apply as above to the testimony of a party extend not to his signature the testimony to the presumed authenticity of the signature of the party is not his own interested testimony but the uninterested testimony of an extraneous witness   the authenticity of the instrument the whole taken together inferred from the consideration of the person or persons in whose possession or custody it has been from the apparent time of its origination† to the time in hand or such part of the intervening interval through which the possession of it can be traced presumption ex custodiâ‡       the authenticity of the instrument the whole taken together inferred from the consideration of its tenor or say contents presumption ex tenore   the authenticity of the instrument the whole taken together exhibited by a subsequent indorsement an entry made upon the back or other vacant part of the paper or parchment in a hand purporting to be that of some official person and expressive of the fact of its having in the character of an authentic instrument been subjected to his inspection in virtue of his office presumption ex visu officiali by this species of evidence the question in regard to authenticity is rather shifted off than solved superinduced upon the original instrument is another piece of writing which as being a writing requires authentication as well as the original instrument an indorsement of this kind may be considered as a supplemental written attestation added to the instrument at a subsequent point of time to that of the execution of the instrument the memorandum in question was it really written by or by the order of the person by or by whose order it purports upon the face of it to have been written it is only by circumstantial evidence that to this question an answer can with propriety at least in case of dispute be given by direct evidence yes if he be alive and forthcoming but if he be then at an earlier or later stage of the inquiry not any such circumstantial evidence but this direct evidence will for the purpose in question be the most satisfactory and therefore the most proper and ultimately the only proper evidence in ancient times when by various circumstances connected with the immaturity of the human mind forgeries were rendered much more easy and much more frequent than at present—an incident not unfrequently exemplified is that of an official person visiting the written instruments deposited in this or that official receptacle and to serve as proof of their genuineness writing or causing to be written upon each a memorandum to the effect here spoken of of the sort of apparent certificate or judgment here in question the effect is to declare the opinion of somebody that the instrument on which it is marked was genuine—was not a forged one if the principal the substantive document be not incapable of having been taken for the subject or made the product of an act of forgery neither is this subsidiary this adjective instrument but forasmuch as to each of any number of forgeries especially if so many different hands purporting to have been written at so many different times be taken for the objects of imitation a separate set of difficulties stand opposed the consequence is that to any such apparent certificate if can scarcely happen to be altogether destitute of probative force some probative and authenticative force a document of this sort will always have whereby to the amount of it it will make an addition to the intrinsic selfprobative force possessed by the principal instrument itself—the evidence or presumption ex tenore as in the case of the original subjectmatter so in the case of this adjunct evidence ex tenore with evidence ex custodiâ for the corroboration of it will in general be the only evidence on the ground of which a judgment concerning the genuineness of it can be formed to these it may now and then happen that the evidence ex collatione may be addable viz where in the same repository or in other accessible repositories manuscripts which by their physical tenor appear to be of the same handwriting are to be found—manuscripts capable of being employed in the character of standard scripts in the three cases where the conclusion is founded on a supposed similitude of hands the superiority in quality ascribed to the prior in order cannot with propriety be ascribed to it but under certain conditions and limitations   as between presumption ex visu scriptionis and presumption ex scriptis olim cognitis if of two witnesses each has within the same compass of time seen an equal number ten suppose of scripts derived from the same hand—of which two witnesses one only had in the instance of one or more of these scripts been an eyewitness of the act of writing—the evidence of him by whom that advantage had been possessed could not but in a theoretical point of view be regarded as the better evidence why because the mode of cognizance that fell exclusively to his lot is with reference to each such object of comparison of the nature of direct evidence the other is but presumptive circumstantial evidence in a practical view however the difference can seldom be worth regarding especially if the way in which the cognizance was obtained     was that of epistolary correspondence when from an individual more or less known to me in person or by reputation i receive a letter bearing his signature—that is when i receive a letter with a signature purporting to be that of a person known to me as above—on what supposition can such a letter have emanated from any other hand than his on no other than that of forgery a crime not to be presumed or so much as suspected without special ground in any single instance much less in a number of unconnected instances suppose on the other hand the writings of the same hand seen by one witness in ten instances without his seeing the act of writing in any of those instances while by the other witness the act of writing was seen in one instance only he not having seen any other writings of the same hand in this case the evidence of him who had never seen the act of writing would surely be regarded as the most satisfactory of the two so likewise in the third case as compared with the two former ones the case of scientific evidence as compared with authentication under favour of opportunities derived from acquaintance if in respect to qualification for forming a right judgment any advantage be afforded by opportunities derived from acquaintance it can only be by reason of the comparatively greater number of opportunities the number of opportunities of this sort derivable from personal acquaintance may have been considerable in any degree and upon a general view of the subject will naturally appear indefinite the number of data of this kind put into the hands of a scientific witness on the occasion in question or on any one occasion for any one particular purpose will seldom be considerable and will always be definite but—suppose the opportunities of observation equal in every respect as between the witness speaking from particular acquaintance and the witness speaking from general and appropriate science—the superiority naturally belonging to the latter by reason of the superior intensity of attention and the superiority of appropriate intelligence naturally resulting from it will be sufficient in general to bestow upon the value of his opinion a decided superiority the witness speaking from acquaintance has for example received from the individual whose hand is in question ten letters and no more and that suppose in the compass of two years let these same letters be put all at once into the hands of a scientific witness together with the writing to be judged of the advantage afforded him by his science must be inconsiderable indeed if it does not render his opinion on the subject of more value than that of the unscientific witness judging from particular acquaintance the case in which the presumption from custody is most apt to be called in is that where the deed to be authenticated comes under the notion of an ancient deed antiquity in this respect not being designative of any particular length of time to the exclusion of all others—to give precision to our conception on the subject it will be necessary to particularize some determinate length of time beyond which reckoning from the day of the exhibition of the deed in evidence it shall be deemed an ancient one—say therefore thirty years of the lapse of such a length of time a natural and frequent consequence is that all means of authentication by particular acquaintance shall to a person in the situation of the party having occasion to authenticate the deed be unattainable here then comes in the presumption from custody here is a deed signed having for the name of one of the parties the name of one of my grandfathers i myself never saw him consequently never saw him write i can think of no person now living who to my knowledge ever saw my grandfather or had any correspondence with him but upon the death of my father on taking a survey of his effects i found in a box this amongst other deeds the presumption ex tenore is the medium authenticationis that remains to be resorted to when all others are unattainable it is a proof and the only proof that can never be wanting the presumption ex custodiâ includes it and implicitly at least is grounded on it when i conclude the granter of that deed to have been my grandfather it is not merely because it was once in the custody of my grandfather but because from the tenor of it it is a deed in which my grandfather in his time could not but have had an interest but though the presumption ex custodiâ cannot present itself unaccompanied by the presumption ex tenore yet the latter may without the former and it is for this reason that the two sources of authentication are stated as separate by accident it might have happened to the deed to have been found in a receptacle not within my custody by accident it might have been found in a public road or street into which it might have fallen by the accidental disruption of a package in a vehicle to which it had been consigned by accident it might have been found in a chandlers shop into which it had found its way by negligence amidst a bundle of waste papers by this single presumption unassisted even by the presumption ex custodiâ deeds and other scripts are in various cases considered as sufficiently authenticated under the actually established system of jurisprudence they are so for example in english jurisprudence a deed which is considered as sufficiently authenticated by the presumption ex tenore is in the language of that law said to prove itself such is the phrase in the language   0 of one of those classes of men whose selfcomplacency is never so exulting as when they triumph or seem to triumph over reason to have said the authenticity of a deed may be presumed in certain cases from the tenor of it would have been to have stated not only the decision itself but the consideration on which its claim to be regarded as a proper one depends in the expression in certain cases a deed proves itself a decision to the same effect is expressed but in the place of the reason it gives a paradox—an absurdity if not in reality in appearance—a sort of appropriate and professional figure of speech of the same stamp with those by which in so many other instances these professional men seek to hide their meaning from the view of other men and on which they love to found their claim to the praise of superiority in science §   modes of authentication in the case of written official and casually written evidence the principal points of consideration being thus stated under the head of private contractual evidence—being that which affords them in the greatest variety the two remaining classes of written evidence—official evidence and casually written evidence will give us but little trouble i written official evidence if in the case of private contractual evidence—evidence issuing from an interested and thence suspected source authentication ex tenore appears satisfactory much more may it in the case of official evidence—evidence from a source generally speaking untainted by interest and therefore unsuspected in the case of private contractual evidence the circumstance of custody though material in itself and for the sake of one or other of the parties necessary perhaps to be brought to view contains in it matter of suspicion as well as confidence the deed according to my statement has from the time of the date of it been either in my own custody or in that of some progenitor or predecessor of mine and this custody i allege as an indication serving to show the person appearing upon the face of the deed as a party to it to have been really so good supposing my statement in this behalf to be true but supposing the deed fabricated or fraudulently altered by my hand will not its having been in my custody be a still more necessary consequence if instead of having been in a custody thus open to suspicion it had been in the joint custody of a set of official persons not capable of deriving any advantage from any such forgery the presumption ex custodiâ could not but be much clearer of suspicion much more satisfactory and conclusive hence as already intimated one of the main advantages and uses of official custody for the purposes of official evidence   casually written evidence the same modes of authentication which apply to the two justmentioned modifications of written evidence apply in general to this two exceptions alone and those altogether obvious present themselves attesting witnesses are out of the case the characteristic property of preappointed evidence and therefore of private contractual evidence if exhibited according to preappointed forms being to exhibit this source of authentication that of casually written evidence not to exhibit it† persons casually present may happen to have been percipient witnesses of the act of writing in the case of the unsolemn document as in the case of the solemn one but writing in general is not a social work epistolatory writing affects solitude and so does the act of literary composition as well as the act of making memorandums for selfregarding and domestic use this is more particularly and obviously the case with regard to that large division of casually written evidence which is most apt to be exhibited in causes of a penal nature and consists of documents obtained through the indiscretion or negligence of the writer and produced against him in the character of confessorial evidence oral examination of the alleged writer of the script is evidently in a general point of view the most eligible mode of authentication it is plainly so in the relation of a means to the main end—the discovery of the truth supposing the writing to be mine there can be no one of whom it can be so certain that he knows whose writing it is as myself—that one percipient witness who in the nature of things cannot fail to have been a percipient witness of the act other witnesses to it there may have been or not been as the case may be this first choice remains at the same time susceptible of exceptions partly on the ground of practicability partly on the ground of eligibility   the writer himself may be unamenable to the commands of justice either for ever as in case of death or incurable insanity or for a time certain or uncertain as in case of expatriation latency sickness   the writer may in respect of the fact in question be bent against the declaration of the truth this fact may either have been already ascertained by experience or may only     be presumed or deemed presumable presumable either on general grounds from his station in the cause as when he is defendant in a cause of a highly penal nature and the instrument supposing it genuine is a document capable of serving as conclusive evidence of his delinquency or on particular grounds as for example his moral character—particularly in respect of veracity the quality particularly in question in this instance   in respect of delay vexation or expense the choice of the writer himself for the authenticating witness may be attended with a degree of inconvenience such as either in the whole or in part may be avoided by resorting to some other witness chapter iv modes of deauthentication in the case of written evidence in the question relative to authenticity the affirmative proposition is as already observed except in here and there an extraordinary instance the true one the affirmative is therefore under that exception the proposition that comes to be proved the negative not except in the extraordinary instances just spoken of but since instances of this description how extraordinary soever are unhappily found to exist hence an operation opposite to authentication comes sometimes to be performed correspondent in good measure to the list of modes of authentication will consequently be the list of modes of deauthentication in the main they will consist of the negation or the reverse of the modes of authentication but with some variations and additions as the tenor of them will show modes of deauthentication—sources from which a persuasion that the document in question is spurious or falsified may be obtained i direct evidence—   testimony disaffirmative of attesting witnesses i e of persons mentioned in the instrument as attesting witnesses   testimony disaffirmative of nonattesting witnesses i e of persons not mentioned in the instrument as attesting witnesses   testimony disaffirmative of the party against whom the document is produced and who denies his having authenticated it denies the handwriting to be his or if signed as if by him denies the signature to be his signature   testimony disaffirmative and confessorial of the party by whom it is produced viz the party in the cause and who on being crossexamined or otherwise confesses either that he himself bore no part in the document in question or that the other supposed party to the transaction whether a party to the suit or no bore really no part in it in a word that in one way or other it is spurious or that if there are certain portions of it in which they respectively bore a part there are others in which they respectively did not bear any part that is that in respect of a certain portion or portions of it it has been falsified   hearsay evidence testimony of any person whatever attesting witness nonattesting witness or party declaring himself to have heard on the part of an attesting witness a nonattesting witness or a party by or in whose favour the document is produced a discourse amounting to an assertion of its being spurious or having been falsified ii circumstantial evidence—   dissimilitude of hands deposed to ex visu scriptionis   ditto ex scriptis olim cognitis   ditto ex scripto nunc viso the document in question being now inspected by some scientific eye and on being confronted with other scripts indubitably from the same pen pronounced dissimilar   ditto from the appearance of its being a feigned hand   presumption ex custodiâ the party producing it or a person through whose hands it has passed being the person who in case of success would be a gainer by having fabricated or falsified it or procured it to be fabricated or falsified to the effect suspected   presumption ex tenore marks of spuriousness or falsification apparent on the face of it indications of spuriousness or falsification apparent on the face of a written discourse may be presented either by the physical entities of which the signs are composed or by the consideration of the discourse signified i indications afforded by the paper parchment or other substratum on which the colouring matter is laid—   paper if of a date known to be posterior to the date apparent on the face of the instrument a certain proof of spuriousness   paper—if in any part the surface exhibit     a roughness and comparative thinness such as would be produced by an erasure i e the scratching of an edged or pointed instrument—a cause for suspecting falsification   paper—if in any part which appears to have been written upon as for example in the middle of a line of writing a stain appears such as might have been produced by a solvent applied for the purpose of dissolving the ink or other colouring matter of which the characters are composed—another cause for suspecting falsification n b—indications nos   and   apply alike to parchment vellum or any other substratum consisting of skin   ink if the colour of the ink being uniform throughout appear of a colour fresher than what as supposed it would have been if written at the time of the date this freshness may be thought to afford some suspicion of spuriousness very little reliance however can safely be placed upon this circumstance in respect of quality of colour intensity of colour and glossiness the difference may be as great between two inks made at the same time as between two inks made at different times   ink if the appearance of the ink be different in different parts of the same writing such difference may afford a ground for suspecting falsification in this case the reason may be considerably stronger than in the last preceding one if to an ink employed in the first instance there succeeds another sort of ink which continues to be employed to the end scarce any cause of suspicion can be afforded by this change the natural interpretation is that the penman not being satisfied with the ink or perhaps with the pen that he found in one inkstand betook himself to another ink or to another pen that he found in another inkstand the only case in which any considerable cause of suspicion can be deduced from this source is that in which the different kind of ink appears in spots and patches having ink of the first appearance on each side of it in this case two other indications will be to be looked out for   marks of a discoloration or stain     or of roughness and thinness according to the nature of the chemical or mechanical means employed for the obliteration of the preexisting characters   the probable import and importance of the words obliterated as deducible from the context ii indications of spuriousness or falsification afforded by the nature of the discourse signified—   in the script in question mention direct or in the way of allusion more or less oblique made of facts of later date i e of facts that did not come into existence but at a time posterior to the date expressed on the face of the instrument facts viz things persons or events or situations or other appearances of things or persons   in the script in question words or combinations of words or modes of spelling known not to have been in use but at a time posterior to the date   in the script in question mention made of pretended facts of the nonexistence of which the individual in question is from other sources known to have been conscious supposed facts for example inconsistent with other facts of the existence of which he is known to have been conscious in a deed for example recital of a fact the falsity of which could not but have been known to him at the time from this circumstance it is evident no indication of spuriousness or falsification can be deduced any further than as the absence of mendacity on the part of the supposed author is assumed   in the script in question it being a contract viz either an instrument of conveyance or an instrument of engagement engagements or conveyances incompatible with prior conveyances made or engagements entered into by the individual in question or known by him to have been respectively made or entered into by those in whose place in that respect he stands from this circumstance no indication of spuriousness or falsification can be deduced any further than as the knowledge on his part of the disposition of law in this behalf and the absence of improbity on his part in this respect are assumed   in the script in question indications of a character manifestly superior or inferior to that of the individual in question in respect of learning intelligence veracity or any other branch of morality as established by other writings discourses or actions of his sufficiently ascertained this indication is in a manner confined to scripts belonging to the head of casually written evidence such as letters memorandums and literary compositions in contradistinction to such as belong to the respective heads of private contractual evidence and official evidence   in the script in question opinions affections or tastes manifestly opposite to those of the individual in question according to information satisfactorily deduced from other sources this again is in a manner confined to casually written evidence as above   in the script in question the style phraseology or mode of spelling manifestly dissimilar to those of the individual in question ascertained from other sources the idea attached to the word style being as yet extremely vague the indication grounded on it will be proportionably vague another indication that applies principally to written evidence of the casual kind as above   in the script in question the style or phraseology manifestly dissimilar to that in use in the office in question this upon the face of it applies exclusively to official evidence chapter v distinction between provisional and definitive authentication rules for the legislator and the judge concerning the authentication of written evidence such being the possible modes of authentication—next comes the inquiry which mode on each occasion ought to be required for this purpose a distinction must be taken in the first instance between provisional authentication and definitive by provisional i mean that evidence which may be received as sufficient for the authentication of the evidence in question provided that no suspicion of its authenticity is expressed on the other side by definitive i mean that which if satisfactory in itself shall be deemed sufficient proof of the authenticity of the instrument notwithstanding all protestations and contestacions on the other side for the purpose of provisional authentication that is in all ordinary cases that mode of authentication will be the most eligible which in each instance can be employed with least vexation expense and delay but should the authenticity of the document be disputed on the other side—in a word should it be accused of forgery—in such case the subordinate consideration referring to these collateral inconveniences must give way to the superior consideration referring to the direct justice of the case always supposed     that the imputation of forgery may not be allowed to be made through mere wantonness much less in the express view of giving birth to those collateral inconveniences and that accordingly in the case of mala fides or temerity the burden of the inconvenience may rest ultimately on the head of the party to whose misconduct it owed its birth if the mode of authentication which is not needful but in case of contestation be regularly employed where there is no contestation—where no doubt of the authenticity of the document is really entertained and if between the modes of authentication necessary in the two cases there be upon an average any considerable difference in respect of vexation expense or delay the aggregate mischief unnecessarily produced in those three shapes must be prodigious indeed among the writings of all sorts which come to be exhibited in a court of judicature in the character of evidence if there be one out of a thousand in respect to which any such suspicion is really entertained the proportion would prove much larger than i should expect to find it upon this supposition in nine hundred and ninetynine instances out of every thousand this mass of inconvenience will be created without necessity or use if in pursuit of a phantastic idea of regularity the employment of the definitive mode of authentication be insisted on to the exclusion of the provisional mode the most convenient i e least vexatious expensive and dilatory mode which might so unexceptionably have supplied its place this oppressive plan of authentication we shall find established in english jurisprudence in the adjustment of the modes of authentication to be established in regard to written evidence the leading points or ends require to be kept in view on the one hand satisfaction in respect of trustworthiness on the other hand avoidance of delay vexation and expense—the three inseparable modifications of collateral inconvenience of these two ends this firstmentioned being the main and principal end has in general been pursued with a degree of preference which would have been very proper but that the sacrifices that have been made to it at the expense of the triple collateral end have been inordinate and much beyond anything which good economy in this respect would be found to authorize the supposition upon which judges and legislators have proceeded in the fixation of the modes of authentication which they have prescribed has been that of a universal and constant disposition on the part of all suitors to commit forgery or if that supposition has not in every instance been actually entertained it is the only one on which the modes prescribed are capable of being justified—the only one by which the price paid in the shape of delay vexation and expense for the supposed advantage in the shape of satisfaction in respect of trustworthiness would not be recognised to be excessive and oppressive if among a thousand cases in which the legal effect of a piece of written evidence is in dispute there be not so much as one in which the authenticity of it is a matter of real doubt on the part of the suitor against whom it is produced—it is only in the one case where it is matter of real doubt that the price paid for authentication in the shape of delay vexation and expense or all together need be so considerable as to be worth counting under the existing system there is scarce a cause in which it is not considerable and in many a cause it would be found to be seriously oppressive thus it happens that for one grain of mischief produced or that would or could be produced by fraud in the shape of forgery a thousand ten thousand are produced by fraud in the shape of chicane of chicane produced partly by the enmity of suitors partly by the rapacity of their agents abetted by that of the subordinate officers of justice both passions protected and encouraged and engendered by prejudice and indifference on the part of judges and legislators familiarized with the spectacle of continual misery generated according to rule and custom and therefore on their parts without blame—the reduction of the mischief to its minimum the reduction of it so much as within any narrower bounds never presents itself to them as worth regarding like so many other processes which go on as it were of themselves according to preestablished and neverconsidered rules the authentication of evidence is considered as a sort of mechanical operation the pathological effects of which have no claim upon them for so much as a thought whence all this composure for the observance of the established rules the man in office is responsible for the propriety of these rules—for their subservience to the ends of justice he is not responsible to attempt in this place to combat the tripleheaded monster by any proposed regulations of detail would be to touch upon the topic of procedure a general observation or two may serve to indicate the course authentication in the ultimate and what may be styled the adverse mode ought instead of being the routine of practice to be the dernier resort the extraordinary recourse the process of authentication should be carried on not at the time of trial but between party and party at a preliminary meeting either in the presence of the judge or before some inferior minister of justice whose time can best be spared     the party who has a document to produce produces it in the first instance to the adverse party who either admits the authenticity of it or declares his intention to contest it if he admits it he marks it as admitted if he chooses to contest it he has a right to do so but he uses it at his peril—at the peril of simple costs in case of simple temerity at the peril of extra costs in case of mala fides the end in view is in every instance to save the suitors from the delay vexation and expense of adverse authentication in so far as these several inconveniences are avoidable the means to be employed in the prosecution of that end is the taking such arrangements as shall make it the indisputable interest of every individual concerned each in their several stations parties agents of parties officers of justice of all classes to abstain from giving birth to these several inconveniences any further than as they are necessary the virtual penalty inflicted on this occasion by imposition of costs with the above views should not depend on the ultimate decision of the cause but should be infficted pro unaquâque vice for each act of authentication unnecessarily performed otherwise to the enmity of a suitor who was persuaded of his having the law on his side the proposed remedy would apply no check the principle would remain unapplied unless to each particular act of vexation its own particular penalty stood opposed on the subject of the supposed proportion between the number of the cases in which suspicion of spuriousness has not existence and that of those in which it has existence one observation there is which to every person to whom the practice of technical procedure is familiar will be almost sure to present itself number of cases says the objector in which no suspicion of spuriousness is entertained nine hundred and ninetynine be it so number of cases in which suspicion of that sort is really entertained one and no more be this likewise for arguments sake at least admitted but in addition to the one case in which any such suspicion is really entertained what is there to prevent the bringing forward a pretence of suspicion in an indefinite multitude of other instances and in particular for example in every instance in which the party who is in the wrong suppose the defendant has more to gain than to lose by the delay or on either side of the cause entertains a hope of forcing his injured adversary out of the field of litigation by the pressure of the expense the answer is the state of things on which the above question grounds itself is the existing state of things under the reign of technical procedure but in respect of the matter in question the state of things here supposed is exactly opposite it being the policy of the existing state of things for the sake of giving every practicable increase to the number of causes and to the profit extractible from each to give every possible increase to the number of malâ fide defences and demands as well as to the number of the operations performed and to the number and length of the instruments exhibited on the occasion of each such suit bonâ and malâ fide such taken together—and to that end to afford to wilful falsehood and insincerity in every imaginable shape every practicable facility and encouragement—falsehood and insincerity in the parties litigant have accordingly been exempted with little exception from the check of counterinterrogation in every shape and without any exception from the check of counterinterrogation in the vivâ voce shape but in the state of things here in question whatsoever on this or on any other subject were said by a party on either side of the suit or cause would be said under the influence of whatsoever securities for correctness and completeness are or would be applied to the case of an extraneous witness under the influence of vivâ voce counterinterrogation at any rate under the check of an oath if notwithstanding the objections brought forward in this work against that ceremony it were thought fit to be retained if not under the check of a solemn and deliberate averment a party contestant would no more have it in his power to reap any advantage from a naked averment declarative of a belief on his part in disaffirmance of its genuineness or of a suspicion of its spuriousness than the party exhibitant could do from a naked averment declarative of a belief on his part in affirmance of its genuineness each would alike be liable to be called upon and under the same securities for sincerity as in the case of any extraneous witness to state in the most explicit manner the grounds of the persuasion professed by him to be entertained to rash as well as to mala fide contestation various are the other checks that might be and if the ends of justice were the objects naturally would be applied if for example by the production of a source of evidence the needfulness of which after the mutual explanations in question appeared more or less doubtful to the judge delay and expense to a certain amount would manifestly be necessitated—not only would eventual compensation for the damage by such delay be secured as well as the expense attendant on the production of the evidence in question cast of course upon the party by whom the production of it was thus insisted on—but if by the exhibition of this evidence a demand for counterevidence to be exhibited by the adverse party were produced the expense of such counterevidence might provisionally     be charged in the first instance upon the party thus insisting rather than that by such means it should be in his power to oppress his adversary by exhausting his means of maintaining his post in the field of litigation—his means of pursuing in the character of plaintiff his own claim or repelling in the character of defendant that of the party on the other side in some cases for the purpose of provisional authentication instead of the executed or rather say recognised instrument a transcript or an archetypal draught may be employed several cases may be mentioned in which supposing less delay vexation and expense to be necessary to the adequate authentication of this succedaneous script than to that of the proper instrument the substitution may be employed with advantage note that for the purpose of discussion on the ground of the contents subject to eventual correction the succedaneous script may serve exactly as well as the proper instrument if in so far as under the contract in question the dispute turns upon the point of law the question of law is decided against the exhibitant plaintiff or defendant—the delay vexation and expense of which the exhibition of the proper instrument would be productive may if worth saving be thus saved supposing that there is no question of law or if there be that the question is decided in favour of the exhibitant in either case allowance of his claim follows of course upon the supposition of the conformity of the succedaneous script thus exhibited to the proper instrument of which the genuineness as well as the existence is thus provisionally at least supposed supposing the exhibitant to be the plaintiff in this case upon the authority of this succedaneous script even possession might be delivered to him if adequate security be given by him for eventual restitution ad integrum i e for putting the adversary in a plight in every respect as good as if the possession had not been changed† of the actual execution and thence of the genuineness of the proper instrument so likewise of the correctness and completeness of the succedaneous script even in case of contestation or doubt—for saving of delay vexation and expense evidence less conclusively probative than for the purpose of a definitive decision might be necessary might for the purpose of a provisional decision be received on either side even if contested a script which is authenticated ab intrà i e which on the face of it presents the signature of the apparent author affixed to it for the evident purpose of authentication need not be authenticated ab extrà in the first instance why because unless it be supposed to be tainted with forgery its authenticity cannot appear dubious but delinquency ought not in any case to be presumed without special ground much less delinquency of so high a cast inability to effect the authentication of a script on or before a certain day need not—ought not to be rendered so much as a cause of delay much less of ultimate miscarriage the decision—a decision in all other respects ultimate—might be made provisional dependent upon the subsequent authentication of the instrument on or before a day to be named nor need even that nomination be so inexorably peremptory as to allow accident much less fraud to triumph over justice note that in all these cases the advantage     and propriety of giving admission provisional admission and effect to such succedaneous evidence depends upon the relative quantity of the inconvenience saved by it in the shape of delay vexation and expense but let it not be forgotten that to this quantity there are no limits other than those of the earths circumference note moreover that so far as concerns written evidence including the fact of its genuineness and the nature of its contents the savings capable of being made in case of contestation would the whole mass of them put together be inconsiderable in comparison with that which in the case of the supposed proper script upon a call made by the party exhibitant would have place by reason of admission without contestation as above to these savings in the shape of delay vexation and expense may be added a saving that in the account of an honest man will not be regarded as fit to be neglected—a saving in the article of improbity improbity on the part of the parties and their professional advisers improbity on the part of the judges improbity on the part of the custos morum improbity on the part of the keeper of the royal conscience in the ordinary intercourse of life a man to whom it has happened to deny his own handwriting is pointed at as a man of lost character and to such a degree lost that to a person to whom the like loss is not a matter of indifference it may be scarce safe to associate with him on what ground is it that for such a mode of conduct a man is thus consigned to infamy on this or on none viz that in this way he was knowingly and wilfully guilty of falsehood—wilful and deliberate falsehood for the purpose of injustice the man by whom his adversary in litigation is loaded with the delay vexation and expense of proving as well as exposed to the peril of not being able after all in the teeth of so many opposing quirks to prove at any expense the genuineness of a document of which there exists no real doubt—literally speaking and to outside appearance this man does not commit the falsehood that would have been committed had the question is the genuineness of this document matter of     doubt to you been put and answered in the affirmative the falsehood is not committed but what is committed is an injustice—an injustice which in point of mischievousness is exactly upon a level with such falsehood—the injustice in which such falsehood would have found its sole object and its sole advantage the falsehood has not been committed but why has it not only because the judges in whom the practice in this behalf has found its creators and preservers have taken such good and effectual care to secure to every dishonest man who in this way finds his account in making himself their instrument the benefit of such falsehood without that risk which had the eventual necessity of it been left subsisting would have constituted the expense of it in so far as concerns justice and veracity there are two codes of morality that in this country have currency and influence—viz that of the public at large and that of westminster hall in no two countries can the complexion of their respective legal codes be easily more opposite than that of those two moral codes which have currency not only in the same country but in the same societies and if so it be that in the public at large the system of morals that has place in practice is upon the whole honest and pure—it is so not in proportion as the morality of westminster hall of which so many samples have already been and so many more will be exhibited is revered and conformed to but in proportion as it is abhorred so far as concerns love of truth and justice the greatest but at the same time the most hopeless improvement would be the raising of the mind of a thoroughpaced english lawyer on a bench or under a bench to a level with that of an average man taken at random whose mind had not for professional views and purposes been poisoned with the study of the law as on the other hand in point of sound understanding and true wisdom the raising the same sort of mind to a level with that of a man of competent education of the nature of that to which the term liberal is commonly applied yes it is from novels such as maria edgeworths that virtues such as the love of justice and veracity—it is from the benches the bars the offices the desks in and about westminster hall that the hatred of these virtues and the love of the opposite vices—is imbibed but that which to maria edgeworth was not known or by maria edgeworth was not dared to be revealed is the genealogy of her lawyer case that that very ingenious and industrious gentleman had for his elder brother the honourable charles case barrister at law m p in the lower house and both of them for their father the right honourable the lord chief justice case christopher baron casington in the upper and that it was only by executing the powers given or preserved to him and earning the rewards offered and so well secured to him by his noble and learned father that the younger son became what he was how long for the selfsame wickedness shall the inferiors in power and opulence—the inferiors who are but instruments—be execrated and the superiors who are the authors of it adored attorneys solicitors—were they the makers of judgemade law—were they the makers of the system of technical procedure—were they the makers of the law of evidence chapter vi aberrations of english law in regard to the authentication of written evidence the distinction between provisional and definitive authentication is unknown to english law in all cases alike it insists upon having the authentication performed in the same mode without allowing of any exceptions on the score of vexation expense or delay it presumes all mankind to be forgers and where there is forgery affords no facilities for the detection of it it guards against deception where there is none to guard against and where deception is at work interdicting the interrogation of the suspected person it interdicts the most efficient means of scrutiny previous meeting between the parties for the purpose of ascertaining whether any and what documents presented by one party are contested by the other there is none disputed or not the authenticity of every document must be proved true it is that for saving of delay vexation and expense sometimes it does happen that on one or both sides the genuineness of this or that instrument of contract or other script or as it may happen of all the scripts meant to be exhibited is admitted but it is only in so far as on both sides or if it be an equity suit or cause on all sides—and that to an indefinite number all persons concerned law advisers as well as suitors are honest—and not only negatively honest but completely and actively and zealously honest—that any such admission with the consequent savings can have place if by any such admission a law adviser were to prevent his client from reaping any advantage which by the refusal of it might be obtainable whether for want of the adversarys being able to procure the evidence or by thrusting him out of the contest by the intolerable pressure of the expense—his conscience would hardly acquit     him of treachery in betraying his clients interest not so says somebody for by the fear of eventual costs i e of the eventual obligation of reimbursing the costs on the other side a dishonest no less than an honest man may be restrained from giving increase to such costs though it be on the other side true if every man were his own lawyer but under the reign of technical procedure no man ever is or with any the smallest chance of success can be his own lawyer and so long as the system of procedure remains on that level in the scale of unintelligibility to which it has been raised by the undiscontinued exertions of so many ages the quantum of each mans burthen in this shape will always depend upon the sort of man whose interest it is that it be as heavy as possible in this state of things for the keeping down of superfluous expense on the part of the client no degree of honesty on his part would suffice without that sort and degree of honesty on the part of his law adviser the existence of which unless here and there by great good fortune under such encouragement as is given to him to be dishonest it would be altogether absurd and idle to expect without the preliminary meeting above spoken of it is physically impossible that in relation to the matter in question justice or anything approaching to it should be done injustice in the shape of needless delay vexation and expense if not in the shape of actual misdecision is unavoidable but although without the aid of this arrangement it is impossible that wrong should not be done yet there are degrees of wrong and in instances to a great extent wrong over and above what was rendered necessary by the absence of this arrangement will actually be seen to be done from the determination taken to put an exclusion upon that which is not only the best evidence but the least burthensome evidence viz the evidence of the parties follow—  in violation of the dictates correspondent to the direct ends of justice two opposite mischiefs not only groundless exclusion but rash and insufficiently guarded admission and   in violation of the dictates correspondent to the collateral ends of justice enhancement of the necessary burthen—an enhancement to the amount of which there are no assignable bounds nor let it ever be out of mind that—whenever the expense which presses upon him who has right on his side swells beyond endurance—misdecision to the destruction of his right is the consequence and the evil opposite to the direct ends is either substituted or added to the evil opposite to the collateral ends of justice i exclusion put upon the testimony of parties viz even at the trial ii exclusion put upon the testimony of nonattesting witnesses iii admission given to instruments without authentication—i e admission given without other proof to an instrument purporting upon the face of it to be of a certain age viz thirty years old or upwards iv inadequate mode of bringing to view the supposed contents of a script in possession of the adversary for exemplification of the mischievousness absurdity and inconsistency not to say improbity by which the practice in relation to this subject is characterized a brief observation or two under the above several heads may suffice but so full of complication selfcontradiction and uncertainty is this same practice that the idea given of the chaos by the few samples of it thus brought to view is little less inadequate than would be the idea of a house by the like number of bricks picked out of it i exclusion put upon the testimony of parties viz at the trial of the cause in regard to the species of fact here in question as in regard to every other the most satisfactory and on every account beyond comparison the most eligible evidence need it again be said is that of the parties—viz in relation to each fact that one of the parties against whom it makes by the exclusion put upon the preliminary meeting this evidence stands excluded from the commencement of the cause and when at the end of half a year or a whole year or some number of years from the day of the commencement that inquiry which ought to have begun and in most instances would have been concluded on that same day is under the name of the trial suffered to take place—upon this same best evidence is an exclusion again put by means of another exclusionary rule in the eye of common sense this is the best evidence possible in the eye of the law it is no evidence at all therefore not the best evidence for on this part of the field when exclusion is the object out of the word best is formed the basis of the pretence always excepted i mean from the exclusionary rule the case where an extra price and that a most enormous one is paid for opening the door to that which otherwise would be the excluded evidence viz at the equity shop and elsewhere by the immesurable and profitable addition thus made to vexation and expense together coupled with the comparative badness of the shape in which the evidence is extracted the objection which would otherwise have been so peremptory is now removed   0 rather than give admission to that best and most satisfactory of all evidence no evidence so loose and unsatisfactory but that admission will be given to it in the case of an instrument of contract for example proof i e what is called proof—viz mere circumstantial evidence of the genuineness of a couple of words purporting to be the name of an attesting witness look at these words viz john smith did you ever know any person who ever bore that name yes—did you ever see him write or receive letters which you understood to have been written with his hand yes—judging from these opportunities do you believe these words to have been written by him yes true it is that when no better is to be had the exigence of the case necessitates the reception of this loose—this circumstantial evidence but when the case affords not only direct evidence but the most trustworthy of all direct evidence—to exclude that best evidence and admit this loose evidence instead of it how inexplicable the folly were it not for the sinister interest that lurks at the bottom of it wounded by the rule itself justice is again wounded by the evasions of the rule   three obligors jointly bound in a bond proof by extraneous witnesses it must be supposed being somehow or other unobtainable one of the obligors is called to prove the execution of it but for this purpose he must have been left out of the action and the recourse against him lost just as it happens in penal cases where one of two malefactors is let off that his testimony may be employable against the other   if a subscribing witness is become infamous—on producing his conviction his hand may be proved as if he were dead here inferior evidence is let in to the exclusion of the best circumstantial to the exclusion of direct so much for security against deception moreover the conviction must be produced a lumbering record lugged in at a heavy and unnecessary expense to prove a fact in itself notorious and capable of being sufficiently proved by less expensive means and which after all cannot be sufficiently proved by this means john brown was convicted true but how does the dead parchment prove that it was the same john brown†   so when an attesting witness being the only surviving witness had become interested without any prejudice to his character his hand was allowed to be proved by somebody else on the presumption that he himself would have denied it‡ preestablished rules apart the experiment might have been tried at least and if he had perjured himself then might it have been time enough to encounter the perjury by other evidence ii exclusion put upon the testimony of nonattestors witnesses to the number of half a dozen or half a score all of them unexceptionable are ready to be produced each of them ready to say i saw the several parties attaching their respective signatures to this instrument saying each of them i deliver this as my act and deed quibbleton counsel for the defendant addressing himself to the first of these witnesses what is your name answer john stiles quibbleton my lord here is the deed—two your lordship sees and but two attesting witnesses neither of them is named john stiles judge set aside this witness half a dozen or half a score all of undisputed character all ready to speak to this plain fact and not one of them permitted∥ why not permitted answer because in     the first place if permitted they would all perjure themselves in the next place having thus perjured themselves they would all of them in spite of counsels crossexamination and judges direction obtain credence two persuasions these neither of them it is true avowed because when absurdity or improbity enter upon the stage they do not either of them present themselves stark naked but to give to the exclusion so much as the colour of being conducive to the ends of justice these persuasions must both of them be entertained or at any rate of the matters of fact respectively predicted by them the certainty or to speak with a degree of correctness new as yet to lawyers language the preponderant probability must be assumed but supposing these persuasions entertained on what ground is it that they must have been entertained on this ground and no other viz that the names of these persons are not to be found upon the face of the instrument in the character of attesting witnesses exists there then any article of law by which it is required on pain of nullity or any other pain that upon the face of every deed of the sort in question wills being out of the question there shall be visible the names of two persons in the character of attesting witnesses no neither of any article of real i e legislative law nor so much as any rule deduced in the shape of judgemade law on what ground then stands the rejection answer on this ground viz that—when the name of a person purporting to have been written by him in the character of an attesting witness is visible on the face of the instrument—the testimony of any number of persons who if they are to be believed actually saw what it is there declared that this man saw is not with relation to the fact in question the best evidence nonlawyer what—the evidence being good enough to produce a complete or at least preponderant persuasion in this case—by the mere circumstance of its not being the very best imaginable admitting for arguments sake that it is not the very best—by this one circumstance is any sufficient ground afforded for shutting out this evidence when there is no other and when in consequence if this be shut out the party who has right on his side must lose his cause lawyer oh but where there being upon the face of the deed an attesting witness he is not produced but instead of him others are produced whose names are not upon the deed here is an omission from which we draw a conclusion and the conclusion is that had the attesting witness been produced his testimony would have been against the genuineness of the deed nonlawyer and on this conclusion it is that you build the two other necessary conclusions viz that the nonattesting witnesses being all of them so many intended perjurors would all of them have affirmed the genuineness of the deed the fact being otherwise and thus falsely affirming it would have gained credence with submission suppositions of a contrary tendency might be raised in any number—any one of them less improbable than the above take half a dozen or so for examples—   we know not where to look for the attesting witness we know not who he was we know not whether he be alive or dead   we know indeed who he is and where he is but he is not within the jurisdiction of the court   he is indeed within the jurisdiction of the court and the place where he is is known to us but that place is far distant and we—who at our peril on pain of losing his evidence and along with it it now seems our cause were bound to advance to him whatsoever money in case of dispute should be deemed sufficient to defray the necessary and proper expense of his journey to and fro attendance and demurrage whatsoever that might be—could not either find of our own so much money or borrow it—your laws against usury forbidding a man in recompense for any risk or for the relief of any exigency to accept of any extra price   yes we do know who he is and it is because he was so well known to us that we took care not to call him he is a dishonest man an enemy to us and in league with the parties on the other side after having promised or not promised to come he would after all come or not come according as in their view of the matter it would be best for them that he should or should not come if he did come he would deny his own handwriting i know nothing about the matter he would say it was not by me that this name was written by counterevidence or even by counterinterrogation it might have been possible for us notwithstanding to extract from him the truth of the case and the more so because in the presence of two other persons who are not however either of them at present within our reach once upon a time he did declare and confess that the name in question was really written by his hand but both these means of coming at the truth we are debarred from by another of your rules viz the rule by virtue of which merely because we are unfortunate enough to stand thus in need of his evidence—of this enemy of ours it is said by you that he is our own witness and that because he is our own witness he must not by us be contradicted or so much     as questioned whatsoever may tend to the bringing him to view in this his true character whether it be counterinterrogation or counterevidence we are thus forced by you to suppress independently of regulation—positive and effectually notified regulation—it is difficult to say what there is that should determine the choice of the party in favour of a supposed attesting to the exclusion of or even in preference to a nonattesting but by him equally known to have been a percipient witness true it is that by the signature of the attesting witness proof is so far given that in relation to the transaction in question he was a percipient witness yes but is it a proof that no other person was a proof too which by those who know that the contrary is true is to be regarded as a convincing one the attesting witness would cost suppose so much money to produce the nonattesting witness may be had for a few shillings less this in the eye of a considerate and especially in the eye of a poor man honestly advised should suffice to give the preference to the nonattesting witness the attesting witness would after all expenses paid him suffer inconvenience suppose from the attendance the nonattesting witness would not suffer any inconvenience this in the eye of a humane and considerate man should suffice for securing the like preference oh but we have a rule about the best evidence viz that in no case shall any evidence be received but the very best which the nature of the case admits of preciously instructive rule we receive no evidence but what we receive for anything more precise or intelligible or wise or honest than this will not be found in it no evidence do we ever receive other than the best evidence and what is the best evidence answer it is on each occasion that which we receive as such they know not themselves what their own rules are strange indeed it would be if they did for that which has no existence how is it to be known to anybody they know not themselves what their own rules are they resolve that every other man shall know them that is without the possibility of knowing them shall as often as occasion offers be punished for not knowing them nemo tenetur ad impossibilia says another of their maxims but in any one of their maxims so sure as there is anything good so sure is practice opposite once more partly upon the source partly upon the shape depends the goodness of an article of evidence as to the shape in so far as depends upon themselves in none but the very worst shape come it from what source it will do they receive any evidence and so it be in this worst but to themselves most profitable shape no source so impure but that from that bad source they are ever ready to receive it yet such is their delicacy that as if for evidence as for meat there were a market at which with money in his hand a man may pick and choose none forsooth will they put up with but the very best of evidence iii admission given to instruments without authentication by the man of law whenever you see a gnat strained at on a second glance make sure of seeing a camel taken up and swallowed behold an instrument for the authentication of which today a whole score of witnesses who every one of them if they are to be believed were percipient witnesses of the execution of it they not being attesting witnesses will not suffice it is accordingly dealt with as if it were forged wait till tomorrow this spurious deed becomes genuine and so plainly genuine that for the proof of its genuineness no evidence is required this metamorphosis who was the god that operated it answer the god time yesterday the script wanted a day of being thirty years old today the thirty years are fulfilled this admission has neither quite so much absurdity in it nor quite so much mischievousness as the exclusions the instrument if it be not what it purports to be is a forgery forgery a flagitious and pernicious crime is not to be presumed independently of particular argumentative grounds the odds against the fact as testified by experience are prodigious for every forged instrument you have genuine ones by thousands not but that to this crime by the exclusion put upon the interrogated testimony of the party by whom or in whose behalf the instrument is produced every encouragement has been given which it has been in the power of judge and co to give to it suppose the party to have forged it he puts it silently into the hands of his lawyer and it is the lawyers business to fight it up at the lawyers elbow if so it please him sits the forgerer there he may sit till he is tired for he is in no danger the law has taken him under her care not a single question can be put to him convenient as this law is to every criminal to an honest man it may happen but too frequently to be laid by it under an embarrassment out of which it seems not altogether easy to say how he is to be delivered the instrument purporting upon the face of it to be thirty years old or more—this antiquity coupled with possession i e with the relation borne to the suit or cause or to the fact in question by the individual in whose possession it has been is accepted as evidence sufficient for the authentication of     it but the individual suppose in whose possession it is is the plaintiff and for the whole of the time that has elapsed since the execution of it or for a part more or less considerable of that length of time he has kept it locked up in his strong box not having in all that time shown it because in all that time no occasion has called upon him to show it to any person who is without interest in the suit or cause by whose testimony then is the custody of it to be proved by his the plaintiffs oh no that would be contrary to the inviolable rule but if not by his testimony it cannot—by the very supposition it cannot be proved by that of any one else yes if he had had information timely information of the existence of this rule of law for in that case he might have got this or that uninterested person to look at it but if any such information had reached his mind the care and pains taken by judge and co for so many centuries to keep it out of his reach would have been frustrated by keeping them from receiving existence in and from any determinate form of words care has been taken very effectual care that neither by nonlawyers nor by lawyers themselves shall any of these portions of imaginary law be laid hold of by inspection by their uniform repugnance to every conclusion that would be drawn by common sense care not less effectual has been taken that they shall never have been laid hold of by inference or conjecture if in this case the exemption granted from the obligation of authenticating the document by evidence ab extrà is proper it can only be because in the other cases the obligation is itself improper as being needless forgery is not the crime of any particular point of time whatever be the probability of it at this present day it was not less on this day thirty years a deed purporting to have been fairly executed thirty years ago may have been forged or falsified at the time of the date or at any rate may have been forged or falsified at any subsequent point of time forged writings of an apparent date two hundred years anterior to the real date—forged writings ascribed to shakespeare† have been known to deceive the very elect among english lawyers‡ iv shifts when the script is in the power of the adversary the hostility of the technical system to the ends of justice—the consciousness of that hostility on the part of those who while they are acting under it are profiting by it—the violation at the same time so continually offered by themselves to the very principles to which by themselves the highest importance is attached—all this may be seen exemplified in a case which shall now be brought to view when the article of written evidence which the party in question stands in need of happens to be in the hands of a party on the other side when an instrument which a plaintiff for example stands in need of happens to be in the possession of the defendant the sort of shift that has been made is truly curious under a rational system of procedure the course is plain and easy the evidence acted upon is of the best kind imaginable both parties being together in the presence of the judge the plaintiff says to the defendant to make out my case i have need of such or such an instrument describing it you have it have the goodness to produce it yes says the defendant unless his plan be to perjure himself and here it is or i have it not with me at present but on such a day and hour as it shall please the judge to appoint i will bring it hither or send it to you at your house or give you access to it in mine under the technical system no such meeting being to be had no such question can at any such meeting be put but at the trial viz under the commonlaw alias nonequity system of which jury trial makes a part at the trial that is after half a years or a years or more than a years factitious delay with its vexation and expense—then it is that for the first time a chance for procuring the production of a necessary instrument may be obtained though neither for any such purpose nor     for any other—neither to the party on either side nor to any agent of his—can anything in the shape of a question be put vivâ voce by a party or agent on the other side—the question for example the instrument describing it have you it or no—yet under the name of a notice a sort of requisition in writing calling upon him to exhibit it may be and every now and then is delivered of this notice to exhibit the instrument what is the effect that the defendant is under any obligation to exhibit it no such thing to produce any such effect would require nothing less than a suit in equity whereupon the instrument would be exhibited or not and if exhibited not till the end of the greatest number of years to which the defendant having an adequate interest had found it in his power to put off the exhibition of it to have enabled the party thus far to obtain justice without aid from equity would have been robbing the lord chancellor and the master of the rolls and the swarm of subordinates of whose fees the patronage part of their emolument is composed what then is the effect answer that after this notice if that best evidence which is asked for be not obtainable—not obtainable only because those on whom it depends do not choose it should be obtained—what is deemed the next best evidence that happens to be in the plaintiffs possession is admitted and on this occasion no evidence is too loose to be admitted after such notice given one succedaneum that has been admitted is a supposed transcript an examined copy are the words another is parol evidence of the contents in the midst of all this laxity observe and admire the strictness in case it be a copy that is offered it must first be proved that the original of which it purports to be a copy was a genuine instrument so much the more business for the benefit of the man of law so much the more chance of failure for the benefit and encouragement of the wrongdoer but suppose no such copy producible—the best and only evidence which it is in the plaintiffs power to produce being as above parol evidence of the contents i e some account given of the supposed contents of the supposed instrument by a person into whose hands by some accident or other the opportunity of bestowing upon it a perusal more or less adequate—of throwing over it a glance more or less slight and thus giving an account of it more or less correct and complete—has happened to find its way this casual reporter—for his report to be received is it necessary that he or in his stead the party by whom he is called in should have established in due form the genuineness of the instrument which for ever so short a time chance had thus thrown into his hands in this one point may be seen a mine a rich mine of future causes behold now another mine the two sorts of makeshift evidence thus brought to view in the case of a deed—viz a supposed transcript copy examined or not examined and parol evidence of supposed contents—shall they apply and under any and what modifications to any and what other sorts of scripts delight paints itself on the countenance of law at the thoughts of such a mine of nonsuits and to the lawyer at any rate if not to the client and suitor of agreeable surprises good all this as far as it goes when so it is that a mans good fortune has put into his hands any such makeshift evidence but if not what in that case becomes of the notice in that case the wrongdoer triumphs the party who is in the right loses his right whatever it may be and so the matter ends did but the judge deign to admit at the outset into his presence the persons whose properties and liberties he has contrived with so little trouble to dispose of—whatsoever were the instrument wanted if it were not found in one of two hands in which it was expected to be found it would be in another every instrument that was necessary to justice would be ferreted out as it actually is in the case where justice being necessary to his own personal protection as well as that of the public it has been the pleasure of the man of law that the necessary instruments should be made forthcoming viz in the preparatory examinations taken as in a case of murder robbery or other felony by a justice of the peace no loophole or at least not so many loopholes would then be left for the wrongdoer to creep out of thus foiling for a time or for ever the party whom he has wronged but under the technical system this business of notices affords to the wrongdoer an inexhaustible fund of chances† in this lottery     a nonsuit the produce of which is an additional suit constitutes the prize in which judge and co with their protegé and partner the wrongdoer are sharers i proceed to speak of the course taken by the english law on the subject of authentication in regard to any sort of document coming under the notion of official evidence—whether as purporting to be the work of an official hand or to bear upon the face of it a testimony of its authenticity imprinted upon it by an official signature here under both principles—the principles here advanced and those acted upon as above by the jurisprudential law in question—tenor and custody together should be sufficient proof upon the principles here advanced the former alone is sufficient proof much more that and the presumption ex custodiâ together when the custody is that of a hand so completely exempt from suspicion as in this case but upon the principles of english law the presumption ex tenore alone cannot be sufficient for to this case the ground of antiquity does not extend and as to the other part of the proof it consists in the custody which the law does not require according to comyns† a deed indorsed as enrolled shall be read without proof according to his continuator the certificate of the auditor of the dutchy of lancaster is sufficient evidence of the enrolment of a dutchy lease according to the same the indorsement by the proper officer is sufficient evidence of the enrolment of a bargain and sale if as i should suppose to be the case the instrument in question was in these several instances admitted as an ancient deed would have been to prove itself—no proof of the official custody in which it had been was exhibited but on this supposition to call the certificate that of the auditor calling the indorsement an indorsement by the proper officer was a petition principii an assumption of the very fact that required to be proved in another case in the same book where the custody is considered as part of the case the fact of its being proved is mentioned   0 doubts upon doubts might be started upon this topic and upon the several decisions that have been given on the occasion of it in the way of statute law i could undertake to clear up all these doubts if what ought to be extirpated were fit to be amended in the way of dissertation i could undertake for nothing but to thicken them     book viii on the cause of exclusion of evidence—the technical system of procedure chapter i object of this inquiry—its connexion with the subject of the present work the mass of absurdity the chaos which in the delineation of existing arrangements it will be necessary to hold up to view must continue to be what it has hitherto been a blind inexplorable labyrinth until a clue be given to it a perfect riddle unless a key be added to it this clue this key will consist in an indication of the views and designs of those to whose lot it has fallen—from the time when the very foundation of the edifice was begun upon to the present—to be occupied in the erection of it designs the natural and necessary result of the position in which they have all along been placed in a work confined to the subject of evidence an exposition how brief soever of the universally and necessarily corrupt state of the predominant system of judicial procedure in every country may be apt to appear irrelevant or at least of too mighty and disproportionate importance to be introduced as it were in a parenthesis—as subordinate not only to the subject of evidence but to that comparatively small part of the ground occupied by the practice of exclusion but it will be seen that of that corrupt system the doctrine of exclusion constitutes a fundamental part—a feature altogether characteristic and indispensable the consequence is that unless the nature and origin of that system were brought to view the prevalence of the practice could not be accounted for nor therefore that sort of satisfaction given which on every subject which admits of it the eye of the reader naturally looks for and seems entitled to expect his time will not be the worse bestowed if in addition to this comparatively narrow abuse the source of so many other and still more crying grievances be pointed out still less if a glimpse should happen here and there to be caught of a feature or two of the only appropriate remedy in all discourses authoritative and unauthoritative—at least in all discourses of a grave cast—that have had the system of judicial procedure for their subject an assumption explicit or implicit seems constantly to have been made—viz that the ends to which that course has with more or less felicity been directed have been those to which of course it has all along been professed to be directed viz the ends of justice consider the position of the voices by whom the vocal concert on this stage has been led—nothing can be more natural than this assumption i e than the fact of its having been made consider it on the ground of parallel experience consider it on the ground of the known and incontestable principles of human nature—nothing can be more inconsistent or improbable than the truth of it consider it on the ground of direct experience—nothing can be more false false in every country—in every country far enough advanced in the career of civilization to have afforded a settled establishment in this quarter of the field of government—it is in a more preeminent degree false as applied to english practice a proposition the truth of which howsoever unwelcome will be found but too palpable as we advance into no mans conception does it ever appear to enter that the securing the maximum of happiness to the good people of england was the motive or so much as among the motives which brought duke william upon a visit to king harold—that it was a regard either for the purity of the jewish faith or the symmetry of jewish mouths that rendered one of his royal successors so alert in rendering the functions of a dentist to one of his hebrew subjects—that it was the sympathetic apprehension of seeing their neighbours dissolved in luxury that used to render mahratta princes so diligent in the collection of chout notwithstanding so many professions as have been heard professions which even from the impurest lips will to one who duly considers the character of the nation and the temper of the times sound rather as exaggerated than as altogether insincere many there appear to be who regard with scorn and ridicule the notion that the augmentation of the comfort and wellbeing of the indian natives has had any share in so many exertions as have     been made by governorsgeneral in hindostan for extending to those defenceless beings the protection of english laws if in the very highest rank in society social and enlarged affections were so completely smothered by narrow and selfregarding ones is it natural that in an inferior rank the purer affections should in the same stage of society have reigned paramount or alone whatever on this subject can on the present occasion be brought to view must unavoidably be subjected to an extreme degree of compression to a future occasion the task of development must in a great measure be deferred hence it is that what is here delivered must be delivered in the form of thoughts or aphorisms bearing the similitude of crude assertion for proof and illustration for by each example both purposes will be served they must wait for details of which a part only though what for this purpose perhaps will be found a sufficient part can find a suitable place in the present work chapter ii technical or feegathering and natural or domestic systems of procedure what in consequence of the infirmities attached by nature to the infancy of society the formation of the system of judicial procedure has nowhere except here and there by bits and patches been the work of the legislator it has fallen everywhere to the share of the judge in consequence of the same infirmities the judge received everywhere or found means to make for himself in the shape of fees extracted from the suitors a retribution necessary or unnecessary for his trouble and the use of his power—for the service rendered or supposed to be rendered to them by the exercise of it the mode in which the will of a legislator acting as such is expressed is by rules mostly general and at any rate laid down beforehand the sort of law thus produced is called statute law very different was the mode in which the will of judges was expressed—of judges acting as such and by the exercise of that will developing the course of procedure and collecting fees no rules were laid down beforehand as occasion called what was thought right or pretended to be thought right upon each occasion was done and as to rules it was left to suitors to collect or rather frame them for themselves as they could from the observation of what had been done law produced in this mode of generation has been called common law and sometimes jurisprudence or jurisprudential law rules which are laid down in determinate words may in so far as these words are well chosen—adapted to the habits and capacities of those for whose use they are intended be understood without art rules which not being laid down in determinate words can scarcely with propriety be said to exist cannot be understood—or rather since where nothing exists there is nothing to understand guessed at—without art the system constructed by such hands and constructed or left to be constructed in such a mode may accordingly be termed the technical system of procedure† when a man empowered to pursue a public object is by the same means empowered to pursue a personal one it is not in human nature that this private object should be a matter of indifference to him it will naturally and unavoidably exert an influence over the course taken by him in the pursuit of the public object in consideration of this influence the system here denominated the technical system may further be characterized by the name of the feegathering or feecollecting system the occasions of bringing it into view under this character will be but too numerous the courts of justice in which the system or mode of procedure chalked out as above and under such influence as above is in force may be termed by one common appellation courts of technical procedure everywhere they may be seen to be characterized by a common set of features‡ before states existed at least in any of the forms now in existence in civilized nations families existed justice is not less necessary to the existence of families than of states the mode in which in those domestic tribunals     created by nature at the instance of necessity justice was administered and for that purpose facts were inquired into may for distinctions sake be termed the natural or domestic mode of judicature it is among the characteristics of the natural or domestic mode of judicature to be exercised if not absolutely at least comparatively speaking without forms—without rules a man judges as monsieur jourdan talked prose unconscious of any science displayed—of any art exercised one of your two sons leaves his task undone and tears his brothers clothes both brothers claim the same plaything two of your servants dispute to whose place it belongs to do a given piece of work you animadvert upon these delinquencies you settle these disputes it scarce occurs to you that the study in which you have been sitting to hear this is a tribunal a court—your elbowchair a bench—yourself a judge yet you could no more perform these several operations without performing the task of judicature—without exercising the functions of a judge without hearing evidence without making inquiry—than if the subject of inquiry had been the hastings cause the douglas cause or the literaryproperty cause it is among the characteristics of technical procedure all over the world to abound in rules and formalities in process of time—as occasion presented itself and irresistible necessity urged inquiry—spite of all prejudices a discovery was made that with little or no exception these rules and formalities instead of being necessary were repugnant to the ends of justice that an option was to be made between the sacrifice of these rules and formalities and the sacrifice of certain portions of substantive law necessary to the existence of the state accordingly certain portions of the field of judicature were marked out and a course prescribed for the appointment of judges with authority to proceed and inquire to hear and determine as they would do in the bosom of their respective families paying no sort of regard to any of these rules and formalities for distinctions sake the courts thus constituted may be termed courts of natural procedure or judicature of natural procedure restored or if in any odd nooks of the field of judicature discovery should in any instance be made of any little spot which happened to have escaped the fangs of the technical system natural procedure preserved the character of the natural system of procedure it may already be perceived is little more than negative health is the absence of disease liberty in its original sense is the absence of coercion natural procedure is the absence of those rules and formalities of which technical procedure is composed but for verse prose would not have had a name but for technical natural procedure would not have had would not have needed one in current nomenclature the distinction nearest to a coincidence with that between technical procedure and natural as here explained is that between regular and summary but the coincidence is far short of being complete thus far it is true they agree—that in comparison with all technical procedure all natural is always summary but technical procedure has its branches which are called summary as well as its branches which are called regular for designating that which is not technical the word summary has therefore been unfitted moreover summary means short and wherever one course is shorter than another it may in comparison with that other be termed summary but in a series of infinite length the number of degrees is infinite and in all that number there is no one that can have any exclusive pretension to the epithet of summary the final cause of this article of jurisprudential nomenclature is not difficult to divine the use of regularity is recognised by everybody the term regular is eulogistic get people to believe that summary procedure is something opposite to regular procedure you may prevail with them and accustom them to regard the more expeditious procedure with a jealous eye in an underhand way you may thus insinuate and get them to believe what you durst not assert that there is a sort of incompatibility between the superior dispatch observable in the summary mode and the superior regularity observable in the regular that is in the technical mode the utility of dispatch—its title to be regarded as one of the ends of justice—is too plain to be denied in the technical mode as compared with the natural the want of dispatch is also too plain to be denied to reconcile men as well as may be to the repugnancy of the technical system in relation to this end of justice you thus take the best chance that in so few words can be taken for getting them to fancy on the part of the natural course a repugnancy to the direct and ultimate ends of justice a conception the exact reverse of which is the true one in every country so i imagine it would be found men of law unable to find the shadow of an argument have trusted to the power of this prejudice preserving a prudent or rather necessary silence blackstone in the fertile soil of england has been fortunate enough to find another and a still stronger prejudice applicable to the same purpose summary procedure is a mode of procedure to be regarded with jealousy and with such a degree of jealousy as shall prevent as much as possible the extension of it with jealousy why because in summary procedure there     is no jury no jury—and what then is the use of trial by jury to be regarded as an end or only as a means taken altogether are the ends of justice more completely fulfilled by regular procedure with its jury than by summary procedure without a jury—another inquiry in which no lawyer ever ventured to engage and on which blackstone knew better than to start no where prejudice reigns everything is to be lost by inquiry nothing to be gained by prejudice the same business is done when it is done upon much easier terms but in the very word summary may be seen an indication which if it does not of itself afford at least points out the path to a complete demonstration of the incongruity of that mode to which it stands opposed what is a summary mode it is a mode in and by which an efficient decision is obtained with a less quantity of delay expense and vexation than that which is attached to the other mode termed the regular to the use then of the regular mode a quantity of collateral inconvenience attaches which does not attach upon the summary mode from this single statement admitting it to be true follows a necessary consequence viz that—unless under the summary there be some deficiency in respect of the security against misdecision and that deficiency such that the mischief of it is of a magnitude to outweigh the advantage obtained by the defalcation from the mass of collateral inconvenience in the shape of delay expense and vexation—the existence of the regular mode be it what it will is an enormous nuisance is the summary mode then attended with any such disadvantage is the regular mode attended with any such disadvantage if so in what particular respect what are the arrangements which being necessary to the giving the completest security that can be given against misdecision are to be found in the regular and not to be found in the summary mode the question is a conclusive one no answer has ever been none ever will be given to it all the wits of all the lawyers by whom civilized society is intested would sink under the task chapter iii cause of the vices of technical procedure the sinister interest of the judge §   ends of judicature under the feegathering system opposite to the ends of justice various are the channels through which under the feegathering system the matter of corruption may find its way into the bosom of the judge   the fee is received into the judges own hands or being received by another hand is placed openly to his account   the fee is received by some subordinate officer by the hand or on the account of the subordinate but the office is at the disposal of the judge and sold by him for his own benefit the whole of the purchasemoney being put into his own pocket  —or upon the admission of the officer the judge receives a bonus avowedly or tacitly proportioned to the quantity of the emolument constituted by the aggregate of the fees   the office thus endowed is at the disposal of the judge but being by law or fear of public censure inhibited from selling it he gives it to some person connected with him by the ties of blood alliance or service thereby saving to himself the charge of a provision which he would or would not otherwise have made for the same person at his own expense the possessor of the office thus endowed doing the duty of it in person  —or by deputy that is by doing nothing for it but receiving the fees the deputy receiving a consideration for his trouble by a fixed salary or by a share of the fees   the fees having been received by a deputy by whom the duties of the office are performed are paid over to two or more persons in conjunction nominated by the judge which persons not doing either of them any part of the business appear upon the face of the transaction to be trustees the person for whose use they are trustees not being declared and thence appearing to be the judge himself by whom the trustees were nominated if the aggregate of fees liable to be paid had in the instance of each suitor been no greater than it would have been in his power to pay without any inconvenience worth regarding if at the same time it had been out of the power of the judges or their subordinates to add either to the amount of the fees exacted on each occasion or to the number of the occasions on which they were exacted in such case between the interest of the functionary and his duty no opposition would have been created by this means but in the nature of things it was scarce possible that in the situation in question and with the powers inseparable from it power should not be possessed of adding either to the quantum of the fee or to the number of the occasions on which it comes to be exacted the mischief became much greater the opposition of interest to duty much more strenuous  00 and disastrous when a given sum was raised by multiplying the occasions of receiving fees than when it was raised by adding to the quantum of this or that fee by merely adding to the quantum of this or that fee no other mischief would have been produced than what would have been produced by the addition thus made to the quantum of the expense but by adding to the number of the occasions corresponding additions were made inevitably made to the vexation and delay over and above the additions made to the expense unfortunately it became on various accounts easier much casier to add to the number of the occasions on which fees came to be exacted than to add to the quantum of each fee additions to the quantum of each fee could not escape notice and would be apt to produce complaint what did not come under notice could not produce complaint and the occasions of realizing additions to the quantity of writing manufactured or number or duration of other acts done—in a word to the quantity of business rendered necessary to be done and thence to the number of the fees exacted on the occasion of it—might very easily and on a variety of undetectible though false pretences be augmented almost without stint accordingly under this system the judges to the power added the effectual inducement to produce factitious vexation expense and delay or more briefly to make business in a quantity almost without limit and continually tending to increase the vexation expense and delay for the sake of the profit extractible in the shape of fees from the expense hence the production of vexation expense delay and official profit became the real and in a manner the sole ends of judicature profit the ultimate end expense and delay so many intermediate ends the production of the vexation not an end but a collateral result had not collateral mischief been contributory to the profit or what came to the same thing inseparably attached to the production of it it might not have been any mans study to produce any part of that collateral mischief but being either contributory to the profit or inseparably attached to the production of it it became every mans interest and consequently every mans study to produce them to the greatest amount possible†  0  so far as these ends of judicature are pursued so far must the ends of justice be sacrificed but what the people and the sovereign expect and demand is that the ends of justice be pursued here then it becomes necessary to make a sort of compromise and to preserve appearances for the purpose of keeping the public deceived and quiet to sacrifice to a certain degree the pursuit of the ends of judicature for that the ends of justice might in general be supposed to be pursued steadily and exclusively it was necessary that to a certain degree they should be actually pursued—that they should be pursued in all cases in which the pursuit of them was not adverse and even in some cases in which it was adverse to the pursuit of the ends of judicature thus when in other stations public functionaries receive public money with a view of extracting what they can of it to their own use in the way of embezzlement or peculation—it becomes necessary to them notwithstanding to the prejudice and pro tanto to the sacrifice of these their objects to apply a part of such moneys commonly by much the greater part to the services for which it was designed but to raise the mass of official profit in this line to its maximum it was not sufficient to raise to its maximum the quantity of profit extracted on the occasion of each suit—it became also necessary to raise to its maximum the number of suits understand of such suits and such suits only as would yield a mass of profit worth acceptance on such terms whatever suit would either yield no profit at all or none that were worth acceptance—none that by the mass of its profit would outweigh in the mind of the judge the trouble of doing the business in regard to every such suit it was his interest that it should never be begun or being begun should come to an end as soon as possible for the trouble the labour attached to the doing of the business is in other words so much vexation to the judge hence the end of actual judicature became distinguishable into two principal branches positive and direct the augmentation of profit negative and collateral the diminution of trouble by the augmentation of the aggregate mass of fees collected both these ends were served at once by the money paid by such of the suitors as could and did pay profit was augmented by the exclusion of such suitors as were either not able or not willing to pay trouble was diminished in the first case the imposition operated as a tax and yielded revenue in the other case it operated as a prohibition and yielded ease so successfully has this feegathering system acted in the production of one of those results which it has converted into the actual ends of judicature viz delay that we shall see the same suit which under the natural system regularly occupies on an average a space of a few minutes occupying with equal regularity under the feecollecting system a space of some hundreds not to say thousands of times that magnitude so successfully again has it acted in the production of another of those ends of judicature—denial of justice—that as to all remedies other than such as are applied by criminal suit we shall find from six to about ninetenths of the people in england fixed by it in a state of perpetual outlawry if by the system of which this delay and this denial of justice were the ends and are the fruits a greater chance of right decision were afforded than by the natural system above contrasted with it the mischiefs of the technical system might receive some setoff some compensation though it could searcely be anything near an adequate one but in proportion as both systems are seen into and understood and even in the course of the very small part of the examination contained in the ensuing pages it will be seen that the chance of right decision is by the technical system decreased in a variety of ways—increased in none §   alliance between the sinister interest of judges and that of professional lawyers under every system of procedure and in the very earliest and rudest stages of society some individuals there must always have been to whom by infirmity bodily or intellectual on this as on other occasions the assistance of others must occasionally have been rendered necessary so far as persons standing in need of this assistance could find friends that were at the same time sufficiently qualified to afford it and able to afford it gratis so far society could exist and did exist without professional lawyers but so soon as one instance manifested itself in which a man unable on other terms to obtain the assistance he looked upon as necessary had recourse to pecuniary retribution for the purchase of it—that instant the profession of a lawyer came into existence the same motives by which in every other  0  line of moneygetting business a man is stimulated to raise to its maximum the quantity of his business will of course apply themselves to this and with equal energy the interest of the judge was that there should be as many suits as possible the interest of the professional lawyer was the same here then is a community of interests between the judge on the one part and the professional lawyer on the other and this community of interest is upon the face of it perfect and entire it was the interest of each that the mass of business understand always profityielding business should be as great as possible it was the interest of each that any exertions of his own by which any addition could be made to that mass should not be spared fellow labourers towards one common end the acquisition of pecuniary profit—cooperators throughout the whole of the career yet in no part of it competitors—a sort of virtual partnership was thus established between these two species of lawyers a species of connexion be it ever remembered constituted entirely by the mode of payment established in the case of the judge a connexion ever existing where that mode of payment exists never existing either where the judge receives no pecuniary retribution in any shape or where receiving one he receives it in the shape of salary only and without fees under the feegathering system of procedure—the main and neverfailing branch of the art of judicature a branch which is sure to be cultivated and in perfection whatsoever comes of the rest is the art of making business in the exercise of this art we now see one sure and ever ready assistant to the judge the professional lawyer his partner as aforesaid whenever it happened that in the transaction of the business the party the client was himself present as well as the professional lawyer his assistant—the presence of a person whose interest it was that of the business for which he was to pay not more should be done than was necessary to his purpose operated as a check to the exertions of the partnership in that part of their industry which consisted in the art of making business both parties felt themselves stimulated by the strongest and most constantly acting interest to make every exertion for the removal of so troublesome an obstacle an iniquity so glaring so repugnant to the most obvious ends and perpetually recurring principles of justice so opposite to the practice of every man that ever lived in every case in which he had the discovery of truth really at heart could not in any country be the work of a moment in england in particular it cost several centuries to bring this part of the system of exclusion to the perfection in which it exists at present to make a direct rule of court saying in so many words no suitor shall be allowed to transact or join in the transaction of his own business—no suitor shall ever be admitted into the presence of the judge or of any of the officers acting under the direction of the judge—would have been too monstrous the resource was so to torment and vex the suitor by delays and fruitless attendances as to make him regard the faculty of saving himself from this torment as a special grace and favour no system can ever be made so absurd or atrocious as to appear so to the bulk of those who are born under it much less to those who are paid for upholding it in mexico human victims were understood to be an acceptable fee human blood a bonne bouche to the supernatural and immortal judge in england so late as the seventeenth century duelling was regarded as the surest mode of obtaining his judgment and in the presence of his natural and mortal deputies champions were as attorneys and barristers still are regarded as being on many occasions eligible substitutes to parties and witnesses a capital improvement was made in the art of making business when one professional lawyer had contrived to make pretences for calling in the assistance of another each made business of his own and business for the other john was paid for attending thomas—thomas for being attended by john john was paid for writing what thomas was to read—thomas for reading what john had written in operations of the mechanical kind by the division of labour the sum total of labour necessary to be bestowed is lessened in the case of the species of intellectual labour here in question at any rate where it is paid for in this mode the result is reversed the sum total of labour bestowed or what comes to the same thing pretended to be bestowed is increased by what is called division—by the allotting of different portions of labour or pretended labour to so many different hands of a cause the same in denomination how comes it that in the two cases the effects are so opposite a seeming paradox but the direction in which interest acts explains it in the physical case the profit of the directing hand augments as the quantity of labour employed in the production of the given effect diminishes in the psychological case the profit of the directing hand is increased not by the diminution but by the augmentation of the quantity of labour bestowed or pretended to be bestowed the quantity of business made in each given cause being thus made to increase by and with the number of hands employed in  0  it—it has become the interest of all hands and in particular of the superintending hand to give every possible increase to the number of such hands in other words the quantity of profit flowing under this system into the coffers of the judge receives a natural increase from the number of the channels through which it flows in ordinary partnerships an increase in the number of the partners is rather a consequence than a cause of an increase in the quantity of profitable business where it becomes a cause it is always in virtue of and in proportion to the aptitude for the business on the part of each such additional partner whether in the way of capital connexions industry or skill but in this great law partnership an increase of the number of the partners has never been a consequence of the increase of business—has ever been a cause and—as to skill and industry—to the augmentation of the factitious part of the business the absence of those qualities is much more favourable than their presence the more neglects and the more blunders the more business to the grand object of raising to its maximum the quantity of business or the manufactory of made business there is no one article so essentially useful as a stock as copious as possible of lies utterance of lies is business refutation of lies is business decision and operation in every way upon the ground of those lies is business reversal of that decision undoing or repairing or pretending to repair the mischief done by those operations when the lies come to be detected is business but the greater the number of professional substitutes on the same side the greater and more efficient the stock of lies the generation is more easy the refutation and detection more tardy and more difficult the danger of punishment a danger which if it were realized might operate in the way of prevention the less formidable moreover the greater the number of professional channels through which a profitable lie can be made to flow the more effectually is detection prevented or at least retarded and by the destruction of all individual responsibility the more effectually is all danger removed of punishment or shame if the party for whose benefit real or pretended the lie is uttered to and in the presence of the judge is present at the uttering of it whether it be by his own lips or anothers that it is uttered there is a somebody who is responsible for it and that somebody is he what you can do if there be any use in it is to exempt him from all factitious punishment what you cannot do is to exempt him from the natural punishment of present shame on the other hand keep him out of the way providing at the same time a gang of professional lawyers of different classes through whose pens and lips it shall have to flow till it comes to the ear or the eye of the judge the more numerous the band lawyers alone or if the client be the author lawyers and client together the more secure they are all and each of them from every the slightest flush of shame the lawyers are there but they such is their misfortune are misinstructed and deceived the client if he were there would be exposed to shame but he is not there—care has been taken that he shall not be so in another branch of trade—the hustling trade—the greater the number of the partners the more difficult it is to ascertain at each given moment in whose possession the purse or watch is to be found in a partnership it may be said—in a partnership properly so called as between one attorney and another the community of interests is constant and complete stiles cannot pocket a sixpence but nokes comes in for an equal or according to the terms of the partnership which comes to the same thing a proportional share but many and many are the operations on the occasion of which while the attorney receives so much the barrister gets nothing the judge as little many again are the occasions on which attorney and counsel each getting his profit the judge still receives nothing as before doubtless but to any practical purpose what effect results from these exceptions not absolutely none but next to none to constitute the effective partnership to render the community of interests strong enough for every pernicious purpose it is not necessary that the judge should come in for his share on every occasion it is sufficient if there be any occasion on which he comes in for any share sufficient on every other supposition than this viz that the aggregate amount of his share does not communibus annis constitute a sum sufficient in his station in life to exercise any corruptive influence the case is that—although upon a minute search and analysis made with this special view a separation might be made between the two classes of cases—viz those in which  0  the judge does participate in the profits made by lawyers of the other classes and those in which he does not—yet so thoroughly intermingled are the cases that belong to one of the two classes with the cases that belong to the other that without such express research a sort of research which one may venture to say no man ever made it is not possible for any man in the station of a judge to have retained in his mind any such conception clear enough to have maintained an influence on his conduct what it may happen to him to say to himself is—by this or that part of the present suit i shall not get anything what it never can happen to him to say to himself is by two such suits i shall get no more than i shall by one what then is the result that literally speaking there is no partnership because there are no articles—but that in effect at least to the purpose here in question and on the occasions on which the word partnership is here employed the partnership is undeniable there exists that sort of community of interests which it is the effect and the object of a partnership with articles to create and for the expression of which the term partnership is preferable as being so much shorter than any phrase by which the equivalent of it could be expressed in other words considered in one point of view the corruptive influence may in its effect be stronger than if there were an actual partnership declared and confirmed by articles in the case of a real and declared partnership all eyes would be open to the existence of it—all hands upon their guard against its corruptive tendency acting under this check the judges the ruling members would be more cautious and abstain from serving the partnership interest and which is the same thing in other words from vexing and pillaging the people in many instances in which for want of such a check they now act at their ease whereas at present the thread by which the interests of the several members of the firm are bound together being of so fine a texture as to be invisible to vulgar and incurious eyes that check can scarcely be said to have existence that the existence of the corruptive connexion is generally unperceived seems indubitable else how is it that—not from lawyers only but from nonlawyers of all classes the boasts should be so incessant of the purity of english judicature that in a certain sense the purity is complete seems altogether probable viz that within the memory of any man living to go no higher no english judge of the superior class ever received from a suitor anything that could with propriety be termed a bribe what is more were it possible to know i should not be surprised to learn that no instance had ever happened in which any judge now living was instrumental knowingly and willingly in the establishment of any fresh rule or practice the effect of which was to make any addition to the amount of the profit of the firm were i to hear of the existence without being apprized of the purport of a new regulation emanating from any of the courts of westminster—and were i obliged as suitors are sometimes in those courts to make a bet—i would lay the odds that the regulation had both for its object and its effect the promoting the interest of the people in the character of suitors and not that of the learned partnership for inasmuch as every day at however slow a rate the legislature and the people come to see further and further into their own interest in respect of matters of judicature—every day in point of obvious prudence it becomes more and more necessary for the partnership to consult that interest but having gone thus far here i must stop and admitting on the part of the existing generation and their probable successors all this purity no admission is made that is in any degree inconsistent with the supposition of a system rotten to the very core nothing is done by any man to make the practice worse some things are done now and then to make it better but so thoroughly bad is it having been so from the beginning—so thoroughly adverse to the people so thoroughly favourable to the partnership—that to attempt in any way to do anything to make it worse would be an enterprise as unnecessary as it might be imprudent and unsafe at the pace here supposed improvement might go on century after century and after as many centuries as have elapsed since the julian period the system in respect of its essential characters might remain still the same—still subservient to the ends of judicature—still repugnant to the ends of justice what these characters are or at least some of them will be endeavoured to be shown in the course of the next succeeding chapters §   interest of the partnership in depraving the moral and intellectual faculties of the people whatever mischief is done from the seat of judicature must have a veil to cover it it must be taken for justice or it would not be endured what is done by the authority of a judge acting as such—were it avowed or even without being avowed clearly understood that it was contrary to justice and by the judge himself known to be so—in the first place the sovereign whoever he were would not endure it in the next place if the sovereign would the people would not they would rise upon the judge as they did upon jefferies and tear him piecemeal to keep the moral and intellectual faculties  0  of the people in as corrupt and depraved a state as possible under the exceptions dictated by a regard to personal safety may therefore be set down as among the constant studies of the man of law to construct and keep at work such engines as should be best adapted to the purpose has been the subject of his constant labours suppose a people reduced to such a pitch of stupidity as to be persuaded that to convert injustice into justice was a transformation in the power of every judge and that to effect it nothing more was in any case necessary than to pronounce one or other of three or four words such as null void bad quash irregularity what is easy enough to conceive is that supposing this point accomplished the actual ends of judicature are fulfilled—the one grand problem solved suppose again a people brought into and kept in such a state of stupidity as to believe upon the word of a judge or anybody else that wilful falsehood when uttered by or by order of a judge acting as such becomes not only an innocent but a useful a meritorious and even a necessary practice insomuch that without it justice either could not be administered at all or at any rate could not be administered in anything like the same perfection as with it and by the help of it here again supposing this done what is easily understood is that in such a state of things a judge need never be at a loss for that under favour of it it is in his power at any time to commit with impunity and safety whatever wickedness is most to his taste all this is plain and easy but the difficulty i do not say is now but one day will be—posterity will feel it in all its force—the difficulty will be to conceive how it should be that in a state of society in many other respects so highly enlightened a whole people including the members of the sovereignty should have been in such a state of infatuation as to give in language or in practice assent to two propositions in which so much absurdity is combined with so much wickedness propositions the persuasive force of which depends upon a constant and universal habit of blind assumption propositions in defence of which when once put into question not all the wit of mankind could furnish in the way of argument the value of a single syllable for reconciling the understandings of the people by argument and reason to the practice of these enormities it is needless to say how vain the attempt would have been how hopeless the task could not but have appeared to be for reconciling their affections and attaching them to the practice of these enormities the course taken was to give it a connexion as close and extensive as possible with such results as in themselves were most agreeable to those affections to do away the antipathy naturally excited in this or that mans mind by the view of an immoral act habitually practised by another no course can be so effectual where it is a possible one as to engage him in the practice of it himself this done it is no longer in his power to accuse the other man without accusing himself his mouth is stopped for ever and to keep at peace with himself an indispensable task is to reconcile himself in opinion as well as he can to that sort of conduct to which he has already reconciled himself in practice from thenceforward his thoughts on the subject will be as few as he can make them and those all of them on one side whatever idea tends in his view of the matter to present the practice in an agreeable light will be embraced with avidity whatsoever tends to place it in an unfavourable point of view will be studiously repelled with aversion and disgust hence it is that under the feegathering system it has been to the partnership so desirable an object and with the help of the powers inseparable from the office unhappily so easy a one to convert the whole body of suitors little less than the whole body of the people into a company of liars to make the practice of that vice a condition sine quâ non to the receipt—let us not say of justice—but of all those necessary benefits which are ever prayed for or granted under the name of justice accordingly in the road of moral filth and corruption thus elaborately made not a step can a man stir without either uttering some lie or acquiescing in the utterance of it by some one else as nonsense succeeds to nonsense absurdity to absurdity so does lie to lie from the beginning of the career to the end of it all forced into mens mouths by these pretended guardians of the public morals to the youth of both sexes when flocking to a ballroom or a theatre it has never yet been proposed as a condition precedent to their admission into those seats of social pleasure and innocent delight that they should each of them before the delivery of the ticket take a roll in the contents of a nightcart kept in waiting for that purpose but an initiation of that sort cannot be more repugnant to the ends that attract the children of gaiety to a theatre or a ball room than the being rolled as suitors are through the mire of mendacity is repugnant to the ends in pursuit of which they find themselves under so unhappy a necessity as that of betaking themselves to that seat of affliction called a court of judicature  0  §   interest of the partnership in the irrationality of the law it was and is the interest of the partnership that the law be throughout as irrational as possible why that it may be as unconjecturable as possible the more rational the more easy to discover by conjecture the more irrational the more difficult—no for that implies proportion whereas nothing was more easy than to give it that degree of irrationality that should set conjecture at defiance in every country that is not plunged in barbarism—the inhabitants of it subject to the yoke of corruption or caprice under the mask of justice but where is the country that in this respect has completely emerged out of the sink of barbarism—the will of the sovereign has throughout every part of the field of justice subject to it clothed itself in a determinate assemblage of words and those words it has adequately conveyed to the notice of each individual whose conduct is respectively required to conform itself to the respective portions of it so far as this fundamental duty of the sovereign has been fulfilled the office of conjecture is a sinecure when and so far as this duty has been left unperformed there extends the province of conjecture the materials which conjecture has to work upon have by some means or other been locked up and rendered inaccessible to the great mass of those whose conduct is to be regulated or rather whose condition is to be disposed of by a decision impossible to be foreknown because not previously in existence here then it is that the demand for conjecture comes in and the use of rationality for the assistance of the individual in the performance of a task at once so important and so difficult applied to law rational is as much as to say subservient to utility seeing that general utility is for the most part the object actually aimed at—always the object professed to be aimed at by the authors of statute law—men take for granted that the same has been the object aimed at by jurisprudential law this being taken for granted—each man—when for the purpose of determining at the moment how to conduct himself it becomes necessary to him to form a conjecture relative to the state of the law actual or future in that behalf—thinks with himself what sort of decision is most conformable to the conceptions he has been led to entertain concerning the dictates of general utility viewed either immediately in themselves or through the medium of the dictates of justice utility being the object towards which with more or less skill and felicity all eyes are directed—what appears to each man the track of utility is the track in which he expects to find on each occasion the footsteps of the judge positive law actually created statute law or known decisions of jurisprudential law excepted—this is the only chance which the ideas of any one individual have of meeting with the ideas of any other the judge himself included the track of utility is the common place of rendezvous for all minds meeting in it is the only chance which any one mind has of finding out any other the road being one which they are all but too apt to miss hence the expectations of each concerning what will be the opinions of this or that other are proportionably apt to be disappointed but be the disappointment ever so frequent this is the only chance they have for escaping from it but as it is the interest of every individual in the character of subject viz to the law and eventual suitor to the judge to possess the greatest possible chance of finding out by conjecture what will be the eventual decision of the judge so on the other hand under the feegathering system it is the interest of the judge that in the endeavours thus employed to find out what will be the decision the suitor shall be as seldom right as possible in other words that with reference to the suitor the state of the law should be throughout not simply uncognizable but as unconjecturable as far out of the reach of conjecture as possible from this unconjecturability two intimately connected but perfectly distinct advantages accrue to the partnership and pro interesse suo to the judge—  in proportion as the law really is unconjecturable the failures made by the suitor in his attempts to find it out are frequent and as often as the conjecture of one party points one way while the conjecture of the adverse party both being in a state of affluence adequate to the maintenance of a suit points the opposite way a suit takes place and the partnership have the benefit of it   in proportion as to him who in the quality of eventual suitor thinks of it it appears to be with reference to himself unconjecturable in that same proportion rises the obligation he feels himself under of having recourse to the professional lawyer by whom that faculty of conjecturing of which he feels himself destitute is supposed to be possessed here then suit or no suit so much business is made for the professional lawyer in that shape in the character of lawadviser or opinionist whose business it is in each case to form conjectures concerning what in that case will be the eventual decision of the judge the judges mind the firmament the opinionist the astrologer whose horoscope points itself to that seat of supercelestial influence to accomplish the object of the partnership his own of course included in it it is evident enough how easy on this occasion  0  is the task of the judge appoint a place of meeting with a man if in fact it be your wish not to meet with him nothing can be more easy a very slight deviation from the spot is sufficient to secure you against the misfortune it is your wish to avoid by stepping aside but a little way out of the track of reason a judge may thus be sufficiently assured of having placed his decision and all future decisions capable of being built on the same ground out of the reach of conjecture on this occasion he has but two purposes to accomplish and neither of them very difficult to accomplish—  that the decision with the ground he places it on shall be irrational and   that howsoever irrational they shall not be in such sort and degree irrational as that it shall be impossible to find for them any pretence which may serve to prevent their irrationality from presenting itself in its genuine colours to the eyes of the nonlawyers whose interests are sacrificed by it the more unconjecturable the more abstruse the more abstruse the greater the degree of sagacity and appropriate information the sort of information called learning which becomes requisite to the possession of any tolerable chance of pitching upon the eventual decision by a fortunate conjecture the more irrational the more unconjecturable the more unconjecturable the greater demand for learning but with respect to learning whatsoever be the subject the more abstruse it is that is the greater the force of mind it is supposed to require and to attest the possession of the greater the admiration it is wont to excite thus it is that out of the sink of those iniquities in which if seen in their true light they would have found a source of shame—of wellmerited odium and contempt—out of that same sink they have contrived to draw a fund of glory out of the den of iniquity and nonsense dealt out blindfold and in return for such dispensations not wealth alone but honour wealth and reverence are poured into their laps by the deluded multitude the excrements of his body are the presents distributed by the grand lama to such of his votaries as he expects to find his account in honouring jewels gold and silver are the presents sent to him in return the excrements of his brain are the dole distributed to the nonlawyer by the man of law and the expected return comes to both impostors in the same valuable shapes §   limits to the operation of the sinister interest the mass of mischiefs to which the authors of the technical system were led by the influence of this sinister interest to give birth was not mischief in all shapes without distinction the extent of it was bounded by certain exceptions conditions limitations   the subject of depredation is the matter of property or wealth considered as liable to be transferred from hand to hand by such means if wealth in every shape had been destroyed profit judicial profit would thus have been dried up in its source fees are the golden eggs national wealth the hen that lays them   a lawyer besides being a lawyer is a man he sleeps commonly in a house—he travels frequently on a road were any such misfortune to happen to the man as that of seeing his house burnt or feeling his throat cut the sympathy of the lawyer would hardly be altogether idle this is another motive for prescribing some sort of limitation to crimes in general and more particularly to those more violent ones of which if too liberal an encouragement and indulgence were to be extended to them the destruction of society would be a speedy consequence by the same principle by the action of which he is induced to nurse and encourage some sorts of misdeeds he will be induced to aim with more or less energy and felicity at the prevention of others the misdeeds he nurses will be those from which he has most to gain and least to fear the misdeeds he combats will be those from which he has most to fear and least to gain a great majority of the whole number of misdeeds have ever been and will ever be offences of the predatory class and of these again a great majority will have for their authors a set of miserable wretches from whom little or nothing is to be extracted in the shape of fees they will be in a word crimes of indigence—theft highwayrobbery housebreaking and so forth thus far then clients and suitors are hardly worth multiplying in the character of defendants moreover the persons exposed to suffer by these offences are persons of all classes poor as well as rich and taking persons of all classes in the aggregate a great majority will be too poor to yield a mass of fees worth stooping for thus far then they are but little worth nursing and multiplying in the character of prosecutors when a mass of property constitutes a stake contended for by two parties or sets of parties and that capable of being at an early stage impounded or at any rate sure to be forthcoming when an estate in any shape is at stake and it can be so ordered that costs shall come out of the estate this is the sort of cause worth nursing above all others†  0  taken together the aggregate of criminal suits compose an object very little worth nursing in comparison with the aggregate of noncriminal suits accordingly it is in the former class of causes that the greatest regard will be manifested for the ends of justice—that most care will be taken for securing the conviction of the wrongdoer the acquittal of the guiltless—and that the quantity of factitious expense vexation and delay will be least considerable   to the absolute and exclusive pursuit of the ends of judicature the power of the legislature would always be an obstacle resisting with a greater or less degree of force of the abuses of which the technical system was naturally composed some of the grossest and most intolerable would now and then be removed and the idea of censure and even punishment how little soever to be apprehended by such hands and from such hands could never in this line be altogether without influence but though in the character of a check as well as a remedy this superintending power would never be altogether without its influence yet in the character of a bar as well as a remedy it could never be other than a very unsteady and inadequate one it was only because the hands in which the power of supreme legislation resided were in some way or other in respect of some other necessary endowment more or less deficient—that the task of laying down the rule of action could ever have been intrusted or rather left and abandoned to hands so essentially and incurably incompetent in this or that place he would be for a length of time like john doe not to be found anywhere in one place he would be for a score of years together† in another for a century or two‡ in the state of a dormouse—the day of his resurrection uncertain or destined never to arrive when he exists if he be a corporation sole this corporation will be a puppet in the hands of some member of the feegathering partnership no one else uniting the experience industry and reputation necessary to the faculty of coping with a mass of accounts screwed up by ages of exertion to the maximum of intricacy if he be a corporation aggregate the same causes will still operate to make him yield to the current against which his power should be as a dike to lay him more or less at the mercy of those to whose enormities he should operate as a check even though adequate knowledge and skill as well as power should not be wanting—still the public affection by which he is urged to oppose the torrent will be apt to prove but a feeble counterpoise to the strong and concentrated interest which gives motion to it   to the sort of check last mentioned the apprehension of popular discontent would always add another though always one still more feeble it is only through the medium of the legislature that the people at large can act in this direction with any considerable effect unless it be with such violence and irregularity as to render the remedy worse than the worst paroxysm of the disease even at the height of absolute or illchecked power reputation it is true can never be altogether without its value but the opinion of the public at large can never operate as a check upon the enormities of lawyers any  0  further than as the people are in a condition to see through the artifices of lawyers and so completely has the field been every where rendered impenetrable and repulsive to unlearned eyes that the people be their sufferings ever so acute know not so much as to point to the seat of the disease much less to choose and call for an appropriate remedy success has long ago crowned the machinations of the man of law the ends of justice have been thrust by him out of sight spurious ends adherence to this or that pernicious prejudice have been set up in their stead these spurious ends have been habitually passed upon the people for the legitimate ends the baal to whom his priesthood bow the knee the people have been taught and have learnt to worship as the true god what the effect of the law may be upon the fate of some individual who at the moment happens to be an object of popular favour or disfavour is the only sort of law question in which the great body of the people are apt to take any very strong or steady interest so the point of the day be gained—at what expense it is gained i mean at the expense of what mischief done to the whole body of the laws is no concern of theirs   to the above checks which with more or less efficacy operate all over the civilized world for throughout the whole of that extent spreads the plague of technical judicature english jurisprudence adds one peculiar to itself as in another line of practice thief is sometimes caught by thief—so in this one it has happened in more instances than one that one abuse has received a sort of correction from another subordinate judicatures of narrow extent excepted originally there was but one court for everything business everflowing a division was made such as it was of the field of judicature the line drawn or attempted to be drawn being not geographical but metaphysical the limits were of course in a multitude of points obscure and illdefined four great shops with a quantity of custom allotted out for each were opened at once for the sale of that commodity which went by the name of justice four great shops the original universal shop with the king at the head of it being parted off into four quarters for that purpose honest men might have found difficulty enough in settling which belonged to each these men strove might and main each of them to steal what to the knowledge of every man and of himself more particularly was the indisputable property of his next neighbour no contrivance no wickedness was spared mendacity being the weapon everybody was most expert in the use of was employed by everybody the natural arbiter the king looked on and stared parliament sometimes in existence sometimes in abeyance never acting but upon the spur of some pressing or rather excruciating exigence either thought nothing of the affray or knew not what to think of it universal lasstitude put at length a period to the war by a sort of uti possidetis the brethren parted like two fish wives each with a handful of the spoils of her antagonist in her hand be the cause of this chancemedley what it may the result has been that for a considerable part of the aggregate stock of commodities taken together the suitor has two or even for some articles of it three shops among which to take his choice from the competition it has been supposed that in the case of this as of other branches of trade the customer derives a considerable advantage each shop stands engaged by interest to vie with its rivals either in respect of the cheapness or in respect of the goodness of the articles in which they deal the principle which operates as a cause of this benefit—of the service thus rendered or supposed to be rendered to the ends of justice may be termed the doubleshop or rivalshop principle the advantage such as it is flowing or supposed to flow from this principle seems to be attached if not in an exclusive at least in a preeminent degree to the feegathering system supposing the retribution given in the shape of a fixed salary the motive of love of reputation it is true might act with a certain degree of force in the character of a cause of exertion but suppose it to present itself in the shape of fees depending upon the number of suitors and thence in a certain degree upon the reputation of the court there would still be the love of reputation and the more substantial motive the love of fees besides the advantage such as it is is well worth consideration not the less as being the only one and that altogether casual and undesigned which the feegathering system has to set against so many pernicious consequences as have been already under review that it is not altogether imaginary seems indubitable but it applies not with equal force to all the ends of justice the way in which it is of use seems to be by diminishing the probability of misdecision to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side it being the interest of the judge to draw into his court as many suits as he can and the party on whom it depends whether the suit shall be instituted in one or other of the two courts being the plaintiff—he will in proportion to the quantity of emolument at stake be stimulated to exert his faculties in the endeavour to render justice in favour of that side   0 §   vices of established judicature how far the effect of design though of so many unjust rules and practices as the system of regular procedure teems with or rather is composed of there is not perhaps a single one that is not in some way or other directly or indirectly subservient to the actual and false ends of judicature—it would be an error to suppose that in every instance the mischief has been the fruit of design on the part of any one of the authors much less of a general concert official and professional the leading features having been traced by design—a large part perhaps in bulk the lugest may easily have been filled in by imbecility and indifference imbecility understand always relative imbecility was a natural consequence of the original choice made of the sinister ends to delude the other branches of the government and the people in the character of suitors it was necessary that the real mischief underneath should receive a covering of apparent good from something wearing the name of reason the nature of things not affording any good reason a bad one was to be fabricated but the same sinister interest that produced the fabrication of the bad reason on the part of one man in the character of judge produced the adoption of it on the part of his colleagues and successors and to adopt the bad reason with as little violence to conscience as might be it was necessary to take that course which is taken by all men under the influence of sinister interest viz to turn aside from all considerations tending to evince the absurdity of the doctrine—to pin down the attention to all considerations tending to conceal the absurdity from view when the practice is completely absurd and mischievous without a grain of utility among its effects the considerations tending to show the absurdity of it will be all the considerations belonging to the particular case in hand the considerations tending to conceal the absurdity of it will be those general considerations which for this sort of work compose the standing stock of instruments the great learning and venerable character of the prime author known or unknown—the difficulty of fathoming the depths of the science—the danger of forming a hasty conclusion from the superficial and partial appearances presented by a first view—the observation that when in consequence of any such hasty and incorrect views alterations have been made the mischief of the alteration and thence the wisdom of the preceding practice has been manifested by subsequent experience it is in this way that as in religion so in jurisprudence there is no absurdity so gross as not to have found its zealous and in a certain sense even its disinterested defenders for—howsoever the habit of false reasoning may have had at its origin the influence of sinister interest for its efficient cause—yet when once in train it is driven on by the vis inertiæ in the beaten track till at length it acquires an independent existence having lost all recollection of the impure source that gave it birth thus it is that in all that train of reasoning which exercises itself over the particular field in question—in all that quarter of the psychological frame a sort of local palsy establishes itself a habit of imbecility a distempered relish for the convenient absurdity a nausea for inconvenient truth this partial sort of mental palsy is not incompatible with an ordinary nor even with an extraordinary degree of strength in the other part of the mental frame the herculean mind of johnson driven to the confides of insanity by the veteres aviæ that had taken possession of his bosom in early youth laboured under a palsy of this kind and had lost the faculty of reasoning on certain topics connected with religion as may be seen in the hints given by his biographers alchymy judicial astrology judicature under technical procedure—under these names may be seen so many systems of profitseeking imposture alchymy the art of cheating men on pretence of making gold judicial astrology the art of cheating men on pretence of foretelling future events judicature under technical procedure the art of cheating men on pretence of administering justice that among alchymists and judicial astrologers there have been those who have been dupes to the impostures by which they profited cannot be doubted that among technical lawyers prejudice and the concealed workings of selfinterest have been productive of the like illusion is equally indubitable between the company of dupes and the fellowship of hypocrites who shall draw the line no one under omniscience and to what use would it be drawn to none whatever on the physical ground how often must the dupe and the impostor have been counted in one person—a dupe at the commencement of his career an impostor in the progress of it the same delusions by which he had been himself deceived would after the cloud was dissipated and when the jargon had become sufficiently familiar serve him for propagating the delusion to other minds thus on physical grounds and what is there that should render it otherwise on the moral neither on any of these grounds are the characters of dupe and impostor incapacitated from meeting in the same person at the same time the alchymist sells the art of making gold     what he knows is that as yet he is not himself in possession of that art what he is not yet satisfied of is that no other artist has ever been or has had any reasonable hope of being more fortunate the astrologer foretels future events—what he cannot but know is that the event has belied the predictions hazarded by him in former instances what it may be that he is not yet satisfied about is that the fault lies not in the artist but in the art what under the system of technical procedure the judge cannot but see is that the decisions he pronounces are frequently the course of procedure to which he sees the suitors confined is constantly in a state of repugnance to the ends of justice what it is possible he may not see is that this repugnance is the work of his predecessors in power and office—that it has not its root in the nature of things to the ends of justice from his first entrance upon the career he has never been accustomed to turn his eyes the objects the only objects towards which he has been accustomed to look with any degree of complacency are the principles and rules actually established established probably under the pretence possibly under the notion but whether pretence or notion certainly false of their being so many means conducive to the true ends of justice are they really thus conducive a proposition this which he has ever found it altogether easy and convenient to assume and take for granted not at all easy and altogether inconvenient to inquire into for appearing to regard them as being thus conducive as being practically necessary to the ends of justice he has as good a pretence and as towards the public a justification as heart can wish he has the unanimous certificate of all those who are generally supposed to know or to be capable of knowing anything about the matter that the decisions prescribed by the system he pursues are in abundance of instances repugnant to the direct ends of justice is a truth continually before his eyes what he does not see is that there exists any other system by the observance of which the frequency of such repugnance would be diminished how happens it that this better system is never seen by him because there would be no profit no pleasure nothing but difficulty and toil in looking for it no profit no pleasure nothing but shame and fear in finding it under his eye lies the natural the summary system in all its various branches in which such unjust decisions cannot but be incomparably less frequent since in them there are not any rules as in his system there are so many rules the effect of which as far as pursued is to render such injustice necessary there it lies under his eye but what is there that to any use with any reference to his own practice should engage him to bestow a glance upon it on what part could he turn his eyes that would not publish to him his own shame to sum up the result of the foregoing observations—what may be open to doubt is in what degree on this or that occasion this or that individual may have been actuated by a deliberate intention to sacrifice the ends of justice how much of the effect may have been produced by the direct and acknowledged operation of the sinister interest how much by the unperceived influence of a prejudice produced by the unperceived operation of that interest how much by honest blindness and negligence what does not admit of doubt is that supposing such to have been the views and wishes they could not by any other arrangements have been more fully accomplished than they have been by these existing ones §   recapitulation that the conclusions resulting though but in the way of corollaries from the above survey may be placed in a distinct point of view—a few propositions by way of recapitulation may in this place be not without their use   that—in so far as it has departed from the practice of the courts of natural procedure—the practice of the courts of technical procedure the practice of all the courts in the kingdom the above excepted is completely and radically unconducive and repugnant to the professed and supposed ends of their institution the ends of justice   that in the mind of the judges howsoever it might have been in the mind of the legislator so far as the legislator has interfered in the ordering of it it never has unless comparatively speaking of late years been directed to those ends   that the ends to which it has been directed have been the procurement of the maximum of profit combined with the maximum of ease immediately to the judges and intermediately to the several other classes of lawyers   that to the purpose of the collection of this profit lawyers all classes taken together with the judges at their head constitute a virtual partnership   that of this departure from the ends of justice the consequence is perpetual injustice injustice in every one of its shapes and in every one of them to a prodigious amount failure of justice and misdecision to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side misdecision to the prejudice of the defendants side vexation expense and delay all factitious and manufactured in prodigious quantities on both sides   that the judges of modern times—not     having had any concern in the forming of the system but taking it as they found it and being bound to pursue it throughout except in so far as any alteration may come to have been made in it by competent authority—reap the whole benefit of its depravity without incurring either reproach or danger and that though constantly occupied in the working of injustice in all its shapes they are not in that respect chargeable with criminality in any shape or with any the slightest misdemeanour the mischief they are continually occupied in doing being done not contrary to law but according to law   that in this perpetual fabrication of mischief and distribution of injustice there is nothing in any way inconsistent with that perfect purity and uncorruption which has so long been regarded as a characteristic and perhaps in the degree in which it is possessed the peculiar virtue of an english say also british judge the measure of profit regularly received by those judges according to law being probably greater than under the most corrupt administration of justice in any other country was ever received by judges of the like rank in the way of bribes and contrary to law   that being not only authorized but bound to pursue the course marked out by the established system as it is it would in the instance of any individual judge in so far as he keeps to that course be a question equally useless invidious and indeterminable how far in his own conception of the matter he pursues the ends of justice—how far if in any degree he pursues the established ends of judicature as above delineated   that—howsoever it may be to be regretted that in the midst of such a heap of abuse to which in one way or other conscious or unconscious they were continually adding—neither the whole order of judges nor one member of that order ever exhibited symptoms of any serious desire by their own authority or by application to the superior source of power to apply any considerable and efficient remedy yet in so much as no such obligation has ever been imposed upon them by any official oath or otherwise by any positive law the question whether on the score of such forbearance any blame even of the mere moral cast can justly attach to them for legal blame is altogether out of the question would be another question alike useless and invidious  0 that in so much as by any such interference every person in that high station would have more or less to suffer and no person in the way of ordinary interest anything to gain—the wonder that no such interference has ever hitherto taken place would be a wonder the expectation that such interference should ever generally take place would be an expectation repugnant to universal experience and common sense    that though in the legislative body there be power abundantly competent to a complete system of reform in this as in every other line of abuse yet inasmuch as on the part of any individual person within any more than without that body there exists neither obligation nor adequate inducement in any other shape either to propose any such system or any the smallest portion of it or ever to look into the actually existing system in any such point of view neither matter of blame nor matter of wonder on this score is to be found in the instance of any individual member of that supreme body any more than on the part of any member of the legally exalted though subordinate body above mentioned    that by no institution which should have for its professed object the propagation of vice could vice in three of its most pernicious shapes mendacity insincerity and injustice be more assiduously or successfully propagated than it is by and for the profit of the principal courts of justice and of what vices not those of which as in case of drunkenness pleasure is the sure and present pain but the future and contingent fruit but those of which pain present and future pure and unmixed evil is the result    that the practice of the courts of natural procedure is not subject in any respect to such imputation that in and by those courts should vice in any shape be manifested or propagated it never can be manifested or propagated—should injustice be ever committed it never can be committed—without exposing the delinquent to contingent punishment as well as to certain and immediate shame delinquency at the worst is comparatively rare and if punishment in case of delinquency be not there so certain as it might be the fault lies in the practice of those superior courts in and by which alone such punishment could be inflicted    that in the character of schools of absurdity the practice of the regular courts and the discourses by which under the name of reasons it is explained and defended exercise no less pernicious an influence over the public understanding than in the character of schools of vice they do over the public morals    that the practice of the courts of natural procedure is as free from absurdity as it is from vice    that against the malpractices committed by individuals under the system no tolerably efficacious remedy can be applied by the punishment of those individuals—that the root of the evil lies in the system itself—that     the mischief done by violation of the rules bears no proportion to the mischief done by the observance or under the sanction of the rules—and that under the system no malpractices ever were or ever can be committed which it has not been the tendency at least if not the object of the system to engender and to nurse—that any misbehaviour of the pupils is the fault immediately perhaps of the pupils but originally of the school—and that it results only from their having followed too closely and incautiously the sort of instruction they had received hence the injustice of imputing any especial or peculiar personal blame to this or that individual functionary on the score of his having on this or that occasion pursued the dictates of that sinister interest which the system itself in the state in which he found it planted in his breast the fault lies not in the individual not in any peculiar taint of improbity seated in the bosom of the individual but in the system itself—the system into which he enters and under which he acts amend the system you amend the individual render it his interest to pursue the ends of justice the ends of justice will be pursued the ends of judicature will be brought to a coincidence with the ends of justice hence also it may be inferred that the more powerful the sinister interest planted in every bosom without exception by the corruption of the system the more substantial is the merit the more brilliant in proportion as that merit is understood will be the glory of the few should any arise more than few there cannot be in whom the force of that sinister interest should have found a superior and opposite force strong enough to overpower it in vain would any individual of any of the classes in question exclaim you have thrown obloquy on the profession you have in as far as depended on you covered it with infamy and that infamy falls upon me however honest my character however irreproachable my conduct my answer is i have done no more than to state the strength of the temptation under which you act to state what is matter of history written upon the face of the system how weak if any the resistance which that temptation has experienced from those who have gone before you the task i have been labouring in according to the measure of my strength is no other than the sort of task which has been performed and with so much applause from the public by so many public committees and commissions under the authority of the state bringing to view the opposition that has taken place between the interest of the public in respect of the branch of administration in question on the one hand and the interest of the functionary on the other and the system of conduct to which to the prejudice of that branch of the public service that opposition of interest has given rise of the infamy not a particle can fall upon yourself but from your own choice confess the viciousness of the system or defend it confessing its viciousness—the greater its viciousness the greater your merit and your glory defend it if to you it appears defensible remembering always that by defending it you make it your own and that after your defence in whatsoever eyes the system will appear vicious after all and indefensible the viciousness of the system will be the ignominy of the advocate hence also the absurdity and mischievousness of any opinion which could call upon the author—upon any one who shall undertake the task he has undertaken to spare the system in consideration of the station of the persons acting under it to suppress truths of the first importance in consideration of any displeasure of which in such exalted breasts the doctrine may naturally be expected to be productive hence also supposing the existence of the sinister interest established the incongruity and absurdity of paying any regard to opinion mere general declaration of opinion as contradistinguished from argument delivered by any person acting and speaking under the impulse of a sinister interest of such mighty force separated from argument the value of such opinion will not be simply nothing but negative operating on the side opposite to that in favour of which it is delivered the more strenuously an existing arrangement is in this way defended the stronger the presumption afforded of its being beneficial to the administrators of this corrupt system which is as much as to say pernicious to the community at large the more strenuously any new arrangement proposed in the character of a remedy to the abuses of that corrupt system is opposed the stronger the presumption thereby afforded of its utility there is yet another circumstance by which the value of any opinions of this description if they had any would be diminished not to say done away in the quarter from which such opinions are supposed to come there exists of necessity the most thorough knowledge of all the matters of fact out of which just ground of defence in the one case of opposition and censure in the other case are capable of being made all the materials of defence that the subject furnishes—all these materials of defence if any such exist are constantly at your elbow the handling them turning them about and at a moments warning making application of them to any given purpose at command is the constant occupation of your whole life with so mighty     an advantage in respect of the materials for making an appropriate and proper defence if the nature of the case admits of any—do you notwithstanding betake yourself to generals and confine yourself to generals—to a sort of argument equally at the command of the best cause and the worst confining yourselves to such arguments you give judgment against yourselves chapter iv particular exemplifications of the vices introduced by the feegathering principle into technical judicature in the ensuing chapters the business will be to bring to view the principal devices constituting so many leading features of the technical or feegathering system of procedure in the character of effects produced by the operation of the sinister interest on the authors but before we proceed to the enumeration and delineation of these several features considered in a general way as produced by the operation of that corruptive principle it will serve for illustration as well as for proof if a view be given of the operation of the principle in particular instances—a particular portion of delay vexation and expense produced on a particular occasion on the part of the suitor through the medium of a particular rule or course of practice produced by a particular sum of money operating in the character of a principle of corruption on the bosom of the judge in whose decision and habits of procedure the practice took its rise in many of these instances to say no more as the practice itself so the mischief of it stole on at an imperceptible rate being therefore not the work of any one judge or judges to the exclusion of the rest the effect produced by the operation of the sinister interest is rather the preservation of the practice than the generation of it if so it be and surely it will not be otherwise that of those by whom the benefit of the abuse has been reaped no one can ever have failed to recognise the mischievousness of it the repugnancy of it to the ends of justice on the other hand neither is there any one who can have recognised in himself the author of it the benefit is enjoyed by all of opprobrium scarce a particle has ever yet been reflected by it upon any one i sham writs of error—kings bench an open delayshop exemplification the first— justice delayed by sham writs of error a sort of instrument whereby a party almost always a defendant against whom a judgment has been obtained in a court below appeals to a superior court alleging the erroneousness of such judgment number of causes so delayed by appeals called writs of error made to two courts viz to the

liar by whom the existence of it was asserted than to his injured adversary what is not certain speaking always upon the face of this account is that even of the    that were argued there was so much as one that was in the other case be it not supposed that from the difference between the number sued out and the number argued any interence can be drawn one way or the other concerning the probity and wisdom of judges—the proportion between cases of right decision and cases of misdicision—and the proportion between the number of the instances in which the losing party goes away satisfied and those in which he goes away dissatisfied with the conduct of the judge the    0 were almost all if not all of them so many cases in which there was no real question between the parties—cases in which the justice of the demand was no more a secret to him that resisted it than to him that made it the delayshop the injusticeshop stood open he went in and bought the goods because after paying the price there was a nett profit upon the purchase as little be it supposed that the £     forming the chiefjustices share of the price of the delay on the writ of error account was the whole of his profit upon the aggregate of the suits—the whole of the profit produced to him by this point of practice of these  00 suits in a year each yielding a writ of error for delay—but for the delay thus purchaseable perhaps not one would have come into existence in each of these instances the years delay yielded by the writ of error was preceded by a quantity perhaps upon an average about an equal quantity of delay manufactured in the course and by means of the suit to which the judgment thus appealed from professed to put an end if the suit by appeal had no question in it it was because the original suit had no question in it whether they would or would not have been defended and so kept up had it not been for the assurance of the twelvemonths delay after judgment—these  00 original suits were so many malâ fide suits malâ fide on the part of the defendant generated by the technical system so many suits that would not have had existence had the ends of judicature and the practice in conformity to these ends been in a state of conformity instead of repugnance to the ends of justice of all these   0  or these      suits if      costing probably not so little as £ 0 apiece not one that under the natural system of procedure in the hands of a court of conscience for instance or of a justice of peace would not at the cost of a few shillings or if thought better without any cost have received its termination in a few minutes instead of the half year or year for the single suit without the appeal or the one and a half year or two years for the double suit—original suit and suit of appeal together can it for a moment be supposed that anything but will is wanting for the extirpation of the abuse the remedy—is it not almost too obvious to be named without an apology for a general rule—the judgment being in favour of the plaintiff—notwithstanding the appeal let the judgment take its effect just as if there were no appeal security being found by the plaintiff for eventual restitution in case of reversal or modification according to the decision of the court above cases may be found in which the decision of the court below being executed and that decision erroneous the damage might be irreparable damage to person—a female delivered into the arms of a wrong husband a minor especially of the female sex delivered into the power of a wrong guardian

affectionis destroyed by malice or embezzled by concupiscence against these possibilities precautions would need to be taken but even though no such precautions were practicable and nothing could be more easily practicable—giving execution in the first instance to the decision of the court below would still afford a better chance for ultimate justice than would exist in the contrary case under the tardy pace of technical procedure everywhere what tolerably effectual provision is there against accidents thus deplorable be the judge who he may can there be more safety in ascribing corruption or culpable negligence to him than ordinary probity and diligence for if he be not either corrupt or incapable to a degree calling aloud for dismissal not to speak of punishment give him but the necessary power he will take effectual care that in case of the reversal or modification of his decision no irreparable damage shall take place thus upon general principles laying the scene anywhere

concourse of technical atoms the kings bench happens to stand above the common pleas but on this occasion or on any other who     ever supposed that a grain more or a grain less of confidence was due

the fate of so many other of their projects but as to this one it will meet us in another place† by giving to such and such a judge such and such sums of money a man who owes another so much money and knows it to be justly due may purchase with so much of his creditors money the delay of almost a year including the interest of the debt for that time besides other advantages yet this on their part is not bribery why because they are not punishable for it suppose for arguments sake they were punishable for it—in what respect and degree would the mischief of that act of theirs which then would be an offence be augmented by such punishment when lord bacon was punished for taking bribes his excuse was that though he made justice pay more than he ought to have done he never for money showed favour to injustice that for which so much money is regularly taken by these his successors is in every instance for favour shown to injustice—for money known to be the plaintiffs put by them into the

commonly happens that by the defendants first answer a need is produced of further questions under the name of amendments to the bill to this demand it may happen to present itself any number of times for it is only in this way that that security for correctness and completeness which is afforded by the faculty of grounding questions upon answers can be obtained at the end of a certain     number of months that security which in an examination vivâ voce as before a jury may be obtained in so many minutes the allowance of time on an amended bill is precisely the same as that on the original bill except that a third application is not allowed by every such set of amendments therefore a title is given to the defendant to purchase a further quantity of delay to the amount following—   allowance by regulation   days   more on first motion of course if it be a town cause      — — if a country cause       more on second motion of course      it has been decided that after two

paying the price it is as much at the command of him who has no just demand whatever for a moments delay as of him who has ever so just a demand for a delay of ever so great a length it is on this account that it is said as with the strictest propriety it may be said to be sold the case and the only case in which it is not sold is where a special case is made for extradelay on some special ground the supposed facts constitutive of the supposed ground are then brought before the court by motion not of course supported by evidence though in the incongruous shape of affidavit evidence with liberty on the other side to oppose with or without counterevidence in the same shape the judgment of the court is in that case exercised and whatsoever may be the fees received the term sale if here

regularly made by the subordinate judges in chancery called masters for the purpose of extracting correspondent fees in the court of chancery the masters are so many subordinate judges cleven in number by whom each of them sitting singly in his closer judicial decisions in great variety and to any degree of pecuniary importance are pronounced in the first instance the master is attended by the solicitors attorneys on both sides each attendance is preceded by a sort of summons or notice addressed by the master at the instance of the solicitor on one side to the solicitor on the other side this instrument is called a warrant and for each warrant the master receives a shilling a fee settled at a time when that sum was worth perhaps some number of times what it is now by a custom which is never departed from but of which the exact time of commencement is now inscrutable no real attendance ever takes place till after the third warrant‡ by an habitual connivance on the part of these subordinate dispensers of equity for the purpose of trebling the emolument lawfully receivable by them the quantity of delay is thus trebled to the suitors to the proportionable distress of the suitors on one or both sides according as the persuasion of the justice of a mans cause is entertained on one side only or on both for the more effectual attainment of the same ends the quantity of time bestowed by the master at any one attendance is never more than an hour but may be to any amount less on these several occasions what actually passes is no more to be known than what passes in the divan at constantinople but by whatever cause the custom of three warrants for an attendance was produced by the same cause of course the rate at which business is done when the partnership are ashamed or afraid to put it off any longer is regulated as often as the suit affords a party who by dishonesty or insolvency is engaged to seek delay here is an individual whose interest it is that on each attendance the quantity of business done shall be as small as possible and whether the suit affords any such party or no it affords two professional lawyers whose interest it is as well as that of the judge that this maximum of delay shall be produced here then exists a corrupt interest constantly acting upon a set of persons who are known to pay habitual obedience to it and who amongst them without the smallest danger of punishment or so much as shame have it completely in their power to put themselves in possession of the corrupt profit which that interest invites them to receive     go any day you please into westminster hall you may hear pompous eulogiums on the importance and essentiality of publicity in judicature but the occasions in which publicity has place are—what those in

cases whatever abuse cannot be fastened upon justice the absence of it is trumpeted forth with great ceremony regula generalis touching mischief—what you can do do and profit by what you can not do

darkness the less the demand for anything in the shape of a reasonable soul in the human flesh subsisting in such a state of things the natural course is that of that business that judicature which is said to be done by the master a great deal should be in reality performed by the clerk lawyer—what sir do you dare to insinuate anything to the prejudice of the learning the assiduity the sound

as i have been in use to hear anything about westminster hall or the inns of court which may now be somewhat above sixty years but perhaps if applied to any particular person nothing of all this would be found to be true and if there were any person in particular of whom i thought it true do you think you would catch me saying so indeed sir you would not my business is with genera and species to individuals i make my bow what makes the practice the more valuable in the character of an example is the smallness of the fee is it credible that a man in such high office receiving so many thousands ayear bearing so long a gown upon his shoulders and so venerable a mass of artificial hair upon his head indued consequently with so rich a stock of learning and virtue—that a man so gifted should ever in any single instance be content to do so much mischief for a few shillings is it in the nature of a man so to degrade himself whether in the nature of a man is a problem i leave to philosophers what is certain is that it is in the nature of an english judge a man—any man that ever breathed in such high office—do so much mischief for a few shillings—and that in the very teeth of common sense and common honesty and without the shadow of an excuse a man why they all do it and for a single shilling it is everydays practice and the chancellor and the master of the rolls their superiors know of their doing it see them doing it see them every day so far from stopping it did ever chancellor dead or living ever let fall so much as the slightest token of disapprobation at the process going forward perpetually under his nose how should he what sense is there in expecting he should would you have the husbandman turn up his nose at the rottenness of the manure that is giving fertility to

chancellor with its et cateras and their et cæteras—are not shillings the stuff it is composed of to this most highly and best rewarded of all lawyers the value of every office to which he has the nomination is in the direct ratio of the emolument it brings and in the inverse ratio of the qualifications it requires the less capacity it requires the more open it leaves his choice among his friends the more emolument it brings the more worthy it is of their acceptance not that the situation of these learned subordinates has been altogether matter of neglect to their still more highly learned and withal noble and honourable principals†     in the district called the rolls there is a chapel and in that chapel a catechism in which to the question—who is thy neighbour the answer is

every case of the kind were his lordship of that opinion he should think any order unnecessary and therefore improper when however he looked at the practice of the court for the last twentyfive years and considered that hundreds of orders of the kind had been made within that period he could not persuade himself that all of them had been granted for no earthly purpose but must suppose without such order that the right of the master to do what was here required did not exist his lordship therefore granted the order to the master subject to the masters exercising his own judgment having obtained the power to act whether the circumstances of the case rendered it necessary for him to do so every day or not the practice of the court then is so contrived if the account thus given of it be correct purposely so contrived that the master shall not have it in his power to make that distribution of his time which in the judgment of the only judge who with the power has the facts before him is conformable to the demands of justice by the sham warrants with their fees a regular system of delay is organized but from this regular delay by the motion for the de die in diem with its fees an exemption is always ready to be sold and what is it that at this price is purchased not any obligation on the subordinate judge but a licence only and pro hâc vice only to do justice here then we see a perpetual writ of injunction issued by the superior judge of the high court to his eleven subordinates prohibiting them from doing justice a prohibition on justice and to what end that as often as a partys impatience for justice is too strong for controul an attempt may be made to purchase it at the expense of an incidental suit carried on by affidavit evidence a suit which if needful shall for that once render it so far possible to do justice injustice established as a rule of practice to produce motion causes with their fees and such causes actually produced to the number of hundreds how many hundreds is not said in the course of fiveandtwenty years†   0 such being the pattern set at the metropolis it may be imagined whether imitation is in danger of being slack in the shade of a distant province on passing accounts before the court of grand sessions upon the chester division of the welsh circuits each side is to file its interrogatories with the registrar and to take out three warrants for the other side to be present at settling them six notices to produce the effect of one else on the third warrant the registrar proceeds ex parte august      is stated as the time at

little welsh equity court being a sort of dormouse that must generally sleep ten or eleven months of the year the great high court a sort of sloth which though at its own pace keeps on crawling almost the whole year round five or six times as much delay as in the grand warehouse of delay and yet not enough for the appetite of learned travellers without the extra portion attached to the sham

0s and perhaps there is no other defendant not appearing you are almost angry and to show you are in earnest you fee counsel to move for a larger sum taking care not to be too hard upon him—say £ 0 the same cause preserving inviolate on the part of the corporation the same principle of passive disobedience you are now quite angry and to show you are not to be trided with any longer you move a second time get your third distringas with your £ 0 worth of issues for that is the phrase in mr fowlers account of the practice of the court of exchequer equity side are to be found three original and highly instructive cases from which the above instruction was composed corporations squeezed—  corporation of bridgewater   eastindia company and   a free grammar school average quantity of delay sold between half a year and a year after which the cause was to begin profit to the partnership not discoverable care taken by the court in each case that the amount of the eventual mulet on the second order should not exceed £ 0 lest obedience to the second order should take away the pretence for the third in two out of the three cases a brace of writs were let off at a time thus in the exchequer equity side but at common law the art of dealing with corporations is not less completely understood the same care to avoid precipitation and the same tender caution not to bear too hard upon the corporation though it has no conscience a first and second time† a judge who with a wish to do justice possessed power suitable—can it be necessary to ask what in such a case he would do he would send for an acting member of the corporation the directing head the writing hand or any other what difficulty soever they might find in settling the matter among themselves there would be no more difficulty on the part of the judge in dealing with them than with any one of them in his individual capacity and what was not done in the exchequer among so many learned hands in six months could be done in half as many minutes v sham representations—scotland—court of session a delayshop—lord ordinary the shopkeeper exemplification the fifth— in scotland as everybody knows no fewer than fifteen judges are occupied in obstructing one anothers decision and frittering away one anothers responsibility all sitting in one court‡ as with most other functionaries so with judges in the calculation of common sense the chance of right decision is because responsibility is in the inverse ratio of the number     in french calculation in the direct ratio a thick quarto volume of calculations is built upon that ground in france sale of offices and amongst others of judicial offices was an object of revenue before she gave kings to england—drawn by necessity scotland clung to france french law shows through scotch law in a thousand places under this system of obstruction lest suits should get through too fast a sort of a turnpike was contrived with one of their lordships in quality of turnpike man to stop the cause and take toll of the suitors with the title of lord ordinary in no one sort of cause is he bound to give any decision in some he is not allowed in no cause is the suitor bound by his decision should he have been pleased to give one in some sort of causes the suit after regularly going up as regularly comes down again before anything can be done in it   the king of france with forty thousand men   went up the hill and then came down again this privilege of not judging does he frequently avail himself of it this would be worth knowing if this modesty is general the result is curious here is a court composed of fifteen judges each of them by his own acknowledgment unfit to be a judge what not take so much as a chance for giving satisfaction to the parties impose upon them purposely the most vexations lot that necessity can prescribe supposing you to have got a decision of his lordship called an interlocutor in your favour think you that a guess can be formed when the cause will terminate not it indeed after receiving a fortnights delay gratis your adversary gives in a representation and then the cause stops some time or other comes a second interlocutor adhering to the first stop again and so on without end on each such representation fee to his lordships clerk  s to the other members of the partnership other fees amount of each and number in the whole unascertainable seeing in the instance of masters warrants what the power of one shilling was in england an estimate may be formed of what even were this all the power of three may have been in scotland lawyers of all men are least given to the telling of tales out of school the quantity of abuse that transpires is as nothing in comparison with that which is kept close here and there by a momentary fit of pique or probity an incident comes to light in the picture above given is the character of scotch justice injured hear from her own worshippers first let us hear from mr russell how the matter stood in        it is a common device of defenders who want delay to suffer decreets to pass in absence against them and then to offer a representation to the lord ordinary praying to be heard in their defence by this shift the determination of causes is greatly postponed and much unnecessary trouble is given to the lord ordinary in reading representations which contain nothing material to the cause   the party who is dissatisfied with an interlocutor must offer a representation to the lord ordinary praying an alteration of the judgment within ten sederunt days amounting to a fortnight† of the signing of the interlocutor otherwise the interlocutor shall become final unless c   representation against decreets entirely in absence may be permitted at any time before extracting the decreet‡   the lord ordinary after reading the representation will either refuse the desire thereof or ordain the same to be answered by the other party either of which shall keep the matter open until a new interlocutor is pronounced∥ failing both it may thence be inferred the cause would be at an end a catastrophe of this sort does it ever happen if seldom the unfrequency of it is a proof of the constancy of his lordships vigilance how should there be any failure of that virtue the cause gone with it go the representations and the fees   every new interlocutor creates a fresh delay as it is competent to the party who thinks himself injured to offer a new representation within ten days a fortnight of the last interlocutor and there being no limitation as to the number of representations the occasions of delay are infinite when parties are litigious§ there being no limitation to the number of representations there is no limitation to the number of  s fees and there being no limitation to the number of his lordships fees there is no limitation to the extent of his lordships patience where is the virtue that may not be taught by money by money english judges are taught mendacity by money scotch judges are taught patience   if the lord ordinary after repeated representations shall continue to adhere to his former interlocutor the party who complains must either acquiesce or apply to the lords in the innerhouse by petition this in      one and thirty years after let us observe how the matter stood in     ¶       it is to be regretted says mr lawrie that there is no general rule of court limiting representations in point of number as a party who conceives himself hurt by the ordinarys judgment frequently brings an intolerable load of expense on his opponent and trouble on all concerned the party is he the author of the mischief what is the judge about all this while   sometimes says he again in order to accelerate the final decision and save trouble and expense to the parties the lord ordinary declares in his interlocutor inexorable justice that he will receive no more representations in which case if the party be dissatisfied with the judgment he ought to apply for redress to the innerhouse in practice however such declaration is too often disregarded amiable weakness more representations being given in notwithstanding the prohibition by which means the salutary ends which the judge has in view are often entirely disappointed thus it is that under the feegathering system the virtue of judges is continually set at nought by the wickedness of suitors observe that to prevent the mischief altogether all that his lordship has to do is to abstain from violating his own solemn engagements that to this purpose no positive act whatever is necessary for that if his perfidy slumbers but for a moment the cause with its fees is at an end all that he has to do is to abstain from travelling any further in that track of corruption into which perhaps in no other country certainly not in england has any judge the effrontery so much as to make a footstep of the statement thus given by the institutionalist one is at a loss to know what to think is it serious is it irony is he a party to the hypocrisy or a dupe to it the fee which is treble to that by which the probity of english masters in chancery has been so long subdued is far i have already observed from being the whole of the force by which that of the scotch judges has been kept in the state we see as to making out a complete account of it i have already acknowledged the impracticability of it the greater the number of shillings the more irresistible the temptation the better the excuse let us pick up a few more   if the representation be ordered to be answered at the bar it is the business of the other party to enrol the cause in the ordinarys first handroll     to his lordships clerk for every enrolment in the handroll fee  s†  0 but if the order be simply to answer the representation which is the most usual deliverance the other party must give in a written answer within the time limited by the interlocutor if any time be specified‡ at giving in this answer or any other paper in a cause appointed by the lord ordinary fee to his lordships clerk  s∥ let us now hear mr bell official lecturer on conveyancing in his system of deeds vol vi exhibiting instruments of procedure— when a judgment is pronounced by the lord ordinary the cause must then proceed as before by representation and petition but where memorials or informations are appointed to be given in it will most probably happen that the one party is more anxious than the other to bring the cause to a conclusion i e the plaintiff to receive his money than the defendant to part with it and of course to force in the memorial or information this is to be done only by preparing the memorial on the part of the client and by enrolling the cause and praying the lord ordinary to appoint the opposite party to lodge their memorial the lord ordinary will of course renew the order against next calling but in all probability several such enrolments value of each  s will take place before the order be made peremptory or under a fine in short this is a situation in which it is almost impossible to force forward the cause the only remedy you have is by constant enrolment application of  s fees in that shape and by strong representations application of similar fees in that other shape to the lord ordinary of the necessity of dispatch to obtain an order that will force in the paper called for and with it a last  s fee the judge takes payment for making delay and the more delay he makes the oftener he is paid and to this traffic there are no limits is it to be wondered at that scotch suits are longer still than english ones compare this case with the preceding one between them the partnership have a dilemma and such a one that on one or other horn they are sure to catch you is it delay you want to buy there it is for you and welcome at a fixed price is it dispatch you want there is delay for you instead of it the higher you pay for your dispatch the more delay you have for your money and so it goes on till shame or fear cries out to them the measure is full it is time to be in earnest a pretty task is that allotted to the suitor to ply the judge with fees till his lordship is tired of receiving them two courts through which almost every cause at least every cause worth retaining     is doomed to travel one in which his single lordship would not get on if he could the other in which their whole lordships could not get on if they would it is not enough for them to be themselves delayers they must moreover be the cause of delay in other men scotland is fortunate enough to be provided with a system of local courts competent to the task of rendering prompt and unexpensive justice to every man at his own home unfortunate enough to see in the two so closely intertwined branches of this supreme court the power and the will to nip in the bud that incipient advantage of their joint activity no inconsiderable portion is employed in paralyzing the salutary action of the interior courts one merit which in comparison with english is peculiar to scotch lawyers—they do not plaster over the foulness of their system with enlogistic daubings they acknowledge—at least there are some among them that acknowledge their need of amendment such is their humility they are willing to draw it from the fountain that flows on the other side of the tweed and their southern brethern such is their liberality are ready with their ink to blanch the northern ebony when abuse is the plant the pruningknife not the pickaxe is the instrument employed by jurisprudential husbandry when you see the lawyer bustling and a twig or two cut off be sure that the patience of the nonlawyer is exhausted or threatens soon to be once in half a century or so the legislator awakes from his trance and then something is to be done at other times his dealing with the man of law is that of the young spendthrift heir with his steward or his winemerchant the fellow is a rogue and cheats me but rather than be at the pains of overhauling his account ill een set my name to it as usual and there is an end of it the real nature of the representation trade was it a secret to the traders without staying for the answer of common sense let us look to history in a particular case specified so long ago as in      representations were forbidden† in this case they were taken away altogether in other cases mr russell who ever and anon is a reformer suggested that the number of them be limited limit the number of representations when you have done that reduce the number of masters warrants from three to two or the number of common bail or of pledges of prosecution from two to one‡ discard poor mr doe and leave his friend mr roe to pine in solitude such are the reforms of lawyers ask an english judge how many representations he thinks ought to be allowed or what to him is the same question how many his law allows he will answer you when a scotch judge has informed you how many common bail or how many pledges of prosecution he looks upon as necessary what is above is but a sample let it not be imagined that the above manifestations of the influence of the principle of corruption are all that could be found let it not be imagined that they are the hundredth part let it not be imagined that they are even the grossest manifestations why then employed to the exclusion of others partly by accident for the labour of a complete survey would have been too great partly as being more intelligible ransack the whole system of procedure—travel through it from beginning to end—you will find it throughout of the same complexion owing its birth to the same causes maximum of profit to the partnership the main and constant end maximum of ease the collateral end minimum of expense delay and vexation to the suitor the pretended—maximum the real—object pursued in the character of an intermediate object conducive to the main end misdecision and failure of justice knowingly produced not for their own sake nor therefore constantly but whenever they presented themselves as conducive to the above intermediate end and thence onwards to the ultimate the ends of justice the true and legitimate ends of judicature pursued so far and so far only as seems necessary to keep the people in the character of suitors     in a state of patience and keep the talons of depredation covered by the cloak of justice such being the interest—such the wishes and endeavours generated by these interests—what were the means employed by them it remains that an answer be given to that question by a brief indication of the principal devices employed by the feegathering system for the attainment of these ends chapter v list of the devices employed under the feegathering system for promoting the ends of established judicature at the expense of the ends of justice thus much as to the sinister interest operating on judges under the existing system of procedure and the ends pursued in consequence the actual ends of judicature not coinciding with but opposite to the ends of justice in the pursuit of these ends a variety of devices have been employed it may be of use to bring to view a list or at least a sample of these devices the rather since at the head of the list it will be necessary to place an instance of exclusion a sweeping operation in which evidence and of the best and most necessary sort is comprehended—evidence which in most cases constitutes the most instructive part of the whole mass there will be a convenience in seeing the list of these engines of iniquity in one view for enabling the reader to enter into the conception of them a variety of expressions have been employed where one fails another may answer the purpose not having been noticed at least sufficiently noticed they have never as yet been named   exclusion of the parties from the presence of the judge—parties not heard—decision given without hearing the parties—audience refused to suitors either throughout the cause or till the end of it   tribunals out of reach—the county courts swallowed up by the metropolitan courts   sittings interrupted interrupted by long and fixed intervals terms—circuits—days fixed for each step in a cause   operations without thought—decisions pronounced judgments rules orders delivered by subordinate officers without the privity of the judge judicature upon mechanical principles—principle of mechanical judicature   decision without evidence or on evidence delivered in under a mendacitylicence—under a general licence given by the judge for the admission of false evidence   pleading and more especially special pleading   principle of nullification—decision on grounds foreign to the merits—decision by quirks and quibbles   principle of fiction in all its various branches—the habit of giving from the bench lies for reasons—of telling lies to entrap and fleece the parties—of encouraging parties to tell lies—of compelling parties to tell lies—of punishing parties for not telling lies—of encouraging jurors and even compelling them by torture to commit perjury   principle of jargon jargonization or technical language—perversion of language to the purpose of securing ignorance and misconception of the law on the part of the people—setting and keeping up a cant or flash language to serve the ends of judicature  0 double fountain principle    eulogization puffing of jurisprudential law    multiplication of offices on the subject of the several articles comprised in this list several observations applicable to them in common present themselves as having a claim to notice—   there is not one of them that has any place in any of the courts above distinguished by the name of courts of natural procedure   there is not one of them that has not place in the several courts above distinguished by the name of courts of technical procedure   they consequently form so many characteristic differences by which on the one hand the courts of natural procedure on the other hand the courts of technical procedure may be distinguished from each other   in proportion as the institution of them respectively is found to be repagnant to the several ends of justice one more or all of them together which in the case of every one of these devices will be found to be actually the case they will serve to bring to view and demonstrate the existence of so many virtues in the natural so many vices in the technical system characterizing the natural system by their absence the technical system by their presence—so many vices and as being the result and product of great labour carried on by generation after generation from age to age and under the impulse of a sinister interest created by the feegathering system so many abuses   they will form so many topics for the exercise of the ingenuity and eloquence of the advocates of the technical system—for the professional advocate the official judge the official lecturer or general institutionalist the unofficial compiler or particular institutionalist under each head a perpetual invitation is given to all these learned persons in any     court of natural procedure has it any place of the courts of technical procedure is there any one in which it has not a place is it not more or less conducive to the mischief opposite at least to some one of the ends of justice—delay or expense for example or both can you make it appear that to any other of the ends of justice it is in any preponderant degree or so much as in any degree conducive here is so much delay from it here is so much expense from it here is so much vexation from it—now where is the use of it in this plain speech—not too plain for the plainest man to put or to comprehend—they will feel the spear of ithuriel touch them with it one after another the unclean spirit will stand confessed of these there are few which have not place in common in every civilized country in which the technical system is established that is in every civilized country on the face of the globe of the whole list of them however no inconsiderable part will be found peculiar either in toto or in degree to that modification of it which is established in england some articles peculiar in toto many more peculiar in respect of the degree in which they have place in this country as compared with others devices peculiar in toto are—  the distinction between law courts and equity courts   the habit of eulogizing jurisprudential law at the expense of statutory sham law at the expense of real under the head of devices peculiar in degree will be found perhaps more at any rate the following viz—   tribunals out of reach   sittings at long and fixed intervals   principle and practice of nullification   jargon under its several modifications   fiction or mendacious reasons   the use made of the double fountain principle   motion business including the business of incidental motions original motions and motions of course chapter vi first device—exclusion of the parties from the presence of the judge §   mischiefs of the exclusion in the exclusion put upon the parties may be seen the masterdevice the sine quâ non of the whole system to this as to the centre may all the others be referred their office being in each instance to give either birth continuance or effect to it by exclusion of the parties from the presence of the judge must here be understood exclusion of their allegations in the character of testimony applicable to the purpose of grounding a decision giving termination to the suit an express exclusion put upon their persons would have been too flagrantly odious and more than was necessary to the purpose it was done by so ordering matters that a party should have nothing at all to gain by attendance while he had as much as possible to suffer and to lose nothing at all to gain when he could neither gain credit for any testimony of his own not extract any testimony from the lips of his antagonist nor so much as comprehend through the jargon in which it had for this purpose been enveloped what had been done or was intended to be done much to suffer partly from the natural causes of vexation expense and delay the unavoidable concomitants of judicial attendance but a great deal more by the arrangements that had been established for the purpose of wearing out his patience rendering the burden of attendance intolerable and thus forcing him into the arms of the paupers and dependants of the judge the professional substitutes and assistants† it is in virtue of this commanding feature that a glance however rapid over the whole expanse of the technical system became so indispensable a part of the present work exclusion of parties is exclusion of witnesses—of the persons in whose instance an acquaintance more or less intimate with the mass of facts pertaining to the cause or at least with some of them is matter of course and that acquaintance frequently most intimate     not unfrequently peculiar—the cause affording no other witnesses under the technical system the ends of judicature being throughout in opposition to the ends of justice—to bring to view the several ways in which the appearance of the parties in the presence of one another and of the judge or where that cannot be at any rate of the judge is subservient to the ends of justice is to show in other words the several ways in which it is adverse to the ends of judicature so many services which it is in the nature of this meeting to render to justice so many considerations by which the authors of the technical system were called upon to oppose an inexorable bar to it at any price as also on the other hand so many considerations by which the legislator in proportion as justice is the object of his regard will feel himself called upon to rid the country of a system by which the dictates of justice are thus trodden under foot in the most common and natural state of things both suitors will at least in the outset of the cause find themselves together in the presence of the judge what other arrangement so natural whom should the judge hear if not the parties and if either why not the other and were it only that time may not be wasted at the same time in this case the meeting is tripartite parties to it the two suitors the plaintiff the defendant and the judge tripartite taking the judge into the account bipartite and reciprocal as between the suitors cases however are not wanting in which either in a physical or in a prudential sense the reciprocity is impracticable then comes a meeting bipartite a hearing ex parte when the party is not present his presence may either remain altogether unsupplied or supplied in so far as it is capable thus to be supplied by an agent or substitute private† or professional‡ or both in the character of a party the suitor if he be present appears necessarily and of course in the character of a witness he may appear or not as it may happen according as it happens or not that a fact or facts having an influence on the fate of the suit had or had not fallen under his cognizance saving always the case of impracticability physical or prudential—justice presents a constant demand for the presence of each suitor on two opposite accounts on his own account that of the facts arguments and demands which the cause is susceptible of and he capable of adducing such part may be brought forward as tend in favour of his side of it on the account of his adversary that the adversary may on his part be in possession of his share of the same advantages in the character of a witness the suitor may present himself either as an immediate or as a nonimmediate witness if as a nonimmediate witness it will then be merely as giving indication of some other source of evidence real oral or written some being whether belonging to the class of persons or of things from whom or from which evidence fit to serve in the character of immediate or say ultimatelyemployable evidence may it is supposed be extracted in any case the supposed ulterior source of evidence thus referred to may either be determinate known to the suitor as qualified to serve in that character or hypothetical and indeterminate from what of his own knowledge he knows of the nature of the case taking into account the circumstance of place and time he supposes with a degree of persuasion more or less intense that from a person or a thing of such or such a description evidence pertinent to the cause in hand may be to be obtained presenting himself or presented in the character of a witness—the facts which a party will be most ready and most sure to bring to light will be such facts as in his view of the matter promise to be of service to his side of the cause in respect of these his evidence is selfserving and will naturally be spontaneous facts seen to be of the opposite tendency if they come out at all will scarcely come out but on demand made by the adverse party or the judge in a word but by interrogatories in respect of these his evidence will be selfdisserving∥     i facienda by the plaintiff functions for the performance of which the presence of the plaintiff is or may be requisite—   to state the nature of his

purposes viz   to discard any such articles as were it not for such concert might in reality or appearance be necessary to the parties having in contemplation to produce them respectively but by virtue of such concert and mutual explanation may be rendered unnecessary   when this or that article of evidence is so circumstanced that the production of it threatens to be attended with delay expense and vexation to any considerable amount—to take measures in concert for reducing to its minimum that mass of collateral inconvenience   where the quantum of the inconvenience appears to be to such a degree considerable as to outweigh either the value of the evidence in the character of a security against misdecision or even the mischief of misdecision though on the exclusion of the evidence it were seen to be a certain consequence—an exclusion may accordingly be put upon that article of evidence an exclusion to wit either definitive or provisional as the case may require†   where by the influence of any cause or causes of complication any ulterior meeting or meetings have been made requisite—to concur with the judge in the fixation of such time or times as shall be productive of least delay expense and vexation regard being had to the convenience of both parties as also of the suitors in other causes depending before the same judge to the uses attached to the functions which by this means the parties are in the most advantageous mode enabled and obliged to perform enabled each for his own benefit or obliged each for that of his adversary may here be added an advantage which consists not in anything that either of them does but in the situation in which each of them finds himself i speak of that which places him in the presence of the judge and commonly except where special circumstances afford special reasons to the contrary in the presence of a more or less numerous and miscellaneous auditory bringing thereby to bear against each party in case of malpractice or insincerity on his part that sense of shame which is so powerful a preservative against any the slightest deviation from the line of rectitude and of which in the solitude of the closet the force is as nothing in comparison with that which it derives from society especially from society so composed the use here in question is over and above that which consists in the partys being personally responsible for every breach of sincerity or probity committed on his side of the cause such responsibility might be made and is made‡ to attach upon him without his ever finding himself in the presence either of the adverse party or of the judge the check here in question is that which is applied to a man by the consciousness that in the event of a present detection or wellgrounded suspicion of any impropriety of speech or conduct on his part the stain thereby made on his reputation will be witnessed by a number of persons more or less considerable in which his adversary and the judge will at any rate be included the adversary whose triumphant eye and the judge whose reproving eye his own humiliated and suffering eye will have to encounter on the spot∥     of all the above modes of turning to account the presence of the parties there is not one that is not the obvious result of the plainest common sense not one that is not wherever the nature of the case admits of it subservient to all the ends of justice not one of them the use of which in that character is not felt in the courts of natural procedure according to the nature of the causes of which those sanctuaries of justice are respectively permitted to take cognizance but by so many points as this arrangement is subservient to the ends of justice by so many is it adverse to the established ends of judicature accordingly the opposite arrangement the exclusion of the parties constitutes the basis of every system of technical procedure wheresoever established and howsoever modified all the other devices presuppose this and serve but to improve the advantage gained by it in whatever court this basis of all justice has been restored or suffered to remain the best evidence so far as it applies takes place and besides furnishing such lights as frequently are not to be had from any other quarter saves the vexation expense and delay attached to the production of inferior evidence and the cause receives the very speediest as well as least expensive and in every way least vexatious conclusion which the nature of it admits even when ulterior evidence is ultimately necessary by the preliminary meeting much vexation and expense is saved in the exhibition of it under the technical system for want of the necessary preliminary explanations each party finds himself generally speaking under the obligation of having in readiness by a particular day and hour every article of evidence how vast soever may be the expense which it is supposed can by any possibility be sound necessary or so much as rendered serviceable under the arrangement proposed not only in respect of this or that individual article of evidence is the delay vexation and expense saved that would have been produced by the exhibition of it but without any the smallest prejudice to the direct ends of justice needless evidence with the delay vexation and expense attached to the exhibition of it is shovelled out in whole masses as for example—   whenever the burthen of delay vexation and expense attached to the collection of the evidence constitutes an object worth regarding—if any point of law is in question the collection may on both sides be postponed till after the determination of the point of law for suppose the point of law given for example against the plaintiff all evidence as well on his side as on the other side will be altogether useless   in like manner where on the defendants side the burthen threatens to swell to a certain amount the collection may on that side be postponed till after the plaintiffs evidence has been collected and provisionally pronounced upon for if the plaintiff fails in making out his case it is needless to put the defendant to the trouble of making out his neither party it may seem at first sight ought to be present without the other no ex parte appearance previous to their simultaneous appearance supposing this to be the case the simultaneous appearance will be the first step in the cause after the delivery of the summonses by which it is brought about but in some cases it may not be right that the defendant should be subjected to the vexation of attendance until the primâ facie justice of the demand has been so far established as it can be by the examination of the plaintiff in these cases it is for the advantage of the defendant that the plaintiff should be heard without him and before him and consequently out of his presence again in some cases it may be necessary for security to apprehend the person of the defendant without warning and by that means at some casual and unforeseeable time and place in all such cases the ends of justice require as peremptorily as the ends of judicature have forbidden that without loss of time and it possible antecedently to his being inclosed within the walls of any prison ordinary or extraordinary he be conducted into the presence of the judge† in     these cases it is only by an accident and that a rare one that the plaintiff can be there exactly at that same time here then it is for the advantage of the defendant to be heard out of the presence of the plaintiff again on the part of the plaintiff the obligation of personal appearance is attended with a degree of vexation which when without preponderant vexation it can be saved ought to be saved besides that the fulfilment of the obligation will in some cases be physically in others prudentially impracticable here then comes in the consideration in what cases—antecedently to the issuing of the summons commanding or the warrant for compelling by physical means the attenddance of the defendant—a succedaneous security shall be accepted at the hands of the plaintiff in lieu of that which would have been afforded by his preliminary attendance at the judgmentseat and examination by the judge here again comes in the question in what cases examination in writing ought to be employed in aid or provisionally in lieu of examination vivâ voce reciprocal or ex parte by and before the judge i say provisionally and never definitively and exclusively as in the case of the answers extracted from defendants in equity practice under the assurance of never being subjected to the other more efficient mode so again in what cases the reciprocal examination incidental to the meeting of the parties in the presence of the same judge shall give place to a reciprocal ex parte examination viz of the plaintiff before one judge of the defendant before another whose seat may be at the antipodes obvious enough these several considerations to those whose views are directed to the ends of justice to men of law they will be apt many of them to appear new as not being conducive to the ends of judicature they are here glanced at as being necessary to fit up the natural system for performing not what is performed but what is pretended or supposed to be without being performed by the technical §   uses of the exclusion to judge  co use   making business i e profit by forcing the suitor into the hands of professional lawyers assistants substitutes linked with the judge himself in a virtual partnership in the mode

production of it in shapes more expensive and more profitable to the partnership more profitable to the parties more expensive   making business by giving birth to erroneous decisions grounded on incorrect or incomplete masses of evidence which decisions give birth to ulterior suits seeking relief in ulterior and bettergrounded decision   making business by exempting on each occasion the party in the wrong from that sensation of shame which at the moment of detection especially if in the presence of a miscellaneous mass of bystanders as well as of the judge attaches itself upon selfconscious and detected falsehood or injustice opening the door to whatever falsehoods and frauds present themselves as promising to serve the purpose of the cause or of the moment and thereby to demands and defences and thence to suits which but for the assurance of being able to employ to advantage such falsehoods and frauds would not have had existence   making ease without prejudice to profit by exempting himself from the plague and indignity of having to do with low people with the mob the rabble the populace—i e the great majority of the people wretches who being ignorant of things in general and of jurisprudential science in particular are in proportion to their ignorance apt to be troublesome       giving to the partnership or at any rate to the judge and his younger brother the advocate the profit of inhumanity—of inhumanity to any extent clear of the opprobrium that otherwise would attach upon it were the debtor and creditor both in court in the presence of each other and the judge shame would every now and then prevent him from extorting in the shape of fees the pittance which if not left to the debtor in the name of humanity should have been delivered to the perhaps equally distressed perhaps still more grievously distressed creditor in the name of justice   giving to the partnership or at any rate to the judge and to the advocate the profit of inhumanity clear of any pain of sympathy that might otherwise be exerted by the spectacle of distress in the bosom of him for whose benefit it has been produced often does the unlearned judge the country magistrate give up his trifling retribution why because the distress of which the exaction of it would be productive is before his eyes who ever heard of fees given up by the learned and ermined magistracy of the profits drawn by them in such copious draughts from the extremity of distress a great part perhaps the greater is never set down to their account it is sunk in the pocket of some officer and the profit to the judge is from the sale or what is equivalent to the sale of the office even of that part which finds its way directly into his coffers care has been taken that the individual contributors with their respective distresses shall be as completely unknown to him as if the scene of them were at the antipodes what the eye does not see the heart does not rue nowhere has the truth and value of this proverb been more fully understood and more completely profited by than in the great hall at westminster hence the miseries and iniquities of which the english system of imprisonment for debt is composed†—a mass of abomination not to be matched in any other clime a source of profit as religiously protected as it has been elaborately organized—have ever found as much sympathy in the stones of which the pavement is composed as in the bosoms of those who walk upon it misery in abundance but the heart never rues it care having been taken and that so effectually that the eye shall never see it in the division made of the labour among the members of the partnership all this opprobrium and whatsoever may be supposed to be realized of this pain of sympathy lies on the shoulders of the attorney his inferior share of the aggregate profit comes to him loaded with this incommodious drawback the superior share of the authors of the system—the judge and the advocate—drops into their learned laps free from all incumbrance   giving the necessary support or increased effect to the several ulterior device of which in their order and in particular to the practice of decision without evidence and without thought to the principle of nullification to the use of written pleadings with the benefit of the mendacitylicence to the chicaneries about notice to motion business to the entanglement of jurisdiction as between law and equity courts and to the opinion trade‡     chapter vii second device—tribunals out of reach or swallowing up the inferior courts if justice he necessary in one place it is little less so in any other if justice be necessary to one set of men it is little less so to another so obvious is this truth that upon the first settlement of every country judges with competent authority distributed all over the country in courts under some denomination or other as little distant from each other and thence as numerous as the state of the country in respect of wealth and population will admit are under the natural system an obvious and general arrangement to disturb it requires as under the feegathering system power perverted by the impulse of sinister interest to private purposes in every country in which the technical system has established itself—in every country to an extent commensurate with the power possessed under that system by the superior courts established as they naturally would be at the fountainhead of power as close as possible to the ear of the sovereign—to strip the local distant and consequently inferior and weaker courts of as much of their jurisdiction as was possible has of course been the constant aim of the superior the metropolitan courts but in no country have the enterprises of this most cruel species of robbery been so successful as in england not to speak of byecourts established for particular purposes—not only before but for ages after the norman conquest every county every hundred had its court sitting for general purposes if in any place justice be necessary in respect of any one sort of cause in that same place justice cannot be much otherwise than necessary in respect of every other sort of cause if then of a court sitting in any district a hundred for example the whole time be not taken up by causes of a particular description nature and utility combine in giving to or rather in not taking from that same court the power of administering justice in causes of every other description to so simple an arrangement limitations may be made by power actuated by sinister interest or caprice but cannot unless for some very cogent and not at all obvious reason be warranted by utility and justice between jurisdiction and jurisdiction geographical lines of demarcation are prescribed by utility rising to the degree of necessity metaphysical lines of demarcation except in here and there a particular case indicated by special circumstances are the result of a compromise between rapacity and rapacity fighting in the dark under the natural system of zoological economy spider devours spider for want of flies under the technical system of procedure judge give him time and power swallows up judge if the hundred court—if even the county court once so efficient and so exalted in power and dignity with its carl and its bishop its temporal judge and its spiritual judge can still be said to have existence it is scarce otherwise than in name it is as the shell of the fly which after having been sucked by the spider is sometimes seen flittering in the web in a general point of view the cause of this voracity is as obvious as the fact is notorious as to the details of the operation and how it happened that the success of the enterprise was so much more complete in england than anywhere else—the investigation would be curious but here there is not sufficient space for it and if not history for history requires honesty materials at least for history are not wanting in the books of the mischiefs resulting from this distinction little need be said on the one hand anarchy failure of justice the equivalent of constant misdecision     to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side—on the other hand factitious delay expense and vexation and in general with an increased chance of misdecision to the prejudice of either side from extinction of local courts comes enlargement of the geographical field of jurisdiction of their devourers the metropolitan courts thence increased length of journeys and of demurrage—obvious and irremediable causes of increased delay vexation and expense in each several instance the burthen sustained is it sustained by both parties—then comes the collateral inconvenience does the plaintiff that is the injured individual who but for the abuse would have been plaintiff sink under it—then comes the failure of justice is if the defendant who sinks under the burthen—then comes misdecision to the prejudice of the defendants side a mischief on that side correspondent and not inferior to the mischief of failure of justice on the plaintiffs side if the mischiefs of this devastation are obvious and incontestable the advantages aimed at and reaped by the authors are no less so   making increase of business of the whole number of causes that would have gone to the local and little district courts it was but a part indeed and that a small part that could find its way to their metropolitan devourers the remainder would evaporate in the shape of failure of justice but no grain of profit was too minute to be stooped for nor any mischief too great a price to be paid for that minimum of profit witness the shillings the splendid shillings the price of delay under english equity witness other delays without number with their respective purchasemoneys   making pretences and means for the exclusion gradually put upon the parties in all cases the more remote the province the more intolerable the vexation of journeys and demurrage to and from the head seat of judicature especially in a state of society which afforded neither roads nor carriages nor inns nor lodginghouses nor security against robbers but the more intolerable the burthen of attendance the more anxious the solicitude to obtain permission for the employing of professional substitutes who when once admitted for the relief of distant suitors soon found means to render it as impracticable to suitors to do their business in westminister hall without the help of lawyers as it is to stockholders to make transfers at the bank without the help of brokers besides it would be a hardship to send to a man at the lands end to come and be heard at wesminister therefore so it would to send to a man in palaceyard or to put a question to him in court if he is there already this logic impresses conviction on learned minds to come and he heard is the greatest of all hardships to a man understand if it is about business of his own for if it is a business in which he has no interest he being but a witness there is no hardship or at least none worth thinking about without this advantage the other would in comparison have been little worth the system of procedure pursued would have been the natural system and under that system business is scarce worth having   saving technical judicature from the odium of comparison by the extinction of natural judicature this advantage came in gradually as the technical system with its everincreasing mass of delay vexation and expense took place of the natural in the superior courts in the local courts the mode of procedure would of course continue if not purely natural at any rate in comparison undilatory unvexatious unexpensive† the motives being so strong and power being adequate means could not be deficient the mode was the only object that presented itself to reflection or choice in the choice there was no difficulty make the recourse of the suitor that is of the plaintiff to the local courts vain and useless productive of nothing but vexation and expense—he will either sink under the injury without seeking for justice anywhere or he will seek for it in the great courts removal in all its shapes proffered itself and was accepted for this disastrous service make the burthen of attendance in the great courts intolerable the suitors on both sides will fly for relief into the arms of their natural enemies the professional members of the lawpartnership raised up to bring in custom by the head and most active partner the judge john poor and thomas rich live both in cornwall rich is able to bear the charge of journey and demurrage to london poor not from the cornish courts a defendant has the power of removing the cause to the london courts what chance has poor for justice against rich none whatever rich removes the cause from london and poor gets his labour for his pains     in this way nineteen injuries perhaps out of twenty are shut out from remedy who cares judge and co get their profit out of the twentieth the indigent of all classes are thus reduced to a sort of slavery under the opulent nineteen persons put out of the protection of the law that two may be squeezed by and for the benefit of the lawyers removal is either absolute or not without leave leave viz of the court ad quam the court into which the removal is proposed to be made obligation of applying for leave is in appearance a security against oppression—in reality an aggravation of it a cause tried to know whether another cause should be commenced the yoke doubled on pretence of lightening it under the feegathering system sham securities of this sort are as easy to find as it is difficult to find real ones the prime security is the appearance of the parties at the outset coram judice and to bereave the suitor of that security nothing that power and industry could do has been left unemployed in general and after allowance made for a few narrow exceptions† there can be no sufficient reason for taking any sort of cause out of the jurisdiction of the local court in any other way than by appeal if there were any such reason what should it be value of the matter in dispute too great to be entrusted to such inferior and comparatively untrustworthy hands but the remedy and the sufficient remedy lies in appeal not in refusal of cognizance when the party who knows the circumstances of the cause and against whom the decision is sees no reason to be dissatisfied with it—is it for the legislator or the superior judge who knows nothing about the individual cause—is it for these strangers to be dissatisfied with it from whence is it concluded that the judge is unfit to be trusted with a sum above the mark—he whose fitness for judging of all sums up to the mark is assumed by delay it is true injustice equal to any producible by misdecision—equal and even superior since to the mischief of antecedent delay vexation and expense may come to be superadded the mischief of ultimate misdecision—injustice especially to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side may come to be produced and to this mischief an appeal which supposes decision applies no remedy but though it lies not within the reach of that same remedy neither is injustice by delay any more than injustice by decision without its remedies nor are those remedies less efficient in this than in that other case chapter viii third device—bandying the cause from court to court appeals and removals have no place but by the act or with the concurrence of a party in the cause the sort of transfer here in question requires no such concurrence nor any spontaneous act on the part of anybody at a particular stage of the cause it takes place as it were of itself and without any fresh expenditure of human will or reason it takes place as in a piece of clockwork sound succeeds sound by a preestablished harmony among the parts of the machine of this species of transmission the possible modifications are plainly infinite in scotch judicature the actual ones observable in a single court want not much of being so throughout the demesne of the technical system other exemplifications in unhappy abundance may be found the principal of them will be found comprisable under the following description—one court to decide another court to collect the evidence on which the decision is to be grounded for illustration the following may suffice—   practice of the english superior commonlaw courts on indictments for offences not felonious—the cause bandied to and fro between the court of kings bench and the court of nisi prius   so in informations in criminali   in civili uniform practice of the kings bench common pleas and commonlaw side of the exchequer—the cause bandied between these courts respectively and the courts of nisi prius and assize projected from the     metropolis by a centrifugal and drawn back again by a centripetal force fragments of causes projected now and then under the name of issues from the court of chancery and the equity side of the exchequer to a commonlaw court and then reabsorbed are to the others what comets are to planets   ordinary practice of the equity courts—the collection of the evidence turned over or rather turned down in london and within twenty miles to a clerk in the examiners office and beyond that distance to one or two attorneys on each side commissioned in each cause for that one cause   practice of the ecclesiastical courts—transmission and retrosusception as in the equity courts   practice of the admiralty courts much the same   in scotch judicature the practice of the court of session on this ground forms a system of itself the cause a very shuttlecock between the outerhouse and the innerhouse vibrations and vibratiuncles more than hartley ever imagined while this game is playing the property of the suitors told over a gridiron in each house a plague on both your houses would be the cry of the agonizing suitor if this fragment of a line in the part of mercutio could be pronounced with safety on the edinburgh theatre   the vibrations which in many instances a cause is made to perform between the court and the office of the subordinate judge called the master form another class which must not pass altogether without notice they have place both in law and equity but more constantly and abundantly in the equity courts made business is here almost undistinguishably entangled with necessary business the reasons and pretences are far too multifarious to receive discussion here not that in either class of courts the vibrations are either so complex or so gratuitous as between the two contiguous scotch delayshops for illustrations sake take the following examples of the contrary practice—   indictments for offences not felonious on the circuits viz before learned judges in the character of judges of assize instead of a complete vibration a semivibration the cause received into the kings bench without having been sent from thence   indictments for the same offences at the quartersessions viz before justices of the peace—judges themselves unlearned but acting per force in technical trammels tanquam in vinculis sermocinantes   causes brought on by petition to the lord chancellor in matters of bankruptcy   attachment causes in all the westminsterhall courts unless in the extremely rare event of a transmission of the defendant to the master to be examined upon interrogatories   motion causes and applications of various sorts principal and incidental in all those great courts see the chapter so intituled chap xi note that in nos     and   there is no transmission of the cause for collection of evidence and that for a very simple reason no evidence is received but in a readymanufactured state viz the state of affidavit evidence a state in which it has been seen there is but one objection to it—viz that it is unfit for use the case of indictments for felonious offences is a case too complex to receive discussion here in this case antecedently to the trial the cause has gone through two courts viz   that of the justice or justices of the peace before whom the preliminary examination has been performed   that of the grand jury before whom the evidence has been heard on one side only viz the plaintiffs by the operations of the grand jury the trial before the petty jury is also preceded in the case of an indictment for an offence not felonious but as the cause comes before the grand jury in the first instance without ever having been in any superior court no complete vibration takes place here from the extent given to the bandying system in one direction and the limits set to it in another—from this incongruity coupled with the gigantic length of arm given to the metropolitan courts and the licence given to the prosecutor to choose his court—results an addition of no mean importance to the mischievousness of the system to the people on the one hand and the advantage made of it by its creators and preservers on the other at the sessions there is no bandying sentence is pronounced pronounced on the spot by the president of a bench of judges who at the same time with the jury have been hearing the evidence at the assizes as we have seen the bandying system reigns one judge along with the jury hears the evidence the court of kings bench composed of four judges of which that judge may or may not be one as it happens the chances are exactly two to one against it pronounces the decision—the sentence which professes to ground itself on that evidence     at the sessions the expense in fees is much the same the whole kingdom over everywhere comparatively moderate having been settled by or under the controul of those who derive no personal emolument from it at the assizes and at the metropolis the expense of fees is of course for the opposite reason much greater but the expense and vexation attached to journeys and demurrage instead of being a fixed is a fluent quantity of which the extremes are to each other—as ten—the number of miles representing the distance from kingston to london to three hundred and one—the number of miles representing the distance from carlisle to the same manufactory of technical justice the magnitude of the punishment consequently is in the joint ratio of the animosity of the prosecutor and the distance of the abode of the defendant from the great shop in which the sweets of revenge are dealt out in lots proportioned to the price which the customer is content to pay for them whatever be the county town revenge is always to be had in much larger quantity than any which any such country shop can afford but to a man who has a taste for the sweets of revenge a surrey man in the character of a defendant brought up to town will afford poor sport in comparison with a cornish man or a man of cumberland not but that this excess in punishment has its remedy but this remedy is as usual an aggravation of the disease the cornish man if his own fireside happens to be more pleasant to him than the kings bench enjoys the faculty of causing a motion to be made praying the court to dispense with his personal attendance that motion like all other motions which are not of course supported by affidavits and arguments on one side opposed by weapons of the like nature on the other for the chance such as it is of an exemption from this vexation which is a work of supererogation over and above the punishment a cause is then to be gone through a cause of the same sort as that which comprehends the whole career of litigation in many other cases as to the kings bench—what in that sanctuary befals the hapless sinner dispensation being either not applied for or refused—with what solemnity after hearing his sins poured over his head for the second or third time by affidavits upon affidavits enforced by comments upon comments—with what solemnity he is committed one day without sentence that he may be brought up another day to receive sentence—in what pathetic strains the day of doom at length arrived the wickedness of the age hears itself deplored by the senior and most reverend of the three reverend and puisne ministers of technical justice—these are topics not exactly assorted to this place the reiterations and protractions given by the deliberations of the cat to the sufferings of the offending mouse may to any one to whom it has happened to witness any such dispensation of domestic justice furnish a general idea of it mischiefs in specie as above of misdecision an increased factitious probability of delay vexation and expense a certainty first as to misdecision of the evidence all that most instructive part—the species of circumstantial evidence composed of deportment—the gesture the countenance of the witness under the ordeal of adverse examination—in a word the very spirit of the evidence—is lost the caput mortuum alone preserved the evidence is the very vitals of the cause he who is not fit to decide upon the evidence is not fit to collect it or preside at the collection of it for this function when the mass of evidence is to a certain degree complicated and conflicting no degree of skill of experience of sagacity can be too great when the rule of action is in the shape not of sham but of real law the ability necessary to right decision on the question of law is as nothing in comparison with that for which a demand is sometimes presented by the function of collecting the evidence on the part of the judge whose province it is to frame a decision upon the evidence the most consummate ability may be rendered useless by a want of ability on the part of him by or under whom it is collected in proportion as the deciding judge is studious to guide himself by the evidence his decision is commanded by that other functionary if there be another by whom it is collected under natural procedure the parties present in court the first thing done is to hear the evidence if the cause affords no evidence but that of the parties or none but what they have brought with them then the whole of the evidence is heard at that one time and the cause is already ripe for decision to what end send it for decision to any other court certainly to no good end exists there any other court fitter for pronouncing the decision then was that other court fitter likewise for hearing the evidence on which the decision is to be grounded does the cause afford more evidence than at that first meeting can be heard part at any rate of the evidence has been heard when part of the evidence has been heard in one court if the remainder can be heard in that same court to what end send the cause into any other court the evidence already heard is it to be heard over again delay expense and vexation are the consequences all of them without use is it to be sunk and excluded the consequence is misdecision or at the best a great and useless danger of it     by necessity this transference this inconvenient arrangement like any other may be justified of the evidence necessary to the pronouncing a right decision it may happen that a part consists of the testimony of a witness whose testimony cannot be heard by the court in which the suit is instituted but may be collected elsewhere viz either vivâ voce in some other court and so minuted or in a readywritten state by epistolary examination as the case may be here is a just and necessary cause for bandying the suit pro tanto from court to court here the transmission and retrosusception is proper because necessary by necessity it is justified but it is by necessity alone that it is justified under the technical system this transference is made always without necessity always by choice viz by a blind and preestablished choice by choice yet without reflection so it might be said and truly were it not for the sinister advantages which the authors as may be seen already reaped from it of the cases in which it actually has place is the extent commensurate to and limited by that of the necessity quite the contrary the cases in which it has place are all of them cases in which being without necessity it is without excuse the cases in which it has not place are all those cases in which necessity and justice call for it use to judge

have been pursued in some instances whatever has been the number of deciding judges sitting on the same question at the same time all but one have slipped their shoulders from under the load leaving it to rest upon that one such has been the expedient employed by the three great commonlaw courts in english practice kings bench common pleas and exchequer such also has been the general practice under romebred law on the continent of europe in other instances the deciding judge or judges have exonerated themselves of it altogether turning it over or rather turning it down to some underling or set of underlings not recognised as executing the function or possessing the character of judges   making complication helping to manufacture rubbish to serve as materials for sham science thereby nursing uncognoscibility on the part of the law—that is uncertainty in regard to decisions with other beneficial consequences for which see titles nullification and jargonization chaps xiv  xvii chapter ix fourth device—blind fixation of times for the oplrations of procedure the parties once met in the presence of the judge—in nine instances out of ten the cause would receive its decision upon the spot and execution excepted or not excepted nothing would remain to do in it at any other time yet circumstances there are and in no inconsiderable abundance by any one of which a demand may be created for a quantity of time to which no just limits can be set by general rules in any of these cases whatever at the conclusion of that first meeting remains to be done the properest time for doing it will be settled of course settled by the judge on the joint consideration of the quantity of business which thus remains to be done—the point of time at which it can be done—the convenience of the parties on both sides in that cause—and the convenience of the court that is of other parties who in other causes have their several and equal claims upon the disposable portion of the judges time thus necessary is it on the occasion of each cause that in respect of fixation of times the conduct of the judge should be governed by considerations peculiar to that individual cause in the way of general regulation with here and there an exception too inconsiderable and too obvious to be worth particularizing fixation of days of times and intervals is plainly repugnant to the ends of justice fix what day you will the chances against its being the proper day will be as infinity to one on each individual occasion the interval thus blindly allotted will either be too long involving factitious and needless delay or not long enough insomuch that in the course of it either the business cannot be done at all or cannot be properly done   under the technical system neither party being present exigencies and convenience of all sorts being in all shapes alike uncared for and unknown discriminative fixation is impossible the one device forms thus a reason   0 for the other device—the one abuse forms a cover for the other abuse the fixation is not so inflexible as not to have admitted diversities of time corresponding to diversities in place jurisprudence english jurisprudence has a geography of its own in england there are two places town and country town is the spot in which the four courts are situated reckoning from that place as from the terminus à quo all places in the country are at the same distance as the term is one day so the country is one place but forasmuch as there are two places town and country so there are two sorts of causes town causes and country causes accordingly when for a given operation a certain number of days are allowed in a town cause for the same operation an additional number of days are allowed in a country cause one and the same additional number in every country cause if as hath been said the branches of true science are connected those of sham science are so too jurisprudential geography and jurisprudential chronology throw light upon each other regularity and good order are the images presented and doubtless meant to be presented by these fixations whatever is according to rule or reducible to rule is regular but the quantity of the pillage being given whatever be the degree of regularity the party plundered is not much the better for it still less if the object and effect of the regularity have been to give birth or increase to the quantity of the pillage every order is good order in the eyes of him who profits by it motions for setting aside proceedings on the ground of irregularity form no inconsiderable part of the business of the courts the irregularity is sometimes improbity sometimes honest departure from regularity as above delineated uses to judge and co— use   making business in each case whatever be the length of time thus blindly fixed it will almost always be either too long or too short longer than necessary or too short to admit that to be done or at least properly done which is required to be done if too long then come the advantages from delay of which under the next head if too short then comes an application for more time no application but by motion and no motion without fees fees to the advocate for making it or being supposed to have made it fees to the attorney for preparing it fees to judicial officers for preparing and registering the result the application is either opposable or unopposable if unopposable then the application is a sham application and the fees for making it so much money obtained on false pretences† moreover so much more delay sold thus by the partnership to every dishonest suitor who will pay the price for it if opposable and opposed then comes so much more business a cause within a cause—a motion cause within a regular cause opposed or no—if opposable the application must have its evidence to support it and warrant the judge in complying with it this evidence is not received but in the shape of affidavit evidence bringing with it its fees fees to the attorney for manufacturing fees to judicial officers for receiving and registering it‡ use   affording ease to the judge fixation with eyes open would have consumed time and trouble to regard the ends of justice—to consult the convenience of the suitors—to attend to the allegations and discussions pro and con in relation to that convenience—are irksome operations beneath the dignity of the court by blind fixation time trouble and dignity are all saved use   affording materials for the system of mechanical judicature or decision without thought for which see chapter xii use   making more and more rubbish with the help of factitious and groundless diversification thence uncognoscibility uncertainty and so forth as before with blind fixations the ingenuity or the blindness of the man of law has contrived to combine equally blind diversities though from diversity in respect of length of distance no diversity in respect of length of time allowed is deduced yet from diversity as between court and court all four in the same hall correspondent diversities in respect of allowance of time have not been grudged as to the mischiefs to the suitor—in a general view they have been stated already under the preceding heads in detail they may so easily be read through the medium of the benefits derived to the law partnership from the same source that a separate delineation may it is supposed be spared     chapter x fifth device—sitting at long intervals connected with blind fixation of times for judicial business but separable from it and therefore not identical with it is the device which consists in the establishment of long and unabridgeable intervals between these times as to the general nature of this device it is too simple for explanation the mischiefs of it viz to the suitors are those of delay of the uses derived from it and in the contemplation of which the creation and preservation cannot but have originated some explanation may be of use but before we come to speak of the uses a short glance at the principal applications made of it will place it in the clearer point of view of these applications the principal are presented to view by the words term and circuit terms in the year four each containing three weeks and a day upon an average nineteen days deducting sundays of the thirteen months lunar months in the year not so many as four in which anything is done under the name of justice under the name of vacation time all the rest of the year is a blank all the rest of the year so much holiday time given to injustice such was the original arrangement in effect as well as name such it is still in name and in effect as far as possible if through this and that outlet as the business increased this or that portion forced itself out of its bounds and spread itself over the vacation it has been because it could not be kept in because the complete confinement of it was not possible nor need the extravasation be matter of regret on the one hand the extra labour called for in the vacation is not unrewarded on the other hand of the profitable mischief produced by the compression by far the greater part as will be seen has been successfully preserved unimpaired judges keep holiday almost fourfifths of the year in holidays† if there were a time of the year a proper time for justice to sleep when would it be when injustice does when is the time for the shepherd to keep holiday when the wolf does when is the time for the mother and the nurse to keep holiday when the infant can live without sustenance when is the time for the physician and the surgeon to keep holiday when there are neither diseases nor accidents the ancient romans being pagans and as such superstitions had their dies fasti and their dies nefasti days in which justice was to be done and days in which it was not to be done days in which it was lawful and days in which it was not lawful to do justice the primitive christians a whimsical set of people when they came into power took it into their heads evidently out of a spirit of opposition to administer justice upon all days alike in the eyes of blackstone‡ neither of these courses coinciding with existing practice both it seems were wrong the dies fasti and nefasti made an extreme and justice upon all days alike a sort of confusion of all order made a contrary extreme profanation the wickedest of all wicked things broke out in different shapes administering justice upon all days alike was one of them among other sins of the primitive christians holy church when it came into power took this profanation in hand to correct it taking into consideration five holy seasons advent christmas lent easter and pentecost it beheld in them so many reasons for four intervening vacations—so many reasons for being months together without so much as pretending to administer justice of the necessity of the three short vacations considering that holy mother church was at that time a papist blackstone seems to have entertained a sort of halfdisclosed suspicion but as to the long vacation a season so comfortable to lawyers with that he seems to have been completely satisfied here to the general spiritual reasons he adds     a temporal one a reason which if good in those days of popery is certainly not less good in these days of reformation this is the demand presented for denial of justice by the haytime and harvest accordingly certainly in the eyes of holy mother church and as it should seem in those of blackstone—should it have happened to a man to have his carts and his horses unjustly taken from him and thereupon to apply to a judge to have them back again—the application would have been an unreasonable one contrary to the interests of agriculture what is the matter with the man what use can he have for his horses or his carts does not he know that it is harvest time—such would be the speech of mother churchs and mother blackstones judges such is the cogency of this reason that in the city of london courts whose jurisdiction ends before fields begin long vacations are kept up no less religiously than in westminster hall not to speak of the profanation care was taken not to call off the harvestmen from their labours in cheapside one use of prohibitions is to form a ground for dispensations her holiness was not inexorable dispensations were granted the profanation vanished anno      at the commencement of the reign of edward i† a discovery was again made that it is great charity to do right unto all men at all times when need shall be whereupon at the special request of the king to the bishops provision was made that in a few particular causes at a few particular extra times justice even without any such special dispensations might be done since then the time for doing justice having been found once more to have run out into an extreme—parliament has since under the direction of its learned counsellors been occupied not only in regulating terms but in abbreviating them‡ particularly the two boundaries of the long vacation trinity term and michaelmas lest that holy season for injustice now happily so much longer than all the seasons for justice put together should not be long enough all this while the truth is that in the eyes of the most competent judges three months in the year for administering justice was an excessive allowance four days were quite sufficient and by an exertion of legal pncumatics each term consisting of thirty days more or less was condensed into one day and so real is this condensation that it is decided andargued upon and forms a source of business terms with their vacations present but an inadequate idea of the quantity of delay really manufactured an idea nearer the mark is that which is indicated by circuits not that either is complete without the other for to the quantity manufactured by one of these engines of iniquity must be added the quantity manufactured by the other excepting that class of causes from the trial of which as above all fit evidence is excluded with a few other exceptions of too narrow an extent in the whole to be worth     particularizing the business done in term is so much made business business manufactured by the principle of fixed days as above or some other device or devices business for which in the natural system there is no place and the transaction of which is repugnant instead of being subservient to the ends of justice in a general point of view term business may be set down to the account of sham business the real business the business by which anything is done towards the ends of justice is what is done at the trial and in causes noncriminal not to speak of the inferior criminal ones the trial under the operation of the bandying principle as above explained is performed at the courts of nisi prius and the circuit courts nisi prius courts in town causes circuit courts in country causes counties in all england wales not included  0 deducting middlesex as not comprised in the circuits    counties to which the judges in their circuits go twice in the year    counties to which they go but once in the year the remaining  † average number of days in the year on which the circuit courts sit in each place at both seasons put together—gross number   employable number allowance being made for journeys and for days of entry on which in general nothing can be done at the utmost   out of the    —number of days during which justice or something that goes by the name of justice is administered those   number of days in which nothing under the name of justice is so much as pretended to be administered in these courts anywhere but in the metropolis the remaining   0 termtimes for real business two in the year lasting  ½ days each vacations between those termtimes two of   0 days each four counties excepted in which the vacation instead of the   0 days lasts about   0 out of the     the four northernmost counties being as well able to live without justice for a whole year as their next neighbours for half a year as some animals are able to live longer without air than others blackstone besides the care and cheapness bids us admire the system for the expedition which characterizes it expeditious indeed if out of the     days   0 be but thrown out of the account—the   0 in which nothing can be done—expeditious indeed on these terms as if procrustes himself had planned it in the time of henry ii who out of his grace and favour gratified his people with a circuit once in every seven years glanville his grand justiciary or whoever held the pen of glanville trumpets it forth in the only passage of his book‡ in which any symptoms of sensibility are to be found instead of once in seven years had it been once in seven times seven years the glanville or the blackstone of the day would have admired it either for the expedition or for something still better which they would have found in it meantime whatever delay is created by the   0 or    ½ vacation days is amply made up for in the remaining   excess of delay finds in excess of precipitation a counterpart and in the eye of the law a remedy the space being marked out it is for the causes to squeeze themselves into it as they can like negroes on the long passage∥ when the natural course of things is departed from and that to such a degree that there are more nojustice days than justice days—in such a state of things in regard to justice days what is of much more importance than the number of them in the year is the degree of equality with which they are distributed suppose for example in the whole year    justice days and no more place them regularly one in each week and on the same day in each week—here are in each week indeed   nojustice days but in no week any more place them on the contrary in an order as widely different from the foregoing one as possible place them all    together—the whole year is thus divided into two masses and but two one composed of    justicedays the other of     nojustice days a term of    days followed by a vacation of     with this proportion in both cases—under the system of the greatest equality suppose the causes to be all of them of a simple cast and to such a degree simple as that none of them shall be capable of being protracted beyond the first sitting in this case though the provision made in this respect for the fulfilment of the ends of justice would fall considerably short of that made by the natural system of all justicedays—still in comparison with the system of greatest inequality the     denial of justice would be comparatively inconsiderable on the one hand the inconvenience resulting to the suitors from the subtraction of the six days out of the seven would be comparatively inconsiderable on the other hand the benefit to the law partnership would be absolutely nothing or next to nothing suppose the cause complex enough to require an adjournment then the inconvenience to the suitor and what as will be seen would keep pace with it the benefit to the man of law will begin to be sensible suppose with or without a fresh adjournment another week—the inconvenience on one side the advantage on the other would rise in value and so on without end viewed in this point of view the abominations of the circuit system will show themselves in the truest and clearest light in the four northern counties the inequality of the distribution and consequently the wickedness of the system at the highest possible pitch in the thirtyfive other counties the inequality and the wickedness half way to that pitch the profits here placed to the account of the length of the intervals between the time fixed for one part of the business and the time fixed for another part of the business in the same cause are over and above those which are reaped from the mere fixation of the times as under the last head use   making business by making delay delay is a part of the stock in trade terms and circuits with the vacations between them are the machinery by which it is made on each occasion the greater the quantity of the delay the better it is worth a mans while to pay the price that has been set upon it use   making business by extra fees fees taken by the judge or what comes to the the same thing his official instruments and sponges for business done in vacation over and above what is taken for the same business when done in term time an instrument of extortion is thus made out of the delay and the longer the delay the stronger the instrument the judge neglects wilfully neglects his own duty this neglect of his own he converts into a source of profit first he commits the wrong then he takes advantage of it himself he rewards for it—him who is injured by it he punishes for it use   making business by delay viz the delay manufactured by the nullification machine of this engine of iniquity one of the most capital ones in the whole factory a draught will be given in another chapter according to the application made of it sometimes ultimate misdecision sometimes mere delay is the product when it is delay only it is for the sake of the delay with the casual benefits attached to it—of the delay and nothing else—that the suitor applies to have the engine set to work the delay is the commodity which he obtains by the application the costs of the application by which party soever ultimately paid are the price of it were it not for the delay he would get nothing by the application the costs of it would be so much pure loss to him he would never make it what use would there be in making a flaw if it were cured as soon as made thus then stands the relation between the system of terms and vacations and the principle of nullification without the principle of nullification the system of terms and vacations would in a variety of ways have been rendered serviceable to the ends of judicature but without the system of terms and vacations that engine of torture the principle of nullification so far as concerns its dilatory use which is its principal use would have been worth nothing and society would never have been afflicted by it use   in case of pecuniary demands—securing to the defendant when a wrongdoer in the shape of interest saved or gained interest on the amount of principal due an inducement to become a purchaser of the delay so manufactured and set to sale use   making business by giving effect and use in like manner to one division of the chicaneries in regard to notice see the chapter on that head ch xiii use   affording ease to the judge and to the partnership in general ease in the shape of holidays so much the less time in which business can be done so much for a moment it might be supposed so much the less business thus obtained ease it may be thought is obtained at the expense of profit no such thing the quantity of natural business—the demand for the services of the judge by the administration of justice is little influenced     by the time allowed for doing it in if in this or that particular instance an example should be found of business natural business lost by delay the sum total of the business so lost would be found to hear no proportion to the amount of what is gained in the shape of made business of the denial of justice for so great a part of the year coupled with the nondenial of it during the remainder—of the compound made as above noted of excessive delay with excessive precipitation—the general effect bating a few casual exceptions is not that less is done by reason of the temporary denials of justice but that what is done is more badly done that for which time is continually insufficient is rendering of justice that for which time is never insufficient is receipt of fees chapter xi sixth device—motion business the principal agent in motion business is the advocate except the principal hearing called in jury causes the trial almost all business in which the advocate as such has or is pretended to have had occasion to address himself in open court to the judge is referable to this head it consists in making a motion or opposing it in the aggregate mass of motions two main branches may be distinguished motions not of course and motions of course the use of the distinction will appear presently the mass of business composed of motions not of course calls upon us to distinguish it into two branches—  incidental motions being so many applications made to the judge in the course of a suit already instituted in some other form   original or originative motions giving birth each of them to an individual suit belonging to that class of suits which on this account may be ternted motionsuits or causes all motions not of course have two common properties or characteristic differences by which they are distinguished from motions of course—  each of them has for its ground and support a mass of evidence   that mass the whole of it is of a sort which not only is but by all those by whom on a disputed case it is thus employed is perfectly known and upon occasion openly acknowledged to be of an inferior and untrustworthy complexion so untrustworthy that when better is to be had without preponderant delay vexation and expense and it is seldom indeed in which it is not to be had even with less delay vexation and expense it is altogether unfit to be on any disputed occasion ever received in any court of justice motion causes in so far as they extend are a sort of improvement upon ordinary causes they are tried in a bad mode but in a mode somewhat less dilatory perjury abounds and triumphs but one way or other the business terminates as men are dealt with in those courts he who is soonest out of them is best served all the rules of evidence are either discarded or reversed no unwilling witness is compellable every willing witness is received every party is admitted to swear for himself no party is compelled to swear against himself testimony which would not be received on any other occasion—the testimony of a convicted perjurer—is received on this occasion without difficulty every man that chooses to be heard is heard on condition that his testimony be concerted with an attorney and that he be not crossexamined incidental motions arise most of them out of factitious business the business made at the offices with the help of so many devices all directed to this end—exclusion of the parties mechanical judicature jargon fiction mendacitylicence nullification—blunders are made or pretended to have been made that application may be made for setting them to rights these applications are called motions the incidental motions under any natural system accidents may arise producing need of new arrangements and of application for that purpose to the judge unexpected absence sickness lunacy death and so forth on an occasion of this sort what truth and justice require is some person from whose testimony when present and examined the judge can deduce sufficient ground for being satisfied about the matter of fact instead of that he sees a lawyer who knowing nothing about the matter stands with a paper in his hand containing a vampedup story which whether in his own eyes it be true or false he calls upon the judge to take for true motions of course are motions that are of no use without any one exception this character belongs to every individual operation of the class thus denominated of no use none whatever understand always with reference to the interest of the suitor to the ends of justice to the ends of judicature to the partnership in divers of its branches—yes of no small use a motion of course is an application supposed to be made to the judge but which made or not made never is refused—never creates on the part of the judge any demand for the exercise of reason—never in fact comes under his cognizance motions of course are again distinguishable     into two other classes—  motions made   motions not made this distinction is of comparatively recent growth originally all motions used to be made all are still supposed to be made every motion of course that has been made is signed by the advocate in attestation of his having made it in attestation of his having received the fee charged by the attorney to the client every motion that has not been made but is charged to the client as having been made is also signed by the advocate viz in attestation of his having made it as well as of his having received his fee for it made or not made they are all alike useless mere pretences false pretences for extracting money out of the pocket of the distressed suitor to put it into the pockets of the attorney the barrister—the judges protegé and eventually the judge pretence of speaking is false in many of them pretence of thinking is false in all of them in conclusion we have a division of the whole stock of motions applications that ought not to be made in that manner and applications that ought not to be made at all the division is exhaustive chapter xii seventh device—decision without thought or mechanical judicature in this device may be seen the very acme of perfection under the feegathering the technical and as it might be called could the object be completely attained the mechanical system in this may be seen the goal to which all exertions tend though it cannot on every occasion be reached—to get in the money without the trouble of a thought here may be seen men without feeling operating upon others as if they had none besides the exclusion of parties which is necessary for everything the principle of fixed days was necessary indispensably necessary to the accomplishment of this device which in truth is little more than the principle of fixed days carried to perfection and applied to this particular purpose something which on a particular day according to a rule declared or not declared ought to have been done—done by the defendants attorney—is not done from this omission without anything more the judge by his decision deals with the defendant as if he were proved to be in the wrong not that he thinks him in the wrong for he thinks nothing about the matter but from this omission on the part of one member of the partnership the other takes occasion without knowing anything about the cause to act as if he had tried it and to punish the client for the fault real or pretended of his lawyers like default on the part of the plaintiffs attorney judgment for the defendant judgment against the attorneys client the plaintiff what is thus done by the power of the judge—by whomsoever it be really done is at least said to be done you would naturally suppose by as well as by the authority of the judge no such thing to such perfection is the system carried in this line so notoriously as well as effectually is the judge exonerated from the trouble of judging that judgment in this case is not so much as said to be signed by him the member of the partnership the person by whom it is said to be signed is an attorney—the attorney of the party in whose favour it operates so completely are the relations of persons and of things confounded so open not in deed only but in word is the contempt of justice it is well for the party if the worst that happens to him in such a case be the loss of his cause by blameless ignorance by culpable ignorance by negligence or by treachery something which it is said should have been done on a particular day by an attorney is omitted to be done† by an attorney employed by the party—or perhaps by the party himself who has failed to employ an attorney because it was out of his power to find money to pay one the something at any rate which should be done fails to be done what is the consequence by a preestablished order of things the work of the goddess law not of the mortal judge—the defaulter that is not the person by whose fault but the person to whose misfortune the failure has taken place is pronounced a rebel or a contemner of justice and dealt with accordingly he is taken up and consigned to prison on the authority of a writ of attachment as for contempt or a commission of rebellion a paper signed by somebody no matter by whom by an adverse attorney by an automaton or by a judge‡ regularity is thus maintained and on the strength of that endowment the system is     for praise and honour compared to a piece of clockwork the parailel need not stop there for under a set of rules so organized it is just as impossible to a judge of flesh and blood as it is to a judge of leather and prunella with bowels of brass and iron to do anything better than receive fees under the authority of a judge acting under the natural system what room is there for such regularities for such irregularities or any of their consequences the parties being before him at the outset of the cause an appearance which need not and perhaps would not cost either of them a farthing he would state to them what was to be done by each of them on the next occasion and what in case of failure would be the consequence in a case of extremity he would have recourse to the measure of extremity he would send a warrant but the warrant would neither make nor find nor pretend to find a rebel or contemner if the cause reguired another day to finish it would the day appointed by him be appointed by cross and pile without thought or preference as between convenience or ruin of the interests of any of the parties on the contrary not one would there be to whose convenience due attention would not be paid of course though in the order of things which we have been examining the decision is altogether without thought it cannot in strictness be said to be altogether without evidence by an inference made once for all the party whose attorney makes default is concluded to be in the wrong here is a something which if it must be called evidence belongs to the head of circumstantial evidence and so satisfactory is this evidence that by the operations grounded on it it is pronounced conclusive of the inference so quietly drawn what is the force to a rational hand consideration had of the circumstances of the case from the fact thus accepted in the character of an evidentiary fact and that conclusively so is there any sufficient reason for regarding the principal fact viz that of the partys being in the wrong as being so much as in a preponderant degree probable no such thing whatsoever under the natural system under a system pure from factitious expense might be the degree of the probability—the force of the inference under the system in which it is made conclusive in which the probability is put on a level with certainty is below par—much below par the chances are many to one on the other side without setting down anything for the chance of treachery ignorance or negligence on the part of the attorney or what is so frequent a subject of judicial complaint fraud on the part of his brother on the other side or even uncertainty in the rules themselves which had uncertainty for their object—of the whole number of individuals exposed to the misfortune of becoming defendants how few are there who are able to defray the expense of continuing themselves on that unhappy list in comparison with those who are unable if the unable are not to the able as more than one to ten then say on this score alone without looking to any other the chances are as ten to one against the truth of the proposition thus acted upon as if it stood on the ground of certainty if in imitation of the law still existing in some places in regard to flourmills a barber secured by privilege in the possession of the whole custom of his district were to set up an engine by which instead of corn ground beards were to be shaved the patients standing in rows to apply their faces to the circumference of a wheel—the advantage to the professional man would be obvious and indisputable business to any amount might be done within a given time and should any mischance takes place such as the drawing of blood or the levelling of protuberances not intended to be levelled the responsibility instead of falling upon the professional man would be divided between the patient and the wheel the privilege was too valuable to be imparted to barbers judges reserved it to themselves canses accordingly are decided though not exactly by steam steamengines have not been long enough in use yet what comes to the same thing by mechanism without the aid of any such expensive instrument as human reason as to the advantages of the improvement they have been already indicated men are as well judged as by the shavingwheel they would be shaved and the nees derived by the partners with the judge at their head from the circle of offices are alike conspicuous as those that might be derived by the barber from the wheel in the system of mechanical judicature the supposition of the existence of notice apposite and adequate notice is necessarily involved in many cases and of course in as many as possible the supposition belongs as will be seen to the category of fiction it is false the study having been to make it so but as appearances must to a certain degree be preserved and punishment or other hardship avowedly inflicted without notice that is without possibility of defence would not be consistent with the preservation of appearances—it is not the less true that on whatsoever principles performed rational or mechanical judicature supposes notice under the system of fixed times—in so far as the fixation extends and is not disturbed by incidental application—the fixation being supposed to be foreknown is thereby supposed to convey the requisite information to operate as notice to this     class of cases extends what may be called general or preestablished notice on the other hand in the cases to which the system of fixation has not been supposed to extend and in those to which as just mentioned it has experienced disturbance—to those cases applies the demand for special incidental notice such is the connexion between the device of mechanical judicature and the device that is as will be seen one out of two parts of the device composed of chicaneries about notice to render the mechanical system more productive one object has been so to order matters that the implied supposition of the existence of adequate notice shall in this and that instance and of course to as great an extent as possible fail of being verified by the impossibility of timely notice or by some other means that which a man is to be punished for not having done is rendered impossible and therefore he is punished for not having done it for an exemplification of this policy the practice of outlawry in actions called civil actions is of itself a host of cases but as to this see the chapter in which the chicaneries about notice are particularly brought to view uses to judge and co— to the uses already summed up under the head of the two devices forming the foundation of this device there will not be much to add use   making business viz by the foundation laid for defaults mischances and frauds thence for more and more business use   making business viz by giving encouragement and existence to malâ fide demands and defences under the assurance of inability on the part of the adversary for want of adequate opulence to avoid making the default use   affording ease viz by enabling the judge to act and receive fees without expense of thought without expense of time trouble avocation for pleasure or hindrance of ulterior and more profitable business use   affording ease viz by exempting the judge from all responsibility and apprehension of responsibility a judge when he has thus converted himself into a machine shares this advantage with other machines use   affording case viz by giving to the judge the profit of inhumanity clear from the opprobrium use  —and from that pain of sympathy which by the view of the party thus injured and distressed while suffering under the distress might by possibility in some cases have been excited the most striking peculiarity of this device as compared with most of the others is the shelter which it affords to the judge against responsibility when the fate of the several parties interested is seen to have the judge for its author to have a decision pronounced by the judge on the ground of appropriate evidence for its cause a certain share of responsibility attaches of course upon the judge should the parties or any of them labour in consequence under any evil imposed upon them in contravention of the ends of justice the odium at least if nothing more is carried naturally and of course to the account of the judge should any profit be thrown into his hands by the operation of the same cause such profit will be apt to be also carried by the public mind to the account of the judge and the expectation of the profit on the one part will be in danger of being looked to as the cause of the suffering on the other that so inconvenient a check should be removed was of essential importance to the ends of judicature the principle of decision without thought presented itself for this purpose whatever is done—whatever cruelty whatever extortion is practised takes place without any thought and therefore without any need of thought on the part of the judge—takes place in virtue of certain preestablished rules these rules—having been established so long ago nobody knows when nor by whom nor why nor wherefore—are of course presumed to be the fruits of the most consummate wisdom—and whatever misery is seen to flow from them is placed to the account of necessity and the nature of things the imperfection of human institutions and so forth who have been the sufferers or to what amount the judge neither knows nor cares the judge who knows what it is he does is exposed to the imputation of partiality let things be so arranged that on as many occasions as possible he shall act and be known to act without knowing what he does and that men in general shall understand as much and be satisfied with it—malice itself cannot find any pretence for disturbing him with any such charge the judge secures the praise of probity inflexible probity—and by what by that very arrangement by which for the purposes of extortion justice has been rendered impossible the judge is thus almost from first to last the passive the unconscious and consequently the innocent and irresponsible instrument of all the mischief that is done by his authority and for his benefit whatever distress extortion and injury comes to be manufactured for his use means have been found for saving him from everything that could have been unpleasant to his feelings from the tears of the afflicted from the cries of the oppressed from the reproaches of the injured whatever mischief is done either     he never hears of it or if he does it is through the medium of friends and partners engaged by a common interest in reality to make it as heavy in appearance to make it as light as possible in the simplicity of ancient times saving his ears from being stunned with noise ne ampliùs clamorem audiamus was the only motive to which it was thought needful for the monarch to ascribe his alleged disposition to do justice under the technical system his substitute the judge has contrived to withdraw himself out of the reach even of this motive chapter xiii eighth device—chicaneries about notice whensoever for the purposes of justice an obligation to any effect is imposed upon a man knowledge of the existence of such obligation is necessary to the fulfilment of it or at any rate to the affording the requisite security for its being fulfilled what in some cases may happen is that without knowledge of the obligation a man may be led by other causes to do that which it is the object of the obligation to engage him to do but in so far as the obligation is either necessary or conducive to his performing that act which being performed is the fulfilment of it—so far the knowledge of the existence of the obligation is necessary to the fulfilment of it on the part of the individual fraud and injustice operating on the subject of notice must assume one or other of two forms one consists in wilful omission to give notice viz in the not furnishing the person by whom the performance or the opportunity of performance of the act in question is necessary to justice with information of the existence of the fact the contemplation of which is to present to him the motive for such performance the other consists in the not acknowledging the receipt of notice to wit by him by whom it has actually been received under the feegathering system fraud in these shapes as in all other shapes being in some way or other beneficial to the partnership—among the objects of that system has accordingly been that of giving encouragement to fraud in both these shapes one device has consisted in the enabling a fraudulent party for the joint benefit of himself and the partnership to impose upon his adversary without effective notice given this or that burthensome obligation the imposition of which on the supposition of the receipt of effective notice may be just or not just but at any rate on the supposition of the nonreceipt of such notice is not just the opposite device has consisted in the enabling the fraudulent party by whom effective notice has been received to escape from this or that burthensome obligation the imposition of which is necessary to the giving effect to the correspondent right on the part of his adversary to escape viz on the supposition that the effective notice so received had failed of being received failed viz either because it never had been received at all or because it had not been received at such time and in such manner as to enable it to answer the purpose for which it ought to have been given on these two devices taken together has been engrafted a third consisting in the needless diversification of the modes and forms of notice the written instruments required to be employed and the steps or operations required to be performed in relation to such instruments this diversification has had two main sources—  the diversity of courts—the fertile source of confusion and injustice on so many other grounds besides this   the diversity of occasions on which the demand for notice may have been presented by incidents arising in the same court viz whether in causes of the same sort or in causes of different sorts carried on in the same court the demand for the notice is produced by the obligation grafted on it—by the obligation to the justice of which the existence of such receipt is a necessary condition this obligation will in every case be bottomed upon two inseparably connected grounds—  the existence of the law or rule of law by which the quality of giving birth to the obligation in question has been conferred on a fact or facts of the description in question   the existence of such fact or facts as to the law—as on this occasion so in all others—to prevent it from having been present to the minds of those who are subjected to its operation on the supposition of its having been on the occasion in question present to their minds is among the fundamental policies and constant endeavours of the feegathering or technical system in every part of its course the keeping of the requisite facts also out of the reach of the minds of those who are to be thus operated upon is a more special and diversified application of the same industrious policy examples will meet us as we advance after what has been said or even without anything of what has been said two propositions it is supposed may pass without any dispute—  that whenever appropriate notice is necessary to justice it ought to be effectively given   that whenever it has been effectively given and thence effectively received it ought to be deemed and taken to   0 have been received i e that ought to be done the doing of which in the case in question is upon the supposition of such actual receipt of notice conformable to justice hence—to any one whose desire it really were that in all cases as far as possible justice should be done—a main question would naturally at the outset present itself what in general is the most effective and upon the whole the most eligible mode for the conveyance of effective notice in the endeavour to find an answer to this question the first observation that presents itself is that to this purpose not merely the efficiency of the notice ought to be attended to but likewise the other consideration so inseparably connected with many questions relative to the subject of procedure—the consideration of the circumstances of delay vexation and expense thence comes the question in its amended state what is the most eligible mode to be taken for conveying effective notice regard being had to the collateral considerations of delay vexation and expense to find an answer to this question the first object to be looked to is the occasion understanding in this instance the occasion as constituted by the stage of the suit by the stage in which it is proposed that the notice in question be it what it may shall be given and received the person by whom it is proposed that the notice be received will in each case he either willing or not willing to receive it in so far as he is willing—the proposed giver of the notice being also by the supposition willing to give it—there can exist no difficulty in the ordinary and amicable intercourse of life those who wish to hold intercourse with one another and are at the same time free to do so never experience any other difficulty than those which are opposed by the circumstances of time and place unfortunately as between parties litigant the case in general is unhappily the reverse by whatever motive one party is prompted to give the notice by some correspondent motive the other party is prompted to avoid if possible the receiving it or rather the being deemed to have received it if the notice has been received such and such proceedings tending to impose a burthen in some shape upon such receiver are lawful and productive of such their intended effect if not not but his endeavour is of course to avoid being subjected to that burthen therefore his wish and endeavour is that—whether the notice was or was not received by him—the supposition entertained or at least acted upon by the judge may be in the negative under the natural system of procedure in so far as it governs whether in the private circle of a family or in a public sphere—in so far as this primitive mode has been preserved or restored by law—the most eligible course is not only to the last degree obvious but in so far as legal powers have happened to extend is exemplified in every days practice though as to the execution of what is determined to be endeavoured at difficulties will of course be apt to present themselves and in as great abundance and force as one of the parties can contrive to give to them yet as to the determining of what shall be endeavoured at difficulty has scarcely any place where for this or for any other purpose two parties are really and mutually wishing to hold intercourse with each other—they embrace of course the most effective and regard being had to delay vexation and expense the most convenient modes which the state of society in the place and at the times in question happens to afford special messengers on foot special messengers on horseback letterpost mail coaches telegraphs and so forth the problem and the difficulty the only difficulty is how to render that party willing who of himself is not so or where that is impracticable to supply the place of willingness on his part by other means under the natural system the solution of this problem will depend upon the stage of the cause when the judge is honest and not ashamed or afraid to face the parties the business of notice is attended with little difficulty at the outset of the cause suppose a meeting is produced after this all difficulty is at an end a mode of intercourse is settled for each and by mutual consent declare says the judge on pain of losing your cause at what place delivered and how directed it may be taken for granted that a letter has reached your hands so delivered and directed by accident should it happen to any letters to have miscarried the inconvenience whatever it be shall ultimately rest no part upon your adversary the whole of it upon you this arrangement lasts so long as the cause lasts the cause lasts as to this purpose till to this purpose i have declared it to be at an end as to the mode of procuring the initial meeting in general a simple summons will suffice but if there be any apprehension of latitancy and that apprehension declared upon oath or what is equivalent and registered so as to render the plaintiff responsible in case of vexation the security afforded by personal arrestation need not be grudged in this or any other shape the danger of wilful and needless vexation cannot be great where the author in case of its being deemed so is sure to smart for it arrest when it is what it ought to be and might so easily be neither more nor less than a visit to the judge is at the worst but a forced visit every forced visit is unpleasant     but by what human means shall a man be exempted from the occasional vexation of making and receiving unpleasant visits arrest as under technical procedure it is and so long as that system of abominations remains unextirpated will be is indeed a most barbarous oppression a most enormous grievance the visit is not to the judge but to a jail that in that seat of misery indigence may be stript of its last rag out of the sight and for the benefit of the judge his protegés and underpartners a third person—a person who is not a party—a person whose presence although he be not a party may in the character of witness or any other be necessary to justice—is in this respect in the situation which the defendant is in antecedently to the first judicial meeting so often spoken of in case of necessity not on parties only but on third persons from whom information or any other service is necessary to justice might this mode of enforcing it be practised without reserve always understood that in case of purposed vexation the author is at the same time himself standing in the presence of the judge ready by his immediate appointment to pay for the injury by due satisfaction or condign punishment by the laws of the twelve tables any man might lead or drag into the presence of the judge any other obtorto collo giving his neck a twist at the same time the twist in the neck might have been spared that omitted and responsibility for vexation added the provision would not be less conducive to justice now than then in london than in rome lawyer—and would you have the whole time of a leading member of parliament of a first minister liable to be thus consumed by a conspiracy of blackguards or on condition of perseverance by a single blackguard nonlawyer—no certainly but your conspiracy what length could it go before it were discovered and your single blackguard or the first of your conspirators punished as he would be for his very first exploit stopped in his career at the very outset where would be his perseverance as to your own allperfect system—what it does admit is your apprehended mischief what it does not admit is this natural or any other remedy at the instance of mr horne tooke when on his trial for treason pitt the minister of the day with a crowd of other stateworthies delivered his reluctant testimony the relevance was at any rate not very close suppose irrelevance as complete as possible what burthen under the name of punishment or satisfaction could have been imposed on the author of the vexation none whatever default is the nonperformance of that act to secure the performance of which any act prescribed in the character of an act of notice was really or professedly designed on an occasion of this sort is it necessary can it be necessary to state to common sense what would be the part taken by common honesty under the natural system the occasion for notice and eventually default be it what it may will be either subsequent to the first appearance of the party before the judge or antecedent consisting in nonappearance if subsequent to such appearance there can be no difficulty at the first appearance measures are supposed to be already taken since in every case they may be taken—effectual measures taken without difficulty and with full warning of the consequences of neglect for the continuation of the intercourse as long as it can be necessary for any of the purposes of justice if antecedent to such appearance—then for the purpose of giving him official and sufficient notice sufficient information of the nature of the burthen to which default may subject him—personal intercourse with the party himself is by the supposition impracticable but with the adverse party the plaintiff—the party at whose instance the rendering of this service by or at the charge of him the defendant is prayed for—this intercourse has by the supposition taken place the defendant by the supposition is not forthcoming intercourse with him hath as yet been found impracticable simple latency absconsion expatriation exprovinciation—which of all these accidents is the cause whosoever he be whosoever he is or has been—relations neighbours acquaintance some or all of these if he is a human creature he must have had from these sources or some of them if the acquaintance which the plaintiff his adversary has with him be not of itself sufficient information concerning him will be to be obtained and for the indication of these sources of information the plaintiff who is so much concerned in interest to afford it—the plaintiff if it be not in his power of himself to afford sufficient information may at any rate be relied on as a sure resource though a channel of correspondence be settled upon and agreed to be employed yet on legal occasions as on those of ordinary life the process is exposed to failure the channel that ought to have been employed has not been employed or though employed the intended communication has after all failed of being received by the person to whom it should have been made on this head in natural procedure as in ordinary life the first question is of course—received or not received if not received then sometimes comes in the ulterior question—to whom shall the failure be imputed to the party by whom the notice should have     been received or to the party at whose instance and by whose instrumentality in the first instance at least the communication ought to have been made under the technical system the question received or no is a question never made instead of it good or bad is the only question ever heard of in regard to notice if good no matter whether received or no it will be deemed to have been or what is the only material thing acted upon as if it had been received if bad no matter again whether received or no it will be deemed not to have been received and upon that supposition will the conduct of the judge be grounded the notice is regarded as good when the communication is supposed to have been made according to the forms which have been settled or supposed to be settled made according to these forms it is not the less good for not having been received made in a manner varying or supposed to vary in any respect from these forms it is not the better for having been received according to the principles of common honesty the points aimed at have been already stated that wherever notice is requisite to justice notice be not given only but whereever actually received be deemed to have been received and that the operations employed for the giving and the receiving of it be as free from delay vexation and expense as possible given the situation of the north given also the situation of the south given the points aimed at by common honesty given in like manner are the points aimed at by common law—that the notice requisite to justice may as frequently as possible fail of being received that when actually received it may as frequently as possible fail of being deemed to have been received to the end that he by whom it was given may be dealt with as if he had not given it and that the operations relative to it may be in such manner attended with delay vexation and expense as to yield to the partnership as large a mass of profit as possible the courses taken for the fulfilment of these ends are by far too multifarious to be here particularized the diversifications agree in this viz that besides being needlessly dilatory vexatious and expensive they are as inadequate as they can be made the commodious channels presented by the improved state of society being industriously neglected all real means of intercourse being inexorably declined how should it be otherwise to employ them the judge would have to see and hear parties with his own eyes and ears and to see and hear parties would be to give up the ends of judicature on favourable occasions sham communications are employed without disguise the forms of communication being employed under circumstances in which it is known that the information pretended to be communicated will not be received viz either will not be received at all or will not be received time enough to answer the pretended and not intended purpose the forms prescribed to be employed in the first instance being elaborately inadequate profit flows in through a variety of channels suits on the question whether the notice given was good or bad the notice though good not having been received suits for relief from the consequences notice given in the first instance being found bad demand for fresh notice the only form of communication allowed to be given in the first instance being upon the face of it or by experience found to be ineffective or reasonably or unreasonably apprehended so to be—motion that communication made in some other way may pro hâc vice be held good† parties excluded discussions about notice rest of course on the ground of affidavit evidence no questions asked the essential character and use of affidavit evidence no questions asked the resource and motto of fraud on all occasions and in all places no questions asked by receivers of stolen goods—no questions asked by learned judges notice of the fact on which according to law a proceeding at the charge of one or other of the parties is to be grounded—notice of any such fact is nothing unless the notice of the law accompany it means of compliance are presented to view motives for compliance not one grand and standing object is accordingly to keep the law in a state as incapable as possible of being conveyed to notice that which exists not is not a subject of knowledge hence the matter of another device the unfeigned love and indefatigable magnification of that sham law in england denoted by one of the half dozen senses of the term common law and in france so much more appropriately     by jurisprudential law or jurisprudence hence also the accessory devices embroidered upon that ground jargon in all its forms fiction and the doublefountain principle all which see in respect of the mode best adapted to the conveyance of notice besides the diversifications above hinted at as resulting from the state of society others of a more permanent nature are suggested by circumstances of diversity such as under the system of common sense and natural procedure are too obvious to be overlooked the party sui juris or under power of one sex or the other in a state of perfect sanity or in a state of comparative imbecility through immaturity or caducity of age the party a housekeeper or not if not a housekeeper has he a fixed abode or is he in a state of itinerancy his abode known or as yet not known within or not within the geographical boundaries of the jurisdiction of the court from these and other diversities in respect of condition in life may arise a demand for diversification too obvious to need and requiring too many words to admit of further mention here to these natural and rational sources of diversification the technical system in england at least has substituted others more suitable to its purposes and more congenial to its nature diversity of courts diversity in the sorts of causes and diversity of stages in the same cause in french practice the defendant after he had given authority to an attorney to act for him was called upon to elect his domicile meaning neither more nor less than this viz to name the house to which whatsoever communication for the purpose of the cause might require to be made being made accordingly shall be presumed to have reached his hands the domicile so elected was the office of his attorney between client and attorney so long as the relation and the confidence attached to it continues it is not in the nature of things that any evasion or detrectation of intercourse should exist on either side in england as in france and everywhere else even under the natural system to whomsoever the misfortune falls of being obliged to employ an attorney the office of the attorney will in general be regard being had to the interests of both parties the most eligible domicile and if at the outset of the suit so through every subsequent stage of the dispute whatsoever turns it may happen to it to take under the technical system in england election of domicile does take place and it does not take place it does take place in this respect—the greater part of the business done being sham business—business made to make fees business which has nothing to do with the merits what is done and received in the partys name is not communicated to him having lest the uselessness of it shall be perceived been rendered unintelligible to him it is convenient to the lawyer and not disadvantageous to the client that he should be spared as much as possible the plague of hearing of it without any election the domicile of each attorney is known or knowable to every other and thus far without any such election in form the effect of it takes place it is the interest of the partnership that as much intercourse as possible should be kept up between the professional members of it on the opposite sides of the cause the one with the other and as little intercourse as possible between one party and the other and between each party and the lawyer on the other side between the party and his lawyer it is neither in their inclination nor in their power to prevent or impede the intercourse but in addition to this sham business in the course of which though everything is supposed and asserted to be done by the party nothing is done by him in effect—in addition to this sham business to which the party is not unless by accident privy—business will every now and then arise which cannot be done unless the party knows of it here then would be an occasion in respect of which if justice instead of fees had been the object election of domicile would have been made to take place service on the client would have been performed by service on his attorney but among the sources of fees is evasion of notice evasion real on one side—apprehended or pretended to be apprehended on the other by election of domicile anglicè by causing service on the attorney to be in all cases service on the client this source of fees would have been dried up accordingly such permanent election of domicile is unknown to english practice the persons to whom notice is addressed are either known or unknown unknown as in the case of creditors when the debtor is alive and forthcoming common sense would direct men in the first instance to the debtor technical judicature finds always some other channel of correspondence better adapted to its purposes scotch judicature for example—besides the pier and shore of leith has the minutebook and the wall the pier and shore for fugitives the minutebook and the wall for creditors†     rule if notice be not conveyed to those whose interest it is to receive it be sure that either its being received is not for the advantage or that its not being received is for the advantage of those on whom it depends think on this occasion of bank directors and unclaimed dividends think again of lord high chancellors and masters of the rolls and unclaimed pittances of miserable suitors and see by what omnipotence it is that the money employed in augmentation of masters salaries is created out of nothing behold in each masters office a gulf by which when a mans money is swallowed either his right to it is concealed from him or if he know of it and claim it more is squeezed from him than is paid first men make the wrong then they make their profit from the wrong nor is that enough for them but they must have praise for it sham notice presents two main modifications   when notice pretended to be given is not given not being meant to be received   when received or not received it is manifestly incapable of answering its pretended purpose in the one case it is ineffective in the other useless by the english practice in the case of outlawry in the class of causes called civil causes an example may be seen of both these modifications according as it is considered in its application to the one or the other of two descriptions of persons persons out of reach of the pretended notice whether put into that state by latency expatriation or exprovinciation and persons incapable of profiting by it being incapacitated by indigence process of outlawry is a mode of proceeding by which a man is put into the condition of an outlaw to be in that condition is to forfeit all his goods and chattels together with the profits of lands goods and chattels upon the performance of the first ceremony—profits of lands after other ceremonies all of course yielding their fees add to this perpetual imprisonment if he be caught besides other plagues in plenty not worth detailing after these who are the persons whom the partnership has subjected to this fate two descriptions of persons those who have not wherewithal to defend themselves from it that is to employ lawyers to defend them and those who for any cause be they ever so poor or ever so rich happen to be so circumstanced as to be out of the way of receiving the notice not that on this occasion any more than others the condition of poor and rich is exactly upon a par a difference there is and it may easily be imagined in favour of which side a rich man unless he be uncommonly unfortunate can be kept in it only for a time a poor man continues in it for ever and without remedy to put a man in it is a power given to every other who is content to pay the price proceeding in a particular course chalked out for this purpose a man brings an action against you for anything that comes uppermost no matter what it is since it is not necessary that it should have the smallest foundation in fact and if one carried on in this way is not sufficient to ruin you he brings as many more as he pleases the great majority of the people are unable to employ an attorney to defend them respectively in any one such suit much more in any number of such suits increasable without stint consequence—outlawry as above described there are two principal offences to which as already intimated this punishment is annexed one is poverty or rather reference being had to the circumstances of the plaintiff inferiority of affluence the other is expatriation being out of england whether for a mans own business or pleasure or in the public service makes no difference while a soldier is bleeding for his country at the antipodes judges in england have a shop open in which they are ready to sell his liberty with the faculty of destroying his property to any one who will come to them and pay the price for it previously to a mans being sentenced to this punishment a notice in some shape or other must in every case be given to him but it is not necessary that in any case he should have received it he never does receive it it never is intended that he should it is always intended that he should not it is always a sham notice the man is in the east indies the notice consists of a mess of jargon muttered by an attorneys clerk in some office or public house in london† calling     upon the man to appear there or thereabouts in a few days the case in which a man cannot be outlawed for nothing without risk to the person at whose instance this punishment is inflicted on him will help to show if it be necessary to show that it is not for want of knowing how to remedy it that those who profit by this enormity persevere in the commission of it on a criminal prosecution it cannot be practised as above mentioned without risk the necessity of a bill found by the grand jury is the bar to it not that the power given to that sort of court is the real obstacle the real obstacle consists in the oath attached to the testimony without which the bill could not be found i e to the punishment attached to it in case of falsity the same punishment would afford the same security grand jury or no grand jury the observation is necessary otherwise a lawyer would have his answer ready in civili you cannot have the same security against groundless outlawry as you have in criminali because in criminali you have a grand jury and in civili you have none to put an end to this abuse along with many others what is wanted is no jury grand or petty but personal appearance of the plaintiff coram judice for the purpose of examination upon oath in the first instance chapter xiv ninth device—principll of nullification the instruments and operations to which the principle of nullification is in use to be applied may be divided into two classes—nonjudicial and judicial of the nonjudicial class contracts including agreements and conveyances present the most extensive as well as most familiar example these belong not to the present purpose but so close is the analogy what is here said with reference to judicial instruments and operations would without much exception or difference be found applicable to those others applied to a judicial operation or instrument the effect and object of the principle of nullification is according to the most comprehensive description that can be given of it in the case of an operation to cause that to be considered as not having been done which has been done—in the case of an instrument or a clause or portion of an instrument to cause that to be considered as not existing which does exist examples—order from the judge to the party to appear in person at a certain time and place he appears accordingly† this appearance is null and void for this obedience he suffers as if he had not obeyed suffers why because the pleasure of the judge was as he ought to have understood the order being to the contrary that he should not appear in person at that or any other time and place but should employ an attorney to appear instead of him at other times and places defendant proved guilty of a capital crime found so by the jury acquitted afterwards by a judge why because in the description of the crime a lawyer whom the prosecutor was obliged to employ had omitted to employ a particular word which neither legislator nor judge had ever ordered to be employed and which was not in the language for the purpose of giving impunity to the criminal the judge makes the rule pretending to find it ready made on a more particular view the effect of the nullification principle in respect of the ends of justice will be seen to be different and indeed opposite according as it is in favour of the plaintiffs or of the defendants side of the cause that the operation in question has been performed or the instrument in question exhibited   in favour of the defendants side if the suit be a criminal one the object of the suit the application of punishment to the defendant if he be guilty is either prevented altogether or retarded so if it be a noncriminal suit the administration of satisfaction to the plaintiff for example the causing him to receive a sum of money that is his due   in favour of the plaintiffs side if the suit be criminal the effect of the nullification is to cause the defendant to receive punishment and that punishment undue if the suit be noncriminal then on the score of     satisfaction to render to the plaintiff some service and that service undue from causes which lie too wide of the present purpose so it is that—in comparison with the instances in which the operation of it is in favour of the defendants side especially in criminali—those in which it is in favour of the plaintiffs side in such sort as that the defendant shall either on the score of satisfaction or on that of punishment be subjected to a burthen which is not due would be found extremely rare in other words the effect of it is much more frequently to paralyze the force of the law than to give a wrong direction to it this therefore is the effect which in general and unless on special notice to the contrary it will be proper to consider as attached to the application of this principle to which side soever of the cause the operation of the principle applies the effect of it is susceptible of two other distinctions which require to be observed—   it applies either to the whole number of steps taken or about to be taken in the cause or to some part only of that number in the former case the nullification may be said to be complete in the latter case partial† thus in another and fairer and honester as well as pleasanter sort of game the royal game of the goose one sort of unlucky cast throws you back only a part of the way you have made another the whole of it   again where the nullification is complete in some instances it has the effect of operating as a bar—on the plaintiffs side to all ulterior demand to all fresh suit on the same score—on the defendants side to all ulterior defence in other instances not in the former case it may be termed definitive or peremptory in the other case dilatory or temporary or rather nonperemptory another distinction the cause of nullification‡—the pretended irregularity in the operation or the pretended vice or defect in the instrument—may be made to operate backwards only or forwards only or both ways the principle of nullification is what lord bacon would have called a polychrest a constellation of injustices   if the article of substantive law which it serves to frustrate be in the form of statute law it not only contributes to the uncertainty of the law but contributes to undermine the authority of the legislator substituting that of the judge in place of it in the individual case in question it repeals the law of the legislator pro tanto and it serves as an example and an encouragement to judges to repeat such acts of repeal in other instances   although the article of substantive law thus frustrated exist in no other form than that of a rule of jurisprudential law—in other words if it be no more than a sham law made or imagined by a judge without any determinate set of words to put it into instead of an article of oral law made by the legislator in a determinate set of words—in this case though no such advantage is made as in the former case in the way of usurpation yet in the way of uncertainty the advantage is the same the substantive law which was of itself uncertain as being in the form of jurisprudential law is rendered still more so by the shock thus given to the system of adjective law on which its execution depends   it possesses and in a preeminent degree the virtue of an expostfacto law whatever general rule of law is established in the way of jurisprudence that is by judges acting as such is in effect an expostfacto law the mischief of an expostfacto law consists in its being unexpected whence the suffering produced by it is at once inevitable and unnecessary unnecessary since an article of statute law to the same effect would have produced all the good without any of the suffering but what can be so unexpected as that a malefactor should be acquitted because a clerk has written a wrong word   it punishes one man for the fault or the supposed fault of another it punishes the party injured it deprives him of redress because an attorneys clerk or a clerk under the orders of the judge himself has written a word which is supposed to be wrong under the natural system an error being discovered if it were deemed worth correcting it would be corrected and the suit would go on as if there had been no error but under the technical system such correction would not serve the ends of judicature the more foreign the ground is to the merits the more the decision contributes to the giving to the law the desired appearance of a lottery in which a favourable decision is a prize and the tickets the prices paid by plaintiffs and defendants for their respective chances   in all cases of a criminal nature it serves for lodging the power of pardon in hands unknown to the legislator the lower and more numerous the hands so much the better so long as the power of allowing or disallowing the pardon is reserved in the hands of the judge the persons in which this power is     vested are all the persons to whose mistake or supposed mistake this consequence is annexed every attorney or attorneys clerk every official clerk or official clerks clerk if the consequence is settled and the clerk unpunishable the clerk is in respect of this prerogative more of a king than the king himself for the king cannot pardon without the concurrence of at least two other persons and the clerk needs no concurrence but what by the supposition he is sure of a decision which is not grounded on any alleged cause of nullification is said to be grounded on the merits† è converso a decision which is grounded on an alleged cause of nullification‡ is not grounded on the merits under the technical system but more especially under the english edition of it a judge says with equal facility and indifference my decision was grounded on the merits or my decision was not grounded on the merits in some future age such openness will appear hardly credible in each case a shorter phrase might serve—my decision was according to justice or my decision was contrary to justice a decision not grounded on the merits bears upon some ground foreign to the merits—upon some alleged cause of nullification some quirk some quibble when the decision is in favour of the quirk it is then simply and decidedly a decision against the merits yet when it is against the quirk it is only sub modo that it can be said to be in favour of the merits the back of the judge is turned upon the merits not only when he decides in favour of the quibble but at an earlier period viz when he takes upon him to listen to an argument on the subject of the quibble then is it that one offence against justice is committed and if the decision is in favour of the quibble that makes a second offence against justice whether the decision be for or against the quibble—point blank against or to a certain degree in favour of the merits—mischief to the community it will be seen is produced advantage to the man of law when it is for the quibble a portion of mischief it will be seen is produced over and above what is produced in the other case but it would be an error were it supposed that by a decision pronounced against the quibble any sacrifice is made of the ends of judicature of the interests of the partnership that the service habitually rendered to that interest may be at its maximum it is necessary it will be seen that the instances in which the decision is against the quibble and so far for the merits should be frequent equality is as good a proportion as any other it is where the numbers of decisions for and against the quibble are seen to be equal that the uncertainty is at its maximum and uncertainty is the mother of argument that is of business suppose the question were whether the length of your nose should operate as a reason for depriving you of a sum of money proved to be due to you and suppose the decision in the affirmative would the injustice commence with the decision no surely it would commence with the argument or to speak strictly with the token whatever it were by which it had been manifested that arguments pro and con on that question would be heard the exemplification may appear ludicrous but the purpose of it is a grave purpose among the quibbles on the ground of which decisions have been given against the merits enough might be found in which the distance from the merits was not less and in which the mischief done by the contempt put upon the merits was even more considerable if in that case the outrage to justice present itself at first view as more flagrant than in these it is only because in that case the colour of the ground is new for which purpose it was chosen in those others old and the eye familiarized with it fancy not that if a premium had been offered to him who should invent the most absurd ground of nullification the most flagrant injustice that could be committed on this ground anything more absurd or more flagrantly unjust could have been invented than those quirks sometimes successful sometimes unsuccessful which are to be found in such abundance in the books∥     true it is that in the station of a judge injustice can never be done without a something in the character of a ground or reason equally true it is that in that station nothing can be imagined more irrational than what in the character of a ground or reason has been made and may continue to be made to serve fancy not that if it had happened to the nasal reason to form the ground of a decision reported in good lawfrench the decision with its ground would have been defended with less pertinacity or spoken of with less reverence than any of those others which form so large a portion of the chaos called in lawyers language common law as to the uses of this device the catalogue of them has already been in great part seen in the catalogue of the mischiefs use   making business viz pro hâc vice this use as already observed is the more peculiar fruit of the process of temporary nullification in contradistinction to peremptory but even where it is peremptory the argument in that same cause is the fruit of the principle and this whether the irrelevant objection be allowed or disallowed since on that ground at any rate had it not been for the principle there would have been no argument use   nursing uncertainty—the perennial source of made business flowing from the land of quirks and quibbles—in all future cases but as to this use see further under the head of the principle of jargonization use   establishing and supporting arbitrary power see further chap xxiii doublefountain principle use   blinding the legislator rendering the law unintelligible to him putting it out of his power to see what is going forward to form to himself any clear conception either of what ought to be done or of what is done see again the jargonization principle use   awestriking as well as blinding the people causing them to regard complaint as groundless and hopeless and injurious and culpable deterring them thus from complaint howsoever intense their sufferings—see again the jargonization principle use   repelling the eye of the legislator by disgust see once more the jargonization principle use   securing a fund of popularity this use is confined to the criminal branch of the law the effect produced by the principle when thus applied being the acquittal of malefactors such has been the success of hypocrisy in this line that the deluded people have learnt to regard with sentiments of love and reverence and gratitude instead of indignation the treachery of those ministers of justice who by the help of this capital engine of iniquity have persevered in the habit of giving aid and impunity to all sorts of malefactors if an advantage so much greater than at the outset could naturally have been expected contributed little or nothing to the creation of the technical system it contributes at any rate in no small degree to the preservation of it under this delusion—the more illgrounded and whether ill or wellgrounded the more excessive the lots of punishment are which stand attached to acts prohibited under the name of crimes—the more eager are the people to see this surreptitious and anticonstitutional power of pardon thus employed in eating out the very heart of the substantive branch of the law hence a sort of auxiliary device and resource of the technical system consists in adding in all practicable ways to the atrocity of the penal system pouring out punishment as from a cornucopiæ or a pandoras box without regard to proportion or demand this may be done in either of two ways either by applying to the legislator and getting fresh statutes or without any such trouble by jurisprudential construction screwing up misdemeanours into felonies till at last there comes to be but one sort of offence and that a capital one it is thus that under the auspices of hypocrisy ambition and cruelty play into one anothers hands by double iniquity a man renders himself double service by breaking the law he receives the blessings of the people for his humanity when by making it he has received their veneration for his love of justice advice to judges when a case of compassion presents itself and the more atrocious the penal system the more frequently will cases of that stamp present themselves instead of recommending to mercy get the defendant off by a quirk the defendant for example has stolen thirtynine guineas recommend it to the jury to value them at as many shillings observe now how many points you will compass by this one stroke you reap the seven advantages already mentioned and besides all that you cherish in the bosom of the people the habit of regarding with affection and respect the vice which is one of the main engines of your system and cherish at the same time the habit of blind obsequiousness in the bosom of your rivals the juries     if—you being on the ministerial side as it is most natural for you to be—the author of a real or supposed crime particularly obnoxious to administration comes under prosecution and an attempt is made to save him by a quirk you have a choice to make on the one hand you see the service you may do to your party by a due execution of the laws on the other hand the service you may render to your partnership by the violation of them your choice will depend upon existing circumstances but it is a pleasant sort of a dilemma not to be able to stir a step without reaping an advantage the popularity gained by this principle in criminal cases will serve you for the support and defence of it in that other class of cases noncriminal cases in which the favour of the public does not extend to it in these fat cases the advantage reaped from the principle is much more substantial than in those other meagre ones in criminal cases at least in nineteen instances out of twenty the defendant is mere skin and bone the plaintiff called prosecutor little better the effect of the flaw too is commonly peremptory or it would not be worth noticing or worth making in noncriminal called civil cases costs come frequently out of the estate and be that as it may the parties may be of any degree of opulence here then you make the effect of the flaw but temporary and the quantity of business which the cause affords is thereby doubled the grosser and more abundant the pretences for nullification the more easily may business be made without the expense of treachery on the part of the professional assistants of the party who suffers by the flaw and in this case compared with the other the encouragement to such treachery is much more inviting and more pure many a man who would not charge his conscience with the destruction of the innocent or even in a matter purely civil with the final sacrifice of a clients righteous cause will be restrained by no such scruple from the lending a hand to the manufacture of a little extra business by a slip too natural to attract notice in england as elsewhere the body of the laws may be divided into two parts the beneficial and the pernicious nowhere will the existence of the distinction be disputed no not even among lawyers since what little there is in it that tends to the reduction of delay vexation and expense may even in the estimate of an official panegyrist make sure of a station on the lefthand side no man that will not admit the reality of the division no two men who would draw the line exactly in the same place in england however the distinction is more marked than perhaps in any other country the cause may be found in the mixed nature of the constitution and the stages through which it has passed in its ascent to its present elevation be the constitutional law of the country what it may the tenor and fabric of the law must ever be favourable to the interests and wishes of the individuals who for the time being are in possession of power favourable to them proportionally adverse and unfavourable to all whose interests run not in the same channel with theirs hence taking the whole fabric together there will exist continually on the two opposite sides so many perpetual and perpetually opposite contentions and endeavours—on the side of those in power to strengthen the system—on the side of those out of power to weaken it the system imagined by the manichæans for the government of the physical and moral world is thus exemplified in fact in the ordering of the concerns of the political world excellent as the constitution is in its materials and capabilities supported as no doubt it has every now and then been by truly heroic exertions of public virtue—neither wisdom nor virtue nor the union of both will go any considerable length in accounting for the details of it the features in it on which we pride ourselves with so much reason and on which we may felicitate ourselves with so much more reason are to be considered rather as diagonals resulting from the conflicting forces of personal interest than as perpendiculars erected by virtue on the basis of wisdom the struggles between parties have frequently been struggles for existence when existence is at stake all other objects are eclipsed by it everything bends to the present emergency when the adjective branch of the system is weakened in any part the weakness extends to the substantive branch in toto when the foundation of a house decays the danger extends to everything that is above but when immediate destruction is in prospect no price can be too great that holds out a hope of present safety when law is against men men will be against law if by a flaw introduced into the texture of the system of procedure a precious life which otherwise might have fallen may be saved any future mischief that may by contingency creep in at the flaw makes no impression on the mind the beam i introduce to support a falling house may be pregnant with the dry rot but if the house would fall without an immediate prop and there is no other within reach the beam goes up of course all thought of the dry rot is put aside the sacrifice of future contingent good to greater present good is reconcileable to the dictates of the purest wisdom what the dry rot is to a house the principle of nullification—the   0 principle according to which decisions are pronounced on grounds foreign to the merits—is to the system of adjective law and the system of substantive law which rests upon it it is applicable to the purpose of saving from the power of the law any sort of person be he who he may so he be for the moment exposed to its penalties the corrupt placeman who abuses the powers of government or the patriot who opposes his resistance to the abuse when in a penal case on a ground foreign to the merits the decision is against the merits it destroys pro tanto in the individual case in question the power of the substantive law it destroys the power of a bad—it destroys the power of a good law considering it in the light of a perpetually applicable and allextensive principle is it not however capable of meriting upon the whole the appellation of a beneficial one in idea yes but upon what supposition upon this that in the substance of the penal system taken together there is more evil than good in other words that it would be more for the advantage of the country to have no penal laws at all than such as are actually in force upon any other upon this other that the good and the evil being in equal proportions the application of the nullifying principle is more likely to fall upon the evil than the good on either of the above suppositions but on no other is the nullifying principle this favourite and ever busy principle anything better than an execrable nuisance but for either of these suppositions is there any the smallest ground the true remedy is what so obvious the pen is almost ashamed to write it to rid the substantive system of the peccant matter not to introduce into the adjective system a principle of debility by which the efficacy of the good and bad is reduced together and alike when wilkes the victim of the court and the idol of the populace was prosecuted for the two writings one of which had been the cause of the resentment and the other furnished the means of gratifying it—in the instance of this delinquent as of every other the licensed accessaries after the fact consulting the oracle of chicane betook themselves to the principle of nullification for the means of safety their researches presented to them in one of the legal instruments one of those imaginary flaws on which inquity under the mask of humanity has bestowed the power of rescuing delinquency from the pressure of the law but the demon to whom even in mischief all certainty is odious had provided an instrument by which if applied in time flaws of that kind may be closed not amended the flaw would have been a fatal one but to flaws of this description power had been in the habit of applying a remedy addressed in proper form the judge lord mansfield substituted the valid slang to the invalid slang immediately westminister hall was in an uproar what could not be done by reason was to be done by noise and calumny the forgerer who inserts a word in a deed alters it the judge who amends a record alters it the cry was he has altered the record and what you were to understand was that he had committed an act of forgery on it to the enabling the partnership to turn to the best account the principle of nullification the form of jurisprudential law was indispensably necessary without the aid of that deceptitious form something might indeed have been done by so convenient a principle but nothing in comparison with what has been done as in the substantive branch so in this adjective branch the law if it had not been in the form of jurisprudential would have been in the form of statute law in that case whatsoever it had required to be done in the course of the cause by either party suppose the plaintiff—whatever operation it had required to be performed—of whatever tenor purport or effect it had required an instrument on this or that occasion to be delivered—it would have given a description of that operation of that instrument and if on pain of nullity intending that such should be the consequence of failure it would have given warning to that effect of the legislator except in so far as it might happen to him to be corrupted or deceived by the man of law the object would of course be to render such failures as rare as     possible to that end he would as surely have pursued the course just mentioned whatever on each occasion his pleasure were he would have declared it if it be your wish that your servant should go on an errand to a particular place you tell him so mentioning the place you do not unless you are perfectly assured of his knowing already leave it to him to guess that you want him to go on an errand and to what place of the partnership for the sake of the profit drawn in by means of the principle of nullification by the reiteration of operations and instruments together with the other less prominent advantages the object was of course to make such failures as frequent as possible their first and constant care accordingly was that no such directions should ever be given the foundation a foundation not the less sure for being negative having thus been laid for these failures—causes of failure and consequent grounds of nullification were built in infinite numbers upon the foundation so laid day by day the party in the right was punished—punished with the loss of his due because his lawyer had omitted to fulfil directions which lest they should be complied with had been omitted to be declared to him or so much as to be framed the directions which should save the suitor from being deprived of his due by his own lawyer where are they to be found upon the blade of the sword that balaam wished for this was not yet enough while a was punished for the disobedience of b to the unuttered and unutterable directions care was taken to place them out of the danger of being guessed at absurdity and inconsistency figures which cost as little to the english lawyer as prose did to monsieur jourdan secured this point without difficulty in punishing one man for anothers not having done so and so it was not possible to avoid altogether the giving of some sort of description how inadequate soever of that for the not doing of which the punishment was inflicted a description of this sort though on the occasion of the cause in hand and in the character of a direction too late to be of use might yet if committed to memory or writing supply in some sort as far as it went the place of a direction in some future contingent cause though not itself a law a general law it might to him who should be diligent and fortunate enough to catch it and preserve it answer in some sort the purpose of a law a professional lawyer having nothing to do in the cause would for his own instruction or on a commercial speculation in the view of the profit to be made by selling the information to others commit every now and then to paper and eventually publish in a suitable mass a body of instruction of this sort thus collected it is thus that the sort of discourse has gradually been accumulated which by an abuse of words peculiar to the english language has under the common denomination of law been confounded with the genuine expression of the will of a legitimate legislator of this nature at least is the largest and least bad part of the materials that enter into the composition of it a collection of imaginary laws which had they been real would have been expostfacto laws had these spurious laws been of a rational complexion conformable to and such as would naturally have deen dictated by a regard to the ends of justice—had they been such as if framed and communicated in such manner as to afford a possibility of complying with them would have been conducive to those ends—had they at the same time been regularly committed to writing and made public—little by little in the course of a few centuries the mass of sham and spurious law so formed might to the effect of preventing such failures have though in a very imperfect and incongruous manner supplied to the extent of it at each point of time the place of genuine law little by little the pitfalls so carefully left in the field of law would have been filled up as in the siege of a fortified town the ditch has sometimes been filled up by the bodies of the slaughtered the ideal laws the quasi laws thus formed being each of them conformable to the ends of justice would have been consistent with one another the place of promulgation might in some sort have been supplied by analogy from two such already made laws put together a suitor might have learned upon occasion to foresee a future one in like manner though unhappily not with equal certainty as from two angles of any triangle the mathematician knows how to deduce the third this possibility was to be avoided and the avoidance of it was not difficult the more absurd a decision is the more impossible it would have been to divine it and the more irreconcilably repugnant to each other two decisions are the more impossible it is to deduce from them a third accordingly the wit of man never has devised nor under the stimulus of the highest premium would be capable of devising absurdities and inconsistencies grosser than are to be found in what are called the books in such disastrous abundance how could a cover for injustice be ever wanting when it had been made known by every days practice that a syllable wrong written or pretended to be wrong written by a lawyers clerk was enough to make the client lose his due would you see a short proof of two propositions at once that the nullification principle     is a mere instrument of iniquity and that by those who are in the constant use of it it is known to be so behold it in this one circumstance in a variety of instances a flaw being suspected—a flaw that if not amended in time might it is supposed subject the instrument to nullification—application is made and permission granted for the amendment of it the permission when thus granted is it made use of not it indeed why should it the defect being an imaginary one amendment is of no use the flaw being a sham the amendment may be so too as on another stage a sham sore leg is cured by a sham remedy defect amendment argument deliberation—everything is a sham but the iniquity and the pillage uncured the flaw would have made business cured it makes business likewise cure or no cure what matters it so it produce equal business chapter xv tenth device—mendacitylicence §   mendacitylicence what the licence given to mendacity being one of the most efficient articles in the list of jurisprudential devices it is particularly necessary to be clear and distinct in the explanation of it under the feegathering system falsehood wilful falsehood was by the judge and the rest of the partnership found at a very early period to be on many occasions a necessary and on all occasions a useful instrument in their hands to aid them in their pursuit of the ends of judicature it accordingly became a capital and constant object with them to neglect no means or opportunity of applying it to this its use in whatsoever instances falsehood being known and wilful appears to have been habitually uttered either by the judge himself or by others with his allowance or under his compulsion to the advancement of the ends of judicature as opposed to the ends of justice—what is so uttered and done may be said to be done under the mendacitylicence the mendacitylicence has been in some instances acted under—in some instances assumed acted under where the falsehood uttered has been uttered by one of the parties that is under the exclusion put upon the parties by his professional assistants acting as such assumed where the person by whom it has been uttered has been the judge himself or any of his official instruments and subordinates the case where it has been assumed is the case of fiction—legal fiction it will be spoken to under that head in the case where the licence has been acted under it has been acted under either by choice or by compulsion—compulsion imposed by the judge in the former case the licence is a simple licence created by permission in the other case to the simple permission has been superadded a command a virtual one at least punishment applied to produce the effect of a command in the present chapter our concern is with the falsehoods which are simply permitted when in regard to a practice of any kind which on most occasions or to most persons stands prohibited the intention is that on certain particular occasions or by some particular persons it shall be practised if they please—there is no other mode than the taking off in those particular instances the punishment by which in the other instances the prohibition is created or enforced unless over and above such forbearance or exception a declaration were issued expressly permitting and authorizing the practice in the cases to which the permission was meant to extend itself an act which in the case here in question would be as indecorous not to say perilous as it would be needless for securing truth veracity correctness and completeness in testimony when to produce these effects has really been the wish and endeavour of men in the character of legislators or judges the expedient employed has been punishment in some shape or other attaching upon each violation of that important duty punishment in whatsoever way attached to the breach of this duty being a known and obvious and obviously and confessedly necessary means of providing for the observance of it where the intention has been that it should be observed—wheresoever this necessary means has been forborne to be employed a presumption not far short of certainty has been afforded that the forbearance has been intentional having for its object to promote the utterance of the falsehood by operating as a licence when it appears that for a course of ages personal advantage has been continually reaped from this forbearance by those by whom it has been practised this presumption is converted into a certainty or what is little short of it by mendacity on the part of an extraneous witness nothing was to be gained by the man of law on the other hand by the detection and supposed prevention of mendacity in that quarter something was to be gained viz the reputation of discernment and of a laudable zeal for justice accordingly by virtue of a general rule extraneous witnesses were to be subjected to examination—made to give answers to interrogatories—and by way of a security for the truth of such answers the sanction of an oath was called in and punishment annexed to the breach of it by the     intervention of an oath promising veracity mendacity committed in breach of that promise was thus converted into perjury—testimonial perjury and to the offence thus denominated a lot of punishment such as was deemed competent was annexed the case of the parties was in this respect widely different by mendacity in this quarter a great deal was to be gained care accordingly was taken that the check applied to such practice in the other case should not extend to this by receiving mendacious statements as grounds for inquiry inquiries in abundance would thus be instituted—inquiries which had the mendacious statements been prevented or the falsehood of them detected at the outset would not have had existence groundless demands on one hand groundless defences on the another were thus invited and admitted without stint in the present case however for rendering the licence complete and effectual the mere suspension or abolition of factitious punishment applied professedly for that purpose and under the name of punishment would not have been sufficient had the natural system of procedure and in particular that feature of it which consists in the meeting of the parties at the outset in the presence of the judge been adhered to the natural punishment attaching in the shape of present shame upon convicted or suspected mendacity would in no inconsiderable degree have operated with the effect and supplied the place of all factitious punishment the clearing the feegathering or technical system of so powerful an obstacle to its success as that initial meeting was therefore a necessary preliminary to the establishment of the mendacitylicence over and above its other uses from the earliest ages of political society wilful falsehood on the part of an individual speaking in the character of a witness for the information of a judge had met with powerful checks the utterance of the testimony being accompanied with the ceremony of an oath the falsehood took the name of perjury and was punished by the gods having this mark set upon it it came to be regarded with horror at least if not always pursued by punishment among men if a statement thus stained and sooner or later seen to be stained by falsehood being exhibited by the plaintiff were seen to be in danger of experiencing this treatment—a plaintiff who to his own knowledge had no merits and whose prospects of success depended on the weariness or poverty or absence of the defendant the mendacity of hired or dependent witnesses or the imbecility or improbity of the judge might shrink from the attempt and so vice versâ in the case of a dishonest defendant to encourage enterprise on the one side perseverance on either what was to be done a sham distinction was to be made to exhibit false testimony the ceremony of an oath having been employed to insure the verity of it would indeed be perjury but what a plaintiff says what a defendant says is not testimony but allegation not being testimony the sanction of an oath will not with propriety attach upon it the sanction of an oath not attaching upon it be it ever so false it is not perjury but not being perjury it is not anything that has a name no longer the crime of a man—of an impious and wicked man—it is little more than the failing the venial failing of a child refusing to everything that comes either from the plaintiff or from the defendant the name of testimony and by that means in case of falsity the name and tremendous consequences of perjury—withdrawing it in a word by that means altogether out of the reach of punishment we grant a licence we annex rewards to mendacity to what otherwise would be perjury in so far as it can contribute to the continuance or the number of those contentions by which it thrives divested of that security for veracity were the discourse of a plaintiff or a defendant recognised as divested of all title to credit and as such unfit to be acted upon in any way and by anybody the invention would not answer its purpose but here comes in another distinction to our aid credit is not due to allegation for the purpose of giving termination to the cause credit the fullest and most unreserved and unquestionable credit is due to it and shall be given to it by us for the purpose of giving continuance and commencement to a cause were we to see and to be known to see that what the plaintiff at the very outset of his demand says in support of it is void of truth there could be no pretence for calling upon the defendant to make answer to it at so premature a period therefore let it be our care to know nothing about the matter to rest in convenient and impartial equipoise to take it for true and not true for not true to the purpose of giving in favour of the plaintiff a termination to the cause for true to the purpose of calling upon the defendant for an answer to it which in the same manner shall be both true and not true and so by the blessing of providence giving continuance to the cause comparing allegation with testimony it is curious enough to observe the difference between appearance and reality—between what is said to take place and what actually does     take place according to the language and perhaps the conception of the man of law nothing is done by the law without proof mere allegation without proof goes for nothing in reality allegation without proof has more effect is much surer of its effect than proof itself—than proof of the nature of testimony than proof by deposition for example of what is ranked under the names of proof deposition testimony the effect depends altogether upon its being believed disbelieved it has not any upon the conduct of the judge or the fate of the adversary of what is delivered in character of allegation mere allegation the effect is exactly the same whether it be believed or no where the suitor and his professional assistants behold in the employment of such licence a means especially if the only means of pursuing their respective ends—if in their respective bosoms the force of the improbityrestraining interests be not sufficient to restrain them from the pursuit of the ends in question by such means their availing themselves of the licence is a result that follows of course where on whatever prospect of advantage a man proposes to himself to prefer against another a demand of the groundlessness of which in point of fact he himself is conscious if at the same time according to the formularies in use on that occasion it is necessary that on that occasion he should utter any assertions general or special which the demand being groundless fail in some respect or other of quadrating with the truth in such case falsehood in some shape or other is necessary both to him and to his lawyer in the pursuit of their respective ends for without the falsehood the suit by the supposition could not be carried on the client would therefore stand debarred from the advantage whatever it be which he looks for from the suit and the man of law from the profit attached to the sale of his assistance on this occasion it is not necessary to be particular in the delineation of the various shapes in which advantage from demands known to be altogether groundless may present itself and be reaped if the object demanded possess of itself a value possession of that object will constitute the advantage if the object demanded be even altogether destitute of value still under the technical system it follows not by any means that the suit should not be provided with any substantial and intelligible advantage is the defendant in a state of comparative indigence he may be ruined is he opulent be he as opulent as crœsus he may at any rate be tormented so if the professed object be the real object of the suit and the value of it considerable to any amount means are not wanting by which without the shadow of a title it may be possessed if the defendant be at once rich and resolute it may happen that nothing less than perjury may present an adequate prospect beforehand but if his condition be that of relative indigence that is if it surpass not the condition of ninetenths of the people perjury may be a mere waste of wickedness and danger the mere expenses of defence natural and factitious together especially with the help of a timid frame of mind may be sufficient to ensure success §   mendacitylicence in what cases granted in certain cases in regard to certain instruments and discourses it suited the interests of the partnership that the liberty granted by the mendacitylicence should have place that mendacity should go unpunished in certain other cases not when it suited their interests that it should be more frequent they encouraged it when it suited their interests that it should be less frequent they discouraged it the effect of the licence may be considered as produced in either of two ways—  the allowance general—the prohibition and punishment particular and operating in the way of exception to the general rule or   the prohibition and punishment general and the allowance particular operating in the way of exception to that general rule it may be considered as constituting the exception or it may be considered as constituting the rule mendacity to all who have not a special interest in the promoting of that vice is a thing so odious—and to every eye but a lawyers so intimately connected with injustice     so hostile to justice—that in regard to every sort of discourse bearing relation to justice the obvious course seems to be to regard the prohibition of mendacity as constituting the general rule the allowance as an exception—a rare unheeded unintended and even unwelcome and lamented exception yet in comparison with the cases in which prohibition and punishment bear upon it so great is the extent of the cases in which neither punishment nor prohibition nor anything but encouragement sometimes by simple permission added to the natural advantage sometimes even by positive compulsion bears upon it—in a word the exception if it be one is so extensive that a man may well be at a loss on which side to place the rule on this occasion as on every other the problem was as we have seen how to produce most profit with least infringement upon ease exaction of heavy fees heavy with relation to the general pecuniary ability in those early times when money as well as moneys worth was so scarce had the double effect of increasing profit and diminishing labour at the same time increasing profit in proportion to the number of those who being able to pay the price take upon themselves the expensive character of suitors diminishing labour in proportion to the multitude of the vulgar herd the bulk of the people who unable to pay the price gave up their chance for justice the quantum of profit which on each occasion it might be worth while to accept from each suitor in the shape of fees being thus settled—the price of the commodity being thus fixed—the greater the number of those who put in for their chance for it the better the first idea seems to have been that the more universal the allowance to mendacity was the better the first arrangement accordingly appears to have been that of an universal mendacitylicence to all mankind no distinction as yet in that respect between parties and extraneous witnesses the proof is that afterwards—when in the case of an extraneous witness mendacity came to be punished—punished it then was as still it continues to be no otherwise than through the medium of the ceremony of an oath no oath no perjury—no perjury no punishment for mendacity—and in the time of edward i at any rate and probably for centuries later no such ceremony as that now in use under the name of an oath was employed—employed in the commonlaw courts on any such occasion as that of receiving the vivâ voce testimony of an extraneous witness at the same time no want of mention of perjury but the perjury then in question was the perjury of the juror of the judge of this or that other official person—of anybody but the witness this in the commonlaw courts meantime the ecclesiastical courts were in vigour and they taking their law from papal rome in which the profit of which writing is so fruitful had always been made the most of went on administering testimonial oaths and punishing the breach of them under the name of perjury from this practice compared with the commonlaw practice the idea of a sort of composition or middle course seems to have been deduced a happy temperament increasing the number of bonâ fide demands and defences without diminishing the number of malâ fide ones if we administer an oath to the parties and thus in case of mendacity on their part punish them as for perjury the truth will come out at the first meeting and there will be an end of the cause no lying excuses no perpetual renovation of delays and fees by alternate absentations† let us therefore confine the oath with its eventual punishment and present discouragement of mendacity to extraneous witnesses these need not shall not come upon the stage till the fifth act leaving the four first acts for the torment and pillage of the parties whose averments being open to the objection of interest and being not upon oath shall no longer in the character of testimony be listened to giving this new security for veracity and thence for justice we shall increase the honest part of our custom without prejudice to the dishonest part we shall increase the number of our bonâ fide customers whose expectation of success being founded in truth they will in the security thus given for truth behold an increased probability in their favour continuing to allow to the averments true or false on the plaintiffs side the effect of giving commencement to the suit in confidence of the inability of the defendant to go on with it—and on the defendants side that of giving continuance to it for the purpose of staving off the evil day or in confidence of the plaintiffs inability to go on with it—we shall experience no diminution no equivalent diminution at least in the number of our malâ fide customers‡     thus stood the matter in the commonlaw courts meantime the equity courts a new class of courts peculiar to england hit upon a further refinement a yet more extended application of the oath a further increase to the number of bonâ fide litigants on the plaintiffs side and still without any equivalent diminution in the number of malâ fide litigants on either side the practice of writing had by this time received considerable extension writing the fruitful mother of fees had become familiar to the man of law let us give to the bonâ fide plaintiff said they the advantage of extracting from his adversary under the sanction of an oath his unwilling testimony—on condition that the examination shall not be performed vivâ voce in our presence in which case the cause being ended almost as soon as begun would afford no fees but in writing and that on both sides reserving to the malâ fide plaintiff whose object is to oppress his less opulent adversary by the weight of vexation and expense the faculty of telling a story which as often as he has no sufficient truth to ground it upon may be groundless but which on the supposition of its being true might afford a just cause for the commencement of the suit let the plaintiff by his bill tell his story the longer the better and put his questions the more of them the better in writing and not upon oath the defendant by his answer gives his responses and in giving them tells his story the longer the better also in writing but under the sanction of an oath all this while it is only from one of the parties that there will be any chance of truth as between those two the truth may be half told but it will be no more than half told so much the better if it be the misfortune of the defendant to stand in need of the testimony of the plaintiff this gives the benefit of a cross cause in which the parties exchange characters the defendant of today the plaintiff of tomorrow another bill another answer another cause had the examination been performed vivâ voce by the one party on the other in the presence of the judge each being as much present as the other—both causes original cause and cross cause would have been dispatched at once both of them would have been as good as lost to us lawyer—mighty fine all this in good truth but what is it you have been about all this while you have been confounding two quite different things assertion and proof pleading and evidence and on this confusion rests your argument evidence is worth nothing without oath accordingly it is never received but upon oath but pleading is not evidence what need therefore of its being upon oath nonlawyer—pardon me nothing has been confounded that the nature of things has separated proof that sort of proof which consists of testimony what is it but assertion and assertion if it be pertinent and sufficiently particular as to time place and so forth the assertor speaking of the fact as being the subject of his belief or having come within his own knowledge—assertion come from whence it will what is there in it that should prevent it from being received as evidence no sir it is not by the nature of things but by your partnership and for the purposes above stated that the distinction has been made call it evidence in one case call it pleading in another it is still neither more nor less than assertion in both cases whence then sprung the distinction from the views which led the partnership to grant or continue the mendacitylicence in one case to withhold it in the other where the licence was to be granted assertion became pleading where the licence was to be withholden assertion was evidence lawyer—and so sir you have persuaded yourself or wish to persuade others that what you are pleased to call the mendacitylicence extends to every assertion that belongs to the head of pleading—to every assertion that does not belong to the head of evidence know sir then that in a number of cases in equity as well as at common law—in short wherever it has been thought proper which is as much as to say wherever it is proper—the sanction of an oath has     been required to be attached and is constantly attached to assertions made by a party made by a plaintiff as such and coming on in the course of the pleadings and not of evidence there is the affidavit annexed to the bill of discovery there is— nonlawyer—yes sir there they are indeed there they are in the books you need not trouble yourself but do you think the credit of your partnership will be much served by these exceptions these thinly scattered exceptions verily verily they do nothing better for you than to use your own expression the fixing you with notice by what reasons will you justify yourselves in withholding the licence in these few cases by none though you were to look for them till doomsday but such as condemn you for granting it in the rest such whereby in every case in which you have granted it your conduct stands condemned it is not then but that the necessity there is of the same security for truth in the one case as in the other is sufficiently understood among you and has been over and over again brought to view what you do then for the encouragement of falsehood of that falsehood which is so profitable to you you do with your eyes open and whatsoever forgiveness you may ever hope for it will not be on the ground of your not knowing what you do that you can expect to obtain it in a word—call it pleading call it what you will—in the whole course of the cause from the writ to the execution there is not one assertion made there is not a scrap of paper or parchment scratched upon to which the effect of evidence is not regularly attached take the writ it is on the ground of the assertion contained in it or on no ground at all that the defendant is compelled to appear as you call it that is to employ an attorney and so on till the cause has run its course take the declaration—it is on the ground of the assertions true and false contained in it that the defendant is compelled either to put in his plea and so on through the several operations prescribed to be performed on his side of the cause or in failure of any of them to lose his cause—that is to be put in as bad a condition as he could have been put in by any the most conclusive mass of evidence and now sir say if it be your pleasure say if it can be of any use to you that pleading is not evidence if when thus applied the word evidence be altogether insupportable to learned ears imitate the admiring critic who speaking of popes pastorals confessed they were not pastorals but said they were something better say that it is not evidence but something more conclusive carelessly as the account of the sins of the partnership is kept by the public mind still as the account swells this or that device must every now and then be practised for the purpose of rubbing them out or covering them flaming indignation for example kindled by a sham plea and a miserable attorney made into a scapegoat immolated in great ceremony a sham plea as if in the whole chaos of pleas there were a single plea that under the mendacitylicence in the mouth of any one who thought fit to employ it as such might not equally be a sham one the plea too thus singled out for infamy what is it it is one of the least guilty ones a lot of gibberish by which the intended effect delay is produced at the expense of a few words and the profit upon those few words were it a hundred times the length such as the archsacrificator has drawn a hundred times over with his own sacred hands—a hundred times as long and equally void of truth—it would not be called a sham one if in any instance there be anything worse in a plea called a sham plea than in a plea not put upon the sham list it is this viz that the sham plea so called being capable of being interposed between the declaration and the sham plea not so called while those of the latter stamp cannot be thus added ad libitum the lesser plague though by itself the lesser is so much superadded to the greater one this supposition is it often is it ever verified inquire who list that have curiosity and patience of this grimace what is the practical lesson—the learn we hence that john bull is to lay up in his mind a preachment on the text by which any abuse at pleasure is metamorphosed into a blessing corruptio optimi fil pessima the system perfection as far as anything human admits perfection the system perfect but man frail and some men are attorneys the rules admirable but irregularities violations of these rules now and then committed everything good asscribed to the rules everything bad to the violations to keep up the delusion of the people and maintain in their bosoms the habit of ascribing to the arbiters of their fate that love of justice the existence of which in such a situation is not in human nature—it was necessary that from time to time the appearance of punishing iniquity should be kept up and that here and there a delinquent though a partner in the firm should be sacrificed in ceremony on the altar of offended justice but to take the victim from that class of lawyers from whom the judges themselves are taken would stamp a mark of suspicion at least upon the judicial character itself matters are accordingly so ordered that whatever malpractice recognised as such takes place shall be the act of the attorney and whatever profit is to be derived     from mendacity and iniquity shall drop pure into the lap of the advocate without danger or punishment even in the shape of shame the attorney is thus made to act the part of scapegoat for the benefit of the advocate and through him of the judge what is the plain truth that the system is rotten at the core that the system is the cause of almost every iniquity practised almost every suffering sustained that whatever is done amiss by any of the partners in the firm is to be ascribed not to the individual but to the partnership itself that when the attorney is wicked it is for the same reason that his censor or any one else is wicked—because the system makes him so and that as to the rules the mischiefs of violation are as nothing compared with the mischiefs of observance if there were any use in quarrelling with water for running downwards or with sparks for flying upwards against which of the two classes should men direct their reproaches on this score against the class which acts under this system or against the class that sits above it and upholds it against the class which knows not what it is to find itself within the bar of either house or the class which divides its time between the woolsack and the bench against the class against which the eye of constant suspicion points itself or against a class to whose words all ears are attention all hands obsequious to estimate the true temperature if it were worth while of the indignation excited by a sham plea inquire whether the judge by whom you see it manifested is not of the number of those who know their way to parliament if yes observe that to bar it out with all its fellows there needs nothing but an oath that familiar too familiar instrument by which so many of its fellows have been barred out already think of this then draw your inference §   uses of the mendacitylicence to judge and co without the help of writing in the use made of the mendacitylicence two distinguishable applications may be noted one independent of the art of writing the other grounded on the practice of that art and proportioned to the abuse of it not but that in the cases where even without the help of that art the licence might with reference to the partnership have had its use that use has from the abuse made of the art received prodigious increase the use that is not absolutely and completely dependent on the practice of writing is that which consists in the encouragement and consequent birth given to malâ fide litigation—litigation which on the part of the malâ fide litigant is accompanied with the consciousness of the injustice of his cause in litigation the mala fides may have place either on the side of the plaintiff or on the side of the defendant wherever to subject an adversary to the vexation and expense of a course of litigation nothing more is requisite than a bare assertion unaccompanied with any security for the truth of it—any man at the mere expense of a lie has it in his power to subject any other at pleasure to whatsoever vexation and expense it may be in his power to introduce into that distressful state and that without so much as a shadow of right as easily and safely as upon the clearest title the plaintiff it is true cannot engage the defendant in that course without first plunging into it himself but the quantum of vexation and expense attached to it on one side compared with what is attached to it on the other is susceptible of all manner of proportion and a man will not engage in it in the character of plaintiff but in those cases in which comparing the probable amount of his own vexation and expense with that of the proposed defendant he sees in it a prospect of clear advantage to himself upon the whole and to the possible number of these cases there is no limit require of him an assertion of one sort or another according as the particular facts on which he grounds his demand are or are not represented by him as having fallen under his own immediate cognizance exacting from him at the same time for the verity or at least for the veracity of such his assertions such security as in other cases for example in the case of an extraneous witness is regarded as sufficient you thus nip in the bud all malâ fide demands the comparatively few excepted in which for the chance of the coveted profit of successful mendacity a man will be content to subject himself to the risk in like manner if at the like small expense any man at whose charge a burdensome service of any kind payment of a debt for example is demanded has it in his power to oppose a temporary bar at any rate with or without the probability of a perpetual bar to the burden sought to be imposed upon him to the burden for example of paying such debt the licence so given to dishonesty is for the time for which it holds good complete and universal as truly so as any other licence can be rendered so by law exact on the contrary from the defendants side an assertion correspondent to that just spoken of in regard to the plaintiffs side together with the like security for veracity—you make in the number of malâ fide defences a reduction proportionable to that made in the number of malâ fide demands in the other case all this is at the same time so perfectly incontestable and so extremely obvious that it     may be pronounced morally impossible that those judges who at an early period of jurisprudential history exempted parties from the obligation imposed in respect of veracity upon extraneous witnesses could have acted with any other view than that of giving the encouragement the immense and too efficient encouragement which has been received and acted upon by profitable injustice there is no practice so mischievous to the flagitiousness of which by habit mankind in general and especially those who profit by it have not been rendered insensible what they do not see because by turning aside from it they take care not to see it is the mischievousness of the practice what they do see is the practice itself that custom which constitutes the only immediate standard of right and wrong in the eyes of the generality of mankind without the use and antecedently to the general practice of the art of writing an advantage might for the purposes of injustice be made of the mendacitylicence on both sides of the cause on the plaintiffs side for instance where his own abode was in the neighbourhood of the court while the defendants abode was at a great and inconvenient distance on the defendants side the advantage had beyond comparison a much greater indeed an infinite latitude under the licence the utmost that a malâ fide plaintiff could do in the way of injustice and oppression was to subject him in the article of journeys and demurrage to a proportionable burden in the shape of vexation and expense whereas in the character of defendant a man who had by injustice possessed himself of property to any amount might with the benefit of the mendacitylicence and with the assistance of the judges by whom it was granted maintain himself in possession of such property for any length of time accordingly in the practice designated by the name of fourcher par essoign—decision staved off by two defendants coming each day with a sham excuse in his mouth and taking care never to appear both on the same day—we see a contrivance suited in its grossness to the grossness of the age but by which even without any assistance from the abuse of writing judges had established themselves in the habit of keeping an open shop for the sale of any mans property to any other man who would pay their price for it essoign was the name given to an excuse for not appearing sham excuses known to be such were regularly admitted by the judges to any man who in reading glanville hingham magna and hingham parva but especially the two hinghams has the courage to open his eyes this will be clearly visible in the character of joint defendants suppose the usurper of your land and a man of straw whom in the character of former proprietor he called in to warranty two of these sham excusemakers joining together made an engine called in the technology of that day fork fourche by the help of which a man who had got possession of your land was admitted to stave you off for any length of time fourcher par essoign was the name given to the operation when a appeared b kept out of the way when b appeared a did him the same good office if thus much could be done by a fork with two prongs judge what might have been done with a fork of two or three dozen or two or three score of prongs such as they have now in equity is it possible to imagine that if the judges themselves had not been in the plot they could have suffered themselves to be deceived and justice paralyzed by so gross an artifice this was when jurisprudence was raw and young so that when once the parties were met together in the presence of the judge the cause was at an end pretences not having been invented for delaying any longer to do justice when by one such artifice or another generation after generation had been squeezed and kept in torture so that the grievance was grown past all bearing the legislature would now and then interpose and say that such things should be done no longer whereupon things went on nearly as they did before the worst that could happen to the contriver of iniquity being the trouble of putting her into new clothes drive nature off says the poet with a pitchfork she will run back upon you justice under the management of these judges was not thus obstinate it required an act of parliament† to say that there should be no more such fourching‡ to understand the structure of a watch   0 each particular wheel must be separately viewed and its office separately considered to obtain a clear and satisfactory conception of the system of technical procedure it was accordingly necessary that each separate device should be separately brought to view and the advantage to the production of which it was of itself and by itself competent separately displayed between the mendacitylicence and the abuse of writing in the shape of ready written pleading the combination was most intimate closer than mechanical combination it required a sort of chemical process to dissolve it and present the elements in a separate state thus much as to what could be done and has been done by the mendacitylicence alone the great improvement given to the virtue of this element by the addition of the other will be seen in the following chapter chapter xvi eleventh device—ready written pleadings §   idea of a system of pleading adapted to the ends of justice should justice ever become an object a system of pleading might be devised which creating no delay and giving no mendacitylicence should at the same time give real information to the parties and bind in chains the despotism of the judge he who has a right to any subject of property—immoveable or moveable sum of money to be paid him by some one else service of any other sort to be rendered by a determinate individual—is he in whose favour some one in the list of events or states of things having with reference to that right the effect of collative or say investitive events or states of things has taken place no article in the list of those to which with reference to that same right the law has given the effect of ablative or say divestitive events or state of things having subsequently taken place in his case the nature of the subject of property or of the right so demanded ideas never having been clear language on this head is not determinate determines the nature of the service which is the immediate subject of demand the service which the plaintiff prays may be rendered to him by the judge general description of the proper contents for the instrument of demand correspondent to the declaration at common law the bill in equity—   specification of the service demanded at the hands of the judge including of course where property is in question a specification of the subjectmatter of the property   indication of some one collative event     or more if by accident there should be more than one on which the plaintiff grounds his title to that service reference to the article or articles say for shortness the article of the body of law on which the demand is grounded viz in which the right or title to a service of the sort in question is given to him in whose favour a collative event of the description in question has taken place assertion of the matter of law affirmation on oath or what is equivalent of his belief of the happening of an individual event coming under the description of the sort of collative event above indicated assertion of the matter of fact   reference to the article of law by which in relation to the same service the quality of ablative events is given to a list of events therein contained affirmation that no individual event coming under the description of any one of the events in that list has to his belief taken place in this instance this with the occasional addition of so much incidental matter as we have seen is what comes out of course at the judicial meeting spoken of under the head of the exclusion put upon the parties such is the stock of information required of course by the judge to warrant him in rendering the service prayed for such is the information which will of course be given by the plaintiff himself by every plaintiff in so far as his intellectual qualifications serve him for the purpose such is the information which in case of any deficiency in these qualifications it will belong to his professional assistant if any such be present to draw from him—or if not to the judge according to the importance of the cause in itself or in the estimation of either of the parties he paying provisionally at least the extra charges should the importance of it be deemed to have no other ground than the particular state of his own particular affections minutes will therefore be taken or not taken of this part as of other parts if any of the evidence but at any rate a printed form with proper blanks will be filled up and signed by the plaintiff to serve pro tanto the various purposes private and public of a record lawyer—mighty well but all this does it not suppose two things—a correspondent mass of what you call substantive law on which this course of procedure is to be grounded and to which it seeks to give execution and effect and that mass of substantive law in the state not of common but of statute law nonlawyer—doubtless it does lawyer—and so according to you there can be no such thing as good pleading without a complete body of laws in the form of statute law that is without the extirpation of the good old common law the pride of ages the englishmans best treasure nonlawyer—say rather if you please the english lawyers but as to that point be pleased if you have any curiosity to restrain it till you come to the device spoken of under the head of magnification of jurisprudence lawyer—and so you look upon it as possible do you sir to compose a complete body of statute law extending over all causes as well as over all persons nonlawyer—indeed do i sir and for these fifty years or more the more i have thought of the task the greater does the facility of it appear to me not a cause is ever decided or so much as begun but all this though never done is supposed to be done which according to you is productive of most labour and most difficulties—to form an article of real law once for all or by an endless series of suppositions never realized to make it over and over again in imagination—to make so many sham substitutes to it if the difficulty be insuperable to a select draughtsman appointed by the legislature subject to correction from all mankind under the authority of his employers—one who may have been occupying a whole life in thinking of it—how comes it to be so easy for every attorney special pleader or attorneys or special pleaders clerk to be continually imagining such laws as fast as called for among the objects which it may be necessary for the judge to have under review to enable him to compass the ends of justice may be noted three the description of which it will in all cases be useful in some absolutely necessary to have in a fixed form given to them by means of the act of writing viz the demands on both sides the titles or grounds of demand on both sides and the evidence—   on the part of the plaintiff a description of the demand in this permanent form is in general necessary for the use of the judge to the end that in the event of its being acceded to by him the decision the judgment pronounced by him and the execution of that judgment may be sure to be correspondent to it   the same reason applies to any demand that may happen in the course of the cause     to be brought forward on the part of the defendant since in case of any such counterdemand he takes upon himself pro tanto and in respect of it the character of plaintiff   on the part of the plaintiff again a designation of the title or ground of demand in this same permanent form if not at all times necessary to the judge would be more or less useful to him to enable him in so far as reflection for any considerable length of time may be necessary to reflect upon it without danger of misrecollection at his leisure this in the case of him who acts as judge in the first instance but in case of dissatisfaction on either side and appeal accordingly to another court especially if the propriety of the conduct of the judge below is to be among the subjects of inquiry these fixed designations will be little less than necessary the demand actually acceded to by the judge is it of the number of those that according to law are if supported by appropriate titles capable of being acceded to the title on which the accession given to the demand was grounded is it of the number of those to which the law has given the faculty of serving as a support to that sort of demand—to enable the judge above to give a surelygrounded answer to these several questions it seems little less than necessary that of each of them there should be a description reduced to that permanent form which excludes all dispute about the words and enables all persons concerned to refresh at any time whatsoever conceptions they may respectively have formed of it   that on both sides of the cause the evidence should be invested with the same permanent character will always be at least conducive if not absolutely necessary to the ends of justice for two distinguishable purposes—  that in case of mendacity the alleged matter of delinquency the subject or ground of prosecution and eventually of punishment may be ascertained beyond dispute   that eventually in case of dissatisfaction as before it may be seen upon occasion how far the decision professedly grounded on the evidence was really warranted by it such are some of the principal of the purposes with reference to which the exercise of the art of writing promises to be in all cases useful in some cases little if at all less than necessary to justice in the course and for the purpose of the suit but howsoever necessary it may be at some stage or other of the cause its employment to the exclusion of the meeting coram judice where practicable at the outset of the cause will not be found necessary or so much as conducive to justice with reference to both points viz the demand i e the particular nature and description of the service alleged to be due and the title i e the ground of the demand in point of law and fact as above explained† misconceptions and consequent misstatements on the part of the plaintiff unblameable as well as blameable are apt very frequently to arise in so far as the true nature and propriety of his demand depends upon his own personal cognizance of the facts in question such incorrectnesses might in case of due attention or at least in case of consummate and perfect intelligence on his part be avoided but in so far as it depends upon the personal cognizance and thence on the testimony of an extraneous witness the most consummate wisdom on the part of the suitor would not suffice to render the exclusion of them in any degree secure still less would be the chance of their being avoided where the source of the necessary evidence is the reluctant bosom of the adverse party in the cause delivered in the face of the adverse party as well as in the presence of the judge a misstatement of that sort may receive its correction the next instant misstatements in any number may receive their correction at the same minute delay vexation and expense avoided altogether nothing of which a dishonest adversary can take advantage so as to render the fulfilment of a plaintiffs demand either distant or precarious let the discussion be carried on in writing—even suppose the defendant honest—a single misstatement of this sort cannot receive its correction till the length of time alloted for the defendant to put in his plea is run out—a length to which there are no certain limits but technical law especially english law if it does not find a man dishonest is almost sure to make him so if he has anything to gain by dishonesty under the tuition of his professional advisers he accordingly lies by and suffers the misstatement to pass uncorrected consequence to the unfortunate author or rather utterer of the mistake loss of the suit—of that individual suit at any rate liberty or not as it may happen to bring on and go through with another if so it be that he feels himself rich and bold enough what is necessary to justice is that communications of this sort should respectively be made what is not necessary is that they should be committed to writing before they are made     §   pleadings in use their modifications pleadings understand ready written delivered in the form of writing in the first instance is the term employed to designate any masses of discourse delivered in that form and purporting to contain allegations made by the parties on the occasion and in the course of the cause in english technical procedure they are distinguished according to the courts under the judicature of which they are delivered into commonlaw pleadings and equity pleadings in each court again they are distinguishable into general pleadings and special pleadings   at common law in a cause of the class called civil causes i e not considered as criminal causes the first instrument is delivered on the plaintiffs side and is called a declaration in this instrument the nature of the demand i e of the service demanded at the hands of the judge is supposed to be stated and as supposed or pretended with what truth will presently be seen with a degree of certainty sufficient for the information of the defendant and the judge and moreover the title on which the demand is founded is or is not supposed to be stated with like certainty supposed or not supposed to be thus stated in here and there an instance it may perhaps be found to be so in return for this comes from the defendants side if any thing an instrument called the plea laying aside demurrer by which the demand is disputed so far only as concerns the ground it rests on in point of law—and setting aside also pleas in abatement commonly having no other object than mere delay and never having anything to do with the demand—the other sort of pleas pleas in bar to the action are either general or special a plea is called general when the effect given to it is the putting an end to the line of altercation† in this mode it states a point which it calls upon the plaintiff to join in submitting to the decision of a jury and admits not in general of any instrument on the part of the plaintiff other than the signification of his consent to do so to do this is to bring on what is called the general issue to plead a plea having this effect is called for shortness pleading the general issue‡ what in all cases it purports and is supposed to do is to express in general terms a denial of the justice of the plaintiffs claim at any rate in respect of fact—in respect of the whole or some necessary part of the mass of facts on which his demand is grounded and eventually also in respect of law what in many instances it really does though without professing to do and perhaps without being generally considered as doing is the giving him a right at the trial to oppose the demand by the proof of counterfacts counterfacts not only such as tend in disproof of the facts relied on by the plaintiff but other facts of such a nature that the law has given to them the effect of establishing in the behalf of the defendant a countertitle having the effect of destroying the force of the plaintiffs title even should the facts which constitute it be established a special plea—though in one respect true or false as it happens meant or not meant to be true as it happens—is in another respect constantly true and so far as it is true the information conveyed by it is material and useful the matter that might be true or false as likewise meant to be true or meant to be false as it happened was the matter of fact asserted by the plea of the information conveyed by it that which was constantly true was in every case neither more nor less than this viz that the matter of fact therein asserted was the matter of fact which the party if he attempted to prove anything intended to attempt to prove it might happen that knowing it to be false and incapable of being proved he did not on delivering it intend to attempt proving that or anything else delay being the only purpose of his delivering it but if he intended to attempt proving anything that and nothing else is what he that is his lawyer must have intended to     attempt to prove why because by the established and in this instance proper practice that and that alone is what at the trial he would be allowed to prove as to the general plea that which brings on the general issue it conveys no information at all it conveys in no instance any more information of the ground or title on which the defendant means to rest his defence than in most instances the declaration does of the ground or title on which the plaintiff means to rest his demand thus stands the matter in regard to written pleadings general pleading conveys no information but there is an end to it if any information is conveyed by pleading it is by special pleading but there is no end to it compare this with the result of the meeting of the parties in the presence of the judge whatever information can be requisite either to the parties or to the judge may be obtained by it and obtained at once ii in equity procedure the first instrument delivered and which of course is delivered by the plaintiff is called the bill it corresponds to the declaration at common law what the declaration pretends or is pretended to do the bill really does it states both demand and title the declaration conveys its noinstruction in a discourse the length of which though too great by the whole amount is in comparison with that of a bill for the most part moderate to the length of a bill there are no bounds what it calls for is an answer what it produces not to speak of demurrers as above is most frequently an answer—not very unfrequently a plea the answer upon oath the plea not upon oath the plea is in every instance of the nature of the special plea above described in regard to pleadings at common law in equity as at common law pleadings used at one time to be drawn into length by altercation in both instances but more particularly in equity the length of the chain has of late years been more or less contracted by the opposing pressure of public indignation as to the range of the mendacitylicence under the two systems it is already understood in commonlaw pleadings it has no exception in equity pleadings the instrument called the answer constitutes the only one §   uses of this device in conjunction with its auxiliary devices to judge and co in practice the profit produced to the partnership by the system of pleading conducted as we see it is a very complex mass including in its composition the accumulated benefits produced by the four principal articles in the already enumerated list—  blind fixation of times for operations   long intervals between sitting and sitting   principle of nullification   mendacitylicence without reckoning the masterdevice exclusion of parties from the judges presence and other devices the benefit of which how considerable soever in itself is in the character of an auxiliary to the device here in question less considerable or less conspicuous that the nature and utility of so rich a compound may be the more clearly understood let us endeavour to bring to light the separate virtue of each element taken by itself what each has contributed to the common ends taking this element for the basis let us first observe its virtues when pure and then conceiving the several others as if necessarily added one after another not that in fact they were so observe what additions it stands indebted for to the separate virtues of the several other elements so intimately and happily combined with it   had it stood by itself the sources of the mischiefs produced by it to suitors and thence of the advantages to the man of law would have been confined to these—viz   employment of writing in cases where it was improper as being either useless or preponderantly expensive   accumulation of surplusage   from the blind fixation of times for judicial operations—from this device alone added to that of unnecessary and excessive scribbling might have been derived a further advantage besides the advantages already spoken of as drawn from this same device the suit being brought to a premature and fruitless end by the breach of this or that blind appointment the use of the pleadings delivered in the course of that suit might have been deemed to have terminated along with it consequence if another suit then a fresh series of pleadings useful or useless with or without surplusage quantity of writing doubled   another addition is made to the virtues of the compound by the application of the principle of nullification in regard to instruments the principle of nullification renders much the same sort of service as is rendered by the blind fixation of times in regard to operations in both instances the object was to make a pretence for causing to be done over again business that had been done already for this profitable reiteration the nonperformance of this or that operation at a given time formed one pretence the supposed incongruity of this or that instrument formed another pretence   let us next observe the additional advantage derived from the excessive length of interval between sitting and sitting the preceding device furnishing means—this furnishes motives     suppose the sittings from day to day and offices as well as courts open alike at all times the operation omitted one day might be performed the next the instrument pronounced incompetent one day might be amended or replaced the next in this mode the interest of judge and co would indeed have been served well enough but both parties being materially vexed and pillaged neither of them very materially served judge and co would have found them both complaining neither joining with them to deliver the other into their hands means for plaguing the adversary would not have been wanting but motives would have been inadequate interpose the length of interval institute terms and circuits manufacture inevitable delay—in proportion to the length of it the account of encouragement swells the value of the delay rises in the joint ratio of the weight of the burthen from which a man is respited or perhaps liberated and the length of the respite to the dishonest debtor to the dishonest usurper of another mans right to the malefactor in every stage of guilt the commodity offered becomes more and more valuable in proportion to the magnitude of the debt due the value of the right usurpe and in so far as any proportion between delinquency and punishment is maintained the mischievousness of the crime without this device the partnership would have stood alone with the whole world against them with all their power they might have found an united people too many for them availing themselves of this device and availing themselves of it to the extent we see and feel they made a division among their adversaries—they made a coalition with one half of them in every dishonest debtor in every usurper of anothers right in every malefactor in every evil doer they behold an eager customer a purchaser an accomplice   the mendacitylicence may close as it served to crown the list it contributed to the common end in two perfectly distinct ways—   to the dishonest defendant it was of use by affording an additional source of delay the fund of true allegation has narrow limits the fund of false allegation is inextinguishable let the length of time gained by an allegation on the defendants side be ever so great say six months without the benefit of the mendacitylicence the advantage thus obtainable would be but inconsiderable in multitudes of the causes that now take place the demand is of a debt and the debt justly due but the debt being by the supposition due on the part of the defendant the case admits not of any allegation that shall be at the same time pertinent and true here is delay enough if it could find customers but nobody is in a condition to buy it the oath with its eventual punishment the oath and the scrutiny form a bar which a few rash adventurers excepted excludes all malâ fide customers remove the bar and you have as many customers as you can find or make dishonest debtors from the defendants side let us turn to the plaintiffs one of two classes of dishonest plaintiffs owes its existence to this device there stands one man who having a right say to a sum of money due and being of course conscious of that right is led by anger or some project of advantage to convert that right into an instrument of oppression men of this description have no need of the mendacitylicence the vexation and expense produced by the other devices furnish him with the means but men thus circumstanced are in comparison but few establish the mendacitylicence remove the bar set up by the obligation to speak truth their number is without bounds the demon by i forget what father of the church was styled the ape of the almighty conceive him in the character of the unrighteous judge that is under the feegathering and technical system of any judge with the mendacitylicence in one hand and the other open to receive the fees addressing himself to rogues of all classes by two different invitations— come unto me all ye that are heavy laden down with your money out with your lies and i will give you rest—rest peradventure for ever rest for many and many a day at any rate such is his address to dishonest debtors come unto me all ye who seeing adversaries in your way see them unable to defend themselves come ye unto me ye have no need of right so ye bring lies and money your money is my reward your lies are my pretence i will deliver your adversaries into your hand numbering adds the commentator among your adversaries all whose enemy you are whether they are or are not your enemies such is his address to all such who may be engaged to tread in the paths of iniquity and oppression in the character of plaintiffs—plaintiffs without being creditors §   pretended use of this device—certainty in the regular form of technical procedure written pleadings are constantly required we have seen the information which under natural procedure is given given by the judicial meeting given of course and without professing it of this body of information a small part only can by technical procedure be so much as professed to be given and whatsoever professions of this kind are made are false     with regard to the nature of the service demanded and the ground of the demand it would be too much to say that no true information is ever given in any of the instruments comprised under the name of pleadings falsehood thus universal would not have been necessary nor so much as in a superior degree subservient to the purpose what was sufficient was that along with the matter which had it stood alone would as far as it went have been instructive so large a dose of falsehood was every where mixed as was sufficient to destroy all confidence all capacity of instruction in such part of the mass as was true certain jews travelling towards a seaport met with a christian and asked him the way to it he pointed along the shore to a path which he knew would soon be covered by the tide they struck into it and were drowned to the christianity of lord coke by whom the stratagem is reported it affords matter of exultation thus perished says he these intidel jews this stratagem may be received if not as the model at any rate as an emblem of the policy pursued in the adjustment of the principles of pleading misconception is worse than no conception false information is worse than none had the communicative christian held his peace the infidels might have escaped when from a source from which he had expected information a man finds none the effect of his disappointment is only to put him upon the lookout for another false information when acted upon cuts a man off from true and makes error sure the first object therefore was to produce misconception—misconception and certain error in consequence unfortunately the advantage derivable from this policy has its bounds information recognised to be false becomes tantamount to ruin the first gang of the infidels were drowned but had a second been within sight the stratagem would not have succeeded upon the second in pleadings certainty is a qualification exacted with the utmost rigour certainty a nonlawyer would say to himself includes truth no such thing by certainty though they have never said as much they mean precision precision and nothing more precision is a quality which it is just as easy to give to falsehood as to truth accordingly so it be but precise what is notoriously false is just as good as if it were true precision and assuredness being two qualities which consistently with truth it is scarcely in the power of the plaintiff to give to the allegation by which in the first instance he states the nature and ground of his application to the judge—the rational and obvious course is to permit it in the first instance to be worded with that degree of generality and indecision which cannot but accompany the conception entertained of it by the plaintiff in the interior of his mind†     this course was too simple for the founders of english jurisprudence certainty meaning as before precision—certainty it had occurred to them was a very desirable property as on all other occasions so in particular on the occasion of all allegations and communications made for the purposes of justice certainty therefore—nothing short of certainty was what on this occasion they were determined to have but the allegation you insist upon cannot at the same time be thus certain and be true well then if that be the case we wont insist upon its being true in our law in our morality diffidence is unpardonable as to falsehood far from shocking us it is on all occasions our delight fear nothing plaintiff falsehood shall be no prejudice to you so it be advanced with confidence to men who could decide thus all idea of utility must have been altogether out of sight adherence to practice adherence and that of the blindest kind was taken for the only rule for every purpose of information false information must in this case have been worse than none the effect of it if it had any could only be to mislead yet this falsehood they were determined not only to receive from the plaintiff but to force him to give of the information required to be given and given accordingly in pleadings what cannot be said is that it is in every instance false what may be said is that it is in so many instances allowed to be false that upon the whole it is of at least as little use as if it were always so not content with requiring at the hands of a plaintiff allegations which supposing it in his power to render them correct might afford to the defendant information capable of being of service to him for the guidance of his defence—might in a word in so far as it were true and correct be useful and instructive—they have on various occasions insisted on a variety of allegations partly false partly irrelevant partly absurd and unmeaning and which if true could not be of any use why insist upon them for what reason because the insertion of them had been customary violation of truth is a thing not worth avoiding departure from custom from precedent would be intolerable if the judicial power had seconded the views of the legislative the state of legislation on this ground would not have been thus deplorable a time there was in the reign of one of the edwards when the legislature by an act which is still in force conveyed to the respective courts or rather to the chancellor a subordinate power of legislation in this behalf but power legal power is one thing knowledge intelligence which is intellectual power not to speak of inclination is a very different thing what the legislator did convey to them was legal power what he knew not how to convey to them was inclination what he could not convey to them was adequate intelligence he had it not to give they if he had were not in a condition to receive it had their stock of intelligence been ever so abundant what should have been their inducement to employ it the labour would have been their own the benefit would have been reaped by their fellowsubjects a part by suitors the other part and the most valuable because reaped without expense by those whose good fortune it would be by means of the information thus afforded them to escape the misfortune of becoming suitors instead of pursuing the course prescribed to them they took a course which was at once more commodious and more profitable they left it to the plaintiff to word his own demand and when worded by him and worded at his peril he learnt by the gain or loss of his cause whether the wording of it was or was not to their taste for themselves they never thought anything about the matter it was for him to declare and at the peril of loss and perhaps ruin what those conceptions were which so far from having been declared and made known had never been so much as formed the same proposition was capable of being expressed in a multitude of different ways and perhaps with equal propriety in any one of the whole number when the suitor came to give words to his claim what was the inquiry of the judge not whether the wording employed by the plaintiff was capable of     answering the purpose but whether they were the exact words which he himself the judge would have employed if there was a hairsbreadth difference so much the worse for the plaintiff his cause was gone was there any possible means of safety for an unfortunate or perhaps obnoxious suitor oftentimes it has appeared to me that there was none the claim was alike capable of being preferred in either of two ways the plaintiff pitched upon the first the judge upon the second had the plaintiff employed the second the judge would have stamped his exclusive approbation upon the first to the nonprofessional reader a few specimens of what lawyers call certainty may be neither useless nor unacceptable— a specific thing if you want to get it of a man or he wants to get it of you belongs to the class of moveables or to the class of immoveables the first instrument by which any information is pretended to be conveyed is the declaration—the first instrument delivered in the plaintiffs name under natural procedure at the first judicial meeting be it a moveable thing or a thing immoveable that is demanded what the thing is that is demanded and on what ground it is demanded would amongst so many other articles of information that might eventually be of use come out of course with every degree of certainty that was at once requisite and practicable how is it under technical procedure if it is a horse your adversary wants of you the action is called an action of trover and the declaration a declaration in trover to state and with truth what it was that was wanted of you viz that it was a horse could not well be avoided but as to the ground of the demand the statement under this head must always indeed be precise but except in a case which scarce ever happens it must as certainly be false it must be not only false but impertinent had it been necessary for him to say how the animal became his this in case of his demands being unjust might have been of use to you this accordingly is what he is excused from saying what he is obliged to say is how it came to be yours that is in your possession for the time though if his demand be well grounded you have no permanent right to it you found the horse this is what he would always be forced to say even were he to know that you bought it or that he lent it to you where a thing immoveable is the subject of the demand it is still worse not only the statement of the title is never given but though a description of the subject of the demand is always given it is never true if it is one acre that a man wants of you his lawyer mentions twenty acres or two hundred—any number that he pleases as to the title the place of instruction is here again supplied by falsehood and impertinencies a foolish story is told about somebody called doe that was turned out by somebody called roe—an imaginary man by another—as anybody may see in blackstone thereupon to work the lawyers go upon the ground of this superficially silly fundamentally wicked story justice the pretence pillage the object and result mendacity the means are you really at a loss to know what it is the man wants of you the information pretended to be given by your adversary being all a sham—if you want any real information it is for you the defendant to apply for it your lawyer makes a motion for it so much more business a cause within a cause here we see the use of the false information to make a man pay so much the more if he would have true where ignorance or doubt is the real state of the mind assertion of knowledge is mendacity who is there that does not see this what lawyer can avoid seeing it every degree of persuasion short of that which is expressed by the word knowledge is proscribed in pleading it would be want of certainty mendacity therefore on the part of every snitor whose degree of persuasion falls short of the highest is called for and compelled moral vice is made into a legal duty and a duty for the breach of which there is no pardon wherever a man speaks in the disjunctive a sort of doubt is confessed which is a sort of ignorance accordingly the disjunctive conjunction or is proscribed in pleading the word and is exacted instead of it why because and is always certain though it be always false half a dozen or thereabouts is the number of different titles upon one or other of which or perhaps sometimes two or more at a time a demand of money due is most frequently apt to be grounded work and labour done goods sold and delivered money lent without security money lent on note of hand and so forth you sold the defendant a horse for £ 0 and he gave you his note of hand for it it is matter of doubt to you which fact you may be best able to prove the sale of the horse or his signature of the note at the suggestion of truth and common sense would you say that the man owes you £ 0—viz either upon the score of the sale or upon the score of the note you would lose your money what they make you do is to demand two debts of £ 0 each one due upon the sale the other upon the note     in the case just put these two demands might serve but the practice is where one debt is due to claim half a dozen or more as above each to the same amount each with a separate count that is the word to claim it the more counts the more writing the more writing the more fees whatever be the demand in general a declaration contains divers counts stories of which one may perhaps be true most commonly all but one false thereupon at the trial the jury being agreed and ready to give their verdict for you the plaintiff—doubts upon doubts on which of all these counts to take it the jury who know nothing about counts waiting in gaping admiration to know what decision which is not theirs shall be given to the world for theirs take your verdict on a wrong count you lose it saving always the privilege of taking your chance at the twelvemonths end for another such verdict which may again be on a wrong count and so toties quoties under natural procedure at the first judidicial meeting—in a court of conscience for example for parliament whensoever it shall be its pleasure knows where conscience is to be found—all this would have been settled at once and upon the best evidence such being the case with the most common sorts of demand that could be found—suits individually counted in perhaps nineteen out of twenty—to pursue the inquiry through the list of the less common ones would be as useless as it would be endless such the information destined for the suitors such the pretended and not intended use to the suitors such the real and intended use to the judges and their partners all this lies open to every eye that can endure to look upon it all this though in blackstones colouring is pourtrayed even by blackstone such is the ground on which he builds the claim of his firm to the veneration and gratitude of mankind all this for ever before our eyes pleadings coming in question judges talk of certainty to all this certainty know they or know they not the nonnecessity of truth if yes what dishonesty if no what ignorance pretended study—to prevent surprises that at the trial both parties may come prepared real study—to produce surprises that sometimes by the production of the surprise sometimes by the apprehension of it business may be made by the judicial meeting surprise would really be prevented everything that was ever called surprise who except by shutting his eyes or turning them aside can avoid seeing it lawyer—the pleadings giving according to you no information or worse than none how is it that surprises are not perpetual how is it that parties ever come prepared nonlawyer—i did not say that no information is ever to be got from your pleadings such consistency i have observed already would be of no use to you but the contrary what i mean to say is that in general it is not from that source that the information a man stands in need of for the support of a just cause is obtained whence then is it obtained from the previous transactions between the parties the case is comparatively rare in which before the suit begins the defendant is not pretty well informed what it is the plaintiff wants of him and on what grounds it is that he demands it so on the other hand the plaintiff on what grounds if on any the defendant means to dispute it but where information is by either party really wanted generally speaking he has this alternative either he applies for it by motion a cause within a cause getting it or not getting it or he does without it as well as he can lawyer—you will admit at any rate that information is afforded as often as the pleading goes to the length of special pleading nonlawyer—agreed you on your part will have the goodness to admit four things   that the information so given being given under the mendacitylicence need never have a syllable of truth in it   that the more there is of it the more business   that where there does happen to be any truth in it the effect of it is liable to be destroyed by nullities against which no human prudence is sufficient to secure it   and that at the end of twelve or fifteen or twenty months it is not in the power of your special pleading be the chain of it ever so long to give half the information meaning true and useful information that at the first judicial meeting would be given in as many minutes   0 chapter xvii twelfth device—principle of jargon or jargonization the object and use of language meaning ordinary language is to convey information information which in some way or other shall be of use for which purpose except in here and there a case too extraordinary to present on this occasion a claim to notice it must be true the object and use of lawyers language is twofold partly to prevent information from being conveyed to certain descriptions of persons partly to cause such information to be conveyed to them as shall be false or at any rate fallacious to secure habitual ignorance or produce occasional misconception misconception as will be seen is on those occasions a sort of improvement upon ignorance all the purposes of ignorance are served by it but in a more exquisite degree particular misconception is the occasional result of general and habitual ignorance its tendency is to rivet the chains with which the public mind has been loaded by ignorance all those peculiarities whereby the language made or employed by lawyers is conducive to this effect may be comprehended under the general name of jargon lawjargon various are the shapes in which jargon is capable of making its appearance—  foreign language dead or living   obsolete language   technical language undefined   nonsense   fiction   ordinary language perverted none but what may be made subservient to the general end one or another this or that one of them is to be employed as occasion serves but that the use of them is not altogether indifferent will be seen as we advance each has its use each was to be made the most of as occasion served each has its use some more than others as will be seen anything will serve so it be repugnant in any way to the ends of language a lot of jargon may consist either of propositions one or more or of a single term in less compass than that of a proposition neither truth nor falsehood wisdom nor folly sense nor nonsense can be conveyed but there are single terms such is their force and virtue that are sufficient any one of them of itself to infuse the qualities of darkness or nonsense into this or that proposition or into almost any proposition of which they make a part such are the terms felony larceny corruption of blood attaint common bail meaning no bail at all vi et armis force and arms applied to forgery c law being the subject whatever tends to keep men in ignorance is of use to lawyers but the beneficial effects of the ignorance assume a somewhat different complexion according to the description of the person in whom the endowment is considered as being liable to reside—  the people at large in the quality of suitors   the legislator or   men of law themselves i on the part of the people at large it makes business in three ways—   from ignorance of the law in criminali comes delinquency from delinquency prosecution   in noncriminali if a man being ignorant is conscious of his being so and knows not how to act with safety he applies to lawyers hence comes an appropriate branch of made business the trade of the lawadviser or opinionist the opinion trade if being ignorant he fancies himself sufficiently knowing not being aware of the traps that have been laid for him so much the better he then leaves something undone which he ought to have done or does something which he ought not to have done and litigation with loss or danger of loss of right or of falling under some burthensome obligation is the consequence business in the way of assistance previous business in the way of advice   from ignorance in respect of the adjective branch of the law the law of procedure in criminali and more especially in non criminali comes the necessity of having recourse to the lawyers in unlimited numbers in the character of assistants or what is much better of substitutes business in the way of assistance with ditto in the way of advice step after step at as many steps as possible making business is not enough without securing against diminution the quantity of business that is the mass of profit habitually made in proportion as business is made the people suffer in proportion as the worms multiply and fatten the patient faints did the people know that the sufferings they experience at the hands of the judge and his confederates are in so large a proportion factitious they would be apt to cry out their outcries would be troublesome and might lead to relief against this danger the use of jargon is considerable it impresses them with awe it forms a species of the sublime omne ignotum pro magnifico est viewed through this medium every object assumes such shapes and colours as could be wished factitious vexation expense and delay become natural and inevitable nonsense becomes science fiaud and extortion purity their tormentors and plunderers become their kind protectors and best friends it is not by its quality alone that jargon lends its service to the advancement of the     common cause by the very quantity of it it renders at least equal service judicial formulary conveyance whatever be the nature of the instrument care has been taken that each particle of sense shall be drowned in a deluge of words by the quantity of profit the particular purpose of the individual lawyer on each individual occasion is served by the contribution made to the immensity and incomprehensibility of the chaos of which it forms a part the interests of the whole partnership receive a lasting benefit it is in the demesne of jurisprudential law that the service rendered by jargon in virtue of its quantity is rendered in the most transcendant degree where statutory law would create certainty by a word jurisprudential with its argumentations gives uncertainty in a volume but even in the composition of statute law the treacherous assistance of the professional lawyer has by a disastrous necessity been forced upon the legislator words being heaped together at so much a dozen the consequence is alike necessary and obvious in this case too lest the virtues of tautology and surplusage should not be sufficient the aid of disorder and a religious exclusion of those helps to elucidation with which no other species of composition is unprovided have been called in and carefully preserved the details of this policy would diverge too far from the present purpose† ii on the part of the legislator the service rendered by jargon to the partnership admits of some diversifications though all resolvable into this viz either adding to the quantity of business i e to the mass of profit extractible from the mass of business or protecting it against diminution from that commanding source the interest of the legislator in as far as it has been brought into coincidence with his duty is on this as on all other grounds the same as that of the people the ends of the legislator are no other than the ends of justice having the power in his hands he will of course unless in so far as he can be corrupted or drawn from his duty or led into mistakes in the exercise of it take effectual care that the mass of madebusiness and thence the mass of lawyers profit be as small as possible towards preventing him from exerting his power in this way the services of jargon are in the highest degree important—   by the heaps of filth moral and intellectual of which it is composed it becomes a perpetual source of disgust and serves as a perpetual repellent to the eye of scrutiny as to that cell there sir you must not think of looking into it you will catch something bad the smell will be too much for you jailors quarte and tierce in fencing against howard jails have had their howard jurisprudence waits for one   it converts the whole field of legislation into a thicket impenetrable to the legislators eye when he does work he works blindfold he works at random at the hazard of creating more mischief than he cures as often as this happens then comes the lawyers triumph you would be meddling see now the consequence that sort and degree of knowledge which the subject dealt with as it has been admits of is now an object of monopoly in the hands of the partnership the stock of endowments such as the legislator must possess to do his duty stands distributed upon a plan the most commodious imaginable on the part of the man of law—what there is of knowledge power to be had for asking were it but convenient for him to ask for it inclination acting in a direction directly opposite to that in which it must act to prompt a man to apply the knowledge and power to any other than a bad purpose on the part of the legislator—power and for the most part inclination but of knowledge appropriate and necessary knowledge so deplorable a deficiency as divests the other endowments of all force and virtue but the mass and efficiency of jargon is continually upon the increase in the way of reform and previous necessary information whatever may be the degree of difficulty one day exists with increase the next every day the more urgent the demand—the more hopeless the supply the partnership look on and triumph soon if not already their language will be in this tone unanimous—yes so long as it was possible a change might have been useful but whatever it may have been it is now impossible human faculties are not equal to it from different temperaments come different tones those if such there be who still fear the possibility will deny the use the use may be admitted as a point not worth disputing by those who look to the impossibility with an eye of confidence admit the impossibility they will allow     you the expediency without scruple the praise of candour is got by the admission and nothing lost by it the plea of impossibility has already become plausible a little while and it will become real iii in their intercourse one with another jargon has again its use it serves them as a bond of union it serves them at every word to remind them of that common interest by which they are made friends to one another enemies to the rest of mankind cooperation is thus secured—concert rendered unnecessary concert would be conspiracy cooperation without concert produces all the advantage without any of the danger if jargon nurses ignorance among those who employ it as well as among those at whose expense it is used so much the better the knowledge which is of use to the man of law is not positive knowledge but comparative nor even of that the reality but the appearance of the reality just so much and no more as is necessary to keep up the appearance when the suitor a nonlawyer makes a mistake about law the mischief falls upon his own head when a lawyer makes a mistake the mischief falls upon the suitor or the client care has been taken that it shall do so under these circumstances superior knowledge in superintending stations being out of the question nothing is so convenient as genuine ignorance unintentional mistakes cost less to make than intentional ones between the veterans and the tyros the harmony of interests is not in this point perhaps altogether perfect but such minutiæ belong not to this place nursing ignorance jargon serves at the same time for a screen to it it does more over a head of ignorance it puts a mask exhibiting a face of science it is the dissertation upon sanchoniathan presented to the vicar of wakefield this is among the circumstances that under the technical system concur in rendering quirks so pleasant and convenient to the thoroughbred judge he feels a degree of awkwardness where a decision is to be given upon the merits if there be any statute law in the case the letter of the law is a sort of check to him statute or no statute the common sense of mankind operates at any rate as a check and that a troublesome one on this ground decision too if it is to be on the right side is apt now and then to require faculties which whatever they may have been at first have been enfeebled by habitual dietdrinks from the fountain of jurisprudence if a man is wrong he exposes himself if he is right he gains little praise compared with what might be got by jargon or hypocrisy every simpleton is ready to say—what is there in all that tis just what i should have done myself seated in a chair in the character of a justice of the peace with common language in his mouth a common coat upon his back and no hair upon his head but his own solomon himself would not gain the praise of wisdom seated on a woolsack bartholon would pass muster while talking about entering appearances or filing common bail clothed in purple and fine linen artificial hair and ermine every sham science of which there are so many makes to itself a jargon to serve for a cover to its nothingness and if wicked to its wickedness alchemy palmistry magic judicial astrology technical jurisprudence to unlicensed depredators their own technical language the cant or flash language is of use not only as a cover but as a bond of union lawyers cant besides serving them as a cover and as a bond of union serves them as an instrument an iron crow or a picklock key for collecting plunder in cases in which otherwise it could not be collected for applying the principle of nullification in many a case in which it could not otherwise have been applied the best of all good old times was when the fate of englishmen was disposed of in french and in a something that was called latin for having been once in use language however is not much the worse so it be of use no longer the antiquated notation of time suffices of itself to throw a veil of mystery over the system of procedure martin and hilary saints forgotten by devotees are still of use to lawyers how many a man has been ruined

not only a science but a mystery do as the devils do believe and tremble jargon pregnant with misconception is better than jargon preservative of simple ignorance the sense of subjection the humiliation the selfdistrust the despair on the part of the nonlawyer the client the suitor is more complete jargon which takes a word that is in every mans mouth and uses it in a sense in which no man ever used it is better than a jargon     made out of foreign antiquated technical or other hard words every man knows what common means most men even know what it means when opposed to special and applied to a jury apply it now to bail and take order about bail you know how—creditor my debtor is going off he must be held to bail—lawyer that he is already—creditor who are they—lawyer common bail

pick mens pockets while you laugh at them for their patience kick them or spit in their faces you cannot because it is a rule with you never to see their faces but this comes next to it the more pointed and solemn the assurance given the better so it be but violated there was genius in writing word to a man appear before me on such a day—and then punishing him for appearing accordingly instead of employing an attorney there was still more genius in saying appear in person and then punishing him as before he had learnt that when a lawyer says appear what he means by it is extortion or deceit but seeing such words added as personal or in person he thought he might trust them for once that it was their intention for once to be sincere he took it for a flag of truce but so savage is the hostility of this coalition there is no trusting to its flags of truce advice to lawyers—when nonlawyers plague you as now and then they will about reforms and something must be done to quiet them they can never refuse you a hand in the business and it will be your part to take care that what is done shall be to little or no purpose when you have done what can be done towards spoiling the plan you make your mock at it you throw ridicule on that reform and through that on all reforms and so you have your revenge thus blackstone triumphed when upon the translation of the lawyers doglatin scriptures into a sort of english the darkness was but the more visible another and a capital use rendered by jargon to the partnership is the extensive possession it secures to the professional branch of the emoluments the comparative leisure the power and the honours attached to the commanding orders of the official branch—attached to judicial offices proportioned to the advantage thus

xviii thirteenth device—fiction what you have been doing by the fiction—could you or could you not have done it without the fiction if not your fiction is a wicked lie if yes a foolish one such is the

case wicked if it had any the purpose fiction of use to justice exactly as swindling is to trade the fictions with which the substantive branch of the law has been fouled belong not to the design of the present work the fictions by which in so much greater abundance the adjective branch is polluted may be distinguished in the first instance into two great classes the falsehoods which the judges are in the habit of uttering by themselves or by the officers under their direction and the falsehoods which they cause to be uttered by the suitors   take for the first case as one of the most striking ones that of common recoveries though it belongs to the substantive branch with as much propriety at least as to the adjective the judges formed a plan for making business by enabling the proprietors of entailed estates to cheat their heirs the king as is said through policy or perhaps through negligence gave them their own way a sham action was brought against the proprietor the proprietor by direction of the judges named a creature of theirs the crier of their court a man worth nothing as the man of whom he had bought the land and who stood bound to prove the title to it a good one or on failure to give him another estate of equal value the father lost the land that is got the power of doing with it what he pleased     but no injury was done to the children because the father and through him they his children got the criers land instead of it this the judges receiving their fees never failed to testify it is entered upon the record a record is the very tabernacle of truth let it say what it will no man is permitted to dispute the truth of it or of any part of it sham equivalent as above to heirs sham security to defendants sham security to plaintiffs sham notices to both and more especially to defendants sham pretences to one another for cheating one another of business to give the list and the explanation of all those shams with the consequences drawn from them would be to heap volume upon volume it is of such matter that the system of procedure as displayed in the books of practice is composed such is the matter of a record everything is sham that finds its way into that receptacle as everything is foul that finds its way out of fleetditch into the thames the spice or two of truth buried here and there amidst those heaps of falsehood serve but to make the compost the richer and the better adapted to the purposes of misconception and deception in a word to the service of the ends of judicature they serve to favour the operation of the doublefountain principle which see   take next the case of sham bail and sham pledges of prosecution in the infancy of the technical system of english procedure the performance on the part of the plaintiff of an operation called by the name of finding security was established in the character of a condition precedent to the subjecting a man in the character of defendant to make answer in any way to a judicial demand the security was real but eventual only and not deposititious a pair of friends binding themselves though by promise only and not as in case of pawning goods by actual deposit to pay a sum of money preliquidated or not preliquidated certain or uncertain in case the plaintiff should lose his cause pledges of prosecution was the name given to these friends no such pledges are in any case found a certificate of their being found is in every case given and the certificate is among the countless host of lies notorious lies without which english judges know not how to administer what in their language goes by the name of justice so in the case of sham bail on the part of the defendant the defendant pays an attorney who pays an officer of the court for making in one of the books of the court an entry importing that on such a day two persons bound themselves to stand as sureties for the defendant undertaking in the event of his losing his cause and being ordered to comply with the plaintiffs pecuniary demand either to pay the money for the defendant or to render his body up to prison no such engagement has been taken by anybody—the persons spoken of as having taken it are not real persons but imaginary persons a pair of names always the same john doe and richard roe† the impossibility that this vile lie should be of use to anybody but the inventors and utterers of it and their confederates is too manifest to be rendered more so by anything that can be said of it in the original institution of this security the pledges of prosecution as little regard was paid to the ends of justice as in the subsequent evasion of it had any regard been paid to the ends of justice the judge were it only for the purpose of ascertaining what security the nature of the case required and what it was in the plaintiffs power to give would have examined him vivâ voce not to speak of the many other indispensable purposes to which the same operation would have been subservient instead of that this part of the duty was turned over to a subordinate officer of which there was but one for a whole county the sheriff this officer either he was personally responsible for the eventual justiciability     and solvency of those pledges or he was not responsible for them for twice as many persons as there were actions brought in a year within a whole county he would have been continually exposed to almost certain ruin not responsible for them two secure instruments of injustice were lodged in his hands for the acts of this subordinate officer were not like those of his superiors the judges exposed to the scrutiny of the public eye one was to consult his own ease and safety by reporting the impossibility of finding two such pledges the other was to make the like report for the benefit of his friends including all such persons as for the convenience of getting rid of troublesome demands of all sorts might find their account in purchasing that distinction at his own price not such however were the considerations which dictated the evasion which ensued of the due application of this security had it been susceptible of any useful application in such hands the effect would have been the depriving the justiceshop the efficina justitiæ of a number of good customers for to a mans being a good customer to the lawyers of all sorts so long as the suit lasted which was as long as they could contrive to make it last it was not necessary that the demand should have any merits to support it or the demandant the value of a farthing left in his purse to pay in the name of satisfaction to an injured defendant at the end of it on the part of the judge any such inquiry it may be said would have been impracticable nothing more easy to say nor anything more true because from the first of their opening it had been the care of those great shops to put down all the little ones without hearing all suitors in the first instance justice it is true could not be done to any of them and true indeed it was that for three or four sets of judges sitting in westminster hall to hear as many persons in the character of suitors as all england could supply has from first to last been physically impossible but what was possible and not only possible but easy was from the whole of that extent of country and from ten times that extent had there been as much to receive fees giving in return for those fees scraps of written lawyers slang in due form of law the plea of impossibility offers itself at every step in justification of injustice in all its forms the plea is as true as so many other pleas are false but the impossibility is in each instance the work not of nature but of the judge no man says the man of law in one of his maxims ought to take advantage of his own wrong what no man no lawyer—no judge take advantage of his own wrong when under the system of procedure which has had the judges for its authors it is thus out of their own wrong and nothing else that an apology or anything in the form of apology is or can ever be cooked up what no man yes no man subject of course to the exception which when anything wrong is forbidden by us is constantly to be understood viz an exception in favour of ourselves and such other persons to whom it is our pleasure to impart our licence true it is that under this system of yours it is impossible without exception impossible ever to do justice nothing was ever more true but the impossibility whence comes it from yourselves first you make the impossibility and then you plead it and

division may again be made into those which they contented themselves with encouraging and those which they compelled the suitors to utter in the one case the powers of reward alone were employed in the generation of the lie in the other case the irresistible force of punishment is called in to secure it a sample of the simply permitted lies has been already seen in the instance of the written pleadings in general and more especially of special pleading at common law and the initiative pleadings called bills in equity the habitual utterance of these falsehoods is exactly commensurate and coextensive with the range of the mendacitylicence above mentioned these exercises of professional genius and morality if they do not in common parlance come under the head of fictions come not the less under the head of falsehoods falsehoods hatched in the same heads and in pursuit of the same ends the ends of judicature of the falsehoods which are forced into the lips of the suitors or rather since in that way little would be to be got into the paws of their professional assistants a specimen may be seen in those falsehoods some examples of which were given in a preceding chapter the utterance of which is rendered necessary on pretence of certainty the specimen is a rich one falsehood upon falsehood for the reason as we have seen is as rich in hypocrisy as the practice itself is in falsehood when a thing happened in one or other of two ways and you cannot tell in which you must not say so that would be uncertain your indictment or your declaration would be void for uncertainty you must say it happened in both on these terms and on these only you are right in law not the less so when the fact is impossible and so if there be half a dozen or a dozen such alternatives which there are and more in every days practice the practice is to tell as many different stories as there are ways in one or other of which it is supposed the fact may have happened it is spoken of as having happened in each of those ways each story is called a count thus if there are two such counts there is one of them perhaps true one certainly false if half a dozen counts one perhaps true five false a man was murdered by being knocked on the head and thrown overboard whether dead or not when thrown overboard is uncertain two counts one that the man was knocked on the head and died of the blow the other that the man the same man was at the same time and place throw overboard and died of the drowning here was the same man killed twice over and this for the better information of the supposed murderer that he might the more clearly understand the charges he had to defend himself against had the fact been truly stated the murderer would have been acquitted this case occurred not much more than twenty years ago the indictment stood the scrutiny of the twelve judges† so again in noncriminali to take the sort of case of all others the most commonly exemplified a man owes you £ 0 and no more you are or are not certain as to the precise description of the debt or the evidence by which you shall be able to prove it your attorney with his special pleader under the bar with or without the advice of a barrister to boot gets a declaration drawn with half a dozen counts in it less or more say half a dozen here then you are made to demand six separate sums of £ 0 each stating them as different and saying of each that it is due to you total £  0 what shall we think of that man but above all of that judge who seeing this or not seeing it proclaims the necessity of certainty and is indefatigable in his eulogiums on the law for the rigour with which it exacts the presence of that best ornament in all legal instruments uses of these forced falsehoods—   half a dozen or a dozen or a score of stories told instead of one so much the more made business   chance of misstatement real or supposed whence application for nullification certainty of a motion and an argument even chance of a fresh suit at any rate more made business   verdict taken in a court alleged not to be the proper one application in consequence more made business as before   the business having thus been rendered incomprehensible to a jury what is given as their verdict is none of theirs but settled some how or other among the men of law neither is the judge himself responsible for it on one or other of all these counts the     plaintiff takes the verdict at his peril that is the plaintiffs lawyers take it at the peril of their client if they take it wrong so much the worse for the client but so much the better for the lawyers the lawyers make the verdict the jury stare jury trial for ever—sacred palladium of english liberty   confirmation of arbitrary power in the hands of the judge the jury serving as a stalking horse incapable of judging for themselves conscious of their own incapacity juries become helpless and do as they are bid how should they do otherwise they know not what is done they know not how to help themselves if the court likes the verdict it stands if not it is got rid of the verdict if an unjust one cannot on the score of its injustice be got rid of without reasons but in this way just or unjust reasons being out of the question it may be got rid of with equal case   the state of the law rendered more and more incognoscible by wrapping up the real dispositions of the law in a covering of nonsense the knowledge of it is rendered impossible to the bulk of the people—to the bulk of those whose fate depends upon it what meets their eyes is gross and palpable nonsense a man dead and alive at the same time a dead man and a live man the same person thirty or forty days making altogether but one day a man constantly present in a place where he never set his foot the same man judge and party and justice all the better for it in jargon such as this no man in whose brain the natural provision of common sense has not been eaten out by false science can avoid beholding so much vile and scandalous nonsense but if by the help of that portion of common sense which each mans fortune has imparted to him it were possible to him to divine what disastrous sense may be at the bottom of this nonsense the nonsense would miss its mark   legislator and people confirmed in the habit of bowing down to falsehood and absurdity and recognising them as being what lawyers are continually proclaiming them to be necessary instruments in the hands of justice if without them justice never is administered what conclusion more natural than that it never can be   corrupting the morals of the people wheresoever the use of fiction prevails and in proportion as it prevails every lawbook is an institute of vice every court of judicature is a school of vice put into the hands of your son the commentaries of blackstone send him to attend the courts at westminster for learning jurisprudence yes but for cherishing in his bosom the principles of veracity of sincerity of true honour stay till you have made your daughter get by heart the words of piron and lord rochester   corrupting the intellectual faculties of the people to what a state of debility and depravation must the understanding of that man have been brought down who can really persuade himself that a lawyers fiction is anything better than a lie of the very worst sort that the whole mass taken together or any one particle of it was ever of any the smallest use to justice fiction may be applied to a good purpose as well as to a bad one in giving support to a useful rule or institution as well as to a pernicious one the virtues of an useful institution will not be destroyed by any lie or lies that may have accompanied the establishment of it but can they receive any increase the virtues of a useful medicine will not be destroyed by pronouncing an incantation over it before it is taken but will they be increased behold here one of the artifices of lawyers they refuse to administer justice to you unless you join with them in their fictions and then their cry is see how necessary fiction is to justice necessary indeed but too necessary but how came it so and who made it so as well might the father of a family make it a rule never to let his children have their breakfast till they had uttered each of them a certain number of lies curses and profane oaths and then exclaim you see my dear children how necessary lying cursing and swearing are to human sustenance     chapter xix fourteenth device—entanglement of jurisdictions §   division of jurisdiction how far subservient to the ends of justice jurisdiction being considered as divisible the possible modes of division may be comprised under two denominations geographical division and logical or say metaphysical the latter comprehending every mode not included under the former the extent of the state in question being to a certain degree considerable division on the geographical principle is prescribed as has been seen immediately by the regard due to the collateral ends of justice viz saving of the delay vexation and expense attendant on journeys and demurrage the division being already carried to as great a length as is prescribed by the mere consideration of the regard due to those ends of justice—add the supposition of a certain degree of populousness in the districts marked out in conformity to those ends the disposable time of the one tribunal if there be but one may be to such a degree drawn upon as to be inadequate to the demands thus made upon it suppose this to be the case thence arises an absolute and irrecusable demand for one or other of two operations a further division upon the geographical principle a division of the first instituted district into more districts than one say into two districts or the institution of more courts than one say two in the same district each of these arrangements has its peculiar advantage divide the district into two each with its separate court you reduce in proportion the quantum of delay vexation and expense incident to journeys and demurrage but then you have no emulation leaving the district undivided put two courts into it each with precisely the same jurisdiction as the other you get the advantage of emulation supposing all other circumstances equal or in case of inequality competent allowance made for it the number of suits brought in the course of the year in the one court compared with the number brought within the same space of time in the other court will if made public constitute a sort of index exhibiting the respective heights at which the reputation of the two judges or sets of judges for the time being stand in the scale of public estimation of these two advantages the former is much the more certain in its nature it depends on causes purely physical causes much steadier in their operation than any psychological ones it is subject to no accidents between two places the distance is not apt to change no expedient can lessen that distance of this advantage however no notice has been ever taken at least by english lawyers how should it recognise this circumstance in the character of an advantage you recognise at once the worthlessness of the system which labours to such an excess under the opposite inconvenience the other advantage being in its nature the more vague and unsusceptible of calculation is on that very score the better qualified for recommending itself under a system with the endurance of which a general habit of thinking with precision is incompatible to the polemic to the rhetorician in whose sight victory is as precious as truth is worthless no argument is so acceptable as one which he can make as much or as little of as he pleases in legislation first the advantages and disadvantages of an arrangement are sought out and weighed then if the advantages are deemed to preponderate the arrangement receives the touch of the sceptre in jurisprudence first the arrangement is observed to be established this observation made then comes the problem—required to find out the advantages of it original shortsightedness had divided the business upon the logical principle of division among three courts mutual rapacity had by degrees broke down here and there the fences mutual lassitude and impotence have left things in this state the former arrangement though made by the legislator was made so long ago that it could not but have been a wise one the latter though made in the teeth of the former being a work of lawyers was still wiser required to prove it so no other argument being to be found the principle of emulation offered itself and was received with open arms that the influence of this principle so far as it extends is salutary seems out of dispute but as to the subjecting the amount of it to any sort of calculation the impossibility has already been brought to view the effect of the emulation depends upon the notoriety of the proportions but as to the giving to the public the possibility of being acquainted with them no such thing was ever done publication of tables exhibiting the degree of success in hospitals is in every days practice medical men being destitute of power have nothing to serve as a ground for business but reputation nor anything to serve as a ground for reputation but desert or at least statements which taking them for true afford presumptions of desert if in both or in either of two courts the interest created by the love of ease happens to be ever so little stronger than the interest created by love of reputation the principle of emulation is without effect judge titius may conduct himself less badly     than judge sempronius and yet conduct himself in a line of frequent repugnancy to the ends of justice a system of registration so contrived as to show continually—in the instance of every judge of every suit carried on under the direction of every such judge and of every step taken in the course of every such suit—the degree of regard paid to the several ends of justice—such a system would afford a still more steady and uniformlyoperating security for good behaviour than can be afforded by the mere operation of putting two courts with the same jurisdiction into one district for the chance of the benefit to which in their instance it may happen to the principle of emulation to give birth the superiority has long been constant and decided the two judges or one of them if they live long enough sink into the vale of years what then becomes of the emulation which fifty or sixty years earlier both being at eton or westminster would have rendered each so eager to take the others place be it allowed however that in certain situations it may be if not upon the whole advantageous at least not in any very high degree disadvantageous that in one and the same judicial district that district not being a very extensive one there should be two courts with power over the same sorts of causes viz under inconsiderable exceptions all sorts of causes operating according to the same system of procedure collecting evidence in the same mode and in the same shape exerting in every case sufficient powers and therefore in every case the same powers the one as the other for effectuating the forthcomingness as well of things as of persons as well in the character of the matter of satisfaction and where necessary of punishment as in the character of sources of evidence each being possessed of the several powers adequate to those several purposes each consequently ought to be possessed of the same powers the powers of each being subjected to the most effectual system of checks capable of being employed consistently with the adequate execution of these several powers in subservience to the several ends of justice the powers of each ought to be subjected to the same checks such are the terms on which the existence of two courts in the same district may be according to the extent of the district either advantageous upon the whole or not decidedly and in any very high degree disadvantageous the advantages from emulation viz in respect of superior security against misdecision being set against the disadvantages in respect of increase of delay vexation and expense by journeys and demurrage change the terms in any respect you will find no cases in which the effects of such multiplicity can be other than disadvantageous give to one court cognizance of causes of one description to another court cognizance of causes of another description each to the   0 exclusion of the other in the first place you lose the benefit of emulation in the next place you produce without any use the danger of collision on the part of the plaintiff uncertainty to which of the two courts he ought to apply on the occasion of this or that individual cause on the part of the defendant uncertainty whether to submit or not to submit to the cognizance endeavoured by the plaintiff to be given to the one or the other court on the occasion of that individual cause on the part of each court uncertainty whether it ought to take cognizance of this or that sort of cause with the purest intentions on the part of those by whom the line of demarcation is drawn and with intentions equally pure on the part of those whose duty it is to conform to that line the application of the metaphysical principle of division has ever been a difficult one and one which is constantly liable to give birth to those doubts and contestations the prevention of which is aimed at by it—with the purest intention in both quarters—much more with sinister and corrupt intentions in either quarter or in both—much more again if the two functions shall everywhere have been as under the feegathering system united in the same hand that hand employed in carving out jurisdiction for itself to fatten upon it will be matter of difficulty in the maturest and strongest state of the public mind—much more must it have been in those ages of barbarity and ignorance in which those lines of demarcation have been scratched in so many directions with so much emolument to the draughtsman and so much delay vexation and expense to the suitors of succeeding times in regard moreover to modes of collecting evidence and of securing forthcomingness—one of the two courts being provided with a set of powers and checks adapted in the best manner that can be devised to those respective purposes—if in the provision made in any respect in the instance of the second court there be any variation that variation since by the supposition it cannot be for the better will either in itself be upon a par with the arrangement that corresponds to it in the case of the first court or it will be for the worse the best that can happen to it is to be upon a par but in this case—though of itself by the supposition either would have been as good as the other—yet there being also by the supposition diversity without use the effects of that diversity cannot but to the extent of it be purely disadvantageous in its purest possible state of simplicity the law in every part of it draws upon all men for a portion of labour and intelligence more than all men have to bestow upon it here is an inevitable imperfection with the inevitable inconveniences that are its consequences add to this inevitable degree of complexity that is of nonnotoriety and thence of uncertainty a single degree that is not inevitable every word thus added is a nuisance §   distinction between law and equity how far should it be included in the list of devices in speaking of the entanglement of jurisdictions and in particular of the entanglement created by the sham distinction between law and equity i mentioned it as an article in the list of devices it may be expected that it shall be shown by what title it occupies the place given to it in the list it will be found that the device is not in the creation but in the preservation of it of itself it can scarcely make out a sufficient title to the name in its original creation it was not mischievous but beneficial among the contrivances as yet brought to view under the name of devices not one but what in proportion as in effect as well as design it was subservient to the sinister ends of judicature was repugnant purely repugnant to every end of justice equity judicature though in design directed with as much fidelity as the other to the same ends and though in effect contributory in a very high degree to some of those ends viz the collateral ends of delay vexation and expense considered as the necessary avenues to profit was in effect contributory also in a very high degree to the direct ends of justice to the prevention of misdecision and of failure of justice but though itself not in strictness entitled to be numbered among the devices purely hostile to the ends of justice yet so intimate has been its combination with them so close the alliance that in any survey taken of them the omission of so capital a feature would have left a most material deficiency in england so unexampled was the imperfection of the original scheme of judicature so many of the exigencies of society had it left without provision altogether that an addition from some quarter or other was matter of absolute necessity these necessary additions with an almost inconceivable stupidity the original set of judges refused to make by another set of judges bred up in a different—a foreign and in a great degree even a     hostile school—under the authority or by the sufferance of the same sovereign these additions came by degrees to be made but the new hands by which these indispensable additions were made would not work but upon their own terms the terms imposed upon suitors by the judges of the old school profitable as they were to the imposers grievous proportionably to the suitors rendered such by the set of devices as above explained were not yet grievous enough were not yet profitable enough for the judges of the new and foreign school the homebred judges shook off by degrees the obstacle opposed to their designs by the presence of the parties and at last contrived to avoid seeing them till the very last instant when it is impossible to help it and when no good can come from it from first to last romebred judges never would suffer the parties to come into their presence at all homebred judges when writing was scarce and dear insisted upon its being employed in considerable quantity to no purpose or to worse than none romebred judges refused to meddle with a cause without a vast and boundless mass of writing employed in the first instance the evil done by the judges of the original english school in respect of the exigencies left without provision—the evil thus done by them in so far as doing nothing can be called doing was immense the good done by the judges of the roman school in respect of the provision made by them for the same exigencies—the good thus done by them though done so badly as well as upon such bad terms was proportionably extensive the good thus done consisted in the aid thus lent to the direct ends of justice the evil done by the new workmen in the execution of the new work consisted in the enhancement of the evils of delay vexation and expense evil done not for its own sake—of that gratuitous wickedness they must stand acquitted—but as in the case of the old workmen for the sake of the profit extracted out of the expense we have seen the engines employed by the old school in the manufacture of that mass of profityielding evil which it fell to their share to organize in the fabrication of the augmented mass manufactured by the new set of hands engines the same in the main were employed but with here and there a variation in the proportions all this while be it never for a moment out of sight that—how well soever when compared with the commonlaw branch of the technical system equity with its peculiar branch of that system may be entitled to the appellation of a remedy—compared with the natural system it is so much sheer abuse whatever imperfections equity has corrected in so bad a way and upon such exorbitant terms the natural mode if suffered to have gone on undisturbed would have prevented from ever coming into existence and would whenever called in supply the defect in the best manner as well as upon the best terms how numerous are the instances of necessary rights for which common law gives no remedy on any terms nor equity without keeping the parties for months or years in hot water but for which a justice of peace operating in the mode in which he is in the habit of operating as far as the law will suffer him would give a more effectual and less precarious remedy in the course of as many hours or minutes think of that remedy by which though still a remedy natural and necessary inconveniences never cease to receive a twentyfold a hundredfold or a thousandfold in crease and this in an age priding itself on its civilization and in a nation never tired of boasting of its laws so long therefore as—while a better an infinitely better remedy might be had for all the defects of common law—this entanglement of jurisdictions a remedy so imperfect and producing so many collateral evils is allowed to subsist—so long although the purpose for which it was created was a highly beneficial one the preservation of it has an indisputable title to a place in the list of devices no man regarding the subject with a view to the ends of justice and the welfare of society can seriously believe that the existence of two repugnant masses of substantive law—that the existence of two repugnant masses of adjective law two systems of procedure grounded on repugnant principles—is really conducive to those ends if this be so then to the score of device of artifice of fraud of hypocrisy must be referred whatsoever composed complacency much more whatsoever active and busy applause and admiration we see bestowed upon english jurisprudence for the felicity it enjoys in the monoply of this peculiar excellence §   equity jurisdiction its origin and extent taken by itself or anywhere else than in company with the word court equity is abracadabra a word without a meaning to give a meaning to it you must connect it with the word court and say court of equity     what then is a court of equity any court in which the course of procedure is in a certain form the characteristic of that form being the sort of instrument called a bill in equity any court in which the instrument the written instrument in which the plaintiff states his demand that is the judicial service which he calls upon the judge to render to him bears that name to bear that name it must contain besides occasional parts three essential parts the charging part containing a statement of the alleged facts—the interrogating part containing questions adapted to the purpose of extracting from the defendant a sort of confessorial testimony admitting the matter of fact alleged or so much of it as shall be sufficient to warrant the judge in acceding to the prayer—and the prayer itself in which a statement is given of the service looked for at the hands of the judge the defendant if he means to combat the obligation of rendering this service is under an obligation of yielding the testimony thus demanded of him the instrument in which it is contained is called an answer the defendants answer to the plaintiffs bill at the time this answer is delivered in at an office the truth of it is declared in general terms by a vivâ voce declaration accompanied with the ceremony of an oath of this ceremony the effect is to deprive a man pro re natâ of the benefit of the mendacitylicence granted as already explained to all parties on the occasion of the pleadings delivered in by their respective attorneys on the occasion of a suit in a court of common law to the plaintiff in respect of his bill the licence is reserved and he is even compelled to make use of it to the defendant it is not reserved what then is equity answer whatever has ever been done by a court of equity a court of equity is a sort of court peculiar to english jurisprudence and the institution of which took place at a period of time comparatively recent relation being had to the other courts called courts of common law the powers assumed by this sort of court have applied themselves to the substantive branch of the field of law as well as to the adjective branch the law of procedure   to the substantive branch accordingly you have legal estates and you have equitable estates the same estate which by the commonlaw courts if applied to would be given to one man the equity courts give to another the same estate which upon your applying for it to a commonlaw court the court will give to you—an equity court upon an application made by your adversary will give to your adversary in case of a conflict or seeming conflict of this sort the equity court is the strongest nor is the commonlaw court dissatisfied it has had its fees the subject which gives most occasion to this difference is the interpretation put upon conveyances wills as well as deeds included the interpretation put upon these instruments or rather the disposition made of mens property on pretence of interpretation common law gives the property to one man equity to another when a mans intention or pretended intention has been ascertained equity will sometimes give effect to it in a case in which common law would refuse to give effect to it   to the adjective branch in this field the principal operations of equity may be ranked under two heads—  rendering for the purpose of giving effect to acknowledged rights a variety of services which the commonlaw courts through stupidity or inability had omitted to do   stopping what was in a course of being done or overthrowing what had been done by the commonlaw courts upon a variety of occasions between stupidity and inability the distinction is no other than between cause and effect before the equity courts grew up and trenched upon them the commonlaw courts did or might have done whatever they pleased there was therefore no inability but such as was voluntary doing abundance of things which they omitted to do they might not only have done which indeed was less than nothing to them more good but what was everything to them have got more money therefore so far as inability extended it had stupidity for its cause from whatever cause however—the list of the things which they could not that is to say would not do was a pretty long one what they could do and did do amounted to this they could punish a man—hang him—cut his hands or legs off they could take a thing a moveable thing bodily from one man and put it into the hands of another from a house or a field they could turn a man head and shoulders and put him into jail if he came in again they could take and at one time used to take for example on pretence of your having been outlawed when it was no such thing your estate and divide it amongst themselves they could take the property of a dozen men jurymen together and destroy or dissipate it it was what they did as often as a new trial was granted till about the middle of the seventeenth century they would not grant one upon any other terms     what they could not do was—everything else not one thing whatsoever that a man ought to do could they make him do a man had agreed with you to sell you an estate and you had paid him the money could they make him put you in possession of the estate or put you in possession of it themselves not they indeed what they could do was to punish him or make a show of punishing him for not having done it give you or make a show of giving you money instead of the estate to raise the money take his goods if he had not sense to put them out of the way—take them sell them and give you what they fetched take his goods or instead of his goods if he had lands and had not sense to dispose of them take half of them and but half when double would not suffice in regard to the future and in the way of restraint they could stop another set of judges a subordinate court from doing what they chose should not be done but they knew not how to deal with individuals they could stop encroachments upon their judicature but they could not stop waste when a house was pulled down they could punish a man for having pulled it down when a grove or an avenue was cut down they could punish him for having cut it down but as to the preventing or stopping him it was out of their line mischief must first be done before they would stir a finger to prevent it when the steed was stolen then and not till then were they ready and willing to shut the stable door it required equity when equity reared its head to stop waste thus in the way of restraint alone and that very imperfectly could they operate upon the future in the way of compulsion they knew not how to deal with it there was a particular circumstance to which they were in a considerable degree if not altogether indebted for their impotence and that was their connexion with a jury how a set of men in many respects so arbitrary came to find themselves hampered with this salutary clog is among the many historical points involved in darkness but so it was by kings bench by common pleas by exchequer scarce anything was to be done but either for or with a jury but there are abundance of things that could not be done and never have been done nor ever can be done by a jury and amongst these are many things so necessary so strictly necessary that without them the existence of society in a state of civilization ever so little above the state of barbarism ever so little approaching to the present is a matter physically impossible—every function requiring occasional and occasionally repeated superintendence—every function requiring a constant eye to the future and a ready hand to follow it—everything that was to be done in a cause which in any one of a multitude of respects was to a certain degree complex except the anomalous and next to unexampled case where jurymen have been treated like cardinals in a conclave—whatever is done by a jury well or ill must be done in a single sitting shut up again after they have been turned loose they are no jury—their claim to confidence is gone by possibility a jury may sit together because they have sitten together twentyfour hours but if they have sat together half the time unless they take their verdict blindly from the judge he choosing to give it to them cross and pile would present a better chance for justice habituated to act with a jury these sages knew not how to act without one no pipe no dance no jury no justice with a jury or in the meantime for a jury was everything to be done what could not be done with a jury was either not worth doing or could not be done superstition bears her shackles everywhere poetry has been cramped by unities by unities justice too has been cramped at the playhouse what could not be squeezed into five hours was not to be represented in westminster hall what could not be squeezed into twentyfour hours was not to be done of the three commonlaw courts the commonlaw half of each exchequer judge included there was but one the kings bench that had any notion of bidding any man except the sheriff do anything and if having received the order in lawjargon called a mandamus a man chose to make a lying excuse there ended the suit in a fresh suit if you could prove the lie upon him then came work for a jury and then he might be made to pay so much money as the jury taxed him at but as to making him obey the order it was not to be thought of from their incapacity of compelling a man to do his duty coupled with their incapacity of doing anything that could not be done in twentyfour hours resulted their incapacity for the discharge of a number of functions on the discharge of which the continuance of society depends   scarce an act of power whether over person or property could they make a man exercise—scarce a trust as the phrase is could they make him execute for the benefit of another from this they were disqualified not only by the two causes above brought to view but by a third likewise most trusts and in particular all domestic trusts require continued superintendence—interposition not constant indeed but eventual and occasional at a moments warning cruelty negligence dissipation imbecility have not their long vacation but the custodes morum the judges had and resolved to     have their long vacation not one week of it would they part with the wife might be plagued to death the child corrupted the property consumed and wasted—it was no concern of theirs   if an account of any considerable length wanted settling they had no tolerable means of settling it an account with a thousand items in it five hundred on one side as many on the other contains the matter of a thousand suits were there ten thousand they would have had no objection to dispose of them if presented one by one but if presented in a mass they know not what to make of it   if a thing were in dispute between two parties the one not in possession of the thing could settle it by bringing an action against the other but if a third had also a claim they knew not what to do about it   destruction of property houses trees and so forth they had no notion so much as of stopping much less preventing so long as the destroyer had a right to the use of it damages meaning satisfaction in money they were ready to give as soon as he had absconded   if a complex mass of property called for distribution they knew not how to go about it for every death that took place not to speak of insolvency if the deceased was worth anything there was a complex mass of property vacant and requiring to be disposed of but death was of the number of those contingencies that had escaped their providence   if an executor had promised to pay a legacy left by his testator they could take measures as above for making him pay it but if choosing rather to keep the money he had the wit not to make any such promise they knew not what to do with him he might do as he would with it for anything they could do to get it from him in some of these instances they could not act at all in others if they did act it was so awkwardly and so badly they had better not have meddled with it in comparison of their mode equity with all its delays was found a relief here then was a gold mine—a mine rich in business open to any hand that had strength to seize it and the wit to work it the clergy a set of adventurers who were always on the alert—the clergy dividing themselves into two parties entered and took possession of so many different parts of it one party with one pretence that is with one set of words in their mouths the other with another some talked of holy mother church and souls and pious uses for the good of a mans soul whatever he had died possessed of be it what it would so it were worth having they were ready to charge themselves with it for pious uses and of all uses none were so pious as their own the bishops having for their proper and only ostensible function the showing men heaven and keeping them on the right road to it soon perceived that there was no earthly power which in such pious hands might not be made subservient to that pious end at an early period not to speak of the goods of intestates including all the moveable property in the country in the line of judicature they soon got possession of causes relative to testaments and causes relative to marriage with a few et cæteras not worth mentioning here being however the delegates of a spiritual authority rivalizing with the temporal authority of the king they found their career checked and limits tolerably precise the time of day considered set to it the good of souls was their object the good of souls was their motto and what is above with the administering a little fatherly or motherly correction by the bye for pawpaw tricks was all they were allowed to do for it in testamentary and matrimonial causes what was done by them badly as it was done would scarcely in those times have been done less badly by any other hands to another set a single word equity answered every purpose what little knowledge the times afforded was in a manner engrossed by ecclesiastics the kings righthand man his virtual first minister under the name of chancellor was of that profession whatever in the way of judicature was ready to be done he was ready for doing it always understood so long as money was to be got by doing it this great officer chose for his motto the word equity whatsoever a bishop did was for the good of mens souls whatsoever a lord chancellor did was for equity it has been among the artifices of men in power to fasten upon some abstract term to beget upon it some ideal shadowy being from the influence of which on the imaginations of mankind they could derive respect and into the darkness of which they could occasionally escape from envy and from censure ecclesiastics the sons of the church were liable like other men to be fools—like other men to be knaves—like other men to be liars but the church their holy mother ever one ever the same ceased not for a moment to be allwise all trustworthy infallible like other men men of law sometimes through imbecility sometimes through cunning have ever and anon not to say most commonly clothed their conceptions in the language of absurdity but that the law herself or itself through all vicissitudes has never ceased to be the perfection of reason is placed out of     doubt by the concurrent testimony of coke and blackstone a judge with the title of chancellor upon his head and the word equity between his lips will be no less exposed than a judge with the title of judge upon his head and the words law common law between his lips to be turned aside by imbecility or cunning into the paths of iniquity and injustice but that equity is a personage still more perfect than that law which is the perfection of reason is clear not only by the assumption of all equitymen but by the confession more or less explicit of common lawyers themselves the range of the judicature exercised for the good of mens souls found the limits that have just been mentioned what limits it will naturally be asked had equity in principle none at all what are the occasions on which a judge ought to act otherwise than according to equity in practice—ask for the boundary line of equity as well might it be asked what line had ignoramus been describing upon the floor when he said of himself buzzo et torno sicut musca sine caput ask any institutional writer ask a lord     chancellor himself ask both in one—as readily will he undertake to trace out the line described by ignoramus in his irregularities as the boundary line of his own jurisdiction with all its regularity though not less regular than equitable to spiritual courts testamentary causes matrimonial causes sins to admiralty courts maritime causes to these jurisdictions already something of a boundary line in those few words but to equity courts what causes answer equity causes what is to accommodate why to accommodate as if i were to accommodate you or you to accommodate me in a word to accommodate of your knowing if it were to be known what equity is and whereabouts the line that bounds its jurisdiction runs the practical use—supposing you unfortunate enough to have need of something to be done for you by a court of equity—would be that of your knowing whether it would or would not be done in such a case take for your direction the only answer the only honest one at least that can be given among the scanty and confused accounts that accident has brought to light of what has been done by judges in consequence of a bill in equity rummage and see if you can whether anything like what you want to have done has ever been done on grounds like those on which you would call for its being done if yes and the view taken of the matter by the judge happens to be the same as yours then perhaps it may be done if no then probably it will not be done by you gentle reader whoever you are if you be not a lawyer i mean your lawyers for as to yourself if it were in your power from any data within your reach to form any such conception about the matter as would be of any use to you they and those whose estate they have would have been labouring for so many centuries with very inadequate success how could it be expected that there should be any line of demarcation between the cases where a court of equity does and where it does not interfere since the limits of its jurisdiction like that of all other jurisdictions under english law was left to be settled by a scramble the history of the scramble would require a volume a short sketch of it however may be given here it is highly instructive with the single exception of the spiritual power—a power which disdaining all limits was comprisable under no rules—in the new settlement that took place after the norman conquest the geographical principle of division if not exclusively established appears to have been nearly so in the great outlines in each county a sheriffs court competent to every sort of suit attached to the person of the king a supreme court competent to every sort of suit and moreover exercising a controul over the several local courts in an evil hour this natural simplicity was violated by a wretched attempt at logical demarcation suits in general spiritual excepted as before were distributed under three unmeaning heads pleas of the crown common pleas and exchequer causes exchequer causes meant revenue causes† pleas of the crown and common pleas meant nothing at all but in a course of ages a meaning was to be made for them made by a tripartite scramble the miserable people whose property it was tearing to pieces remaining in hot water all the while pleas of the crown judged of under the cognizance of a set of judges whose principal occupation consisted in hanging men under the name of felons followed the person of the king in his perpetual rambles common pleas and exchequer causes became stationary at westminster exchequer causes by custom common pleas by law attached all this while to the person of the king was a most indispensable officer whose business it was to give form and authentication to all permanent expressions of the kings will and pleasure—to all permanent mandates issued by him—to all contracts to which he was a party this officer stood distinguished by the name of chancellor of the distinguished subjects in whose company the monarch spent his time those who were not ecclesiastics sometimes could read and sometimes not—the ecclesiastics always could the chancellor was always an ecclesiastic what this minister could not find time for was the administration of justice or whatever was administered under that name what he could and did find time for was to sell permissions to apply for justice elsewhere by the opening of this shop the people of england were divided into two classes to those who could raise the money justice was sold to the remainder it was denied note that what was thus sold at the great shop was not justice itself but leave to buy it that is a bad chance of it at another shop‡     justice was thus regularly polluted at the very fountain head polluted by an arrangement in which the mischief of extortion was the most apparent but the mischief of complication an invisible but endless train of mischief not the less real because too subtle for an ordinary eye to follow was the most felt the judges of the kings bench such was the title given to those who had cognizance of pleas of the crown the judges of the kings bench having no right to meddle at all meddled in comparison but little in causes between individual and individual these under the name of common pleas had fallen to the share of the judges of another court besides the rapacity and insincerity inseparably attached under the feegathering system to the very station of judge their conduct was so peculiarly marked by absurdity and that absurdity so constantly fruitful in mischief and misery that the complaints of injured suitors running continually to the king left him no rest these judges were nailed by law to their bench at westminster the chancellor was constantly at the kings elbow these people are teazing me to death these judges seem to have lost their senses go out to them do my good lord hear what the people have to say for themselves and see what is to be done the good lord was a spiritualist spiritual ideas came last from rome what he had learnt he had learnt at rome or at least from those whose learning had come from rome at rome in addition to polemical theology in which his lordship was an adept of course what was to be learnt over and above reading and writing was roman law by roman law though everything had been done badly everything had been done of the distresses which by the outcries raised by them had given so much disturbance a great part had been produced by those vacuities which the stupidity of the judges had rendered them unable or their obstinancy unwilling to fill up of the english mode of administering soidisant justice and of the sort of justice administered in that mode his lordship knew as little as he cared with roman justice and the roman mode of administering it he was more or less acquainted roman law the seat of monarchical despotism and the source of the most restless usurpation had all along been an object of just suspicion to the few great lords who in their assembly during its shortlived and precarious existence shared with the king the power of sovereignty we understand little enough of our own laws but we understand nothing at all of yours our own we are used to and we wont suffer any change such had been the answer by which a project copied from roman law without thought had been repelled in like manner without the trouble of thinking popular expressions are a wellknown mask and sometimes an effectual one for measures that are unpopular or might otherwise have been so equity was a term that had all along been in use for distinguishing what presented itself as most popular in law against whatever changes the reverend romanist might find himself disposed to introduce in the character of relief he found a hobgoblin ready armed—the horror of innovation to encounter it he opened his rhetorical budget and produced the soothing sound of equity ye are suffering under the plague of stupid and unjust judges ye are afflicted behold in equity pure and holy roman equity behold in it a balm for all your sorrows to fill up in a considerable degree the gaps which had been left in english law by its homebred professors a head was found to be an instrument not altogether necessary a hand with a pen in it was sufficient few except professed shoemakers know how to make shoes few that find any difficulty in fetching a pair from a warehouse in the roman law the clergy had been used to see a sort of warehouse in which slops of all sorts were to be had ready made and in any quantity and without the trouble of taking measure nothing could be more fortunate to take measure of feet for new shoes would     have been found by these adepts a comparatively easy task to take measure of exigencies for new laws if the laws were to be good ones was altogether out of their line as much so as out of that of their homebred colleagues to make good shoes they would have had nothing to unlearn to make good laws had their situation admitted of their harbouring any such wish they would have had a great deal to unlearn almost everything they had ever learnt since they had been learners not but that the field of law had in that school been surveyed long enough and anxiously enough but it was in no such point of view it had been worked in long enough and industriously enough but it was to no such purpose prepared by jargon it had been thick sown with iniquity delay and vexation thicker than even the english field that it might be rich in fees a course of procedure for continued inquiries or for continued interposition good from rome too or anywhere if not to be had otherwise and no better to be had but equity—what had all this to do with equity what more than with so many other fair and pleasant and popular words that might be mentioned—justice right reason or conscience but equity was the cant word that happened to present itself one cant word innovation had been employed to set men against changes from that quarter it required some other cant word to reconcile them to it this happened to be uppermost man calls himself a rational animal and thus it is he is governed to govern a camel the arabs put a hook into his nose to govern a man you sound a cant word in his ear—church liberty equity jury and with this the animal with the two legs is led or drawn as you please as to equity cant it was and nothing else as anybody may see that chooses it what had equity to do with the forcing a man to do what he ought to do any more than with the punishing him for not having done what he ought to have done with settling long accounts any more than with settling short ones with settling a dispute between three parties any more than between two with making distribution of a mass of property taken together any more than with making a separate disposition of any or all of the articles it was composed of with making an executor or any other man pay what he ought to pay without having promised it than with making him pay it after he had promised with making a man fulfil an agreement about a hundred pounds worth of land any more than with making him fulfil an agreement about a hundred pounds worth of cows or horses one part of the beauties of equity still remains to be brought to view in the jurisdiction assumed by the courts of equity may be distinguished in so far as in so thick an entanglement anything can be distinguished two branches which for this purpose may be expressed by the terms the originally operating or necessary branch and the controuling or abusive branch by the originally operating branch let us understand that which operates in the cases where the business which is done by equity is not meddled with at all by common law this branch is that we have been glancing over and which was rendered necessary we have seen how by the controuling branch let us understand that which operates where what has been doing and doing without reproach to those by whom it has been done at common law is at the mere suggestion of the defendant overturned if he prevails stopped for an indefinite time at any rate by a court of equity among the various classes of depredators one has been distinguished in which they hunt in couples one of the pair runs violently against a man and knocks him into the kennel the other with sympathetic eagerness runs up to his assistance drives off the assailant helps up the sufferer and picks his pockets the ruffian thief is common law the hypocrite thief is equity of the controuling branch of equity business the principal part will be brought to the view of the man of law by the word injunction injunction applied to the stopping of proceedings in a commonlaw court a view has been given of the species of sham justice called special pleading the practice of injunctions is a sort of aggravation of that grievance the same fraud the same hypocrisy but by means of still more barbarous vexation and delay productive of still richer pillage for a twelvemonth or so your debtor has been fighting you off in a commonlaw court the powers of commonlaw delay are exhausted you are on the point as you suppose of getting your due in comes a writ of injunction and now you are at the commencement of a suit in equity the pretence may be no matter what since for the purchase of the delay there is no sort of use in its being true the following is as natural as any in the commonlaw suit the decision in your favour was grounded on the evidence of some one else but you in the commonlaw suit the plaintiff now by the equity suit converted into a defendant—you of your own knowledge know as you have done all along that the fact on which the verdict was grounded was not true the commonlaw judges will not allow you to be interrogated the equity judges will there needs therefore a suit in equity     the pretence may be as mendacious as in the case of the commonlaw pleadings for the same providence that granted the mendacitylicence in that case extends it on to this in a court of conscience the same common sense and common honesty that reprobate special pleadings would have reprobated the injunction along with them your debtor being in the presence of the judge and you in the same presence at the same time—whatsoever each of you knows in relation to the fact in dispute would have come out upon the spot extracted by your reciprocal interrogations you see how poor a resource special pleading is in comparison with an injunction that is would be if either were to exclude a man from the benefit of the other a sham plea if it comes at all must come in the middle of the suit and the suit though it has ever so many of them is still but one suit and that but a commonlaw suit but an injunction is an entire suit a second suit and that an equity one piled upon the first the commonlaw suit is a dwarf the equity suit a giant mounted upon his shoulders by the injunction the commonlaw suit may indeed be stopped at any stage—may be stopped at the earliest but your adversary and his solicitor know little of their business if they bring it out a single moment before the last note well here in what the abuse consists not in the giving powers for compelling the testimony of the party for without such powers there is no justice the abuse then consists not in the giving of those powers but in the leaving to him who wishes for them to no other purpose than that of an instrument of abuse the faculty of delaying the use of them to so late a period and by sending him to a fresh court obliging him as well as enabling him to plunge his injured adversary as well as himself in the depths of a fresh suit of the morality of the priest of equity let three short features of his divinity serve as a sample—  for mendacity so long as your debtor confines himself to the character of plaintiff care is taken never to punish him accordingly lest he should be punished care must be taken that mendacity shall not be perjury   for abstaining from mendacity were he ill enough advised to do so he would be punished he would be punished by the loss of his cause for of whatever fact the plaintiff is not informed and therefore for the requisite information applies to the defendant he must give to understand that he the plaintiff is informed saying that it is so and so   if for the proof of any fact on your part you have need of the confession of your part you have need of the confession of your debtor care has been taken that you shall not have it without a third suit a second equity suit in which you are to be plaintiff with the benefit of the mendacitylicence and under the same obligation of making use of it† all this under the notion of affording at the end of two three or four years a chance but that a very inferior chance of that justice which in a court of conscience  00 in the selfsame case would have been administered in less than a thousandth part of the time by the originally operating branch of the equity business the mischief of delay vexation and expense is simply augmented by the controuling branch it is more than doubled when common law has picked the bones of a cause equity comes in and sucks the marrow to the evil produced by superior rapacity as between court and court is added the evil that results from the having two courts to be dragged through instead of one the device of bandying a cause from pillar to post is thus employed and with increased effect it is bad enough to the suitors when the suit is to be bandied from court to court in the same system of courts when bandied from system to system the journey is longer and still worse to the evil of more than doubled delay vexation and expense is thus added the evil of complication the evil of enhanced delay vexation and expense is the more prominent and sensible the mischief of complication is more radical and extensive confusion in practice is thus fixed and protected by confusion of ideas in the language of lawyers and thence in the conceptions of their dupes oppression being confounded with relief men are prepared to cling to both with equal pertinacity when the two sets of courts were at daggersdrawn the suitors were crushed by their collision for above a century and a half they have been upon the best terms and all this time the suitor has been a sufferer by their confederacy discordia pestis concordia exitium had either got the better the suitor would have had but one court to be dragged through and now he has two mark well the profundity of the artifice in virtue of the mixture of the two systems and the confusion generated by that mixture mischief is everywhere blame nowhere commonlaw procedure is imperfect shall not the imperfection be supplied equity therefore is indispensable but would equity suffice without common law still less for besides the still more excessive delay and expense its jurisdiction is composed of nothing but a few scanty and incoherent scraps and it trenches upon trial by jury viewed with reference to the ends of justice neither is superfluous both together are wretchedly inadequate viewed with reference to the ends of judicature neither is superfluous both together constitute as perfect a system as heart could wish or ingenuity devise viewed with reference to the ends of justice the natural system as exemplified in the practice of courts of conscience though wanting powers such as might easily be given to it to fit it for universal use is beyond comparison more efficient than common law and equity put together but in proportion as it approaches to perfection with reference to the ends of justice in the same proportion is it inapplicable with reference to the ends of judicature chaos is the grand rampart of chicane and for the organization of chaos the services of equity have been beyond price §   absurdity of the distinction between courts of equity and courts of law two sets of courts professing to pursue the same ends but by different and discordant means means so completely discordant that though both systems may be wrong—wrong to any degree—yet by this discordance alone were there no other cause it is rendered impossible for them to be both right common law with you equity against you and has it ever been seriously imagined that there exists in the nature of things any difference corresponding to this difference in sounds that in the same sort of case in the same individual case there should be two sets of courts one proceeding and bound to proceed by one set of rules the other by another set of rules the one bound to do what the other is bound to undo one bound to govern itself by a set of rules which if the rules by which the other is bound to govern itself be right rules cannot but be wrong ones is this duplicity a real improvement—are the ends of justice served by it if so why not pursue the example of improvement as far as it will go—why withhold from the country the benefit of more and more sets of mutually repugnant rules if such be the advantage of placing the suitor in the service of two everjarring masters law and equity why not give him as many more such masters as in heaven there are stars if such be the advantage of setting the work of common law to be undone by equity why not set conscience to undo the work of both rectitude of all three propriety of all four and so on without end why refuse the benefit of that improvement to so many causes as are tried by courts of conscience and by justices of the peace out of general sessions why not to each such magistrate two sets of ears for the oyer and two sets of voices for the terminer of each cause—an ordinary pair of ears for hearing according to law—a longer pair of ears upon the pattern of midass for hearing according to equity an ordinary voice for pronouncing according to law—a falsetto for pronouncing according to equity why not for the purpose of diminishing the mass of misdecision vexation expense  0  and delay in the practice of courts of conscience divide the commissioners into two sets one sitting on the left side of the court the other on the right side the left side acting by rules which bind them to give the cause in favour of the plaintiff—the right side by rules which in the same individual cause bind them to prevent the plaintiff from getting anything by the decision and ready at any time to put a stop to the cause from first to last or if precedent be preferred why not bestow upon the judges of courts of conscience the duplicity of nature possessed for so many hundred years by the court of exchequer why not give to every court of conscience the same ideal division into two metapysical sides—the commonlaw side and the equity side by the help of which sitting always on the same bench and on the same part of the same bench they may have their equity days and their commonlaw days as in certain shops a lady may choose whether she will buy the same muslin dear or cheap by paying her visit on an ordinary day or a cheap day can any man of common sense and common honesty lay his hand upon his heart and say of this learning that it is anything better than elaborated confusion and licensed pillage and is this dupery to be among the glories by which british freemen are raised above continental slaves in england we had a court once that sat in a chamber with stars for ornaments on the roof of it it had of course like its fellows a set of rules of its own we had then starchamber justice in addition to equity justice and commonlaw justice starchamber justice has been convicted and has abjured the realm in france there was a sort of court once that sat in a chamber with a marble table in it court of the marble table was accordingly the appellation given to it there we see marbletable justice if justice be good in proportion to the number of its varieties—after reviving star or starchamber justice as we have imported equity justice from rome so from france let us import marble or marbletable justice the same learned persons who at present have so distinct a perception of the difference between commonlaw justice on the one part and equity justice on the other part and the absolute necessity there is for equity justice in addition to the other will then have a perception equally distinct of the difference between commonlaw justice and equity justice on the one part and marble justice on the other and the equally urgent necessity there will then be for marble justice in addition to both the old sorts always understood that it be sold according to a different set of rules and that there be a different set of courts or shops for the sale of it in this new shape with a more liberal price upon it proportioned to the superior beauty of the shape trust fraud accident in these three leading terms the institutionalists used to behold the essence of all the powers exercised under the name of equity trust yes it has already been seen how for want of knowing its value law having along with so many other pearls thrown it upon the dunghill equity picked it up but fraud and accident how short are their united powers of being able to typify the smallest part of the work that has already passed before us fraud as to combating if yes—doubtless among the frauds which law was so busy in organizing or protecting there were some which equity scrupled not to fight with better get money though it were by doing good than not get it at all but law too especially in these latter times law came gradually to discover that there are frauds and frauds that if some are to be supported policy requires that others should be fought with and that in short whatsoever are destined to be defeated better that law herself should have the defeating of them than that the job should be left to equity meantime if it be proper that one judge with equity in his mouth should be occupied or destined to be occupied in defeating frauds can it be endurable that another judge or at another time the same judge with common law in his mouth should be occupied in the support of them and what was the legislator about while two sets of judges both being or professing to be under his command were thus busying themselves in opposite ways about fraud—one employed in setting it up the other in overthrowing or making believe to overthrow it answer—fast asleep as usual foxed by essence of nonsense poured down his throat on both sides if a separate court could ever be eligible for a particular sort of causes it would be for complex causes for causes which in their nature requiring an indefinitely protracted portion of the judges time necessitate delay or with less prejudice than the great bulk of causes admit of it in the courts called equity courts so it happens that causes of this description are found almost exclusively in comparison with the courts of common law why because the  0  constitution of these latter courts confining all the real part of the business within the compass of a single sitting and this cramp not extending to the equity courts the latter description of courts are the only courts the ecclesiastical courts excepted in which well or ill the sort of business here in question can be so much as pretended to be done but avoidable or unavoidable what has complication to do with equity under romebred law all over the continent causes of this complicated description are disposed of and in no part of the continent is any such sponge or any such scourge known as a distinct sort of court under the name of an equity court yes in equity may be seen a curse peculiar to english justice poland has her plica the alps their goitres england has her equity this plague be grateful scotland has not crossed the tweed in scotland these complex causes are disposed of as well as simple ones and in scotland there is no such court as an equity court unless indeed it be said that what comes to the same thing for a supreme civil court vexation expense and delay considered there is no court but an equity court in all countries it is true equity is spoken of—that or the equivalent whatever be the language judgment for the plaintiff more strictly conformable to the letter of the law where there is a law judgment for the defendant more consonant to equity equity spoken of as rectitude propriety probity good faith may be spoken of the dictates of justice as contradistinguished from the dictates of a bad law in every country where there are bad laws there will be equity in this sense in no country except england is there any such thing as equity in the sense of another and a distinct body of law in no other country are there two sorts of law—a sort of law called equity a sort of law called law in a continual state of conflict with one another it is not the word that is the grievance it is the two sets of judges pulling different ways and between them tearing to pieces the property of the suitors it is the oscitancy of the legislator sitting mute and drivelling while under his nose two sets of servants both saying to him—lord lord are ordering and disordering the concerns of his household laying about between them and pillaging according to as many repugnant sets of rules never preannounced and as completely as they could be made and kept to all but learned eyes inscrutable it is the mountebank imposture of a particular set of dealers pretending to possess a monopoly of that almost everywhere toodear priced commodity which if honestly sought for would be found everywhere or nowhere this is your only shop for equity none to be had anywhere else for any price equity applied to what we feel of the practice of the courts to which it has given a name it is a term of derision a cruel mockery equity in what class of ideal beings is it to be found is she like justice a sort of goddess and would you see her likeness look for it among jefferiess and kirks lambs is it a remedy it sweetens like sugar of lead it lubricates and soothes like oil of vitriol or butter of antimony  0  §   war between law and equity—compromise between them—its monstrous results for a long time as has already been observed law and equity were at daggersdrawn in proportion as time had given to each a more correct view of its own interests it came to be understood on both sides that there existed not in fact any such opposition between those interests as had been imagined ages ago like lockit and peachum they shook hands and embraced since then instead of righting and scolding their activity has employed itself in finding out ways and means for playing into each others hands why should law quarrel with equity for having found a use for some of her refuse when my lord chief justice has had his pickings upon the error how is he the poorer if the bones of the cause go to be picked on the other side of the passage one day out of twenty a fit of daintiness takes my lord chancellor he wont try the cause not he not for this time without proper evidence such cookery as his own establishment affords is not nice enough the mess must go over the way to be dressed in a style in which nobody but law knows how to dress it and then it is that an issue is sent to be tried by the lord chief justice sent with as polite a grace as if it were a slice of venison dispatched with his lordships compliments to be tossed up over the lamp on the other side of the table for a long time no conception was entertained of the possibility that equity justice and commonlaw justice could be woven in the same loom or measured out from the same shop in process of time when the two sorts of dealers had coalesced and learnt to play into one anothers hands a grand discovery was made not only might the two sorts of courts carry on trade in a connexion and to their mutual advantage but one and the same man it was found might manufacture both sorts of goods and serve out both sorts of ware at once to manage this all that was necessary was that each man should practise the art of dividing himself into two halves neither half knowing what the other is about until the critical moment when the time comes for the equity hand to raise itself and in such manner as by its fall to stop or overturn the work that has been done by the commonlaw hand hence it is that england not only has been but still continues to be so fruitful in a sort of monster such as africa with all her monstrosities never yet disgorged a sort of judge a doublefaced and doublefeed judge with a conscience that has two sides to it the two surfaces with no more communication between them than between the plus and the minus side of the leyden phial before the chain or the wire has brought about an intercourse two half consciences each as ignorant of what is done by the other as the right hand and the left though to a purpose somewhat different have been taught to be the equity conscience bound by sympathy in the hands of sleep while the commonlaw conscience is spinning out delays and picking up fees—fees predestined to be useless to everybody but the receivers here then and from hence you may see sights such as pidcock never could show—   in westminster hall under the name of barons one chief and three puisne judges each with the two halfconsciences†   in the city of london a lord mayor with a conscience for a year together but no longer thus split into two halves‡   in wales duplicity doubled six eminently learned persons in england advocates in wales judges∥ each with the two halfconsciences   in ireland where each english abuse is so sure to find a younger brother a set of monsters of the same breed except that ireland has no wales   in the distant dependencies here a lawyer or set of lawyers each with his two technical halfconsciences there a governor with the technical equity half in addition to whatsoever entire conscience he may have received from nature  0  imagine the following dialogue between a nonlawyer an english lawyer and a french lawyer— french lawyer—everything as it should be yes that it is of course whatever it is and yet i hear odd things of it they tell me you have judges who give them so much money decide in favour of the plaintiff give them so much more money morblen they decide in favour of the defendant pray is this true how stands this matter english lawyer—what judges what courts are you speaking of french lawyer—i understand there are a whole heap of them more than i could remember had they all been named to me say for example the great court of exchequer in westminster hall and all the great travelling welsh courts in these instances then—for these are enough i suppose at least to begin with—pray is the report true nonlawyer—exactly so french lawyer—diable and is this generally known nonlawyer—universally french lawyer—but pray what says your parliament to all this corruption nonlawyer—corruption hold sir—there you are in a mistake were this done by judge a alone or judge b alone in a case between c and d and not in a case between e and f this would be corruption for this would be irregular but being done regularly that is by every such judge in favour of every defendant who comes up to the terms and that in every individual case whatever of this and that general description there is no corruption in the case another thing—corruption is an offence an offence is something contrary to law but this is all of it according to law french lawyer—criminal if in retail lawful if by wholesale an odder sort of trade still than i expected to find it yes let him sit on counter bench or woolsack an englishman wherever he is is a shopkeeper but pray now tell me a little how is it managed the parties being met in the presence of the judge does the judge give notice immediately and say—here mr plaintiff give me so much and i give the decision in your favour unless you mr defendant think it worth while to give me so much more and then i give it in yours english lawyer—parties in the presence of the judge the court a regular court you a lawyer and suppose any such thing suffered in it the cause may have been before the court for six months or twelve months or ever so many more months and unless by accident the judge may know no more about it than you do at last comes the trial and then it is that the judge that is either one of the four judges of that same court or some one judge of some other court known of it for the first time french lawyer—well but when at last he does hear of it—and do for shortness let us suppose it to be a judge of that same court how then at last does he manage nonlawyer—we must put a case—let one serve for a hundred bond by which ligatus engages to vinctor not to do so and so under a penalty of twenty pounds action on the commonlaw side of the court by vinctor alleging a breach and claiming the penalty breach proved the judge says to the jury if you believe the witnesses you will find of course for the plaintiff damages twenty pounds french lawyer—good but what chance has the defendant all this while nonlawyer—have patience in the court of exchequer and all those other double courts every judge has two consciences with a partition between them and an ear and a hand for each as yet it is only the commonlaw conscience that knows anything about the matter—the commonlaw ear being the only one that has been spoken to the commonlaw hand the only one touched what you are expecting is that vinctor will get his twenty pounds ligatus knows better things when the judge directed the twenty pounds to be given to vinctor it was because his equity conscience with its ear and hand knew nothing about the matter four or five months after just as vinctor is going to take out execution in steps ligatus into the equity office and files his bill equity ear is whispered into equity hand touched and so forth hand touched up it starts by a preestablished harmony and without any expense of thought for all this is done by mechanism lays hold of the commonlaw hand and stops it vinctor may now bid adieu to his twenty pounds french lawyer—good but surely what the equity conscience will do is no secret and the equity hand being the strong hand stops the other of course a mighty pretty case this of yours but begging your pardon where was the use of putting it for where is the man that will realize it will any counsel be weak or dishonest enough to advise a client to be at the expense of claiming a penalty under a law that may be stopped at any time english lawyer—dishonesty indeed—the thing nor punishable you a lawyer and talk about dishonesty as to weakness there is none in the case nonlawyer—it is all matter of calculation you see there are two prices the price of law is so much—the price of equity is so much more the first thing for vinctor to consider is the state of ligatuss finances what cares vinctor for the equity hand if ligatus cannot pay the price for raising it  0  suppose ligatuss finances not altogether insufficient then along with his temper it will be advisable to think of the magnitude of the penalty due or not due in point of honesty ligatus—if so it happens that being well advised he loves himself better than he hates his adversary—ligatus will pay the twenty pounds besides the chances of not obtaining the relief after all he will find himself not a little out of pocket when he has obtained it if to obtain it be his fate by addressing himself to the equity side of the learned and double conscience french lawyer—so then you have in england if i understand you right two opposite sorts of law the one or the other of which prevails according to the form in which the plaintiff addresses himself to the judge we had once a double diplomacy you according to your burke a double cabinet but now it seems you have constantly a double bench and one should think a double parliament and this is the equity you are so proud of nonlawyer—true except as to parliament the eye of parliament is single would it but awake but whenever equity has been on the carpet parliament as if blindness were a duty has always been fast asleep french lawyer—and so then the effect of this duplicity is to have one sort of justice to sell to the poor and another to the rich and the rich mans justice so much the stronger of the two as to turn the poor mans into waste paper nonlawyer—not exactly so unless a particular explanation be given to the words poor and rich and for this particular purpose as for the poor—if by the poor you mean the great majority of the people there is no regular justice for them at all unless it be for hanging them or something in that style the only classes concerned here are two higher and much less numerous classes the middling and the class above the middling it is between these two classes alone that the distinction lies or if you must say poor and rich say the relatively poor and the relatively rich it is as between them to the extent of the debateable ground that lies between common law and equity that the two sorts of justice are distinguished and the two prices put upon them to the relatively poor a dear sort of justice which is not the strongest—to the relatively rich a sort of justice which is still dearer but is the strongest chapter xx fifteenth device—means of securing forthcomingness uselessly divfrsified for various purposes on various occasions the ends of justice require sometimes that things—sometimes that persons be forthcoming at the disposal of the judge sometimes in the character of sources of evidence sometimes in the character of portions of the matter of punishment sometimes in the character of portions of the matter of satisfaction or else as securities or instruments for the obtaining it it is in these characters that they find a place under such titles as mesne process and execution in the books of technical jurisprudence on or by the same object—on or by the same thing or even the same person—different operations require to be performed according to the purpose or end to which justice requires that it or he be made subservient where the purpose is the same different operations may again be requisite according to the nature of the thing according to the condition of the person of all these operations be they what they may not one of which vexation expense and delay in quantities variable ad infinitum are not inseparable concomitants in each instance is the quantity or value of this mass of collateral inconvenience greater or less than that of the direct mischief consisting of such chance of misdecision or failure of justice as for want of the operation might be the result on the answer given to this question of fact the propriety or impropriety of the operation will depend in each individual instance here then are so many demands for diversification so many circumstances calling fo diversity of arrangement at the hands of the the legislator and the judge  0  if to the demand thus presented by diversity of exigence little attention has been paid—attention has not been wanting to that which is presented by diversity of courts four courts in the one great hall at westminister four courts each with a mode of its own for compassing the same point each mode of course abundantly well adapted to the ends of judicature each mode as abundantly defective with respect to the ends of justice thank heaven that of these courts there are no more than four each of them presenting a compound of impotence and violence feeble where good is to be done—powerful to do evil

found for enabling the judge to give judgment for plaintiff or defendant at pleasure the pinnacle of perfection would be mounted at one spring to a first glance the idea presents itself as no better than the lovesick vision of some fond amateur of chicane in practice it has not yet stretched it must be confessed nor seems likely to stretch to so allembracing an extent in the regions of jurisprudence as to cover the whole field but though quiet and silent in its motions the more accurately it is measured the more prodigious the progress of it will be perceived to be sought or unsought the effect flows naturally and as it were of itself from the anarchy that results from whatever degree of influence may have been preserved to the dictates of justice and common sense in conjunction with the suggestions of this or that one among the sources of iniquity and absurdity that have already passed in review exquisite invention or at any rate felicitous result reason herself pressed into the service of absurdity injustice could not have thus enlarged her empire without leaving a corner of her throne to justice the doublefountain device derives its name from the contrivance of those jugglers who by an ingenious application of the laws of hydrostatics and pneumatics serve to the customer out of the same vessel wine of either of two colours white or red at pleasure this device is grafted on any one of the three former devices—the principle of nullification the principle of fiction and the principle of jargonization it consists in the putting an occasional stop to the current of decision drawn from these several corrupted fountains drawing the decision from the right fountain pro hâc vice instead of any of those wrong ones far from being diminished by this apparent departure from the ends of judicature the advantage obtainable from these several devices receives considerable increase no danger in any shape can ever attach—neither punishment nor so much as disrepute can ever attach upon any judge who in spite of any number of previous decisions given against the merits on the ground of this or that quirk or fiction or jargon takes upon him to decide in favour of the merits thus it is that to the extent of the ground occupied by quirk fiction and jargon you possess in virtue of those principles alternating at pleasure with the principles of reason and justice the faculty of giving the case in favour of plaintiff or defendant as you incline praise you are sure of all that you need consider is which of two sorts of praise is most to your taste decide against the merits on the ground of the quirk the fiction the jargon you receive the joint praise of profound science and inflexible steadiness—the praise of adhering to the rule stare decisis decide in favour of the merits disallowing the quirk discarding the fiction the jargon you receive the praise of liberality—of attachment to the laws of substantial justice bribes you cannot receive if neither side is prepared to offer any friendship or enmity you cannot gratify if both parties are equally unknown to you or indifferent but whether you do or do not turn it to account in any way the power you possess to the extent of the ground occupied by these commodious principles is not the less arbitrary the fault is all your own if as often as you have occasion in any of these shapes you fail of administering to your prejudice or your humour the gratification put into your hands—of profiting by the opportunity of crushing your enemy of serving your party or your friend a flaw is alleged in an indictment are the pursuers partyattachments supposed to be on the wrong side precedents are chains of adamant to you fiat justitia ruat cœlum is the word are the mans attachments where they should be you burst by inspiration from the trammels of chicane and you quote the quirkabjuring ejaculation which a moment of contrition wrung from the conscience of lord hale is interest objected as a ground of exclusion to a material witness here you are most completely at your ease there stand the cases in two rows on one hand those in which the objection has been

laws of evidence to be the perfection of wisdom receive the witness  0  your bow points to lord hardwicke and with him you confess your disposition to admit lights the advantage gained by the principle of nullification would be imperfect but for the occasional dash of illapplied reason by which it is made up into the doublefountain principle by the doublefountain principle more business is made than could possibly be made by the fountains of corruption if set running by themselves suppose a flaw started—exactly the same flaw that had already been made fatal here if thhe practice of drawing decisions occasionally from reason were unknown certainty would thus far take place the merits would in that instance have and be seen to have no chance the benefit of the argument would be lost to the profession as well as the sweets of arbitrary power to the judge chapter xxiv nineteenth device—laudation of jurisprudential law wherever jurisprudential law reigns certainty is impossible it has no ground to stand upon jurisprudential law is sham law to ascribe stability to this creature of the imagination is to ascribe stability to a shadow statute law has everywhere a tenor—a determinate collection of words there is the will and there is the expression of it—we know whose will it is where signified by what signs expressed what parts are to be found in it jurisprudential law is law made by nobody at no time and in no words in statute law words may here and there be ill chosen and from the infelicity of the choice uncertainty as well as misconstruction may arise but no sooner is the flaw perceived than it may be remedied jurisprudential law is perpetual disease perpetually unsusceptible of all cure from statute law yes but so far as statute law extends jurisprudential law is or at least ought to be extirpated if it be not the disease so far from being cured is aggravated there is the statute law to give certainty there is the jurisprudential law to take it away in jurisprudential law may be seen not the parent only but the protecting guardian of all these other abuses in it the founders of the feecollecting system have ever beheld the offspring of their own brain the work of their own hands the fruit and pledge of their own power statute law is the work of whom of the legislator—the lawful the real legislator jurisprudential of whom of the judge—of the underhand workman always making work always disavowing it when made—of the birmingham come making his own trash and passing it off for the kings—of the dishonest valet stealing out in the dark going about in his masters name and receiving homage in his clothes by what legislator by what genuine legislator recognised as such and in pursuit of public ends could any devices such as those over which we have been glancing have been set up by what legislator unless perchance under the guidance of some achitophel member and instrument of the feecollecting partnership serving the ends of judicature while talking of the ends of justice that which exists not cannot be known so far as the dominion of jurisprudence spreads ignorance is universal misconception endless an article of statute law is a drop of water in the state of water or in that of ice an article of jurisprudential law is the same drop in the state of vapour in the solid or liquid state you know where the drop is you see it you may weigh it you may measure it you see the bounds of it those bounds are narrow and determinate in the state of gas or vapour unless you have it in a bottle you know not where it is you do not see it you cannot weigh it you cannot measure it assignable bounds it has none unless it be the limits of the atmosphere such is an article of jurisprudential law in the form of statute law a single line might perhaps contain the substance of it and that perfectly in the form of jurisprudential the same article shall fill a folio volume and the larger the folio the more indeterminate the import of the article to a command there is an end to a dissertation there need be none in statute law nonnotoriety is an accidental disease of common law it is the inseparable essence in statute law the disease may be cured as soon as discovered in common law every remedy is so much added to the disease nonnotoriety is sometimes an inbred but always curable disease sometimes an extraneous defect in statute law not nonnotoriety merely but uncognoscibility an aggravated and incurable exacerbation of the same disease cleaves to the essence of jurisprudential law introduced by jurisprudential law every pretended improvement every improvement that if introduced by statute law would be a real one—every slip of common sense and common honesty forced into a soil so repugnant to both brings into action the doublefountain principle fear not on this ground to earn the praise of liberality plant your improvements round your periods proclaim the ardour of your zeal for justice all this you may do and earn the praise of justice without prejudice to the ends of judicature   0 while under the genial influence of the doublefountain principle the old rank weeds are numerous and strong enough to spring up and choke the new plants all this liberality is but a more refined way of carrying on the manufactory of made business by the uncertainty of the law the partnership interest is served in three distinguishable ways—  the number of suits is increased   the quantity of business receives a further increase from the quantity of advice which men are necessitated to purchase—advice before a suit during a suit and for fear of a suit   in proportion to the degree of uncertainty the judicial members are invested with a degree of power proportionably arbitrary and thence applicable to the purposes of the partnership in all imaginable ways going to law i have a chance—not going to law i have none such is the encouraging speech which the interest of the partnership requires should as often as possible be made by the parties each to himself on both sides the oftener a speech to this effect is made and acted upon provided always it be on both sides the greater and more glorious and thence the richer in profit the uncertainty out of the manufactured necessity of advice—advice which by the operation of the same cause that gives birth to the necessity is so often rendered fallacious—arises that branch of the partnership concern which may be called the opinion trade of this a few words under a separate head† jurisprudential law—the imaginary law extracted by each man for himself out of a mass of jurisprudence—is a vast hotbed of uncertainty by statute law in proportion as it extends keeping clear of entanglement with jurisprudential law that most poisonous of all weeds is extirpated hence we have two distinguishable devices hatched by the technical system more especially the english branch of it laudation of jurisprudential law—contempt of statutory law in two instances that i have chanced to meet with there may be twenty for aught i know the single word policy‡ has served a chief justice or puisne judge of the kings bench for superseding the use as they have on so many occasions set at nought the declared will of king lords and commons transplanted from parliament its only proper soil to the kings bench this word coupled with the unlimited faculty of applying it and what limits are ever set to the faculty of applying it was of itself sufficient to erect judicature into a despotism omnipotence required but a word to create light jurisprudence required but a word to create darkness not but others each of them capable of supplying its place might be found in superfluous abundance to the right and left by any one that had taste and courage for the task in christianity is the law of the land∥ there are seven words but in those seven words coupled with the application made of them there is matter sufficient to supply the place of an inqusition and to afford to orthodoxy under each successive change a perpetual security against disturbance by barring out all argument on either of two sides at pleasure and supplying the place of it on the other side     temporal tyranny established by a single word and spiritual added to it by seven more what security does any such word as policy afford against the sinister interests and inclinations of the judge—what security has it ever afforded in taking into his own hands offices on the abuse of which his power is supposed to afford a check will you believe lord mansfield judges are higher better fitter legislators than king lords and commons common law says he in so many words is superior to an act of parliament superior how so the reason is not the less brilliant for being unintelligible it works itself pure from the fountains of justice fountains abundant on the groundfloor of the great hall unknown it seems above stairs send a man to common law for purity send him to the common sewer to cleanse himself as he taught he practised mansfield superior in his own theory to king lords and commons mansfield when a reforming fit came on him chose to do everything by himself with io mio and arrio in the character of mutes and trainbearers another sort of thing whose reputation for working itself pure is rather better established is thames water working itself pure on shipboard it has nothing to do with fountains chapter xxv habitual contempt shown by judges to the authority of the legislature a statement of the instances in which the authority of parliament has been and continues to be trampled upon by its sworn servants might fill volumes upon volumes when misinterpretation is the instrument—scientific misinterpretation—how plainly soever wilful the contempt may in general be covered by effrontery the sense we put upon the law is the sense which it is the intention of the author should be put upon it so we say to whom it belongs to say so and who are you that take upon you to say otherwise cases however are not altogether wanting in which such insincerity cannot be altogether put out of sight not by any degree of effrontery on one part nor by any degree of carelessness and obsequiousness on all others of this number are cases of arithmetical contradiction as if a man were to say is it credible that a man should have said this guinea and this guinea added together do not make two guineas or this first guinea and this second guinea and this third guinea added together do not make three guineas by a contradiction of this kind if a book of practice now before me is to be believed the judges of three of the four great courts for there is no exception did manifest in the year      and for anything that appears do continue to manifest an open declared contempt for the authority of parliament where a statute gives double costs says mr palmer† they are calculated thus—the common costs and then half the common costs if treble costs—  the common costs   half of these   and then half of the latter if this be so then as often as parliament has ordered the judges to give treble costs so often do these sworn executors of the will of parliament refuse to give so much as double costs the grand mischief attendant on such practices is that in proportion as they come to light they weaken not to say root out of the bosom of the people all confidence in the engagements taken by the law they destroy the credit not only of those who deserve so little but of the legislator himself who howsoever himself deceived and imposed upon never certainly wishes to deceive for in a case like this except through the means of these his servants it is impossible for the legislator ever to keep his word but by a determination taken by them and regularly pursued to the extent of this wideextending case so have they ordered matters that he never shall keep it in any one single instance but the greater the mischief resulting to the public from this treachery the greater the advantage accruing from it to the contrivers let the legislator say or do what he will the authority upon which the fate of the subject has its immediate dependence must in every case be the will of the judge upon the will of the legislator it does not depend upon any other supposition than this viz that the will of the legislator will of course find the will of the judge conformable to it suppose this conformity constant the subject is comparatively speaking independent of the will of the judge to know what the will of the judge will be no more is necessary to him than to read the will of the legislator in the letter of the law on the other hand suppose this conformity altogether out of the question the dependence of the subject upon the will of the judge is absolute in other words the power of the judge over the subject is completely arbitrary but the more arbitrary the judicial authority can succeed in rendering itself the greater the degree of perfection in which the purposes of the partnership may be carried into effect absolute     perfection in this line would be attained if in no case the subject could find or suppose himself safe in regarding the tenor of the law the words of the legislator as sufficient evidence of the eventual will of the judge in this state of things regarding the words of the legislator as no better than a snare the subject would view in them on each occusion neither more nor less than the necessity of repairing fee in hand to some professional member of the partnership in whose opinion might be read the most probable conjecture that the nature of the case admitted of the eventual will of the official and governing members to this pitch of perfection the plans of the partnership have never yet been brought but a more effectual step towards it than that which has been made by the course of mock interpretation here exemplified cannot be imagined if a premium were held out for the highest insult that could be offered to the authority of the legislator by the power of the judge viz by wilful misinterpretation simply unaccompanied by a direct disclaimer no higher than this could by the utmost effort of ingenuity be devised instances of this sinister policy may be found in most unhappy abundance and by every insult thus offered to the legislator an additional nerve is given to the arbitrary power of the judge but a single instance such as the one here in question is sufficient to do prodigious service if where the legislator says give three shillings the judge will not give so much as two—if the authority of the law is in this case openly set at nought—in what other instance can there be any sufficient assurance of its not being dealt with in the same manner if to such contempts and for such a length of time repeated the legislator has been insensible—to what others can any sufficient assurance be had of his being less so that the interest of the partnership requires that the uncertainty of the law should for ever be at its maximum is evident enough that their endeavours must have been constantly directed towards that object follows of course that the establishment of a precedent of the above description viz a misinterpretation which cannot possibly have been other than wilful goes further towards the effectuation of that object than a hundred or a thousand that might by possibility have been undesigned is another proposition that seems scarcely open to dispute observe the extent of the effect produced by this manifestation of anticonstitutional disobedience to banish out of the breast of the subject all confidence in the declared will of the legislator—in a word to produce the requisite degree of uncertainty—it is not necessary that it should be understood that it is a rule with the judge always to run counter to it were that the case no uncertainty no such degree of uncertainty of which every man must be more or less sensible could ever take place what is sufficient is that in no particular instance the subject without consulting a man of law can be sufficiently assured whether any regard will be paid to the will of the legislator or no and to produce this degree of uncertainty a single course of precedents such as the above even without the help of so many others as might be added to them—enough to fill volumes upon volumes—is quite sufficient lawyer—a pleasant conceit indeed and so then sir according to this vision of yours lawyers of all classes—advocates judicial officers judges themselves—are all in a partnership all traders—and a capital object with these traders is to destroy all confidence in the breast of their customers—is so to order matters that their customers or say rather those whom they would be glad to have for customers may never believe a word of anything they say to them surely this is the first time that a general destruction of confidence was supposed to be a benefit to trade nonlawyer—visionary enough the notion as thus stated certainly but a little circumstance sir has escaped your notice where trade is open to destroy confidence may indeed be to destroy trade suppose two rival shopkeepers a and b a loses the confidence of his customers b preserves it what follows bs trade of course flourishes—as is destroyed but of these traders the avowed traders we are supposing neither possesses any monoply whereas in the station occupied by the real though unavowed traders we have been speaking of the business not only is an object of monopoly but of necessity ever must be to the purposes of the partnership i have shown you how essential it is that the judge should have destroyed as far as possible the confidence on the part of the people in the engagements taken by the legislator by the course taken for this purpose the reverend functionary has destroyed it is true in a great degree not only the confidence that the people would otherwise have reposed in the words of the legislator but also the confidence which they would otherwise have reposed in himself and his own proceedings but by this double destruction what does he lose just nothing for they are not the less under the obligation of going to his shop on the contrary his profit is promoted by it since the uncertainty of the law increases with it and his profit increases with the uncertainty of the law accordingly as i have already sir had the honour of bringing to your recollection—be it with personal character as it may there     exists not under the sun any sort of person whose public character and in so essential a point as that of veracity is so completely blasted as that of an english judge so successful because so welldirected have been their learned labours in that line and this not in carelessness and wantonness but in all sobriety and sadness inasmuch as the uncertainty of the law and thence the magnitude and certainty of the partnership profit were so evidently dependent on it not only by every such open contempt manifested towards the will of the legislator has the uncertainty of the law been increased and the certainty of lawyers profit and in particular of the profit artached to the opinion branch of the trade been increased along with it but so has it by every condition annexed to a legislative command to which the legislator himself had annexed none and thence it is that the exclusionary system which forms the main subject of these pages is as well as so many other systems of astute defeasances so much added and meant to be added to the uncertainty of the law that glorious system of uncertainty which is the real as well as so generally acknowledged source sir of all your glories in the present instance a special sinister interest added its force to that general interest whereby as above they are continually urged to do as much as they dare towards destroying on the part of the people all confidence in the legislature to prevent vexatious suits was the professed as well as real object of these restrictive and remedial clauses but every vexatious suit prevented is a bird or rather a covey of birds snatched from the snare of the fowler—from the fangs of lawyers while a regular and deliberate system of insult has thus been opposed to the united authority of king lords and commons where has been the house of lords where has been the house of commons in the house of commons is there not a committee appointed or supposed to be appointed at the commencement of every parliament or of every session called the committee of justice or the committee of courts of justice an equal degree of contempt for the authority of the legislator is manifested by every application of the principle of nullification on a former occasion the principle of nullification was considered in its character of an engine of fraud in respect of its particular and more immediate effects on each particular occasion to the prejudice of the party having right on his side on the present occasion the character in which it presents itself to view is that of an engine of usurpation the principle of nullification has been employed the application of it warranted and ordained by the legislator himself an offence having been created and punishment appointed—the judge doing so and so the proceedings against the defendant it has been declared declared by the legislator himself shall be null and void i e the defendant though guilty shall go free in this case the application thus made of the principle has been on the part of the legislator an act of inconsistency and imprudence on the part of the lawyer his scribe to whose unfaithful hands he has committed the task of giving expression and effect to his will an act of imbecility or treachery on the part of the judge the mass of substantive law in question being the work of the legislator every application made of the principle of nullification is a contempt—an act of insurrection against the authority of his constitutional superior condition extension limitation modification exception expressions interconvertible expressions in effect the same by the legislator none at all annexed none at any rate to the effect in question to this declaration of the will of the legislator the genuine and lawful legislator—the judge by help of the principle of nullification attaches exceptions of his own at pleasure to the extent of these exceptions the will of the legislator is in effect trustrated the law repealed lawyer—contempt what contempt do you consider who it is you are speaking of why use such harsh words in the character of legislator any more than in any other is man infallible is it not a case continually occurring the case of an exigence unforeseen by the legislator brought by particular occurrences under the eyes of the judge in the interpretation of laws in the application of them to particular occurrences exists there anywhere that system in which some latitude of discretion has not been considered as virtually reposed reposed of necessity in the hands of the judge but as often as any such discretion is employed is there not according to your own account of the matter some act of virtual repeal or enactment performed nonlawyer—as to the power of interpretation and the latitude proper to be assumed in the exercise of it it is on this occasion nothing to the purpose any such exception as in the honest opinion of the judge the legislator had the particular occurrence or state of things been present to his view would himself have made—an exception of this description yes provided always that the liberty thus taken with the actually declared will of the legislator be confessed and notified to the legislator with opportunity given to him in case of disapprobation to annul and stop it by an arrangement such as this every     unforeseen inconvenience would receive its remedy and constitutional allegiance remain inviolate on these terms but on these only contravention momentary and provisional contravention to the actually declared will of the legislator might be and ought to be not only a power but a duty option between the letter and the spirit of the law would not be as now an organ of arbitrary power operating upon the doublefountain principle but nullification your principle of nullification it is no less repugnant to everything that could in any case be or have been the will of the legislator than to his will on whatsoever subject as actually expressed and declared name for example that crime if you can of which it would have been in any case the wish of the legislator that it should be practised with impunity as often as the malefactor could find means to bribe the clerk or whosoever it be on whom it depends to make the flaw or supposed flaw of which your judges in their wisdom and their honesty are pleased as often as they are pleased to make that use to make one instance serve as a sample for others by hundreds and by thousands let us turn to the practice in regard to convictions by which word are presented to the eye of a lawyer convictions pronounced by justices of the peace acting out of sessions for delinquencies referred to their cognizance by particular acts of parliament trying the cause under the forms or noforms of natural procedure of pure and universal justice the magistrate pronounces the defendant guilty and to ground the further proceedings signs a record or memorandum certifying the existence of the decision so pronounced at the instance of the convict the court of kings bench without so much as pretending to know anything about the facts quash the conviction liberate the defendant set at nought the statute nonlawyer—liberate the delinquent and without evidence after he has been convicted and by lawful authority upon evidence pray on what ground is this done lawyer—on what ground because the magistrate had not set forth the evidence nonlawyer—why should he have set forth the evidence had the legislature ordered him to set forth the evidence lawyer—no it was not necessary nonlawyer—what then had anybody else ordered him lawyer—no it was not necessary nonlawyer—what not even you you who quash his decision for not having set forth the evidence by what ingenuity was he to have discovered this to be your will and pleasure lawyer—we never meant that he should discover any such thing can you be so weak as to suppose we did are we such simpletons do you suppose that when it is really our wish a man should do a thing which he would have no motive to do unless he knew it to be our pleasure—that in such a case we should really omit to make him know that it was our pleasure did you ever know an old woman silly to such a degree of silliness no sir our wish and our determination was to quash the decision at any rate to quash a just decision or to do anything else that ought not to be done a pretence you know or you ought to know we must always have as to what the pretence is it matters very little if the evidence had been set forth we should have found another when we have a mind to get rid of a decision do you think we are ever at a loss nonlawyer—i must confess i do not very well see how that misfortune should ever happen to you but as to the quashing of the conviction pray what may have been the use of it lawyer—use of it abundance of uses   in the first place this was making so much business down comes the money—quash goes the conviction like a snail under our feet   in the next place we throw cold water on a bad precedent the natural system is the rival and mortal enemy of our system we abhor it we do what we can to crush it by its encroachments it robs us by its justice it puts us to shame the turks have a prophecy that some day or other the christians will drive them out of europe we have something between a hobgoblin dream and a prophecy that one of these days the natural system will drive ours out of westminister hall our wish is to stave off the fatal day as long as possible by thus quashing we turn the arts of the enemy against himself he lets off a clause to rob us of our business and out of that very clause we make more business   in the third place     nonlawyer—oh a truce a truce i see very well—any man who will not shut his eyes may see with half an eye—how well you understand your business only one question more—is it a rule with you pray to quash every conviction that is brought to you to quash     lawyer—no that would not be good policy   in the first place if this were the case sooner or later the legislator might find us out and grow angry   in the next place it is not at all necessary every alternate one does just as well we do not stand counting there would be no use in it but that proportion or thereabouts the nearer to it the better if there be any difference nonlawyer—but if every conviction were to be quashed without exception would not this crush the designs of the enemy more effectually would it not humble him still more display the weakness of the natural system and cure the people of having recourse to it lawyer—possibly in some degree but that is not worth thinking about not to insist on the danger of which you have a glimpse already—if in this way we served a distant end we should disserve the immediate one if men did not see somewhat of a chance of having their convictions held good there would be none defended all that business would be lost nonlawyer—oh yes i see i see your world is like the philosophers nothing without its sufficient reason but the legislature all this while what have they said to all this lawyer—said nothing at all do what we will to them they never say anything to us they never have been used to it nonlawyer—so then you have plenty of business in this line a rare trade this quashing trade lawyer—no no great things after all the rogues have almost grown too cunning for us rob us of it to be sure they durst not but little by little they have found out a way of stealing it from us nonlawyer—steal business from the law parliament strip lawyers of their business oh terrible this is the very worst of larceny this is contra pacem with a vengeance sad usage indeed but pray how do they manage it lawyer—they provide a form a skeleton form and then say they every conviction that is according to that form is good the form is a skeleton form with blanks in it such as are in burns justice the justice has nothing to do but to fill up the blanks the business is so easy a viper might as soon bite a hole in a file as any of us find a flaw in it now what do you say to this nonlawyer—say why that you are insidiously and barbarously dealt with but you have one thing for your comfort lawyer—comfort indeed what comfort where is it nonlawyer—nay you have two comforts one is that of seeing how much they are afraid of you that if they do take business from you they take it not as robbers but as thieves why think of the molehill they have filched from you think rather of the mountains they have left and dare not meddle with another is for it shows itself through your lamentations that the old business is still left to you so that the damage after all is rather lucrum cessans than damnum emergens the business does not increase so fast as it might that is all lawyer—alas you are very much mistaken from the old statutes there may be a remnant of business left it is true but it grows less and less every day every day brings new statutes spreading over the old ground and covering it with these cursed forms by and bye there wont be a spot left in which a flaw will be to be found besides that the stock of flaws and quibbles is almost exhausted and to let you into a secret the people begin to find us out we cannot go on quashing through thick and thin as we used to do we are forced to draw up we are forced little by little to turn liberalists there is that passage in hale against quibbles it haunts us it follows us like our shadow it will blow us all up one of these days chapter xxvi opiniontrade the opiniontrade is not properly speaking itself a device it is a natural result and a distinct branch of the aggregate mass of profit reaped from the contrivances already brought into view under that name but on this occasion the fruit cannot pass altogether unheeded any more than the tree that bears it this branch of the partnership trade has for its sole foundation the uncertainty and uncognoscibility of the law properties essentially attached to its existence in the shape of jurisprudential law howsoever chequered with patches here and there of statutory should the legislator ever have the force to know his own will and the grace to grant to his submissive subjects the possibility of knowing it and conforming to it instead of being punished or plagued for not having conformed to it there ends the opiniontrade there vanish the opinionists like animalcules upon the drying up of the puddle in which they feed and float the publication of reports histories of adjudged cases is another arrangement unfavourable to the opiniontrade here we see an interest within an interest mammon divided against itself     when an opinion is taken before and in contemplation of a suit the service sold by the opinionist consists in a conjecture concerning the part which in the case as stated the judge is likely to take if instead of the interests of the law partnership the interests of the community were the objects regarded means would be afforded to the subject for obtaining beforehand at the hands of the legislator or the judge that information of which at the hands of the opinionist he purchases at present a precarious and often fallacious conjecture a provision for this purpose would constitute a natural appurtenance to the body of the laws the opinionist entertains a natural antipathy towards the reporting lawyers so far as the information they furnish extends so far it goes towards narrowing and starving his trade he knows not what to say against them and yet something must be said they publish too much—more than used to be published the science is overloaded by the quisquilious matter they rake together and preserve they publish too soon before they have taken the requisite time for digestion the science is clogged by crudities but to do quite right in the sight of the opinionist there is but one course they can take and that is to have done publishing to give up their branch of the trade to his when the reporters have done their worst there remain the old cases over which they have no power the cases themselves the old cases are reported it is true but what perhaps may here and there not have been reported are certain opinions of the reigning judges the potentates of the day respecting the matter of these cases sects form themselves about this and that quirk or quibble as formerly among the romanists the technical system wherever it sets foot can never be without its proculeians and its sabinians where the treasure is there will the heart be also a plenum of technical ideas is a vacuum of rational ones the head that has fitted itself up for jurisprudence has unfitted itself for everything else the jargon which has been giving occupation to the official hour gives relaxation to the social the lawyer fights over again his arguments as the conqueror his battles the learned lord finds that entertainment in quibbles which the learned king used to find in puns twelve dii majorum gentium find an olympus in serjeants inn the opinionist lawyers are their priests the will or in learned language the opinion of the god is to be learned through no other channel than the will of the priest the gods of the pagan hierarchy had each his priest the jurisprudential have theirs in common advice to parties and attorneys—if it be a knotty point particularly open to controversy—a point in conveyancing for example or any other that seems to lie deep—seek not for that soundness of understanding which would be but an ignis fatuus betake yourselves in preference to some grave person in a silk gown a coætaneus and contubernalis of the reverend band the tabletalk of the ermine forms the privileged science of the silk gown at first hand the opinion of the ermine is not to be bought at any price but whether at firsthand or second hand what matter so long as it is obtained from no one guinea given to an opinionist lawyer does any judge ever receive the smallest share for that would be a bribe a sort of profit as unknown as it is unnecessary to any english judge but the source of legal profit is in the abyss of legal uncertainty and the benefit of the uncertainty is the patrimony of the firm in the profits of which no member is without his share one abuse grows out of another abuse it is because in the field of litigation the pursuit or defence of a mans due is so expensive that he applies to the opinionist to learn whether it be worth his while to hazard the expense and thus the expense receives an addition and that a certain one in the first instance and this additional burthen rests without alleviation on the shoulders of the party injured for it is not allowed in costs if the cause of action lies but a hairs breadth out of the most beaten track your attorney will not proceed without an opinion profit is no object to him to the reputation of virtue he is not alike insensible his fidelity and zeal are proved by his anxiety not to plunge his client into an unprofitable expense his modesty by his unwillingness to rely on his own judgment nor yet in so far as reputation is concerned is he altogether insensible to his own just claims for his defence against the imputation of ignorance rashness or rapacity he has a right to that sanction which the usage of the profession affords to that branch of it in which he serves prudence thus comes in to make up the group of virtues whether in his opinion the cause be good or bad the attorney finds his advantage in this practice if good profit is always increased and not the slightest loss of reputation hazarded if bad he thus exonerates himself of all responsibility his reputation is put under cover and if the profit of the suit is lost the profit of taking the opinion is at any rate so much saved out of the fire but of the ceremony of consulting the oracle the loss of the suit with its profit is by no means a certain consequence so far as     the question of law is concerned the opinionist may indeed be depended upon for not giving as law what he really does not look upon as law so much reputation would be lost to him and nothing gained in lieu of it but the law depends on the facts on the state of the evidence as laid before the opinionist in the instrument called the case by a very slight deficiency either in point of correctness or in point of completeness on the part of that mass of supposed facts such an opinion may be produced as while it engages the client in a suit predestined to be unsuccessful shall secure both members of the partnership from all danger of reproach it is the interest of the attorney not to extract from his client if he can avoid it any fact which if brought to view would betray the badness of his cause on the part of the client this sort of suppression finds itself continually favoured partly by passion partly by ignorance either he is not aware of the influence which the fact would have on the cause—or if he is the pain attached to the idea of it deprives him of the resolution to bring it out the propensity of the bulk of clients thus to deceive themselves while deceiving their lawadvisers is no secret to either the honest or dishonest among attorneys the honest have to fight against it the dishonest keep the discovery to themselves and avail themselves of it turning to their own account the proficiency thus made by experience in the science of human nature to the opinionist whether the mass of supposed facts be correct or incorrect complete or incomplete is matter of the most complete indifference or rather if incorrect or incomplete to the effect of representing the client in the right where he is in the wrong so much the better since in that case a suit which ought not to be brought may come to be brought and the opinionist to be employed in it should the incorrectness or incompleteness be upon the face of the statement so glaring as to force itself upon the notice of the learned sage will he take the trouble to give intimation of it not if he be wise in the way of worldly wisdom labour it will cost him advantage he will not gain in any shape the lips of the attorney may thank him the heart of the attorney will not thank him for an article of information by which on one hand the deficiency of the attorney is held up to view while on the other hand the suit with its profit is nipped in the bud numberless are the ways in which with or without consciousness of wrong the attorney may without any risk of reputation to himself engage the client in a groundless suit whatever the client states as fact the attorney assumes as fact by this demonstration of respect and confidence he does not lose by the opposite demonstration he might incur the displeasure of the client as well as lose the benefit of the suit but though the fact should be exactly as the client states it the advantage which on the occasion of the suit the client will be able to reap from it depends altogether upon the evidence upon the faculty of adducing such evidence as shall obtain admission and be found persuasive by the attorney it is either known or suspected that whether through inadmissibility or through insufficiency the evidence will not serve but if be be ordinarily wise—especially if in the person of the client he has the advantage of dealing with an uninformed mind such as are those of the bulk of clients—he will not be so unpolite or so imprudent as to suffer this knowledge or suspicion to pass the bounds of his own lips what then after all is the sort of intercourse thus described it is a sort of previous inquiry or trial of the cause performed upon bad evidence—upon evidence commonly incomplete and incorrect for the purpose of determining whether it shall be put into a course of being tried upon correct and complete evidence to the account of the technical system of procedure may this fruit of it be set down since under the natural it has no place why because under the natural the facts are brought to light with the utmost degree of correctness and completeness which the faculties intellectual and moral of the witnesses admit of brought to light with less delay vexation and expense than what attends the production of that partial and naturally unfaithful picture which through so treacherous a medium as that of the pen of the attorney is in the course of the opinion trade placed under the eye of the venal and uncommissioned judge by whose decision nothing is decided is it a case in which both parties are heard together selfpartiality draws from each of them such of the facts as promise to operate in favour of his claim the same force extracts from the lips of his adversary information of a contrary tendency and in both instances with as much promptitude as well as correctness and completeness as the collision of interests can command titius cannot have an interest in getting evidence for a false fact but sempronius has an equal interest in bringing down detection upon the falsity titius cannot have an interest in the suppression of a fact but sempronius has an equal interest in dragging it forth into light is it of the number of those cases in which one of the parties at the commencement of the cause the plaintiff comes into court without the other to demand the service     which in that stage of the cause he stands in need of at the hands of the judge adverse party with his adverse interest by the supposition there is none but it is the interest of the judge the honest interest of the unfeed judge that in this stage of the cause the truth shall come to light in a state as correct and as complete as may be why because over and above all reputation and the sacred regard for the ends of justice by extracting from the applicant those truths which his inclination might have led him to suppress or driving him out of those misrepresentations for which his inclination might have led him to obtain credence the object of his application unjust as by the supposition it is in this case may be defeated at the time and the labour of giving a joint audience to both parties or whatever other labour on the part of the judge the grant of the illfounded demand might have been productive of will be saved thus it is that in whatever point of view the field be contemplated technical procedure with its endless train of afflicting consequences presents itself as the disease the foul disease natural procedure as the simple the pure the efficacious remedy chapter xxvii extension of the above devices to substantive law as far as applicable of the two main branches of the body of the law the substantive and the adjective it is to the adjective alone that the subject of evidence belongs the application of the above or any other devices to substantive law falls not therefore within the compass of the present work it is for this reason and for this reason alone that the few exemplifications which have been given of the application of these devices have been confined within the compass of the law of procedure the error however would be great if it were supposed that it is to this comparatively narrow part of the field of judicature that the application of these contrivances for the pursuit of the ends of judicature is confined true it is that of these two great branches the adjective is that in the arrangement of which the judicial authority has had the greatest share but in every country more or less and in england in particular the share which that same authority has had in the arrangement of the main branch the substantive has been very considerable even in this branch the part taken by the judicial authority may in comparison with the part borne by the only competent and legitimate legislator be styled the principal part jurisprudential law forming the ground statute law sticking on here and there a few patches upon that ground in both parts of the work the action of the same sinister interest being favoured with the same opportunities the same character and complexion would naturally be exhibited by the work in both instances as far as power extended and occasion favoured the system of procedure would be adapted to the ends of judicature the system of substantive law would be adapted to the system of procedure the object in respect of the adjective branch besides the multiplication of suits understand always profityielding suits was to adapt the course of procedure to the purpose of extracting from each suit its maximum of profit what it was in mens power to do in working upon the substantive branch towards the common end of both branches confined itself to the purpose of giving birth to the greatest possible number of suits to extract from each the greatest quantity of profit that it could be made to yield lay exclusively within the province of the adjective branch flowers necessary for the crop might be furnished by both branches it was from the adjective alone that the fruit could be reaped intermediate ends common to each were the nursing in the mind of the individual in his character of suitor and client the qualities of ignorance and error on the part of the law itself uncertainty uncognoscibility obscurity ambiguity and voluminousness of the devices or contrivances directed to those ends five viz exclusion of the parties—tribunals rendered inaccessible by distance—days fixed with long intervals—mechanical judicature—and acceptance of allegations in writing at successive times and under a licence for mendacity—these five together with the officemultiplication principle were arrangements exclusively adapted to the nature and texture of adjective law the remaining ones viz the principle of nullification with its supports jargon and fiction and its compound with the principle of reason and utility the doublefountain principle and the habit of magnifying jurisprudential law at the expense of statutory of representing devices as more real than realities shadows more solid than their substances—these five share in the privilege of being applicable to both branches the substantive as well as adjective with equal advantage and is it then all delusion the chief pride and comfort of an englishman the matchless excellence of his laws by no means from all that has been said admitting it all to be just no such consequence follows   what there is good in the system will be found to exist in a much larger proportion in the form of statute law than in the form of jurisprudential law in other words to have been in a greater degree the work of king lords and commons the legitimate legislators     than of judges spurious usurping legislators making base law underground as their brother usurpers make base money and like them with one everlasting lie in their mouths disowning their work of what has been well done the far greater part therefore has been done not by lawyers but in spite of lawyers lawyers grumbling at it as much as they dare and doing what they can to spoil it the exertions of the brotherhood have been employed not so much in the support as in the destruction of society to be assured of this any eye that is strong and single enough to bear the sight need but read over the statutes containing the wretchedly scanty provision that has been made by fits and starts for the amendment of the law in that small but fertile department of parliamentary history may be read the wickedness of lawyers it is a history that may match with that of cartouche jonathan wild japhet crook and so forth except that it is without names   it is not in human nature that the character of the technical lawyer should have completely and in every instance swallowed up the character of the englishman or the man the private interest it has already been shown is not on every point nor on every occasion in opposition to public interest sprinkled here and there over the surface of the law some good much or little according to the object it is compared with might doubtless be to be found that drew its origin from a learned bosom but were the proportion much larger than it is it might not be the less ture that if an inventory could be taken of the number of propositions of which the mass of jurisprudential law is composed nine of them out of ten would be found absurd in themselves mischievous in their consequences take this or that reasonable and useful proposition you will find it swaddled up in a cluster of perhaps a dozen absurd and pernicious distinctions extensions conditions exceptions limitations but for judging of the aggregate goodness of a body of law no tolerably correct criterion can be deduced from the mere comparison of the number of rational and beneficial propositions contained in it on the one hand compared with the number of irrational and pernicious ones on the other no more than any estimate can be formed of the severity of a penal code from the multitude of the penal laws contained in it as in evidence weight so in provisions of law extent as well as number must be taken into account sometimes an arrangement of which the characteristic features may be composed in half a dozen words shall have so much good in it as to compensate for a mass of irrational and pernicious matter sufficient to fill a volume take for instance in judicature the principle of publicity were the most enthusiastic admirer of the english body of law as it stands to be called upon for a list of the provisions on which his admiration grounds itself he would find perhaps a score or two of pages not to say a dozen or two sufficient to contain it were he a nonlawyer there would not be contained in it perhaps one nor even if a lawyer many of the propositions above alluded to under the description of irrational and mischievous the dunghill were there enough of it to fill augeass stable would not destroy the value of whatever pearls might be to be found in it but the dung would not cease to be dung any more than the pearls would cease to be pearls   0 chapter xxviii remedies suggested for the above evils after so much as has been said of the disease the purpose of the discussion would be in danger of being misconceived discontent instead of reform might be taken for the ultimate object—misanthropy instead of philanthropy for the source if nothing were said of remedies but though the causes of the mischief appertain to the purpose of the present work because without them no completely satisfactory account could have been given of the origin and probable cause of the system of exclusionary rules—the remedies any further than as concerns the abolition of the coercive rules and the substitution of a body of simple instructions in their stead are not by any appropriate tie connected with the subject of this work an indication as brief and general as possible is therefore the utmost that the reader will probably look for or be pleased to meet with in this place i removal of the external cause of the disease the root of the corruption substitution of salaries to fees throughout the whole nest of judicial offices ii substitution of the natural system to the technical throughout the whole field of procedure iii transformation gradual but at length complete of the substantive branch of the law from its present form of jurisprudential law or jurisprudential patched with statutory into pure statutory iv arrangements to be taken for annexing to offices already in existence or to a new office or set of offices to be instituted for the purpose an interest in the preservation and amelioration of the fabric of the laws a system of registration calculated for the express purpose of indicating the defects of the law if any in proportion as experience gives them birth and an officer or set of officers whose function it shall be to watch the appearance of all such effects to take note of them to present them from time to time to the notice of the legislator together with an indication of the arrangements which present themselves as best calculated to answer the purpose of a remedy there is a time for all things there may be a time even for justice fashions change who knows but one day even justice may be in fashion things little less strange have sometimes happened in the administration of what is called justice the ends hitherto pursued have been it has been seen not the ends of justice but ends opposite to those ends we have seen the chains in which the wisdom and virtue as well as the power of the nation have for so many ages been held in thraldom chains forged by absurdity in the cavern of depredation time may come when men shall be weary of these chains let us suppose though it were only in the way of reverie let us suppose as in a dream to some perhaps even pleasurable and not the less so for being fantastic—let us suppose a time—if not in the present in some future age the year    0 for example—in which in a sort of mad fit or by way of frolic a resolution were taken in one or other     or both of the two proper places to frame a system of procedure directed to the ends of justice to gratify this odd fancy what would be the one thing needful it is comprised in one word—consistency yes to frame a system of procedure as perfect and salubrious as that with which the people at present are afflicted is depraved and pestiferous the legislature needs only to tread in its own steps the exemplifications of the principal arrangements taken at different times by the english legislature for clipping the wings of the feecollecting system and substituting the pursuit of the ends of justice to that of the ends of judicature may be comprised under the following heads viz—   institution of courts in which the natural system of procedure has been preserved or restored   partial abolition of special pleading   abolition of fees in judicial as well as other departments i courts of natural procedure preserved or instituted let us begin with bringing under review the whole list of these courts together they appear to be as follows—   courts martial including the naval as well as the land branch of the military service the mode of procedure not presenting in the point of view in question any material difference general and regimental is a distinction which in the land branch draws with it a difference respecting the constitution of the court and the sort of causes cognizable but none respecting the course of procedure   courts of inquiry these in the military service serve for a sort of preliminary examination an inquiry having for its object the question whether the person who is the subject of it shall be placed in a situation so full of vexation in various shapes as that of a defendant in a criminal cause mode of procedure to the present purpose much the same in the above instances but more particularly the first the natural modes of procedure may be considered to be preserved rather than restored why because in these instances a strict regard to the ends of justice was so indispensable that under the technical system the country could at no time have been preserved from utter ruin for six weeks   courts composed of justices of the peace acting whether singly or in companies out of general sessions the quarterly court of general sessions being courts of technical procedure   courts of request more commonly called courts of conscience one for each of the several towns or districts to which on their respective application it has been granted by so many acts of parliament with a jurisdiction marked out by each respective act   courts composed of arbitrators chosen by the parties with powers derived from a special article of statute law in whatsoever other respects the course of procedure observed in these several courts differs in one of them compared with another and the difference is not great it agrees in being unshackled by those rules with which it is lettered in the technical courts we have seen those devices and engines of fraud and injustice which having been invented and carried into effect by the technical system constitute so many characteristics of that system to none of these natural courts does the application of them extend in none of these courts of natural procedure is there anything to prevent them from directing their operations to the ends of justice in no instance do they stand exposed to the influence of that sinister interest by which under the technical system judges have been in so deplorable a degree diverted from the ends of justice to the factitious ends of judicature in none of them is there any want of those powers which are necessary to enable the judge to pursue with effect the ends of justice or if there be and if the deficiency were supplied as it might be and ought to be the effect of the supply would only be to bestow upon them what is necessary to render them perfect in the character of courts of natural procedure it would not bring them any nearer to the nature of the courts of technical procedure what distinction there is is confined to evidence in the courts of conscience and arbitration courts alone is the practice in regard to evidence free from those exclusions of which under the technical system it is composed those exclusions the irrationality of which has been announced and will be brought to view in detail as we advance†     on every occasion they afford the time requisite for making on both sides the necessary ground for right decision and in particular on both sides for receiving whatever stock of material evidence the cause happens to supply on no occasion do they consume more than that requisite length of time much less do they on any occasion so work up and improve delay as to render it a cause of necessary misdecision and injustice by the deperition of the matter of satisfaction or of a source of evidence on no occasion do they add to the unavoidable load of expense any mass of factitious expense with or without design either for the profit of the man of law or the ease of the man of finance on no occasion do they add to that mass of vexation which in the course of a suit at law in one shape or other is liable unavoidably to attach itself upon persons of different descriptions any ulterior and factitious mass the fruit of the negligence or the sinister policy of the legislator or the judge what in a word are the characteristics of the technical system of procedure exactly so many modifications of abuse the practice of the courts of technical procedure is throughout infected with or rather composed of all of them from all of them the practice of the courts of natural procedure is free the above observations are mere specifications of detail to point the attention of the reader—to afford a security for the correctness of the general position in which they are included—and to manifest the impotence of malâ fide adversaries by way of recapitulation let us repeat once more the general positions in which they are comprised the practice of the courts of technical procedure being directed under the impulse of sinister interest to ends opposite to the ends of justice is throughout its whole texture a compound of abuse the practice of the courts of natural procedure having nothing to turn it aside from the ends of justice and being uniformly directed to those ends is pure from all such abuse the countenance shown to the two systems is the natural and necessary result of their respective aspects with relation to the interest of the man of law of the inexhaustible mass of eulogy with which the practice of the courts of technical procedure is so universally and indefatigably bedaubed mention has been made already when you can find nothing evil to say of your adversary say nothing of him this policy is no secret to the dullest mind of the courts of natural procedure and their practice what do we hear said by the lawyers or by anybody exactly nothing everywhere a dead and universal silence what can be more instructive what more pregnant with confession than this silence by lawyers nothing for reasons too obvious to need or to bear repeating by nonlawyers almost as little because so successful have been the labours of the man of law that nonlawyers feel the risk or rather the impossibility of ever opening their lips on the subject but in the way of a chorus echoing the eulogies of their learned leaders should there be here and there an individual who moved by the principles of genuine philanthropy and honest love of justice should be desirous of satisfying himself by a convincing test in what degree the popular creed upon this subject is the result of prejudice nursed by sinister interest and in what degree if any the expression of truth—a short experiment will be found not unconducive to his purpose taking any of those institutions the establishment of which has been among the devices of the technical system as above exemplified—let him apply it in idea to the practice of any of the courts of natural procedure and ask himself in what respect any of the ends of justice will be served by it the result may already be anticipated attached to the courts which gave it birth the abuse is protected from censure because protected from scrutiny by the prejudices the solemn plausibilities the everthickening cloud of incense the flowing vestments the ermine borders the masses of false hair—just emblems of the falsehood poured out as from a perennial spring from the receptacles which it envelopes transplant it from that its native soil—transfer it in idea to any of the courts of natural procedure courts of which the practice has nothing to recommend it to the man of law nor anything to the nonlawyer but its subserviency to the ends of justice—it has no such defence to     protect it from the eye of scrutiny all illusions vanish the abuse presents itself to every eye in its native colours does it happen to you for example to be a member of the unlearned class of judges serving your country in the character of a justice of the peace take up in idea but remember in idea only take up in the character of instruments of justice those devices which under the character of instruments of fraud and extortion have been above enumerated as so many tools manufactured and habitually worked with by the superior and exclusively learned hands of lawyers hearing refused to parties tribunals put out of reach sittings separated by fixed and longprotracted intervals mechanical judicature pleadings in writing at successive and distant intervals spun out under a licence for selling lies nullification destruction of just claims on grounds void of all relation to the merits jargon without end fiction without shame deck your proceedings with these flowers—all or any of them—and observe the consequence in the practice of courts military of all sorts land and naval general and regimental courts martial and courts of inquiry the natural course of procedure has ever been preserved and as already observed for a very simple reason at no time in that line of judicature could human society and the practice of the technical courts have maintained a contemporary existence pugnant nec in unâ sede morantur so many times as by act of parliament jurisdiction has been given to justices of the peace out of general sessions or the possibility of obtaining justice against unwilling debtors to an amount not exceeding forty shillings has been communicated to creditors by the establishment of a court of requests—so many times have king lords and commons joined in solemn proclamation to the following effect the course of dealing pursued by learned judges is incapable of being employed with effect in the execution of our laws—incapable of serving for the accomplishment of our predictions for the fulfilment of our engagements—incompatible in a word with the pursuit of the ends of justice in regard to natural procedure and the courts in which it is in use a supposition tacitly if not expressly assumed by lawyers is that it is a sort of inferior makeshift mode of administering justice or something in lieu of justice employed through necessity for the relief of those who cannot afford to go to the expense of justice according to the regular and proper meaning the technical mode that the justice thus administered is a sort of inferior commodity provided for the relief and accommodation of those who cannot come up to the price of the best sort as neckbeef and stickingpieces are provided by the butcher for those who cannot come up to the price of ribs and sirloins that between good justice i e justice as secure as possible from danger of misdecision between good justice on the one hand and dilatory expensive and vexatious justice on the other there exists a sort of natural and indissoluble connexion between the best justice i e justice secured in the highest degree against misdecision and prompt cheap and unvexatious justice as natural and invincible an incompatibility and repugnance that the more dilatory the more expensive and more vexatious your justice is the more secure against misdecision it will be that the less dilatory the less expensive the less vexatious your justice is the worse it is in that other respect that therefore a sort of option is in every case to be made and that people have to choose whether they will have their justice good and secure against misdecision but dilatory expensive and vexatious—or to a certain degree prompt cheap and unvexatious but in an equal degree exposed to the danger of misdecision and in that respect liable to be bad as often as a court of natural procedure has been instituted continues this hypothesis this option has been made in the case of the court of conscience a cheap sort of justice has been provided for poor and low people who cannot afford to have it good in the case of the extrasessional justiceofpeace court a sort of inferior justice is administered—partly and in some cases for promptitude because delays would be prejudicial to the interests of government as trustee for the public at large partly and in other cases for cheapness as in the case of the courts of conscience for the accommodation of the poor and low people who cannot afford to go to the expense of the best sort such is the hypothesis of interest and interestbegotten prejudice what says the simple truth answer pretty exactly the reverse in complicated causes different accidents are liable to arise creating an indispensable demand for an extra portion of appropriate labour of delay i e of time occupied or not occupied in such labour and thence of a proportionate extra quantity of vexation and expense these cases allowed for and laid out of the account and they are extraordinary cases—they compose the small minority of cases the repugnance and connexion are nearly the opposite to what by the hypothesis they are supposed to be and in a word the degree of security against misdecision is in the inverse more nearly than in the direct ratio of the quantity of delay vexation and expense     in the regular technical courts the quantity of delay expense and vexation is greater—in a prodigious degree greater than in the natural courts this is a fact too notorious to be disputed to be contested by any man even by a lawyer but examine the system on the other ground—on that of security against misdecision—you will find this security not increased but diminished—diminished in a high degree and in a variety of ways—   by the exclusion put upon evidence—evidence in a variety of shapes in all which as will be seen it ought to be admitted—and in consequence of such exlusions not merely danger but certainty of misdecision or what is equivalent failure of justice exclusion put upon the evidence of parties and other indispensable or unexceptionable evidence   by substitution of inferior and less trustworthy to superior and more trustworthy evidence inferior evidence admitted while superior evidence even from the same source is excluded   by deperition of evidence the consequence partly and sometimes of the delay partly and at other times of the expense and vexation the party not able or not willing to defray the expense of procuring the evidence including the factitious part manufactured by the system of technical procedure   by deperition or latency of the matter of wealth in the character of the matter of satisfaction the consequence of the delay the property of the defendant or if in this respect incidentally become debtor the plaintiff dissipated or conveyed out of the reach of justice   by nullifications and in consequence of the delay resulting from them deperition of evidence or of the matter of satisfaction   by mechanical judicature as already explained†   by nonproduction of evidence or abandonment of just claim or just defence in other ways through despair or incapacity of bearing the expense man be he where he will will have his weaknesses a court of natural procedure any more than a court of technical procedure will not be exempt from that common lot by which every seat of power is doomed to become occasionally a fountain of injustice but between a court of natural procedure and a court of technical procedure there is this simple difference in the court of natural procedure injustice is matter of accident in a court of technical procedure injustice as we have seen in every shape is matter of necessity in one of its shapes expense viz such part of the expense to the suitor as becomes matter of profit to the partnership it was the end the very direct and ultimate end of the institution in all its other shapes delay vexation and misdecision it has been though not the ultimate an intermediate end as being a necessary means in a court of natural procedure it is but too possible that occasional injustice should be done in a court of technical procedure it is not possible to avoid doing continual injustice in the shape of needless expense vexation and delay constantly and without any exception in the shape of misdecision frequently checks being in both the same in a court of natural procedure the practice of the worst judge that ever lived would be a blessing in comparison with that of the best judge that ever lived in a court of technical procedure in a word how should it be otherwise if that be true which every page of this inquiry has been presenting to view—viz that natural procedure has invariably had for its objects the ends of justice technical as invariably ends always different from mostly opposite to the ends of justice i have spoken of checks one of the pretences if not the only pretence employed by the technicalists in defence of their system and the forms of which it is composed meaning those which under the name of devices have here been stripped of their sheeps clothing and exposed to view is that these forms are so many checks to arbitrary power in the hands of the judge but what i trust is by this time pretty apparent is that of these forms there is not one which either in intention or in effect has ever operated or can ever operate in that character and that amongst them there are few but what so far from being checks were in design and are in effect far from being checks to arbitrary power subservient to it in the character of instruments checks—of everything or almost everything capable of operating in that character or needful for that purpose the indication may be comprised in three words—publicity appeal jury not one of these surely which is in the slightest degree incompatible with the natural system of procedure as far as concerns the organization of the existing courts of natural procedure they are susceptible of great improvements but in respect of the mode of procedure two single features viz appearance of the parties before the judge and vivâ voce examination of the parties but especially the former are enough to render them as much superior to the best of the regular courts as the military tactics of european are to those of asiatic powers they afford no work for lawyers     the wonder is not great that they should not be to the taste of lawyers ii abolition of special pleading in every instance in which by a clause in an act of parliament a licence has been given to the defendant to plead the general issue and give the special matter in evidence—the delay and expense attached to special pleading has by the literal import of the words been dispensed with but so notorious in every such instance has the mischief been that would ensue to the defendant who having justice on his side should forbear to avail himself of this indulgence that no attorney who has any regard to his own character probably no attorney at all ever did venture to forbear giving his client the advantage of it in practice then the dispensation has exactly had what it was intended to have the effect of a prohibition the licence by which men were allowed not to have recourse to special pleading has had the effect of a prohibition inhibiting pro tanto a practice so repugnant to every end of justice almost every act to use the words of ruffhead so far as it relates to officers of justice of customs and duties c and those acting under them and highway turnpike and paving acts give this authority impose this virtual prohibition vide continues he the statutes themselves† these instances amount already to several hundreds perhaps to thousands in the greater part of them the person to whom the indulgence is thus given is a sort of person to whom some special power has been given for some public purpose but though by far the greater number of cases are manifestly comprisable under this designation others there may be that are not comprised in it be this as it may so many hundred times     as the legislature has given this authority so many hundred times has it recognised the practice of special pleading to be a nuisance so many times as professional lawyers of the different classes attorneys in the conduct of the defence counsel in advising concerning the plan of the defence have concurred in giving to their clients the benefit of this authority so many times have they by such conduct and deportment subjoined their attestation to the same unquestionable and important truth in each particular case the recognition it may be said goes no further than that particular case true because in no one of these cases could it with anything like propriety have gone any further because in no one of these cases did the statute of which the clause in question made a part belong to that too scanty class of statutes which have had for their declared object the amendment of the law meaning that part of the law which concerns the course of procedure but in each such instance wherefore was it that in that instance the practice of special pleading was thus abolished for this reason and no other—viz that in that instance the practice was seen to be repugnant to the ends of justice repugnant but why in these particular instances answer exactly for the same reasons which render it equally so in every other instance that can be assigned if there be any difference—if there be indeed a case such that though repugnant in so many hundred other cases it would in that case be subservient—it rests with that man if any such man there be who being willing conceives himself able to point out that case and to bring to view the difference in such case let him mark well the task he will have to perform viz to show that the points of fact in dispute in the cause will with more advantage upon the whole regard being had to the several ends of justice all of them taken together be ascertained and settled by the chain of successive instruments of which the operation called special pleading is composed the judge knowing as little of the matter as he cares than by the adjustment of the same points by the parties together with such professional assistants as they may respectively think fit to have at one and the same meeting together with such subsequent ones if any as may happen to be necessary in the presence and under the direction of the judge this is the point here in question subterfuges may be grounded on the particular sort of case in contemplation in these statutes viz the case where by the allegation called pleading the general issue the facts on which the merits of the cause depend may be sufficiently brought to view such are the subterfuges that but for this notice would naturally have been started but this notice being given they are anticipated and rendered unfit for use the converse thing is that the complete extirpation of this nuisance would not be improvement but restoration the abuse of language here in question having started up within time of memory—no institutional book or book of practice that does not refer you to a time at which the pleadings were performed vivâ voce occupying in many instances fewer minutes than at present they do months in those days had it not been for the presence of the professional manufacturers of quibbles assistants not as at present substitutes and perhaps the absence of extraneous witnesses and the minutes taken of what passed—the proceedings of the common pleas or kings bench would scarce have been distinguishable in simplicity at least from the present mode of proceeding in a court of conscience or before a justice of the peace†     iii abolition of fees in the early periods of political society in general and of the british constitution in particular fees in the character of a retribution for services rendered to the public by individuals were an indispensable resource mischiefs inevitably attached to that mode of retribution there were in abundance but in these early periods none of the conditions requisite to the provision of a succedaneum were as yet in existence neither the experience and wisdom necessary to indicate the existence of the demand for any such substitute nor the degree of public opulence necessary for the supply of it for a long time past this necessary degree of opulence has happily not been wanting and by the aid of the stock of experience that has so long been accumulating the intellectual lights necessary to the application of that experience as to the point in question to its proper use appear at length to have pretty generally illuminated the public mind in other departments of government the sinister influence of this mode of retribution has been brought to light by competent authority in theory the discovery has been made—in practice it has been profited by parliament has raised its amending hand and in these departments retribution by fees has been abolished retribution by salary has been substituted in its stead the precedent or rather in this case as in the two foregoing ones the mass of precedents is upon the face of it conclusive at any rate to such a degree conclusive that if there be any person who admitting the propriety of the substitution in these instances is disposed to contest it in the one now before us it lies upon him to point out the difference but it would be a conception very wide of the truth were it supposed that the reason for the substitution were no stronger in this case than in those—that the malignity of the principle of corruption were no greater in the bosom of a presiding officer of justice than in the bosom of an officer employed in the receipt in the expenditure or in any other branch of the public revenue but it is not to those other departments alone that the benefit of the principle of reformation has been extended the judicial department itself has experienced its purifying influence in so populous a neighbourhood as that of the metropolis the power attached to the office of justice of the peace had been converted it was thought into an instrument of trade the multitude of the fees receivable in the course of a day in a sort of court in which vacations are unknown made up for the smallness of them taken singly in the country at large so moderate is the rate so elevated for the most part the situation of the person invested with that office it is not in the nature of things that the emoluments derivable from it in this shape should in any point of view be an object of regard but in the populous neighbourhood of the metropolis it had for a long time been to such a degree an object of regard as to have attracted and placed in that commanding situation persons by whom it was regarded not merely as an object of desire but as a necessary source of livelihood serving in this respect in lieu of a profession or trade justices of the peace of whom it was supposed that they had been drawn into the situation by such views were distinguished from their colleagues in office by the appellation of trading justices such was the policy by which one branch of an act of the last reign called the general police act† was produced within the district there in question fees though still allowed and ordered to be received were no longer allowed to be carried to the private account of the magistrates by whose authority they were received but lest for want of adequate retribution there should be a want of fit persons disposed to take upon them the duties of an office so laborious and in which it was necessary     that the attendance should be so assiduous a certain number of tribunals of this kind were set down in so many divisions of this district a certain number of magistrates attached to each tribunal and in lieu of all emolument in the shape of fees a certain fixed salary provided for each magistrate to some parts of the plan objections were made while it was in dependency for acceptance but to the part here in question nothing like an objection ever was or ever could be made nobody in this instance made a doubt of the corruptive tendency of the retribution presented in the shape of fees to no one was it ever matter of doubt that in some way or other for the sake of the money attached to the business magistrates of the description in question contrived somehow or other to make business to no one was it ever matter of doubt but that howsoever it might be in respect of delay factitious vexation and expense to a degree calling loudly for the correcting hand of the legislator was the result but whatsoever may have been the proportion of business made for their own benefit by those unlearned magistrates it never could have been great enough to approach to a competition with the proportion regularly and from the beginning of things manufactured by their learned superiors and superintendents compared with the factitious vexation regularly inflicted by the courts of technical procedure—inflicted with the utmost regularity without danger of punishment without fear of reproach with undefined power of punishment of their own creation for their protection against reproach—punishment denounced or destined to be the severer the juster and better merited the reproach—compared with this the utmost vexation attached to any profit ever made or capable of being made by any one of those unlearned magistrates was a fleabite proportioned—at least with an exactness sufficient to the present purpose—proportioned to the mischief suffered on the one part has been the emolument received on the other while the unlearned magistrate has been picking it up by shillings his learned superior has been sweeping it in by pounds between them to whom are we to look for the real trading justice on the one part we see the prodigiously greater share of the profit on the other the whole of the odium and the exclusive possession of the name the trading justice so called made business admitted but to say no more of profits and quantities and proportions what means what instruments did he employ in making it by what aggravation did he ever add to that degree and species of improbity without which the effect could not have been produced what did he ever do towards nursing ignorance towards generating misconception towards confounding and obliterating in the public mind the very idea of true justice when did he ever refuse a hearing to both parties or to either when did he ever condemn a man unheard in what instance is his tribunal removed by his contrivance out of the reach of those whose fate is attached to their attendance on it when did he refuse refuse to all men so much as a show of justice for four for six for twelve whole months together in what instance did he ever keep parties for months and years upon the rack while men in partnership and confederacy with him were loading them with vexation and expense by papers in which a small portion of unnecessary sense was drowned in a sea composed of surplusage nonsense and lies in what instance did he ever to the dismay and ruin of the suitor break the faith plighted to him by the legislator by a decision in which no regard was so much as professed to be paid to the merits of the cause by what jargon did he ever befoul and corrupt the language of common sense and reason by what lies under the name of fiction did he ever defile his own lips or compel suitors and their agents to defile theirs thus it is under the imperfect hold which the regard for justice and consistency hath as yet obtained over the human mind combined with weakness improbity becomes an object of contempt combined with power the same improbity becomes an object of venetation acting on a petty scale the unsuccessful robber mounts the gallows under his own name acting on a great scale the successful robber translates robber into king or emperor and seats himself on a throne the man who without office or power obtains money by false pretences is called a swindler and under the name and pretence of temporary consigned to perpetual banishment not to speak of slavery the man who in office and with power for his protection obtains the same money by pretences equally false is styled a judge and beholds for his benefit mendacity softened into fiction and extortion converted into law thus it is even to this day but till when shall it continue so to be to cause it so to be no longer parliament needs but to tread in its own steps not that by the mere substitution of salaries to fees the mischief could now be cured the rule sublatâ causâ tollitur effectus may hold in some cases but this is not of the number of them the augean stable was not emptied nor even in any degree cleansed either by the fattening or the slaughter of the animals by which it had been filled if the system be an immedicabile vuluus in the excision of it lies an indispensable part     of the remedy for the remedy we need not go far it stares every man in the face chapter xxix apology for the above exposure if the judicial character has been held up in a light considerably different from that in which it has been accustomed to be viewed—if it has been treated with a degree of unprecedented freedom—it is not the individual it is the species that has been struck at nor yet the species but in respect of that situation in which the conduct of any other part of the human species would have been the same the general predominance of personal interest over every other interest—over every other force that can be applied to the human mind—is a principle not only not capable of being done away but which for the good of mankind there exists no sufficient reason for endeavouring for wishing to do away since it is upon this general predominance that when the matter is maturely considered the continuance of the whole species—of every individual belonging to it will be found to depend bad as the consequences sometimes are of an overanxiety on the part of each individual for his own welfare yet if the chief object of each mans anxiety were placed without himself—without the sphere of his own knowledge and experience the consequence would be much worse in the existing state of things by this overanxiety the wellbeing of society receives more or less disturbance in the other state of things supposed the very being of society would be very soon destroyed the man of probity and public spirit the man of general and universal benevolence is not he in whose instance a continual sacrifice is made of personal interest but he in whose instance situation and character have concurred in effecting between his personal interest and the public interest such a connexion that in labouring to promote the public interest he is labouring to promote his own interest at the same time if it be of use to man to know mans nature for what it is—most highly must it be of use to know what mans nature is in the instance of those men on whose conduct the lot of all others is in so high a degree dependent and for the praise of a show of candour utterly incompatible with true wisdom to forego any part of a species of knowledge at once so necessary and it might almost be said so new is a species of suavity than which nothing could be more weak—few things more injurious to the interest of the state and of mankind suppose a proposition had been made for placing in the hands of bonaparte the conduct of the war carrying on against bonaparte the proposition would probably not have been acceded to but for the refusal to accede to it no possible reason could be given that would not amount to this—viz that it would be against his interest to conduct the war in such way as to this country should be attended with most advantage but to conduct the war of this country against bonaparte in the manner most advantageous to the country would not have been more undeniably contrary to the interest of bonaparte than to conduct the business of judicature in the manner most conformable to the interests of the people in respect of the ends of justice is contrary to the interest of the judges circumstanced as are at present these arbiters of human destiny the pictures which in this no less than in other countries interest and interestbegotten prejudice have been so universally accustomed to give of men in high situations and more particularly of men in the situation of judges are such in the composition of which not only the extreme of imbecility but if not improbity itself the effects of it in a very high degree are combined praise bestowed upon misconduct upon misconduct in any situation or in any shape is a bounty given for it operates as an encouragement to persevere in it as in no other situation would any instance be to be found where with an interest so opposite to that of the public at large so much power of giving effect to that interest is combined so neither would there be found any other situation in which praise has been so little merited and at the same time so lavishly bestowed the notion so studiously propagated—the notion that by holding up in an unwelcome point of view the conduct of men in office and more particularly in judicial office their power or their disposition to comport themselves worthily in it is lessened—this notion convenient as it is to those who are thus studious to propagate it is a notion than which nothing can be at once more erroneous and more pernicious it holds up to view as a cause of disease the sole remedy against that same disease   0 the notion that mens obedience to the laws that their disposition to pay such obedience depends in any considerable degree upon the good opinion the respect and reverence entertained by them for the individual by whom those laws are administered is a mere fallacy happily for mankind in this country at any rate it is bottomed on much firmer ground—on ground which is not exposed to be shaken by vice and improbity in the person of individuals the disposition to pay obedience to the official mandates of a judge has for its cause not any opinion concerning the character of the individual but the persuasion so thoroughly and so happily rooted in every reflecting breast of the necessity of such obedience to the preservation of everything that any man holds dear this necessity being the same under every variation which the character of individuals in that situation ever has undergone or is susceptible of—the persuasion is therefore altogether independent of the character of the individuals by whom the situation is at any time filled if indeed by any disadvantageous impression given of the wisdom and probity of these functionaries any such disposition were produced on the part of the body of the people as that of rising up in arms against the authority of these functionaries which so long as they have the support of the supreme power could not be done without rising up in arms against the authority of the supreme power then indeed the obedience of the people might thus be shaken and insurrection and civil war be the result of the views thus given of the system of judicature but though such a result is as easy to conceive as any other nothing can be more remote from probability or foundation in experience from what signs should any such effect be regarded as probable from the present temper of the people deceived by the unanimous certificate and indefatigable eulogiums of all those who are supposed to understand the system—by all those at any rate who have the best means and strongest inducements to engage them to understand it—the people are in the habit of regarding it as allperfect and their disposition towards it far from being that of discontent and insurrection is that of blind and indiscriminating admiration and obedience to the miseries which so large a portion of them are doomed to suffer under it no false certificates no sophisms can render them insensible but though incapable of being deceived as to the existence of the effects they are not the less completely deceived as to the cause whatever they suffer under the system they ascribe to the nature of things whatever they escape from suffering the escape from is attributed to the system itself and to its matchless excellence in blackstone they see their only guide—their only oracle and from the voice of this oracle delivering itself under the influence of constant bribery they hear the faultless excellence of the system proclaimed and trumpeted forth at every page in history is there any example of an insurrection or since the infancy of the roman commonwealth so much as the least disposition to insurrection produced in the great mass of the people by the contemplation of any defects in the system of procedure—so flagrantly defective as that system has in general been so much more than even the system the defects of which are here endeavoured to be exposed to view the following are the reasons for the condemnatory point of view in which the conduct of the fraternity has here all along been placed it being their interest to secure the continuance of the whole body of the mischief in its utmost magnitude and this interest being universally understood or rather more than understood felt—it is impossible in the nature of men and things that they should concur willingly in the giving up of any the smallest part of it that they should forbear opposing every remedial measure with all their might that they should give up any the smallest part of it without being forced and compelled to do so viz by the clamour and pressure of the thinking part of the people in and out of parliament or that the people should be brought to apply any such pressure without a clear and thorough view and conviction of the depravity of the system under which they are suffering be the course of a mans conduct ever so opposite to that of his duty ever so pernicious to the public interest—so long as no disturbance of ease nor loss of reputation to himself is among the effects of his perseverance his perseverance is among those things of which the public may be sufficiently assured if acting in a state of uniform opposition to every end of justice and to the interest and welfare of the rest of the community they receive the same tokens of affection and veneration that would be worthily bestowed on them if the line of their conduct were directly opposite—no expectation could be more idle than that of their changing their conduct and ceasing to oppose the changes that would be necessary to render the course of judicature conducive to the ends of justice every observation therefore that can contribute to place their system and their conduct under it in its true and proper light to expose it to that odium which is so justly due to it is means to an end—a necessary means to one     of the most beneficial ends that human virtue seconded by human wisdom can propose to itself to bring to light a violation of duty on the part of a set of public men and at the same time to abstain from every observation the tendency of which is to deprive them of any share of that respect which the public has been in the habit of manifesting towards them are courses of action absolutely and irreconcilably incompatible an option must be made the mischief must be left in its full force or a line of argument must be entered upon having for its tendency the eventually divesting them of a correspondent portion of this misplaced and illdeserved respect in doing the mischief which in the exercise of the power attached to your offices you are in the habit of doing and which by taking a different course it would be in your power to save yourselves from doing either you know what you are about or you do not if yes you are deficient in probity—if not in understanding this is the dilemma which he who brings to view pernicious practice in a public man or set of public men is continually and unavoidably pressing them with and this dilemma he must either continue to press them with or give up his enterprise as between want of probity and want of understanding the higher the degree of intellectual force demanded by and necessarily exercised in any situation public or private the stronger the assurance that it is not on that side of the mental frame that the failure is to be found although the profession here in question affords a remarkable proof how easy it is for sinister interest to reconcile to the grossest absurdity and bring down to the convenient standard the strongest and most strenuously exercised minds be the absurdity ever so gross—make it a mans interest not to see it—as often as it presents itself he will shut his eyes as often as it is spoken of he will shut his ears and in neither of these operations is there much difficulty this notion about the duty of abstaining from everything that can tend to diminish the respect paid to the possessors of high offices and judicial offices in particular—observe to what it leads it leads to this that not only all present abuses are to continue without remedy but all future ones are to go on accumulating and accumulating without end for where is the species or degree of transgression in which a man will not indulge himself if while continuing thus to indulge himself he stands assured that he will not only be safe against punishment or dismissal but continue in the enjoyment of as much respect as if by the directly opposite course he had manifested himself in ever so high a degree a benefactor to mankind it is a notion invented by malefactors—by such as operate upon the largest scale for freeing themselves from that faint check which it is in the nature of public opinion to apply to a malpractice in those places in which malpractice if it has not that check has none in this country as often as mention is made of the judicial establishment meaning the judges loud and incessant are the boasts made on the score of purity wherein consists this purity what is the impurity of which the existence is meant to be denied what in the mean time in respect of purity and impurity or to use its other appellation corruption will be found to be the plain and real truth of corruption in that sort of shape in which in this country thanks to the publicity of the judicial procedure it is not possible and in which were it possible it would be to such a degree unsafe that no man in his senses would be guilty of it—they have not any of them ever been known or so much as suspected to be guilty this is the case of common bribery of corruption—in that shape in which it consists in pronouncing an undue decision in favour of this or that individual or to the prejudice of this or that other—no one of them has ever been convicted possibly of late years for in the earl of mansfields reign it was far otherwise no one has ever been suspected but does it follow that no such injustice has ever been done on the contrary not a court in westminster hall not a day of sitting in which injustice in this shape may not have been abundant what is not known of any one of them is that in any one given individual instance corruption in this any more than in that other shape was ever committed but what is known of every one of them at least in so far as future conduct can be known from past habits and discourses and connexions is that there is not one of them on whose conscience that facility which an english judge possesses of deciding a litigated point one way or other as is most agreeable to him ever appeared to sit heavy and that there is not one of them to whom the only possible remedies to that perennial fountain of corruption—viz the conversion of unwritten into written law and the substitution of natural to technical procedure—would not be objects of abhorrence the power of giving loose to all such partialities is dear to them as their lifes blood and is credit to be given to them or to their eulogists when they protest that the idea of making any use of that same power never so much as entered into their thoughts on no account will they endure to part with the means and can any credit be due to their protestations when they protest that they     abhor the idea of applying those means to their end—to the only end in respect of which they can be of any use of corruption in a judge what and where is the mischief in what shape can the mischief show itself if it be not in the production the known and wilful production of one or more of the evils correspondent and opposite to the several ends of justice but that to a most enormous amount all these evils are actually and constantly produced—all produced by every one of these servants of the public and in every individual cause that comes before them without exception—is matter of notoriety and has been and will be brought to view over and over again in the course of these pages that of all persons in the world the authors of these evils are those to whom it is least possible that the existence of them should be unknown is surely manifest enough what is known of them is that by all of them more or less though in much the largest proportion by the highest among them in power and influence profit in various shapes is derived from all these evils—profit the quantum of which keeps pace with the quantity of the evils is this corruption or is it not if it he not corruption surely it is something equally bad if it be corruption wherein consists their boasted purity that in any hazardous and retail way they are not known to practise corruption but that in the safe and wholesale way they do practice it and are universally known to practise it of corruption in a judge is the mischief not to speak of guilt—for when separate from that of mischief the question of guilt is here an idle question—of corruption in a judge is the mischief done away—is it so much as lessened—by the circumstance that in the commission of it he stands secured not only against punishment but against shame surely by such a circumstance the mischief far from being lessened cannot but be in an enormous degree increased in the shape of partiality favourable and unfavourable suppose it the wish and intention of a man in the sort of office in question to be guilty of corruption every day in his life with the exception of the security afforded by publicity and the feeble and scanty application of jury trial nothing more proper or effectual could a man set about doing than to continue in their present state the rule of action and the system of procedure the rule of action without words for the expression of it the system of procedure of that sort which has the refusal to hear or see the parties for its essential and characteristic principle a state of things in which there is really no law and in which that which by a cruel abuse of language is called the law is no better than one immense and everlasting share a field covered on its whole surface with spring guns and mantraps and without so much as a board to warn the passenger of the destruction to which he is doomed if under the notion of doing justice that of fulfilling the collateral ends as herein so often distinguished and described as well as the direct ends be included it may be asserted on the fullest examination and with the strictest truth that in westminster hall from years end to years end in no one of its four courts in no one of the causes therein with or without hearing determined for in what is there called judicature neither seeing the parties nor hearing them is necessary no not in so much as a single one of them is justice ever done true it is that—so far as concerns the direct ends of justice—injustice however deplorably frequent and although rendered so by the same means is not thus invariably constant in that sort of cause in which quantity being preascertained or agreed on the question is simply as in the case of a determinate thing or things to a determinate value a horse a house or a sum of money—shall it belong to plaintiff or to defendant—in a case of this sort in which justice would be the frequent result were the mode of trial cross and pile injustice is not always the result but in the case where quantity is the subject and sole subject of the question—as when for instance transgression being out of dispute the only question is what shall be the compensation or what the punishment—what the damages or what the fine—in a case of this complexion neither in respect of the direct ends of justice is justice ever done he by whom compensation is received with reference to and in consideration of a wrong sustained is thereby i e by and after the receipt of such compensation if so it be that the compensation be adequate put in as good a plight as he would have been had the wrong never been done on one supposition therefore and on one only is justice full and complete justice rendered to the plaintiff and that is where the compensation the money awarded to him the damages as it is called is to a certain amount excessive but if in this way justice be rendered to one side it is only at the expense and by the means of injustice committed to the prejudice of the other side and if it be true that for examples sake and thus as it were in the character of punishment it is better that compensation should be excessive than defective if it be better that the shape in which injustice takes place should be that of excessive charge in the name of compensation and thus excessive loss to the defendant than in     the shape of insufficient receipt in the name of compensation and thereby undue loss on the side of the plaintiff still on whatever side and in whatever shape it falls injustice is injustice due to the plaintiff on the score of compensation say £ 0 money of his which after the receipt of what is allowed him at the charge of the defendant under the name of costs would remain unreimbursed to him say £ 0 instead of the £ 0 damages accordingly say £ 0 the injustice at the charge of the plaintiff would thus be avoided but injustice to the same amount at the charge of the defendant would at the same time be done under a system so constructed to take any course that shall not be pregnant with the grossest and most palpable injustice will frequently not to say commonly be physically impossible not a cause in which injustice is not done injustice from which everybody profits and for which nobody is to blame not merely for which nobody is actually punishable but for which nobody ought in justice to be punished for which in that sense nobody is blameable here we have misrule brought to a system the absolute perfection of misrule with how much less expense of thought if not of ingenuity might a system of real perfection the perfection of good judicature have been framed—a system the very idea of which in the character of a possible system would be scouted as utopian—if a tenth part of the reward that has been reaped from injustice had been attached to the investigation and development of the dictates of utility and justice but my lord suchanone or mr justice suchanone such honourable men men who speak at least so nobly—on every occasion if you believe them perfect slaves to justice—can you impute to them any such horrible disposition as that of a constans et perpetua voluntas suum cuique non tribuendi can you accuse them on so much as any one occasion since their ascent to that high station of doing anything that has presented itself to them in the shape of injustice perhaps not but consider that it is not by them that the system has been brought to what it is they take it as they find it such as it is it is of course to them the standard of right and wrong no man ought to be wiser than the laws no judge ought to be more honest than his predecessor whether he ought or no thus much at least is clear enough that there is nothing to be got by it consider that in the judicial department as in every other bating casual irregularities the farther back you go in history the more corrupt and profligate men are found consider for example that in the time of henry vi when judges wanted money they used to fix upon any man that came uppermost and converting him into an outlaw sell what he had and put the money into their pockets that the details of the operation were left of course to their clerks† that the persons thus ruined getting of course from the receivers no redress against the thieves complained to parliament and that parliament by way of setting matters to rights declared and ordered that things of that sort should not be done in future‡ it was a little before this time that lord chancellor fortescue wrote his puff direct his treatise de laudibus legum angliæ since which time there has been a congenial trial of skill between lawyers and auctioneers the worse the wine the more need it has of the bush love of justice with them is neither more nor less than the love of those established arrangements under which they have been born and bred—under which they have practised as advocates and sat as judges in this sense indeed their love of justice is strong enough i suppose they never do anything but what is legal whatever they do the fact alone of their doing it is to my mind conclusive proof of its legality the lord chief justice of england would he do anything that were illegal would he do anything for which according to law he were liable to be punished indeed should a fancy for arguments sake take a chief justice especially if he had a seat in the cabinet to do anything illegal i do not very well see how it would be in his     power to compass it were the fancy that of going upon the highway shooting and stripping the first passenger he met he would stand no better chance i suppose than any other highwayman but as to any mischief done in the exercise of the powers given to him by his office—how any such mischief should have any illegality in it—in the conception of that point lies the difficulty that presents itself as insuperable in such case illegality means nothing unless it means liability to punishment and as to punishment—by whom and at whose instance and by means of what procedure would it be to be administered by removal—think of precedents by impeachment—think of precedents and of the understanding which seems to have been avowed and to have become universal on that subject if punished for what too should he be punished for open and wilful violation of the spirit as well as letter of a positive law on a point in which misconception is impossible it is every days practice lawyer—but can you without compunction nay without horror reflect on the disrepute not to say the odium and contempt that you have been thus labouring to cast upon so many characters hitherto held sacred upon so many exalted personages upon     nonlawyer—hold spare yourself if you please and at any rate spare me the enumeration the red book has done it already to our hands so far as it may happen to individuals to find themselves concerned i am as free to confess as you will be ready to believe that this part of the fruits that may be expected from my labours whatever it may amount to is not the part that i reflect on with most pleasure one thing you will allow me that in no sense of the word gain can i have promised to myself the having much to gain from it another thing you will allow me that they are not so low in power in dignity in credit in everything as to be on this or any other occasion in danger of receiving in the opinion and at the hands of the public at large anything less or worse than justice as to any personal feeling on the part of any such high personages should anything of that sort be really in question i will freely own to you the system of arithmetic which as long as i remember i have been in the habit of employing on all political occasions every individual in the country tells for one no individual for more than one from so obscure and weak a hand should any particle of uneasiness find its way into any learned breast—the assurance of uneasiness far more than equivalent being saved in unlearned breasts by hundreds will be a sufficient equivalent     book ix on exclusion of evidence part i on the exclusionary system in general chapter i exclusion of evidence its connexion with the ends of justice the system of procedure—judicial procedure—the system of adjective law is a means to an end that end is or ought to be the execution of the commands issued the fulfilment of the predictions delivered of the engagements taken by the system of substantive law the system composed of all the other branches of the body of law put together the law respecting evidence is one branch of that system of adjective law it therefore ought to be and everywhere in some degree is one part of the means directed and applied to the attainment of that end in proportion to the steadiness and consistency with which it does act in subservience to that end is its congruity its propriety its fitness the claim it has to be approved of and preserved unchanged with indisputable propriety may the fulfilment of the predictions delivered by the substantive branch of the law be spoken of as an end of justice and why not rather as the end answer because though the principal and the only direct end it is not the only one vexation expense and delay—burthens pressing on the parties throughout every step of the course pursued for the attainment of that end—constitute in their aggregate the price paid for the benefits they derive from the substantive branch of the law to these certain evils vexation expense and delay burthens infinitely variable in their amount but in some amount or other unavoidable add the possible vexation—the vexation which where it does fall falls on the defendants side only—the vexation which in case of ultimate misdecision to the prejudice of that side is produced by undue obligations imposed upon him obligations of a penal or nonpenal nature according to the nature of the demand and of the suit instituted in consequence—the burthen of punishment imposed on him who has transgressed no law the burthen of satisfaction imposed on him who has borne no part in any damage that has been produced or at least in any injury that has been done or supposed to be done the burthen of the obligation correspondent to and inseparable from the collation or recognition of some pretended right which though claimed by the plaintiff and conferred on him or confirmed to him by the judge is really not his due the quantity of vexation expense and delay without which the course necessary to the execution of the article of substantive law in question cannot be pursued with effect—the price thus necessary to be paid for the chance of obtaining the benefit in question—does it exceed the value of that benefit or rather of that chance in such case the price ought not to be paid the law ought rather to remain unexecuted the vexation and expense without which the evidence necessary to the establishment of the plaintiffs claim cannot be produced does it exceed the value of that claim the plaintiff being unable or refusing to make adequate satisfaction for it in that case the plaintiffs demand ought to remain unsatisfied in that untoward state of things in itself and laying out of the account the work of interested lawyers and misguided legislators happily not a frequent one the best choice left to the legislator here as elsewhere is the least of two evils one or other of which is inevitable a competition has place between two of the ends of justice one or other of the contending branches of the public interest must yield one or other of them must for the moment fall a sacrifice by laying a barrowfull of rubbish on a spot on which it ought not to have been laid the side of a turnpike road titius has incurred a penalty of five shillings no man was witness to the transaction but sempronius and in the station of writer sempronius     is gone to make his fortune in the east indies should sempronius be forced if he could be forced to come back from the east indies for the chance of subjecting titius to this penalty who would think of subjecting sempronius to the vexation—who would think of subjecting sempronius or anybody else to the expense here and there a case may present itself in which it may be matter of doubt on which side the balance lies but in general there will be no difficulty all doubt will be removed by clear and indisputable principles in each individual instance to weigh mischief on one side against mischief on the other where occasion calls for it will be a task suitable to the station of the judge to provide powers adequate to the taking of it and acting in conformity to the result will in every case be an attention suitable to the station of the legislator an attention demanded at his hands by the indisputable dictates of justice in this instance we see an example of a case in which evidence ought to be excluded in which all ends taken together the exclusion is called for by a due regard for the ends of justice one case—and it will be found the only one this is the case of preponderant inconvenience in the shape of vexation expense and delay inconvenience preponderant over the mischief attached to a sacrifice of the direct ends of justice the mischief produced by ultimate misdecision to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side or what is equivalent to such misdecision the mischief produced by an instance of the nonexecution of some article of the substantive branch of the law or what is less frequent by the imposition of some undue obligation on an individual standing on the defendants side of the cause produced by the want of some evidence which had it been forthcoming would have demonstrated the obligation to be undue wheresoever the case thus described is realized the exclusion may be pronounced and according to the principle of utility ought to be pronounced proper legitimate congruous conformable conducive to the ends understand always to the aggregate of the ends of justice in every other case the exclusion i announce it not as a postulate but as a proposition to be proved may be pronounced ought to be pronounced improper illegitimate incongruous unconformable unconducive repugnant to the ends of justice if the above positions be correct the doctrine of evidence in so far as concerns the question as between admission and exclusion will be comprisable in a very narrow compass in one general rule with an exception for its limit the rule will be—let in the light of evidence the exception will be—except where the letting in of such light is attended with preponderant collateral inconvenience in the shape of vexation expense and delay let in the light of evidence the end it leads to is the direct end of justice rectitude of decision the consequence of the exclusion of it is ultimate injustice in respect of that end if to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side by nisdecision or otherwise failure of justice if to the prejudice of the defendants side misdecision to the prejudice of that side and consequent undue vexation and ultimate injustice imposing on him on the score of punishment or satisfaction either the loss of some right or some burthensome and painful obligation to which it was not the intention of the substantive branch of the law that he should be subjected let not in the light of evidence not in every case more than the light of heaven even evidence even justice itself like gold may be bought too dear it always is bought too dear if bought at the expense of a preponderant injustice grant even that the dictates of justice were paramount to those of utility in its most comprehensive shape—that the sacrifice of ends to means were an eligible sacrifice—and that the aphorism fiat justitia ruat calum instead of a rhetorical flourish were an axiom of moral wisdom—even thus supposing the choice to be between injustice and injustice the preferability of the less injustice to the greater would scarcely be contested but in the cases above described supposing them ever realized the price paid for justice must upon the very face of those cases as here described be acknowledged to be uneconomical and excessive of the possibility of their being realized we have seen already several anticipated exemplifications we shall see them amply exemplified as we advance chapter ii disregard shown to the ends of justice under the exclusionary system of the ends of justice under their principal divisions a view has already been given as likewise a view of the connexion that subsists between them on the one hand and the arrangements capable of being taken for the exclusion of evidence on the other but if this statement be correct—under all established systems the practice for theory there exists nowhere any will be found to be a tissue of errors and inconsistencies compared with others each system infinitely various—compared with itself each system infinitely inconsistent but it may be said under all their varieties these exclusions thus universal as you yourself admit and even proclaim does not their universality prove the prevalence of one     common principle this principle then has it not the universal voice of all mankind or at least of the most civilized and intelligent among mankind to sanction it and attest the reasonableness of it yes indeed it has that sort of sanction its reasonableness is proved by that medium of proof by which till within this century or two supernatural evidence of various kinds evidence by duel by ordeal was pronounced superior in trustworthiness to all human or other natural evidence no truly the concord in this case is far from being alike real as in those in substance the mode of inquiry was in those instances the same if between nation and nation there was a difference it was confined to formalities to unessential modes here the arms employed by the combatants were of one sort there of another sort here a ring was to be taken out of bubbling and supposed boilinghot water there a party supposed to be blindfolded was to take a walk between two rows of heated or supposed to be heated ploughshares but in the case of the exclusions put upon evidence the agreement was rather in words than principles one nation or rather some one corrupt or lazy lawyer in that nation called for exclusion on one ground another lawyer that is the lawyer of another nation called for it on a different ground by each of these lawyers the decision pronounced by the other was reprobated just as if there appeared in a cause a gang of lying witnesses all contradicting one another each giving a different account of the same business they all agree it may be said for they all agree in lying—they are all liars look to words only you may thus make harmony in all cases out of the most discordant elements in the established systems for in one respect they will be found not discordant in the established systems if nonexclusion be taken for the general rule the exceptions must be searched for in very different sources from the only justifiable ones yes in one respect they do agree and it is this that in no instance are the exceptions drawn from the source just mentioned if at every other step the direct ends of justice are contravened the contravention is gratuitous at any rate in no instance has it for its warrant and its cause a regard for any of the other ends of justice the collateral ends in no instance have men stopped to inquire whether the inconvenience inseparable from the execution of law in the shape of vexation expense and delay will or will not be preponderant when compared with the mischief attached to the nonexecution or undue execution of that article of substantive law on which the suit has been grounded various as are the exceptions taken in these systems to the rule of admission they will all of them unless here and there one should be found dictated by the mere force of blind and unaccountable caprice be found referable to one or other of two leading terms deception and vexation anxiety real or pretended for the avoidance of deception and consequent misdecision on the part of the judge anxiety real or pretended for the avoidance of vexation anxiety to avoid giving birth to inconvenience in that shape of neither of these fears supposing that the conduct of the man of law has been governed by it of neither of these fears can it with propriety be said that it was directed to an improper object in the first we see an apprehension pointing to the direct end of justice in the other an apprehension pointing to one of the collateral ends of justice but in so far as fear of deception was the actuating principle we shall find in every case the measures dictated or supposed to be dictated by a regard for that object altogether unsuitable or rather directly repugnant to the avowed purpose and again so far as fear of vexation was the actuating principle we shall find the measures dictated and produced by that principle equally incompetent the vexation—that vexation which was to afford a sufficient reason for the justification of direct injustice for the contravention of the direct ends of justice—will be found to be a quantity either evanescent or purely ideal or though real and considerable balanced and overbalanced by a preponderant advantage inseparably connected with it thus much for the cases which afford room to conceive that reason and utility have in any shape been consulted on the occasion of the exclusions that have been established but the cases will be but too numerous and various in which the discovery of any the least colour or shadow of reason will be seen to be a problem altogether insolvable by the most penetrating and industrious eye in referring to these two heads deception and vexation the exclusions put upon evidence by the established systems—what i mean is not so much to vindicate the considerations which in the minds of the authors were actually productive of those several arrangements a task in many instances by much too difficult for any human mind as among the legitimate ends of justice to bring to view that one to which the arrangement in question supposing it dictated by the ends of justice bears the most obvious reference for supposing the objects in question deception and vexation to have been really in view the arrangements with whatever sort of success would at any rate have been directed towards the ends of justice those of which deception avoidance of deception was the object towards the direct ends of justice those     of which vexation avoidance of vexation was the object towards that one of the collateral ends in principle the arrangement at any rate correct howsoever in the application misguided and unfelicitous in regard to the exclusions here ranked under the head of vexation—incongruous exclusions put upon evidence under the notion of avoiding to produce vexation—the reality of that object in the character of a final cause of the arrangement in question will in many instances appear probable enough or even indisputable but howsoever the case may be in respect of humanity small indeed is the wisdom that can reasonably be inferred from the regard thus paid to one of the ends of justice here as elsewhere so far as evidence is concerned everything depends upon proportions if the avoiding to produce vexation were the only object necessary to be regarded in legislation no child in leadingstrings would be unequal to the task the result would be not the putting an exclusion upon evidence in here and there an instance—not the shutting the door against evidence in the instance in which by the arrangements in question it was shut—but the shutting the door against all evidence tendered on the side of the plaintiff in whatever cause or to speak strictly the abolition of the whole system of procedure the abolition of all coercive laws to judge therefore whether in the instance of a lot of evidence excluded on the score of vexation the exclusion be warranted or unwarranted—produced by a childish emotion or by a considerate and manly regard for the ends of justice—inquiry must be made whether the advantages attached to the act from which the vexation is seen to flow have or have not been set against it on the opposite scale referring to the proper place for the details to assist the conception of the moment let one example suffice a witness being called on the other side and standing in readiness to be examined—that to put a question to him the answer to which if true would have the effect of subjecting him to an obligation a legal obligation nonpenal or penal would give birth to vexation in his breast is not to be doubted but in that vexation great or little is any sufficient reason to be found to warrant his being exempted from the obligation of making answer by no means the evil of the vexation be it ever so great is more than counterbalanced by the good flowing from the substantive law coercive as it is by which the obligation is imposed by itself the weight is great but the weight in the other scale greatly overbalances it to this case of a spurious exception on the score of vexation apply now the example above given of a legitimate exception on the same score and observe the difference by deposing to the rubbish sempronius the eastindia writer would have given the public the benefit of the fiveshilling penalty but he would have retarded to the amount of one knows not how many thousand pounds the augmentation of his fortune place now on the carpet instead of the future nabob the eastindia writer a malefactor who in consequence of his answers to the questions about the rubbish he is supposed to have seen laid on the road comes to be convicted of a robbery and murder committed on that same road in this case if the quantity of the vexation be the only object which the eye of the legislator is open to how much greater the vexation than in the other but in the eastindia writers case the benefit of the fiveshilling penalty is all that there was to set in the scale against the vexation all the good that the case affords consists in the benefit of the fiveshilling penalty whereas in the malefactors case the good is composed of the chance of the benefit of the fiveshilling penalty with whatever benefit depends upon so much of the security afforded by the law against robbery and murder to add to it chapter iii general view of the mischiefs of the exclusionary system evidence is the basis of justice to exclude evidence is to exclude justice on the plaintiffs side in a suit of a criminal nature—an excluding rule as often as it has the effect of shutting the door against an article of true and unfallacious evidence necessary to conviction operates as a licence for the commission of a crime in the exclusionary system may therefore be seen a fund of encouragement constantly applied to the production of all imaginable crimes on the plaintiffs side in a suit of a noncriminal nature—an excluding rule as often as it has the effect of shutting the door against an article of true and unfallacious evidence necessary to the giving effect to a rightful demand operates as a denial of justice in the exclusionary system may thus be seen a fund of encouragement constantly applied to the production of injustice in all its shapes to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side to the destruction of all those private rights which it has been the business of the substantive law to create and for the efficiency of which it stands pledged on the defendants side in a suit of a criminal nature—an excluding rule as often as it has the effect of shutting the door against an article of true and unfallacious evidence necessary to acquittal evidence sufficient for     conviction having been delivered on the other side operates as a licence for inflicting punishment upon the innocent on a false pretence of criminality in the exclusionary system may thus be seen a fund of encouragement constantly applied or applicable to the oppression of the innocent by the infliction of punishment in all its shapes on persons in whose instance it is groundless and undue on the defendants side in a suit of a nonpenal nature—an excluding rule as often as it has the effect of shutting the door against an article of true and unfallacious evidence necessary to a decision exempting him from the obligation sought by the plaintiff to be imposed upon him evidence sufficient for a decision imposing that obligation having been delivered on the other side operates as a licence for imposing undue obligation in general a licence to oppression by all imaginable wrongs other than on the score of punishment examples exclusion put upon all persons of this or that particular description includes a licence to commit in the presence of any number of persons of that description all imaginable crimes in a law which requires two witnesses for conviction is included a licence to commit in the presence of one single person of any description all crimes and offences whatsoever this licence we shall find constantly granted by roman law and occasionally by english in the former by jurisprudence in the latter by statutes consult your lawyer or your law books note the description of witnesses and a most multifarious and extensive list of them you will find by which were it not for the exclusionary system you transgression would be capable of being made apparent but under which be your transgression what it may you are safe such is the invitation such the encouragement given by the exclusionary principle to dishonest men of all descriptions and mutatis mutandis on either side of the cause if either selfconscious injustice or its chief instruments mendacity and insincerity belong to the category of vice—in the technical system in every country to a certain degree but in england to a most preeminent degree will be found an ever open school of vice—a source of moral corruption pouring itself forth in a copious and uninterrupted stream throughout the mass of the people by example by reward by compulsion by every means possible or imaginable we shall see every man does see it that does not shut his eyes against it this most mischievious of all vices propagated under the shelter of the technical system propagated by the professed and official guardians of the public morals and among the instruments of this disastrous husbandry are to be found some of the most efficient of the evidenceexcluding rules from the above description of the nature of the mischief may be deduced the description of the persons interested in the pushing it up to the highest possible pitch malâ fide suitors on both sides including malefactors of all sorts their accomplices and wellwishers men of law as being the natural allies of malefactors and other malâ fide suitors under the technical system judges and other official as well as professional lawyers professional lawyers under any system exclusion as will be seen is one of the grand engines by the help of which corruption has been enabled to gain its ends and by which arbitrary power with the jus nocendi it enforces has been acquired that faculty the acquisition of which is so delightful to the human heart whether on the particular occasion in question there be or be not a disposition to employ it an engine of power good but how of arbitrary power by means of what has been already described under the name of the doublefountain principle exclusion of evidence barring the few exceptions of which account will be taken is contrary to reason but as often as a judge has recourse to reason he may be pretty sure of having the opinion of nonlawyers on his side establish then the irrational excluding rule you have two fountains from the one or the other of which you draw as on each occasion is agreeable to you would you serve the plaintiff draw from the fountain of reason would you serve the defendant draw from the fountain of the established rule store decisis secure of eulogium either way the ground of it is at your choice adhere to the rule you have the praise of steadiness and superior probity depart from it you have the praise of liberality and superior wisdom adhere to it   0 you have the rigorists for your applauders depart from it you have for the same purpose the liberalists if it be in the nature of the exclusionary rules to save the judge from deception oftener than it leads him into it all this mischief may be found to be made amends for and outweighed whether it be in the nature of such an arrangement to be productive of any such advantage is a question that will be considered in its place chapter iv dicta of judges on the exclusionary system it may be a spectacle not altogether uninteresting to the reader to see a picture of the exclusionary system drawn by the hands of titled and official professors especially should it happen to be a matter of interest to him to consider that were the entire system of jurisprudential law to be represented in the character of hercules this member of it might be considered as his foot ex pede herculem from this one limb no very inadequate conception may be formed of the beauty and proportion of the whole he to whom it may be a matter of interest or curiosity to contemplate it in that character need not fear to find himself in any such perplexity as the employer to whom the architect presented a brick as a sample of a house in the few specimens which the reader will now be enlightened with of the wisdom of english sages he will see at one and the same time how impossible it is to know how anything is and how certain it is that everything is as it should be he will see at one view a specimen of the discernment the security and the consistency which shine forth with perpetual and undiminished lustre from those exalted stations and as in the case of the royal sun of the seventeenth century he may propound to himself for meditation or to his neighbour for debate—of which of this cluster of virtues is the splendour most conspicuous i peake edit   0      lord kenyon c j all questions upon the rules of evidence are of vast importance to all orders and degrees of men our lives our liberty and our property are all concerned in the support of these rules which have been matured by the wisdom of ages and are now revered from their antiquity and the good sense in which they are founded they are not rules depending on technical refinements but upon good sense and the preservation of them is the first duty of judges   term rep p  0  ii peake     the same lord kenyon c j i premise with mentioning what was said by lord mansfield on this subject that the old cases upon the competency of witnesses i e upon the question whether they shall be admitted or not admitted have gone upon very subtle grounds  iii ashhurst j there is so great a contradiction in decisions respecting the boundaries of evidence that i rather choose to give my opinion on the particular circumstances of the case than to lay down any general rule on the subject   term rep p    iv buller j this case involves in it the question which has been so repeatedly agitated in courts of law what objections go to the credit and what to the competency of the witness what objections have the effect of excluding the witness and what objections have no effect at all than which no question is more perplexed ib on the same occasion v grose j the distinction between competency and credit is by no means accurately settled in many of the books the shade between them is so light that the boundaries of either can hardly be perceived i e that it can hardly be known whether the witness is to be admitted or excluded but in all the books which treat of evidence there are certain technical rules laid down which are highly beneficial to the public and ought not to be departed from   term rep p     anno      vi speaking of the question whether in a criminal cause the testimony of a proposed witness having an interest which may be     affected by his testimony in a future contingent civil cause relative to the same transaction shall be admitted—the cases on this point says mr peake are so contradictory that it is impossible to attempt to reconcile them thus far the institutionalist in such provoking colours does the absurdity of this learning sometimes show itself that the most wary and devoted votaries of the jurisprudential thenns are sometimes off their guard observe now what follows in the preface which is always the last part printed of the same really useful and instructive treatise in comparison with which the performances of the two titled institutionalists sound like the drivelings of an old woman in her dotage vii peake preface v the chapter on parol testimony also is in a great measure new for the rules of evidence in this respect have been so much altered and so much light has been thrown on them by decisions that comparatively little is to be collected from ancient books that is satisfactory on the subject it was said by lord mansfield i blac     with that force of expression peculiar to great minds who exercise the right of thinking for themselves before they assent to the authority of others—we do not sit here to take our rules of evidence from siderfin or keble rejecting those cases which were not supported by principles that great judge established a system for his successors to follow and competence and credibility so frequently confounded together are now accurately defined and well understood accurately defined and well understood—these very objects in the decisions concerning which in the declared opinion of one of the noble and learned lords colleagues there was so great a contradiction and at that same time in the opinion of another of those his learned colleagues a degree of perplexity than which a greater is not to be found anywhere such is the sort of matter endeavoured to be passed upon mankind for accurate definition and good understanding by men of law thus it is that as far as they have their wish every intellectual object that comes within the sphere of their activity is defined and understood understood to be what the answer is already given—given and by the same hand—to be what they are so contradictory that it is impossible to attempt to reconcile them the application of the observation has there indeed its limits but whether any such or any other limits to it were necessary the reader will soon be enabled to judge in those seats of learned wisdom what should a man do were his longing ever so anxious to escape from praise we do not sit here to take our rules of evidence from siderfin or keble says lord mansfield and here says the commentator we see the force of expression peculiar to great minds who exercise the right of thinking for themselves but my good lord if not from the decisions of preceding judges as reported by any man whom chance has raised up to report them from whom would you take your rules from your own secret determinations never communicated and impossible to be conformed to because impossible to be known think for yourselves and welcome thinking for yourselves you think for us but at least render it possible for us to know what you think before you ruin us for not having conformed to it chapter v species of exclusion a lot of evidence which one of the parties would wish to see produced fails of being produced whence comes this failure is it that it might have been forthcoming but the law or the judge will not suffer it to be produced in this case the exclusion put upon it may be said to be positive is it that it might have been forthcoming but the law or the judge withholds any of those aids any of those powers coercive or remunerative but more especially coercive which in the case of this or that other article of evidence are not refused which are necessary to its being forthcoming and for want of which it fails of being so in this case the exclusion may be said to be negative supposing the exclusion improper in the former case the injury done is more palpable but in the other is not less real or extensive positive or negative at whose instance is the exclusion put upon the evidence if the person whose evidence is in question be a party in the cause then come the questions—is it at his own instance or at that of a coparty on the same side or at that of the party or if several of a party on the opposite side if he be an extraneous witness then come the questions—is it at the instance of a party on the same side of the cause as that of the party by whom his evidence is or would have been called for or at the instance of the party or a party on the opposite side or at his own instance or at that of a third person a stranger to the cause or in each respective case at the joint instance of two or more such persons by one person the exclusion may be called for on one ground by another on another ground on one ground it may be improper on another not the exclusion put upon the evidence is it put upon it at all events or only in certain events or what comes to the same thing     are there any events in which it may be taken off hence we see another distinction absolute exclusion conditional exclusion by the wonderworking hand of logic conditions are changed into limitations limitations into exceptions improper if absolute the exclusion may by the conditions the limitations the exceptions be brought within the pale of propriety by its tendency to save collateral inconvenience delay expense or vexation of possible conditions the number is infinite distinguished from the herd stand those which respect the existence of other evidence to the same facts in some instances the evidence in question is excluded unless some other evidence is produced likewise exclusion nisi alia or si non alia probatio understood the most common as well as important case is where the other evidence thus made requisite is required to be produced on the same side of the cause exclusion nisi alia ex eodem latere understood of this case an example is presented by the rule of law which requires two witnesses every man is excluded—every man be he who he may unless he comes with another in his hand two propositions are here assumed all men are liars and all judges fools without the second the first we shall see would be insufficient another case is where the evidence thus made requisite is required to have been produced or at any rate to be about to be produced on the opposite or adverse side exclusion nisi alia ex opposito or ex adverso to this head may be referred the exclusion put upon counterevidence in the case where the primary evidence by which the demand for it would have been produced fails itself of being produced if the evidence supposed to have been prepared against the character of testis fails of being produced any evidence that may have been prepared in support of the character of the same witness will naturally be excluded and so in the case of alibi evidence failing on the other side the evidence which supposed the man there you have no need to prove him elsewhere in every case of conditional exclusion a case of absolute exclusion is included by the condition the limitation the exception the case is divided into two cases in one the evidence in question is not excluded in the other it is to the first of the two the discussion concerning the propriety of the exclusion is confined where no condition limitation or exception is spoken of the exclusion must be understood to be absolute in other instances the evidence is excluded if there be other evidence not excluded unless there be other evidence understand of this or that particular description exclusion si alia if the case afford other evidence and that other evidence sufficient and this sufficient and admitted evidence not attended with a mass of collateral inconvenience preponderant over that with which the delivery of the excluded evidence would have come accompanied—the exclusion it is plain can do no harm to this head belongs as we shall see one of the two classes of cases in which the exclusion put upon evidence is proper and justifiable the party whose interest according to his conception would be served by the evidence insists upon it the collateral inconvenience with which it would be attended is not noticed by him or not regarded by him or is perhaps the very and only cause the final cause of the demand he makes of it but by the judge it will be regarded and regarded with other eyes to this head will be found referable kinds of evidence in great masses against which with more or less reason the door is or has been proposed to be shut—  inferior makeshift evidence excluded or proposed to be excluded in consideration of ordinary regular evidence from the same source   ordinary excluded in expectation of superordinary more satisfactory and persuasive evidence from the same or other sources   where the demand for it is created by some other lot of evidence on the same side or on the opposite side of the cause—any sort of evidence excluded viz in the case where the evidence by which had it been produced the demand would have been created fails of being produced so far as the supposition of better evidence is verified the inferior would produce the bad effects of irrelevant evidence so far as the supposition fails of being verified certain misdecision as certain as in cases of deception by bad and false evidence is the result     part ii view of the cases in which exclusion of evidence is proper chapter i general view of the cases in which exclusion is proper of the production of evidence pecuniary expense is an ordinary vexation—in some shape or other in some degree or other an inseparable consequence to warrant the production of any lot of evidence the necessity of it to some one of the other purposes of justice ultimate decision when due on the plaintiffs side ultimate decision when due on the defendants side is an indispensable condition a lot of evidence is proposed to be produced the advantage proposed from the production—is it imaginary—is it outweighed by the inconvenience in either case exclusion is the result the cases then in which exclusion may be proper may be distributed under two grand heads— i to the first head may be referred those in which no mischief at all can result from the exclusion if this be the case it must be either—  because the suit itself is of such a nature that no good can come from it or   because though the part taken by the party by whom the evidence is called for be necessary to justice the evidence in question is not necessary to his making it good the plaintiff being in the right the evidence is not necessary to the establishment of his demand or the defendant being in the right the evidence in question is not necessary to his defence—to the saving him from that burden which the demand seeks to throw upon him to the first of the two divisions belong all those cases in which obtainment of the information sought for is sought for not in the character of a means but in the character of an end where instead of calling for the evidence for the purpose of the suit the suit itself is instituted for no other purpose than that of coming at the evidence coming at the information wanted by demanding it and employing the hand of the judge to extract it by force of law in the character of evidence the suit in this case is what has been called a feigned suit or might better be called a sham or fraudulent suit for the suit itself is real though the object of it be disguised on this occasion however if the exclusion be to be justified it must be understood that the party say the plaintiff has no right on any score to the information called for by him on the score of evidence which is as much as to say that he could not have obtained it by a suit professedly directed to that end for if having a right to it he obtains it like a corollary in mathematics in the form of evidence called for on the occasion of another suit so much the better the business of two suits is done in one two birds are killed with one stone if in prosecuting for one crime or one wrong you get evidence that enables you to punish or compel satisfaction as for another so much the better out of two lots of vexation expense and delay one is saved thus to the man of reason not so to the man of law to him it will be downright cheating—cheating him out of that part of the expense which becomes profit in his hands if of the evidence which the case affords there be any material part behind there wants no other ground for postponing the decision though the suit be a single one but if of the mass of evidence sufficient for warranting a dozen decisions in allowance or disallowance of so many different demands the whole be brought forth on the occasion of one demand—the controversy is as ripe for the dozen decisions in this case as for the single decision in the other but this sort of arithmetic does not accord with the books of the man of law the ends of justice only are served by it  the ends of judicature are sacrificed by it to the other division belong all those cases in which howsoever it happens the information tendered or called for in the character of evidence is not necessary to justice it is irrelevant or though relevant useless because there is enough without it whether from a different source or of a better kind from the same source or whether there be enough without it or no it is still useless because sure to be refuted or outweighed by other evidence in all these cases as in the former if the evidence in question were produced the vexation expense and delay attendant on the production of it would be so much pure mischief unpaid for by any advantage there is     more or less to put in one scale there is nothing to put in the other ii thus much for the first principal head to the other belong all the cases in which there is more or less to put in each of the two scales in the one the mischief from the exclusion of the evidence a mischief in the composition of which misdecision or the danger of it will in general be either the chief or the sole ingredient in the other the mischief from the admission of the evidence a mischief which resolves itself into vexation expense and delay jointly or separately as already so often mentioned in all these cases we may see work more or less for the judge for the legislator none at least if in the drawing of his first lines he has wrought with a skilful hand in every instance there is a question of fact to be tried in no instance need there be ought there to be any question of law understand any new question of law created by the arrangements here proposed to be made relative to exclusion and admission for the question whether a man has a right to the information on any other score than that of evidence evidence in relation to a different suit is indeed professedly a question of law but a question supposed to have been already settled on its proper grounds i first grand and proper head of objection to the admission of the proposed evidence the information is not really wanted as evidence and is such as the party has no right to on any other score or though called for under the notion of its serving as evidence it is not capable of being of any use questions for the consideration of the judge—   has the party a right to call for the information in question by a suit on purpose having that object and no other a question of law but supposed to be already settled   the evidence proposed for delivery is it necessary to justice is it relevant is either party in want of it to either party is it capable of being of use questions which are all of them questions of fact questions upon which no light can be thrown by reference to rules of law deduced or deducible from anything that has been done in any preceding cause if the answer to these several questions be in the negative there is no account to be taken of vexation expense and delay to some amount inconvenience in all these shapes cannot but be attendant on the production of the evidence but as to the quantum it is needless to inquire since for the purpose of the exclusion there is sure to be enough there is nothing to set against it ii second and last grand and proper head of objection to the admission of the proposed evidence the delivery of it is attended with collateral inconvenience in the shape of vexation expense and delay to an amount greater than the advantage derivable from the admission of it that is than the mischief in the shape of danger of misdecision attendant on the exclusion of it questions for the consideration of the judge—   amount of the mischief of misdecision or what comes to the same thing failure of justice for want of decision this depends upon the nature and importance of the cause its nature whether criminal or noncriminal its importance—if criminal measured on the side of the public by the magnitude of the mischief—on the side of the defendant by the magnitude of the punishment if noncriminal measured on both sides by the value of the benefit and burthen at stake taking into account the circumstances influencing sensibility on both sides this will be at any rate a question of fact including or not including questions of law according as the legislator has done or left undone done well or ill the duty of giving a complete catalogue and set of definitions of the several crimes with their respective punishments of the several sorts of rights with the several modes of satisfaction attached to infringement in each case but be there ever so much of law it will be a sort of law the demand for which is to be set down to other accounts and not to this   amount of the danger of misdecision i e of the probability of misdecision considered as liable to result from the exclusion proposed to be put upon the evidence this will at any rate be a pure question of fact under each of these several heads five propositions have presented themselves as true—   that on each of the grounds indicated by these heads cases may arise in which whatever mischief may result from exclusion a greater mischief may arise from nonexclusion a mischief viz in the shape of the vexation expense and delay to which separately or in conjunction it may happen to be inseparable from the admission of the evidence   that between the cases in which the quantities on the one side are the greater and the cases in which the quantities on the other side are the greater the separation is not in general if indeed in any instance so clear as to be capable of serving with advantage as a foundation for any general rules   that therefore it is in all these cases incumbent on the legislative authority to leave or rather to place in the hands of the judicial such a latitude of discretionary power as shall enable it to form the estimate on both     sides and thence to draw the balance in each individual instance on the occasion of each individual suit   that inasmuch as on these grounds general rules cannot to any good purpose be laid down in the way of statute law by the legislature itself—by the only authority avowedly and directly competent at any given point of time and of its own motion and by its own authority to lay down general rules—much less can any such rules be laid down to any good purpose in the way of jurisprudential law by a man exercising under the mask of the judge the authority of the legislator professing obedience when he is exercising power pretending to find readymade—made already by an imaginary being the law the very law which he himself is making at the time   that to obviate this propensity to do by bad means that which on this occasion ought not to be done by any even the best means the legislator ought not to content himself on this occasion either with simply abstaining from tying up the hands of the judge or even with committing to his hands the requisite latitude of discretion in express terms but that it will be further necessary expressly to declare that in no instance shall the judge on forming his decision for the admission or exclusion of the evidence in that individual cause make or admit of any reference to what may have been done by any other judge or even by himself in any preceding cause any more than a jury does in giving damages for a trespass against person or goods for that in these cases the path of precedent is the path of constant error of the absence of the discretionary power here contended for what is the consequence that the chances against right decision will be all along as infinity to one in a word that the decision pronounced will be almost always wrong and mischievous the ground of decision in each case will be not the circumstances of that individual case not the proportions between the quantities in that case but the circumstances of the proportions between the quantities in some other case some other case in which they have but one chance against an infinity of chances for not being different from what they are in the case in hand in a word in a case of this description the looking to precedent for a rule would be exactly as incongruous and mischievous as if on an account between a and b the balance were to be deduced not from a comparison of the sum of the items on one side with the sum of the items on the other but by copying the balance of a former account in which the items as well as the persons were all different an account between c and d in other words and those more familiar to english ears the question as between admission of the evidence on one hand and exclusion on the ground of vexation expense and delay jointly or separately on the other ought in every instance to be treated as a question of fact in no instance as a question of law and accordingly it should be the special care of the legislator by apt prohibitory words to make sure as far as it depends upon him that no question of law shall ever be made of it chapter ii exclusion on the ground of vexation in what cases proper §   modifications of which vexation considered as a ground for excluding evidence is susceptible the idea of vexation judicial vexation is a most extensive one punishment itself—punishment in all its modifications—is but a modification of it vexation is evil any evil produced by the hand of law if with a direct intention ultimate or not ultimate the evil comes under the name of punishment if not with a direct intention whether with or without an indirect intention which is as much as to say with or without a prospect of this result in the character of a consequence of the act of power exercised it then comes under the notion not of punishment but of vexation from the acts done with or without necessity in a course of judicial procedure and in particular from the acts done for the purpose of the obtainment and delivery of evidence—vexation it will be seen is liable to be produced in the breasts of persons of various descriptions implicated habitually or occasionally in the juridical transactions—  parties   witnesses   third persons   the public at large   professional lawyers in the character of assistants to the parties   judges and the official lawyers under them as to the vexation considered as liable to fall upon the parties in the mere character of parties it belongs not to the present purpose but a party whether at his own instance or at that of an adversary or a coparty is liable to be received in the character of a witness received to give information relative to the matters of fact in question just as it might happen to an extraneous witness to do it is in this quality and this alone that any vexation to which it may happen to him to stand exposed is to the purpose here i of vexation by reason of attendance the evil will not in a direct way naturally fall on any other person than the proposed witness in the character of a ground of exclusion it therefore has no place if notwithstanding     the vexation the proposed witness by his own consent freely and fairly obtained delivers or is ready to deliver such his testimony no more has it in the opinion of the judge if a compensation such as in the opinion of the judge is an adequate one be tendered to him and in this case there is nothing which should render the compensation incapable of being rightly estimated more than in a multitude of other cases in which such estimation is performed in every days practice in a remote way it may however happen that the evil of vexation by reason of attendance shall fall on persons other than the proposed witness one example is when in consequence of the evidence of the proposed witness it becomes necessary to the party against whom such evidence makes to oppose it by counterevidence such as otherwise would not have been produced in this case to any vexation pressing on the proposed witness must be added the vexation attached to the delivery of such counterevidence which vexation it being supposed to be of that sort which attaches on attendance will if uncompensated rest on the shoulders of the counterwitness if compensated viz at the expense of the counterparty upon those of the counterparty at whose expense it is compensated another possible example is this—over and above any vexation pressing upon the proposed attendant witness himself by reason of his attendance some vexation some positive loss for example or loss of an opportunity of gain may befall some third person by reason of some connexion which his interest has with the attendance of the proposed witness at another place an inconvenience of this sort will to the extent of it form as substantial an objection to the delivery of the evidence as if the proposed witness were himself the individual suffering under it but in this case the difficulty of proof where the mischief exists will naturally be more considerable as likewise the danger of deception by fallacious evidence where the evil has no real existence in a mass of vexation produced by reason of attendance four branches will in almost every instance be distinguishable four branches producible respectively by the four following causes—   journey out to the seat of judicature viz from the spot or spots at which had it not been for the obligation of the attendance the witness would during the length of time consumed by the attendance have been stationed of this branch of the vexation the weight is of course variable ad infinitum—having no other limits than those of the globe of the earth itself where the distance is considerable this branch of the vexation will naturally be accompanied with the obligation of pecuniary disbursement of which elsewhere under the separate head of expense   attendance in court i e in the presence of the judge by whom the evidence is received during or for the purpose of the delivery of the evidence if the witness being sick in bed the judge for the purpose of receiving his testimony visits him at his bedside his chamber becomes thereby to this purpose a court of justice   demurrage attendance in the neighbourhood of the court for a length of time frequently uncertain—hours days or even weeks—that he may be in readiness to pay his attendance in court when the time comes for the delivery of his evidence   journey home or from the seat of judicature viz to the spot which had it not been for the fulfilling of the obligation thus imposed on him he would at that time have occupied ii vexation by reason of disclosure may fall to the charge of any person or persons to whom it may happen to sustain inconvenience in any shape from the disclosure of any matter of fact capable of being disclosed by delivery of evidence which is as much as to say any sort of fact whatsoever these persons may be—  the proposed witness himself or persons specially connected with him whether in the way of selfregarding interest or of sympathy   other individuals at large   the public at large including the members of the governing body considered in respect of such their public capacity for the different shapes in which vexation in the case of an individual the proposed witness or any other may assume look to the shapes in which injury may display itself corresponding to the possessions in respect to which injury may befall him viz person property reputation condition in life facts from the disclosure of which it may happen to the public at large or to government in respect of the public interest to receive harm may be comprised under the general denomination of state secrets† for the respects in which it may happen to the public at large to experience vexation from this source consult the catalogue of public offences‡     in respect of that branch of the vexation by reason of attendance which consists of attendance in court the witness has as many cosufferers as there are persons of other descriptions on whom the same duty is imposed the aggregate mass increases consequently with the number of these persons among these persons must be distinguished—  the professional assistants so attending for the several parties   the judge or judges so attending with his or their official subordinates §   vexation to the witness or to persons at large in so far as affected by his testimony how far a proper ground of exclusion where the vexation in all shapes taken together that would result from the delivery of the evidence in question constitutes a greater evil than the evil that would result for want of the evidence the evidence in question ought not to be delivered in the opposite case it ought to be delivered and if not about to be delivered without compulsion compelled to determine the preponderance as between the evil the vexation by delivery of the evidence and the evil unjustice or danger of injustice for want of the evidence belongs of course to the legislator in so far as in the situation in which he acts it lies within his power to make such an estimate as shall prove a just one in all individual cases optimus legislator qui minimum judici relinquit in so far as it lies not within the power of the legislator to form any such estimate he ought to invest the judge with the power of forming an estimate for that purpose in each individual case so little can be done in this way with propriety by general rules that the first and fundamental rule should be that which gives the requisite latitude of power to the judge in relation to which the limitations if any which it may be thought proper to apply to that power i e where the legislator thinks fit to take the determination upon himself will come in afterwards as exceptions if the suit itself is instituted for no other purpose than that of procuring the disclosure the disclosure not being intended to be made use of as evidence in any other suit there is not in fact any demand for the disclosure in the character of evidence there is no real suit at least no justlygrounded suit for the purpose of which the disclosure is called for to any such intent as that of its serving in the way of evidence the suit is a feigned suit an attempt to impose unlawful compulsion upon the witness making the judge the instrument of it—making him lend his power in this way to a purpose to which it was not intended either by himself or by the legislator that it should be made subservient in this case the vexation whatever it be has no benefit to weigh against it in the scale—no such benefit as the power of the law applied in the way of judicial procedure was intended to produce let the compulsory process which the judge has the power of applying to a proposed witness for the extraction of his testimony be the sort of torture applied to produce the pretence of unanimity in an english petty jury viz keeping him in a state of imprisonment without meat or drink and so forth let the fact the disclosure of which is thus endeavoured to be obtained be a secret in trade understood or not understood in that character by the proposed witness possessed by some other person a manufacturer and constituting his only source and that an ample source of livelihood were the disclosure compelled and compelled by this means here would be two persons with a distinct injury inflicted upon each on the manufacturer wrongful interception of pecuniary gain equivalent to wrongful imposition of pecuniary loss on the witness unlawful compulsion by fear of corporally afflictive imprisonment just as if the plaintiff had got the witness into a room and there kept him locked up without food and so forth till he discovered what was wanted such would be the consequence if in lending his sanction to contracts thereby adopting them and converting them into so many particular laws the legislator were to include wagers omitting to make an exception in respect of wagers having for their object the giving effect and impunity to the sort of injury just above described two leading cautions present themselves as proper to be submitted to the legislator the first tending to enlarge the sphere of exclusion on this ground—the other to contract it i fancy not that by the regard due to justice you are bound to lay down any such unlimited rule as that on every occasion every man has a right to the testimony of every other man without regard to consequences fiat justitia ruat cælum might lead you to this if as they are but too apt to be the flourishes of orators were to be taken for inviolable rules observe one consequence all secrets then are at an end from all those weaknesses the mischief of which results rather from divulgation than from commission malignity or idle curiosity tears the veil the absolutely immaculate if such there be in the world excepted all reputation is at an end all that illhumour which had it not been dragged forth into the light and air would like embers under ashes have died away in the bosom in which it was kindled—died away without further consequences—all this magazine     of malignant combustibles being dragged forth into the light blazes out and kindles into quarrels from this source of unfathomable mischief states are no more secure than individuals all cabinets all waroffices are laid open the most vulnerable part of each weaker state laid open to each stronger state which whether in a state of actual or only premeditated hostility lies in wait to take advantage of it mischief enough without doubt but by what means producible oh for the means nothing can be more simple they have been invented they have been practised nor yet altogether without success lay a wager would you know the sex of this or that person would you know the use or the uses that he or she has made of it† would you know to what happy exertion of invention your too successful rival owes his present opulence‡ would you for the benefit of your liberal employer on the other side of the frontier line know in what part of it the magazines of your own state are empty in what other quarter such as are full may

high chancellor forces you and your adversary to say you had taken though it is no such thing on pain of seeing justice denied to that one of you to whom it is due ii the opposite caution will not require many more words on the score of vexation do not set down on the side of mischief unless on the side of advantage you set down a sum much greater the certain or contingent result from any disclosure by which it may happen to the witness or anybody else to be subjected whether in the way of satisfaction or even of punishment to any legal obligation or what is the same thing in other words by which the law may come to receive its execution by which the predictions and engagements taken by the substantive branch of the law may come to be fulfilled be the amount what it may all such vexation is overbalanced an assumption to that effect must in every case be made if the vexation be not overbalanced the fault lies in the substantive branch of the law in that part of the law by which the obligation is imposed it is to that branch of the law and that alone that the remedy should be applied the prediction made by the substantive branch of the law should be recalled not disfulfilled the engagement taken by it dissolved and violated to establish as a sufficient reason for the exclusion of the evidence any vexation liable to result from it in this shape is exactly as unreasonable as in an account current it would be to set down on either side a debt already paid and overpaid the tendency of the evidence is it to cause some other debt to be paid which otherwise might not have been paid or of which payment might not otherwise be obtained so cheaply or so speedily so much the better is it to cause some other offence to be punished which otherwise might never have been punished or not so cheaply or so soon so much the better in both cases justice is done in two causes at the expense of one upon the whole then let it be understood that whenever the vexation that might be produced by the delivery or receipt of the evidence in question is stated as affording an adequate reason for the exclusion of it i e as outweighing the mischief that would result from the exclusion of it—viz the misdecision the vexation must be understood to be pure and not having any such counterbalance to it as abovementioned yet it is in the case where it is thus overbalanced that english lawyers make it a matter of pride and glory to carry it to account on the other hand where it has nothing at all to balance it how often shall we not see it left out of the account altogether as if no such mischief were produced take for a feigned case one that till the other day was in part a true one a catholic priest saying mass—that is discharging the indisputable duties of his office—in england     is liable to be hanged delivering his testimony on a dispute about an affair of a few shillings in which he has no concern questions are put to him the answers to which if true will with a force sufficient for conviction prove him to have committed the act thus convected into a crime the vexation that would thus befall him does it constitute a sufficient reason for stopping the mouth either of the witness or his examiner by no means the law which attaches this penalty to the performance of that religious duty so long as it continues on the statutebook must to this as well as every other purpose be taken for a good law and fit and proper to be executed as well upon the ground of this as of any other evidence the law shall be as bad a one as it pleases the reader to suppose it but in whose mouth does it lie to call it so and to seek to defeat it in this way in the mouth of the legislator but in his hands is the power of doing away the mischief of the law not only in this chance and solitary instance but in all instances and for ever how inconsistent and absurd to do away the mischief in retail and in the very selfsame shape leave it to remain in gross in the mouth of the legislator he contradicts himself in the mouth of the judge he contradicts the legislator usurps his power puts himself into his place suppose that—instead of applying the remedy to the really peccant part the substantive branch of the law—the legislator were to be inconsistent enough to determine upon applying it and in the way here in question to the adjective branch—applying it in the shape of an evidenceexcluding rule what shall be the extent of the rule particular or general shall it be particular and stand thus—a catholic priest if called in as a witness in a cause in which he is not a party shall not be compelled to make answer to any questions the answers to which if true would prove him to be such by the supposition this persecution ought to be abolished what does the rule towards the abolition of it shall the exclusion though made to no other end than that of serving as a remedy against the particular sort of tyranny here in question be general and accordingly instead of a catholic priest shall it say a person and instead of the words to be such say to have been guilty of any offence what a price would here be paid for the benefit of this remedy the whole fabric of the law weakened with all the securities that rest upon it and the protection to the innocent religionist no better on this plan than on the foregoing one instead of being the work of the legislature suppose the extension to be the work of the judicial authority on the occasion of some individual suit the judge finding or making a pretence for stopping the disclosures by an individual decision made on the occasion of that individual suit and on the next occasion of the like kind another judge making either out of the decision itself or out of something of a general nature supposed to have been said on that individual occasion a general rule of the additional mischief intimation has just been given insubordination contempt usurpation the confidence of the subject in the legislator shaken disobedience preached by example—by the example of those whose employment profession and peculiar duty it is to exact obedience from everybody else† to the vexation attached as above to the delivery of the testimony when the will the intention to deliver it has been formed must be added for consideration the vexation that may come to be attached to the coercive arrangements which it may be necessary to take for the purpose of causing the will the intention to be formed to this head belong in the case of personal evidence search for the person of the proposed witness entry with or without force into the house land ship or other receptacle for that purpose arrestation detinue conveyance commitment alimentation in the case of real and written evidence—entry as before search as before examination seizure detinue conveyance and in some cases where the source of evidence is a living animal alimentation as before in the case of written evidence examination of books and papers making of transcripts extracts translations abstracts in regard to vexation of this casual and multifarious description two propositions present themselves as expressive of the line of propriety on this ground   in forming a comparative estimate as between the mischief of admission and the mischief of exclusion for the purpose of determining whether the evidence shall be received   0 or excluded—so much of the vexation in whatsoever shape or shapes it presents itself ought to be taken into account as will take place notwithstanding any inclination on the part of the witness including in case of real or written evidence the person on whom the production of the source of evidence depends to yield the evidence   but in this account no vexation ought to be included the necessity for which is produced by the repugnance of the proposed witness he himself being the author of it be it ever so heavy the weight of it can afford no just reason for depriving the party of the benefit of the evidence—of the legal service which is his due as to the provision which it may be necessary and proper to make for the forthcomingness of the evidence considered under its several modifications as above and in the several cases of difficulty that may arise—it belongs rather to the subject of procedure at large than to the subject of evidence the field would be much too wide a one to be inclosed within the limits of the subject now in hand on this part of the ground the utmost that can be done is to give principles propositions fit to appear in terminis though it were not in the character of laws but of mere instructions could not be given without giving also in terminis the laws substantive as well as adjective in modification of which they would have to operate §   vexation to the judge or to any of his subordinates how far a proper ground of exclusion the sort of vexation here in question is that and that alone against which the exclusion of this or that mass of evidence is capable of operating as a remedy the vexation will therefore be of that sort and that sort only which is producible by excess in respect of the quantity of evidence which it has been made incumbent on him to receive and turn in his thoughts to serve as a ground for the decision he is called upon to pronounce in a word vexation having excess of evidence for its cause flowing from this source vexation to the judge has a claim to regard on a double account—  in respect of the feelings of the individual and   in respect of the consequence of it to the cause on his own account and looking no further the feelings of the judge have exactly the same claim neither stronger nor weaker to be considered as those of any other individual in the state considering the matter in this single and abstract point of view it may seem difficult to comprehend how it should happen that if the evidence in question be material a lot of vexation thus narrow in extent should ever swell to such a pitch as to form a ground sufficient in point of reason and utility for the exclusion of it difficult yes but not impossible especially under english law especially considering among how large a number of persons it may happen to the judicial power to be shared say a dozen occasional judges jurymen and one permanent one with from two or three to halfadozen or more subordinate judicial officers these jurymen have all been shut up together for twentyfour hours a case that has sometimes happened value at stake perhaps a hundred thousand pounds—perhaps not a hundreth part as many pence but besides that in this sense of the word material there are degrees of materiality what may happen is that the information proffered in the character of evidence may be irrelevant altogether of which case afterwards in this case there can be no difficulty the service of the judge is in some instances voluntary in others compulsory if voluntary he derives from the office in some shape or other what in his own judgment which is the only competent one is a sufficient recompense but even in this case vexation labour attendance should not be imposed upon him to no use much less where the service is compulsory as in the case of juries and several other cases     what applies as above to the principal applies and for the same reason to all subordinates but in this way when the quantity of the vexation swells to a certain pitch the connexion is most intimate between the personal interest of the judge and the interest of the public at large through the medium of the parties or rather of such one of them as happens to have right on his side from an overload of evidence comes perperplexity from perplexity misdecision if the perplexity be at its maximum an even chance of it probably in every system certainly under the english the instances have been but too numerous in which not to say misdecision decision which to many impartial minds has presented itself as erroneous has been traced up to this source when the hearing of a cause has been drawn out to a length regarded as excessive the principal matter and cause of the excess has generally consisted of the evidence† in causes of certain descriptions to such a pitch has the mischief swelled as to be regarded as a subject of general horror to persons whose situation in the state has threatened them with this species of forced service‡ much in this case will depend upon the modification given in respect of time to this species of service whether de die in diem with or without intervals of repose or the whole to be executed within the compass of one sitting and thence occasionally towards the close of it in a state of imprisonment and slow torture the personal suffering of the judge is not much in danger of passing unheeded nor even unremedied by the judge at least by such person or persons on whom in that commanding station the duration of each attendance depends nor yet has it the less claim to the legislators care since to whatever relief it happens to be assumed or granted in these cases by the subordinate without the observation of the superior it may happen to be either insufficient or excessive but under the system of payment by fees that is under the regular part of the existing system of procedure in most countries vexation to the judge is apt to have an ulterior and much more important claim to notice under this system vexation to judges and their subordinates is expense to suitors changing its shape it transfers its seat at the same time to other shoulders the quantity given on what individual it falls is to the public that is to the aggregate composed of all individuals a matter of indifference the misfortune is that when the seat and shape of vexation is thus changed the quantity of it tends to increase with a velocity plainly infinite in this tendency the final cause of the technical system has already been brought to view on these terms vexation instead of being shrunk from is courted the crown of martyrdom graces the peruke of the judge men of the class of professional lawyers assistants to the parties being under all their varieties and subvarieties men—vexation weighs as heavy on their shoulders as on any other     but vexation to the lawyer is expense to the suitor under the fee system this transformation is undergone by that portion of the vexation which in the first instance alights on the shoulders of the judge under every system by that portion which alights upon the shoulders of the professional lawyer the frequently indispensable and naturally treacherous assistant of the parties but under the fee system the two avalanches being connected from the first roll on and accumulate together pursuing the same object cooperating without any need of concert from the beginning of the game to the end the lawyers of both classes keep playing into each others hands at the cardtable signs and tokens are necessary between the ostensible partners and the latent ones behind their backs no such dangerous intercourse is necessary amongst the partners in the lottery of procedure under any system of payment pecuniary or nonpecuniary by which the interest of the functionary were not placed in a state of opposition to his duty the zeal by which the martyr to professional duty will never cease to be instigated to heap thorns upon thorns on his selfdevoted head will find a constant moderator in the probity the honour and the indolence of the judge under the fee system it finds ostensible checks of which the efficiency is destroyed by spurs not the less sensible for being invisible such being the mischiefs of which vexation from the delivery of evidence is composed or of which it is liable to be productive—such the mischiefs to which exclusion of the evidence presents itself as a remedy—does not the nature of things ever admit any cheaper remedy this will be the subject of inquiry in a separate chapter in which in this point of view the three kindred diseases vexation expense and delay all considered as attached to evidence are considered together in the case of these political as in the case of physiological diseases to find the best remedy we must understand the causes §   arrangements of english law connected with this subject towards this subject what is the aspect of english law the answer may be contained in a line or two or require a volume what on this ground has been done by english law by design nothing but by accident and without thought much more than can here be brought to view by design by design towards such an end how should anything have been done on this subject had anything been done it would have belonged to the system of procedure and except here and there in patches the system of procedure has never been the work of the legislator what has been done has been the work of the judicial authority but to avert vexation is one of the ends of justice and the ends of judicature instead of coinciding have been at variance with those ends vexation is inseparably connected with expense and the ends of judicature have been not to save but for the sake and in proportion to the amount of the profit obtainable from it to embrace every occasion for the augmentation of expense under the head for example of vexation to individuals whether strangers or parties in the character of witnesses—ordinary vexation in respect of journeys to and from attendance and demurrage what on this head has been done by design as already observed nothing by accident more or less—here one thing there another what in this way has been done at all has been done by the limits the topographical limits that have taken place in regard to fields of judicature but in the tracing out these limits nothing of design has had any share boundaries have formed themselves here as boundaries formed themselves after the deluge as shores grew up against seas may it happen to a man to have so many hundred miles to travel for the delivery of his evidence or only so many miles it depends upon the local jurisdiction of the court and thence upon the court in which the cause originated or in which it is to be tried did it originate in westminister hall three hundred and upwards may be the number of miles in a court of quartersessions for the county of rutland for example not so many as twenty miles three hundred and upwards or only twenty—if the delivery of the evidence be altogether free as well as voluntary there is no vexation in the case if obligatory then it is that vexation mixes with it delivery of testimony is it obligatory yes and no yes in a hundred cases no in a hundred others to give a picture of the law on this one head that is of the clouds of uncertainty in which it is involved would require a volume   in causes noncriminal obligatory at one stage unobligatory at another obligatory if the persons capable of yielding testimony are known unobligatory for want of their being known   in criminal causes—in felonies obligatory obligatory as well at the first stage as afterwards   in misdemeanours if prosecuted by indictment—obligatory if known and living within the jurisdiction of the court unless to avoid the vexation their device be to travel a few miles or as many steps to escape from it unobligatory for want of their being known unless some justice     of the peace under the spur of that zeal which has become a monopoly in the hands of unlearned judges acting by custom without which is as much as to say against law has by the terrors of undefined and uncognizable authority contrived to wring the secret from the reluctant breast   in the same misdemeanours if prosecuted by information—but here however abruptly the theme must end   then again comes the tweed think you that a judge standing on one side of that river speaking to a witness on the other could command his evidence no more than if it were the styx   is it again for plaintiff or for defendant that a mans testimony is needed here comes another ocean of distinctions and deficiences fancy not that because a mans evidence is necessary to save your life from unjust punishment you can have unless it be here and there by accident any better security for it than that humanity which if it be to be found in individual bosoms is not to be found in the bosom of the law† the best method of supplying all these deficiences belongs to the science of judicial procedure at large in the existing system how was it possible they should have been supplied to have supplied them the objects of its regard must have been the ends of justice on the score of the vexation of which the disclosure would be productive to the individual whose condition in life was the subject of inquiry—the party calling for the disclosure having no other interest in it than what he had taken upon himself to give to himself by laying a wager and when consequently there is no gain to justice to out weigh the vexation thus produced—the court of kings bench with indisputable propriety forbade the extraction of the evidence on the score of vexation to the public at large by the disclosure of facts comprisable under the denomination of secrets of state no decision appears to have been ever pronounced why because no known case ever presented itself in which a decision to that effect was called for on that ground in this instance as in every other it depends upon chance to open the mouth of jurisprudence‡ in both houses of parliament exclusions are in every days practice put on this ground upon communications that otherwise would be made where the vexation in question is outweighed outweighed by the profit to justice attendant on the execution given to some article or other of the substantive branch of the law in this case the exclusion put upon evidence the allowance given to the plea of vexation in the character of a ground or justificative cause of such exclusion will be found under the head of cases where exclusion on the score of vexation is improper and the allowance ranked among the errors by which english jurisprudence is defiled chapter iii exclusion on the ground of expense in what cases proper of the category of expense though the mischief of it be but a modification of that of vexation a separate consideration requires to be made there are but two cases in which expense expense attendant on the delivery of evidence is capable of forming a rational and legitimate ground for the exclusion of that same evidence one is the case in which not being defrayed by the party by whom it is called for it must if delivered at all which is as much as to say not excluded fall without compensation upon some third person the other is where though it were to fall upon that     one of the parties who is in the wrong the quantity of vexation attendant on it in his instance would be too great to be defensible on the score of punishment in each of these cases supposing them really exemplified the propriety of the exclusion presents itself as unquestionable the load of rubbish has been improperly deposited as before penalty five shillings for the mere purpose of levying this penalty would you put an innocent bystander to an expense of two voyages between london and the east indies would you even subject the delinquent himself to any such expense all reason therefore for exclusion on the ground of expense is taken away—all reason and all pretence when any person who conceives himself to have need of the evidence takes upon himself the expense but evidence and evidence the delivery of which would be attended with considerable expense exists on both sides on one side there exists ability as well as desire to defray the expense of his own evidence on the other side there exists inclination only ability not what in this case is to be done the knot is a gordian one what presents itself as capable of being done towards untying or cutting it will be found under another head expense is to be considered at two periods   when the disbursement is to be made or at any rate undertaken for   at the conclusion of the cause when the time comes for definitive justice to be done even though in the rubbish case the expense of fetching over the witness from the east indies should have been defrayed by the plaintiff in the first instance would you in case of conviction saddle the defendant guilty as he is with the burthen of reimbursing this expense no verily if guided by the rules of humanity and rational justice yes if guided by principles such as those of english law whether a man shall have his costs or not—whether the party who prevails shall receive reimbursement at the expense of the loser depends upon a thousand capricious and inconsistent rules but it is only in here and there an instance that this rembursement is refused on the ground of the excess of the burthen imposed on the loser in comparison with the value of the benefit pursued it remains to bring to view what has been done by english law under this head as it is with vexation at large so is it with that particular modification of it which is produced by forced expense by the same causes by the same accidents by which bounds have been set to the vexation by reason of attendance bounds are also set to the expense i speak of the expense of journeys to and from and demurrage in the neighbourhood of the seat of judicature items which when added to the fees of the persons employed in the collection of the evidence compose in general wherever the evidence is delivered vivâ voce the whole or nearly the whole of the expense attending it by these bounds—the bounds by which the territorial field of jurisdiction of the court stands limited—limits are thus far set to the expense to which the party or any other person shall be subjected by reason of the expense of the journey in the instance of any one witness from beyond these bounds no man can for that purpose be obliged to come and therefore unless by the consent of a willing witness no mass of expense exceeding the expense of such longest journey can be imposed upon any one who is not disposed to bear it every witness and thence the testimony of every witness who were his testimony to be delivered would have to come from the greater distance stands negatively excluded i e it is not compellable thus much then is done is actually done though without design in english law viz by general arrangements towards the limitation of the expense of evidence but in no instance is any exclusion put upon a lot of evidence on the mere ground of the inordinateness of expense understand of the mass of expense of which the delivery of the evidence would be productive in that individual cause in the first instance each party bears of course the burthen of that part of the aggregate mass of expense which consists in the money disbursed by himself on the occasion of whatever steps he takes in the institution and prosecution of his own claim—claim on the part of the plaintiff to see the obligation imposed upon the defendant—on the part of the defendant to see himself exonerated from it when the cause has received its ultimate decision in any court then comes the question whether by him who in that court has gained the cause anything and what shall be received from the losing party on the score of satisfaction for the disbursements made by him deficiency inconsistency uncertainty all at the highest pitch are the result of those learned labours the picture of which fills a volume of near seven hundred pages to a set of arrangements on such a subject would it be possible to give the opposite qualities in so large a compass scarcely—in a twentieth part of it with ease in regard to the plaintiff one question is whether he be king or no for if the suit he called a criminal one the plaintiff is king     whatever else he may be in this case the answer is clear be the suit ever so unjust and the expense which the innocent defendant has been put to in defending himself against it ever so heavy he receives no indemnity for the power of heaping oppression in this way on innocent men in the character of defendants is among the kings prerogatives therefore to prove that an innocent defendant ought to be thus oppressed you want no other postulate than that johnanokes is king than which nothing is more easy after which you may write q e d the rule is indeed scrawled over by exceptions yet not so but that the ground predominates again be the delinquency of the defendant ever so enormous the expense of prosecution ever so great reimbursement is not to be thought of why not because to receive money under the name of costs is beneath the royal dignity call it costs he disdains to receive it back though he is so much out of pocket that is the law servants of the real king disdain to see either their royal master receive it or the johnanokes who really disbursed the money and whom they have set a strutting under the kings name call it costs he disdains receiving it though it be a hundred pounds it is frequently much more call it a fine he is ready to pocket it though it be a shilling the elephant disdains the cannon but is ready to pick up the pin rendered splendid by this its destination many a shilling bating official clipping finds its way and by itself into the real and royal privy purse† indications may be found to show that in england lawyers have had it in their heads to set bounds to the excess of vexation and expense in their heads at times yes in their hearts scarce ever bounds to the excess of vexation and expense from all causes put together natural and fictitious yes not to this an article of natural expense taken by itself under the direction of lawyers statute law has in some instances interposed in some such view but how by refusing to the party injured the reimbursement of his share of the costs of suit and thereby doing much more than refusing him any redress at all for the injury where the value of the injury is judged not to exceed a certain amount‡ and what amount a sum which if annual would have constituted an independent provision for a parliamentary elector but in this case no separate account is taken of that part of the expense which is occasioned by the production of evidence not to speak of what may have been occasioned by the production of this or that particular article of evidence in the equity courts jurisprudential law has explained itself in the same way for any sum below a certain amount no redress is given in these courts why because it would be beneath their dignity and to what     amount £ 0 a sum in those days equal at least to the expense of two years subsistence of an average individual of any of those classes of which ninetenths of the body of the people are composed outlawry was thus pronounced upon the great body of the people outlawry and to what end to maintain the dignity of the judge the dignity of an equity judge consists in what in refusing to do justice dignity forsooth what has dignity to do in this case the fees on the less valuable would they have been worth less than the fees to the same amount on the more valuable cause—would vespasian had found them beneath his dignity but pride in these instances blinded the eyes of avarice humanity no such motive was so much as dreamed of at common law to a cause in which it is settled that either nothing shall be given to the plaintiff or if anything one shilling a more than ordinary degree of importance is not unfrequently ascribed and the question in dispute argued with great ceremony so different on the head of dignity are the notions that prevail on the one side and on the other side of a twelvefoot passage suppose any reason grounded in utility for the denial of justice in all pecuniary demands under £ 0 and conceive what a character you are giving of an equity suit think of the virulence of that disease to which in the judgment of the inoculators denial of justice and in a great majority of the cases that would otherwise have occurred is an eligible remedy along with the vexation the expense of evidence has in the same lumping style undergone a remedy by exclusion in another way viz by barring it out chapter iv exclusion on the ground of delay in what cases proper a lot of evidence being proposed—the delay in question in the character of a ground of exclusion is that which might in some cases happen to be produced by a determination to give admission to that evidence the question for decision then is—of the two mischiefs the two opposite and as it were rival mischiefs and injustices which is the greater—the injustice attached to the misdecision or danger of misdecision that would be produced by the exclusion of the evidence or the collateral injustice attached to the quantum of delay of extra delay it must here be understood that must be incurred if antecedently to the decision that quantity of time be allowed which is understood to be necessary to the production of the evidence were all the material evidence forthcoming     which the case has happened to furnish a decision might be pronounced tomorrow but of this existing and obtainable stock a part more or less material exists at the antipodes shall the decision wait till a correspondence can be had with the antipodes for that purpose the cause having but one party on each side—the cause being in that respect and in that sense a simple one—the proposition for the exclusion if any such proposition come at all must come either from the party who conceives himself to stand in need of the evidence say the plaintiff or from the opposite party from the party whose wish it is to see the evidence delivered no such proposition can come since he has but to forbear calling for the evidence and the exclusion thus attaches upon it silently and of course if in this simple case a demand be made for an exclusion to be put upon the evidence—a demand having for its ground the delay that would be necessary for the production of it—it is from the opposite side say the defendants that the demand must come for anything i know the evidence alleged by the plaintiff to exist may or may not exist the effect of it if produced may or may not be more or less material more or less necessary more or less conclusive but the case is such that if the decision be not passed till the requisite time has been taken for the arrival of the evidence added to what notice may be to be taken of it the mischief resulting to us from that delay will be greater than the mischief resulting to the plaintiff from the disallowance of his claim at any rate than whatever chance of such miscarriage may be the result of the nonproduction of that evidence reverse the case the mischief of the delay will be more sensible it is the defendant that applies for the delay to save the exclusion the negative sort of exclusion that for want of it would be put upon the evidence he has to produce no says the plaintiff—the mischief from this delay would on my side be so great that in consideration of it my petition is that the cause may go on in its natural course—that the delay prayed for may be refused although of such refusal the sure consequence will be that an exclusion will thus be put upon the article of evidence again let the cause be a complex one—complex in respect of its affording divers parties say five on a side and first say on the plaintiffs one plaintiff applies for the delay as necessary to the delivery of the evidence the other plaintiff opposes the delay in other words applies for the exclusion the evidence not being in his view of the matter worth the purchase to the present purpose this third case differs from the first only in name the parties stand on the same side of the cause but on this point at any rate their interests are opposite the plaintiff by whom the application for delay is opposed is to this purpose as against his coplaintiff a defendant the two quantities here compared with one another being both of them in their nature susceptible of variation upon a scale of almost indefinite length—on the one hand the materiality the probative force of the evidence on the other hand the duration of the delay the ratio of each to the other is of course susceptible of variation upon a correspondent scale if however as will frequently be the case the evidence in question be indispensably necessary to warrant a decision on that side—the mischief of mere delay that is mere postponement of the decision on one side of other abstraction made of the contingent mischiefs with which it may happen to it to be pregnant viz on the one side deperition of the matter of satisfaction on the other side deperition of counter evidence can seldom be equal to the mischief of the exclusion from the exclusion of the evidence results in this case by the supposition and that as a necessary consequence misdecision to the prejudice of that same side and the mischief resulting from that misdecision perpetual and irremediable whereas from delay considered in respect of that part of its mischief which is certain no worse effect ensues than the temporary duration of that same mischief which in case of exclusion is perpetual in respect of the evidence the supposed temporary absence of which produces the demand for the delay—what are the expectations entertained by the plaintiff or the defendant if the delay be prayed for on his side and what the grounds of them what assurance has he that the witness cannot now be forthcoming that he will be forthcoming within any reasonable space of time that he knows anything about the matter and that what he knows will if truly reported by him operate to the effect alleged and with a sufficiently persuasive force all these questions together constitute a sort of incidental cause collateral indeed to the principal cause but sometimes not inferior to it in importance because the main cause itself may altogether turn upon it all these questions with others that might be added constitute a complex question—a question of fact which like any other question of fact must be tried by the light of its own evidence—of such evidence as it happens to afford direct evidence circumstantial evidence the evidence of the prosecutor if necessary the evidence of any other individual as it may happen the witness understand he in whose absence the demand for delay originates was an inmate of the owner of the goods taken in the way of theft or robbery—he was in the house at     the time he was a lodger in the house of the individual killed and of whose murder the defendant stands accused—he was in the house at the time or came in soon afterwards the question whether the alleged witness was in a situation that would qualify him to give evidence is a question of fact to be tried like any other question of fact upon its own evidence does the main cause turn upon it it is a question that requires to be examined into with the same care and therefore with the assistance of the same securities for trustworthiness as those which are looked upon as indispensable to the principal cause between delay for the sake of evidence on the one hand and exclusion of the evidence for want of the requsite delay on the other the connexion will after all it carefully and honestly looked into he found like so many other of the evils with which the system of procedure is pregnant in a much greater degree factitious than real such will be the result presented by the chapter the business of which is to bring to view the arrangements capable of serving in lieu of absolute exclusion in the character of remedies to vexation expense and delay† the strongest case in favour of the exclusion is where imprisonment itself tantamount in vexation to a severe punishment is the lot of the defendant during the coutinuance of the delay here then is punishment—a perfectly distinct and incontestable lot of punishment inflicted inflicted where perhaps it is undue and at any rate before it is proved to be due in this case however there is an evident medium between the continuance of this perhaps unjust punishment and exclusion of the evidence—whence acquittal from all punishment bail him if he can find bail if he cannot it will in general be a further presumption of delinquency if no bail take other securities for appearance of which many might be enumerated if the present were a fit place for it in default of all such securities discharge him out of prison even without security but liberation from prison is one thing—definitive acquittal is another—because the plea is sufficient when applied to the one it follows not that it must be so when applied to the other at any rate the question it will be seen turns still upon proportions the perhaps altogether undue or excessive vexation being a determinate quantity the proportion will depend upon the quantity of the delay admitting it to be better that a delinquent should go unpunished than that a punishment should remain hanging over his head for years—it follows not that the proposition would be true if instead of years a man were to say days or weeks all this while an argument that pleads against the delay and therefore in favour of the exclusion ought not to be lost sight of the evidence if produced will tend to conviction will operate in disfavour of the defendant a result this of which the probability at least must be assumed to justify the delay with the vexation thus attached to it but the supposed probability on what is the persuasion of it grounded it is on the part of the plaintiff that the evidence is called for a considerable presumption this but by no means a conclusive one expecting to see the defendant proved guilty expecting to find the guilt established by this evidence he applies accordingly for the delay necessary to the obtainment of this evidence on this supposition indeed it is a matter scarcely to be apprehended that it would be the endeavour or wish of the plaintiff to extend the quantity of delay for the purpose of vexation—to extend it beyond the exigency of the case for the longer the delay continues the longer the manifest object of the prosecution the natural wish on the part of the plaintiff continues unaccomplished so much for ordinary probability but a case neither improbable nor perhaps altogether without example is this—the plaintiff has no expectation that the evidence he applies for will operate to the conviction of the accused he entertains no such persuasion or suspicion as that the accused is really guilty of the crime the object the real object of the application for delay is not justice but vexation the vexation of an individual of whose innocence the accuser himself is conscious the case is a possible one though if examples of it were to be looked for happily for mankind they would be found i believe extremely rare but the case where on the part of the plaintiff an illgrounded but sincere persuasion of the defendants guilt or an exaggerated estimation of it has been productive of an illgrounded prosecution is much less rare on the ground of that one of the evils opposite to the ends of justice which we are now considering—in so far as evidence i e an extra quantity of delay considered as being necessary to the production of it is the cause of the disease and exclusion proposable as the cure—english law however heedless is not quite so impotent as on the ground of either of the two preceding ones     delay oh yes of that there is no want but for exclusion to be put upon evidence for the avoidance of preponderant delay no tokens of any provision—no token of so much as a thought to the allegations on both sides in general terms respecting the general matters of fact on which depend the propriety or impropriety of excluding an article of evidence to save the delay that would be necessary to the production of it the ears of the courts are open but as to any tolerable security for the truth of these allegations on this occasion as on all others learned judges know better than to suffer themselves ever to receive it between every two operations needful or needless a determinate length of delay being fixed by general rules—a length in most instances too great in here and there an instance too scanty—where on the ground of the impracticability of causing the evidence to be forthcoming at the regular time coupled with the probability of obtaining it at a more distant period of time a further length of time is or is pretended to be needful a special application is made to the court for this indulgence in this case if the materiality of the article of evidence in question be out of dispute and yet the demand of the delay be resisted the consequence of such resistance if successful is a virtual exclusion put upon the evidence and this on the score of delay i e of the undue delay that would be the necessary result if the lot of evidence in question were to be received it is in this way and this way alone that on the ground of delay i e of the mischief that may come to be the result of it any exclusion can be put upon any article of evidence the question here concerned is of the number of those incidental questions on which the fate of the cause is liable to be completely dependent as completely as upon any evidence respecting the principal matter in dispute for the truth correctness and completeness of the evidence on which the decision of this incidental point is founded there is in every such case exactly the same demand for the best security that can be afforded whatever that security may be as for the correctness and completeness of the evidence respecting the principal matter in dispute note that independently of all ultimate loss by deperition of evidence or of the matter of satisfaction mere delay may to a malâ fide defendant be productive of certain gain at the expense of an injured plaintiff to an amount to which there is no certain limit sum in dispute £ 0000 trial staved off till next assizes six months distant interest at five per cent sure profit £  0 deducting only the expense of the business thus made as the reward to the law partnership for their service the price of the delay thus manufactured for grounding an application for delay on the score of the absence of a material witness forms every day in use are given in the books of practice the testimony of a witness a single witness is sufficient delivered in the affidavit mode thus far nothing particular learned judges as above mentioned never suffering themselves to receive testimony in any but this worst of shapes but the evidence received in this bad shape is hearsay evidence supposed declarations supposed to have been made extrajudicially and even by persons undesignated—by the common voucher the french on this supposed testimony thus transmitted to the court through the pen of the affidavitmans attorney when the immediate testimony of these supposed extrajudiciallyspeaking witnesses might for anything that appears have been obtained—obtained with as little trouble and without the expense and unless opposed on the other side opposed by testimony which so far as the mode of delivery at least is concerned cannot be of any better complexion the evidence is conclusive† observe the form stated as being in common use in the kings bench‡   the deponent as he is advised and believes cannot safely proceed to the trial    without the testimony of the proposed witness no averment even in the way of opinion in general terms that he can safely proceed with such testimony—that he has any just ground to stand upon   in consequence of the notice of trial    he this deponent caused inquiry to be made c stating says the form the nature and result of the inquiry made after the witness and the time when he is likely to attend here we see hearsay evidence of the second remove the persons inquired of if any such there were not upon oath not judicially examined nor even without examination judicially deposing the supposed inquirer again in the same case such is the sort of evidence which if the statement be correct is habitually received   0 and unless victoriously opposed by counterevidence habitually acted upon as conclusive by the kings bench the common pleas seems not much more nice the following extracts are from a learned practiser in that court who does not express indeed that it is exclusively or more frequently in use in that court than in the kings bench here divers particulars respecting the nature and result of the inquiry as above are given    he this deponent no intermediate inquirer here hath been not said when to the house of the said p w the proposed witness and was informed not said by whom that he was gone to norwich not said when and that he this deponent hath sent there not said whom nor when for the purpose of subpœnaing him but that the said p w is gone from thence as this deponent hath heard not said from whom and verily believes to be true and that he this deponent cannot get any information where the said p w is but is informed not said by whom or when or where nor that he so much as believes the information to be true that he will be at home in two months     can any danger attend the attempt successful or unsuccessful to stave off a just demand for an indefinite length of time or for ever by false representations thus conveyed the application may it is true be opposed but with what effect not a question can the opponent the plaintiff put to any one in this chain of witness it may be a complete tissue of lies and nothing can he do that can contribute to the detection of any one of them the defendants attorney being the deponent his client may have posted persons to give such false answers or statements not that it is worth the while or the like friendly deception may have been put by the attorney upon the defendant his client the least unpromising course seems to be to follow the precedent of the ingenious attorney who to combat the forged bond forged the release the plaintiff makes a counteraffidavit saying nothing of the defendants story for be it ever so false what can he say of it to any purpose but telling a like story of his own showing how he has an equally material witness now forthcoming but whose testimony were the required delay granted would be lost if to a dishonest defence success may thus be given defeat to a just demand—so on the other hand may defeat be given to a just defence success to an unjust demand by the same system of—what shall we say inquiry where not a question can be put say at any rate receipt of evidence affidavit† that a b and c d are material witnesses for defendant in this cause without whose evidence defendant cannot safely proceed to trial as defendant is advised and verily believes was held bad because the belief seemed to go through the whole as well to a b and c d being material witnesses as to the other necessary part of the affidavit that the party cannot safely make defence without their testimony the former part respecting a b and c d being material witnesses ought to be positively sworn belief as to it is not sufficient but as to the latter part it is held bad—and certainly not without something like a pretext at any rate possibly in the way above suggested evasion was designed but possibly and much more probably not but to what use pretend to stop up this loophole when so many doors are left wide open in so many other places to the materiality of the evidence belief not sufficient positive swearing necessary precious distinction as if anything could ever be sworn to howsoever positively but belief as if the materiality of an article of evidence were not a matter of opinion and not only of opinion but for so it has been made by lawyers a matter of law what an indignation was once manifested at the presumption of a deponent who took upon him to swear the law ignorant and presumptuous man to pretend to know the law held bad and what was the consequence was the cause called on without the defendants material and if his statement were true necessary witness and was the subjecting him to the obligation of complying with an unjust demand the ultimate result let us hope rather though it is not said that the badness of the expression was not so fatal but that opportunity was given to amend it viz by ulterior affidavits but the badness the real badness where is it not in the suitors justly and unjustly suspected of evasion but in the practice of the court by which questions are never tried but upon evidence so bad as to afford to insincerity a perpetual chance of success without the smallest danger of punishment or even of shame suppose the maker of this bad affidavit present in court answering upon oath impromptu instead of having employed as many days as he thought fit in studying means of evasion with his attorney at his elbow a word or two in the way of question half a minute in the way of time and the ambiguity would have vanished a case must not be omitted—a case of prodigious extent in the field of law—in     which no competition takes place between the mischief of delay and the mischief of exclusion but the delay with or without design taking place the exclusion follows without remedy—follows by act of law it results from the principle of fixed times with long intervals the time for the trial is come it has been fixed as it is of course by a blind rule a witness or an article of written evidence that was to have been produced fails of being produced a few days hours or minutes more the evidence would have been produced but the time is past it therefore cannot be produced in the first place suppose the failure on the plaintiffs side what is the consequence misdecision to the prejudice of that side to the plaintiff loss of the right in respect of punishment to the malefactor whatever may have been his guilt impunity temporary or ultimate according to circumstances in this case the exclusion of the evidence that is the nonforthcomingness of it for want of the delay may have been designed or undesigned the work of man or the work of adverse fortune but the mischief resulting from it the misdecision is the work exclusively the work of the man of law the work of the technical system with its fixed days and excessive intervals considered in respect of its duration the exclusion may be distinguished into two periods the first is not the work of the man of law his is not the blame accident or unlicensed misbehaviour is the cause but the second is his altogether a slight evil he sees produced without his participation this does not satisfy him but upon the mere ground of this slight evil he inflicts another—in all cases a much greater in some cases an infinitely greater evil of the same kind at the preappointed time the evidence is not forthcoming what in point of reason and justice is the practical result appoint for the production of it the earliest open day in which according to probability it can be forthcoming no says the man of law to himself no purpose of mine will be answered at this rate in cases not criminal i e where be the case what it may the species of suit belongs to that class if it be on the plaintiffs side that the failure takes place the mischief is not irreparable it depends upon him to suffer a nonsuit and proceed anew paying costs whereupon at the end of six or twelve months from that time and at the expense of three or four or five score pounds if the evidence has not perished in the meantime he may take another chance if it be on the defendants side it may perhaps be allowed to him to take such other chance but it depends not upon himself and it must be at an increased expense on the trial in question the verdict must be against him—he in general paying the costs on both sides—and if he obtains the felicity of a new trial it cannot be till after motion and argument thereupon in criminal cases opens a very different scene if it be on the defendants side that the failure takes place it seems rather difficult to pronounce in every case what may be the result on an application made on the ground in question on that side power for putting off the cause is not wanting and in each instance the great probability seems to be that the judge being satisfied of the propriety of the application due time would accordingly be given it is where the plaintiffs is the side on which the failure takes place that the prejudice applies and the mischief flows in consequence breaking out on this side no mischief is ever to be repaired and this is called humanity and justice at the preappointed hour a witness who should have appeared fails to appear an article of written evidence which should have been produced fails of being produced had the failure been foreseen application for time might have been made and time granted accordingly the failure not having been foreseen not having been foreseeable no time is to be granted the omission is fatal the malefactor triumphs behold here another exemplification of the practice of deciding and against the merits on grounds foreign to the merits behold here again the power of pardon thrown out of the window like medals on a coronation day to any one that will take it up to any witness whose testimony is necessary to the possessor for the time being of any piece of paper the production of which is necessary to any one who by fraud or force discoverable or undiscoverable will manage so as to keep the man or the piece of paper out of the way for a few minutes all this is in favorem vitæ no mans life shall be put twice in jeopardy hypocrites say why is mans life ever put once in jeopardy did ye ever could ye ever give any better reason for your human sacrifices than used to be given in mexico and is now given in new zealand because it is what we do and have been used to do for so many hundred years but the same hypocrisy reigns where there is no life in jeopardy on the continent non     bis in idem is moreover a maxim of romebred law a maxim made indeed of stretching stuff like all maxims of all lawyers the malefactor in whose instance the witness or the bearer of a paper has fallen sick or been drowned or been made drunk and so forgotten himself—how much less guilty is he than if the man had come to his time if the chance of triumph must be secured to every malefactor let it at any rate be a fair chance let fortune judge not fraud in fortunes name admit dice and boxes among the furniture of the temple of justice but let the dice be fair the boxes fairly handled no loading or cogging as at present chapter v exclusion of irrelevant evidence proper of the mischief liable to result from the admission of irrelevant evidence no separate mention need be made be it what it may it is resolvable in toto into the mischief producible by vexation expense and delay the difference between the ground of exclusion in the present case and in those others consists in this—in those three cases i e in every case where the evidence is not irrelevant there is an option to make—there is a quantity of mischief a weight in each scale there is something to lose by the proposed exclusion—a chance in favour of justice there is a disadvantage that must be incurred by the proposed exclusion—a probability in favour of misdecision or perhaps a certainty but in this case in the case where the information proposed to be delivered in the character of evidence is irrelevant there is nothing that can be lost by the proposed exclusion not the least danger of misdecision is incurred by it in this case then the inquiry is much more simple than in any one of those three others there there are two quantities to weigh two values to find here but one suppose the proposed evidence irrelevant exclusion is the indisputable consequence irrelevant evidence is evidence that bears no efficient relation to the fact which it is brought to prove evidence which proves nothing as well might one say no evidence fit unquestionably fit to be excluded but to what purpose speak of it who is there to whom it could occur to propose the admission of any discourse coming under this description who is there whose purpose could in any way be served by it to a party plaintiff or defendant acting in bonâ fide—believing himself to have right on his side and seeking nothing but the means of proving it—there can be but one inducement for the demanding or delivering irrelevant evidence viz the belief of its being relevant add material and needful without which the relevancy of it would not help him false conceptions on this head are far from being unfrequent conceptions which whatever ground there may have been for them in opinion prove false in the result by the force of prejudice in a weak judgment in a disorderly imagination there is no saying what reverie may not be presented in the character of a lot of evidence if every such supposed or pretended article of information were liable to be obtruded upon the judge and in any quantity at the instance and at the pleasure of either party and of each party no power of exclusion on this ground being left to the judge—it is easy to conceive how completely in any cause the justice of the case might by this means be overwhelmed prosecution for witchcraft oral evidence in support of the charge on the part of the defendant no direct evidence but the general proposition the alleged improbability of the fact in the character of circumstantial evidence in reply on the part of the plaintiff to prove the probability glanvilles history of witchcraft or any other article of the demonological library proffered in evidence upon this invitation shall it be the duty of the judge to take up the book on the spot and previously to his giving his decision in the cause to read it from beginning to end and so on with regard to every other article in that same library if not and if he should not think fit to read it his reason for rejecting it would naturally be founded on some such ground as what is expressed by the abovementioned clause in a reasonable mind he would say it does not appear to me that the contents of this book are of a nature to contribute anything or at least anything worth regarding toward the forming a persuasion affirming the existence of the alleged acts of witchcraft charged by the plaintiff to have been committed by the defendant to a party acting in malâ fide the inducements constant and casual together are equally obvious we have seen the mischiefs liable to result to the party in the right from excessive loads of matter relevant or irrelevant thrown upon the mind of the judge perplexity deception misdecision we have seen the mischief in the shape of vexation expense and delay capable of being drawn down from the same source upon the party who has right upon his side so many mischiefs so many inducements in the eyes of a malicious and unscrupulous adversary the following are natural exemplifications of irrelevant evidence—       be the suit criminal or noncriminal evidence against tertius is relevant or irrelevant as against reus according as participation is or is not brought home to him will it be so or not sometimes it will not be to be known till the whole of it has been gone through sometimes the fact of the participation may be proved or disproved in the first instance the line of conduct by which a burthen a legal obligation criminal or noncriminal is or ought to be imposed upon tertius is we shall say a chain of acts the connexion of which with the conduct of reus may be proved by some act antecedent to the very first link subsequent to the last or in concomitancy with any intermediate one an example of the firstmentioned case an order of the next an act of confirmation of the last extrajudicial discourse of a confessorial nature in the way of conversation acknowledging participation by any of those modes of behaviour which in a criminal case denominate a man an accessary whether before the fact or after the fact what may have happened is that though reus was in confederacy all along with tertius and though evidence sufficient for the proof of the confederacy exists and can be produced yet the nature of it cannot be understood till after the part acted by tertius has been brought to view in all these cases prove participation upon reus everything that has been done by tertius is material all evidence which contributes to proof of it is relevant if no such participation be proved all that was done by tertius is with regard to reus immaterial all the evidence of it irrelevant if as in case of an order or formal act of ratification it be agreed or established that no proof of participation no other proof can be given than what is distinctly separate from the evidence of the principal course of action if at the same time the proof of the act of participation be short that of the principal course of action long the proof or what is given for proof of the act of participation should come first why because failing this proof evidence of the principal course of action falls into the category of irrelevant evidence and the suit should of course be rid of it what has been done by english law in relation to irrelevant evidence distributes itself naturally under two heads what has been done for the exclusion of irrelevant matter and what has been done for the accumulation of it first as to the exclusion of it in this respect much depends upon the words in which the evidence is collected   collected vivâ voce coram judice et partibus all irrelevant matter everything that appears to wander from the point is nipped in the bud accordingly to the extent in which this mode including its submodifications is employed irrelevancy in the character of a source of vexation expense and delay is scarce known exclusion takes place instanter and no mischief is produced on either side none by the exclusion because what is excluded is of no use none by the irrelevant evidence because before it has time to produce any mischief the door is shut against it in the following modes of collection accordingly the plague of irrelevancy is in a manner unknown—  in the natural mode as employed in causes tried in courts of conscience and before justices of the peace out of sessions   in the jury trial mode   in preliminary examinations taken before a justice of the peace or before a coroner   in examinations before committees of inquiry or commissioners of inquiry   irrelevant evidence is the peculiar growth of equity in the language of that country it is called scandal and impertinence for the designation of matter to which nothing worse can be objected than that it is useless the word impertinence seems to have been employed when the irrelevancy is aggravated by injuriousness the word scandal a consequence inseparable from the modes of collection there in use is that in this case the peccant matter before it is turned out must be let in this circumstance we may be pretty well assured was not overlooked when the mode of collection came to be chosen in by and for those courts nothing could be better adapted to the ends of judicature business made by the quantity of peccant matter let in business made by the discussions relative to the exclusion of it business made by admission in the first place business made by exclusion in the second place the mischief swelled to such a height as to be past endurance the auditory nerves of the judge of a judge who never heard anything about the matter were continually wounded by it it became necessary to apply a preventive remedy order that no answer be given in without having been signed and thence manufactured and dressed up by counsel order that no interrogations be exhibited for the examination of witnesses without having received the same security against scandal and impertinence an additional load of vexation expense and delay laid upon all causes and the chance of misdecision increased by the sophistication of the evidence for the adding of a sham security against the irrelevant matter that might come to be introduced in here and there a cause as if the responsibility of the underling sort of lawyer whom     the judge punishes every day without scruple could receive any material addition from the responsibility of another sort of lawyer whose situation is too near that of the judge to be exposed to punishment business made by letting in the irrelevancy business made by tossing it about when in and throwing it out business made by stationing a set of porters whose constant employment is to keep it out should irrelevancy creep in notwithstanding does the responsibility amount to anything oh no that would be contrary to all rule it is the lawyer that transgresses it is the client that is punished for it how irrelevancy is shut out when it is mens wish to shut it out has been seen already but what could be more adverse to the ends of judicature we come now to speak of the arrangements whereby the accumulation of the same valuable matter is compelled or otherwise encouraged in subservience to the same ends   of one of the consequences of the exclusion put upon the most satisfactory kind of evidence confessorial evidence a momentary mention has been already made the time of the judge consumed his faculties oppressed by an inundation of inferior of hearsay and other extraneous evidence first sample of virtually irrelevant evidence artificially and habitually accumulated—extraneous vice confessorial at large   in this case and from the rest of the matter belonging to this case should be distinguished the more particular case where the use of the confessorial evidence is to serve for the authentication of an article of written evidence contractual or casual and informal a sort of evidence extractable from the party without any additional vexation expense or delay and not without a boundless mass of vexation expense and delay from extraneous sources second sample of virtually irrelevant evidence artificially accumulated—extraneous evidence vice confessorial for the purpose of authentication in a mass of assertive matter whatsoever is false without conveying instruction by its falsity is on that account whether relevant or irrelevant at any rate superfluous and useless the falsehoods of the thief or other unlicensed malefactor—such falsehoods especially when drawn from him by interrogation in court or out of court are pregnant with instruction useful instruction the fictions and other falsehoods of the lawyer relevant or irrelevant always superfluous and useless barren of instruction are pregnant with nothing but confusion and misconception their intended fruit   of the nature of that sort of discourse which forms the matter of written pleadings a slight sketch has been already given of its inutility—of its repugnancy to the ends of justice—of its subserviency to the ends of judicature third sample of virtually irrelevant evidence artificially accumulated—matter of written pleadings and more especially of that sort of written pleading which is called special what pleading the matter so carefully distinguished from evidence do you call pleading evidence it is and it is not evidence it is not to any good purpose it is to a variety of bad ones it is not for the purpose of giving termination or at least any right termination to the suit it is for the purpose of giving continuance to the suit it is not for the purpose of grounding any right decision upon and in favour of the merits it is for the purpose of grounding wrong decisions on points foreign to the merits it is not for the purpose of any decision subservient to any of the ends of justice because being partly irrelevant and partly false it is known to be unworthy of all regard and accordingly no regard is ever paid to it it is for the purpose of producing without compensation that vexation expense and delay for which a compensation is afforded by genuine evidence it is for producing that misdecision the danger of which constitutes the characteristic mischief of false evidence in lawyers language it is not evidence because lawyers have settled with themselves not to give the name of evidence to any assertion which in case of mendacity they are not prepared to punish it is evidence because with the exception of that accidental and adventitious property viz that of subjecting the utterer to punishment in case of mendacity it has all the characters of evidence it is not evidence for the purpose of subjecting to punishment the liar by whom it is delivered it is evidence for the purpose of subjecting to pillage the innocent suitor at whose expense it is delivered   bills in equity may either be included under the last preceding head or be considered as constituting a separate one the matter of them may be considered as part of the matter of written pleading inasmuch as it takes shelter along with the rest under the wing of the mendacitylicence it may be considered as a separate article in virtue of the multifariousness of its contents in virtue of its containing over and above the matter of assertion matter of interrogation and matter of surplusage—general matter which if the appropriate matter happens to be more or less true is still irrelevant from the rest of the irrelevant matter which whatever might be the consequence of omitting it never is omitted may be distinguished one neveromitted portion of scandal     and impertinence impertinence and that of a scandalous nature regularly put in by the learned person whom the party is forced to pay for keeping out scandal and impertinence another difference in the sort of matter that is more apt to be presented by the word pleading—in what at common law goes by that name—a man puts in or does not put in lies as he sees convenient at any rate the obligation of mendacity does not extend to any of the assertions appropriate to the individual suit in the matter of a bill one necessary part is appropriate matter in respect of which matter the learned draughtsman is forced to tell lies on pain of loss of cause to his client this part is distinguished by the name of charging part a chain of assertions constituting the indispensable foundation of the corresponding chain of questions what you do not know and ask to know ask of the defendant whom you suppose to know you must declare that you know and pretend to tell the court how it is   to the account of the difference in respect of the mode of collecting the evidence as between common law and equity must be set down an unknown mass of irrelevant or otherwise redundant matter in such of the written instruments as have the name of evidence the commissioner or examiner the judge ad hoc by whom the evidence is extracted in this shape is paid according to the quantity that in this state of things a portion of surplusage should in the aggregate mass of causes be generated not to say in each particular cause follows as matter of course it is equally obvious that the quantity of it lies not within the reach of calculation varying with individual circumstances as well as with the idiosyncracy of the individual in each individual cause   indistinctness is the parent not only of confusion but of surplusage confusion generates business surplusage is business ready generated in the courts called ecclesiastical the plaintiffs story true or false possesses at any rate that species and degree of distinctness which is produced by a division into numbered articles the principle of distinctness thus infused into the charges with the indirect questions virtually included in them extends itself to the answers and so on to any objections or as they are called exceptions which on the score of insufficiency or any other may come to have been taken to the answer in equity practice—after the clouds of confusion that have been raised by an undivided bill followed by an undivided answer each with its train of surplusage—two species of instruments viz the list of questions by which under the name of interrogatories testimony is extracted from extraneous witnesses and the list of observations by which under the name of exceptions ulterior responses are called for at the hands of a defendant have somehow or other been suffered to receive the benefit of this principle to no lawyer by whom any such articulated instrument was ever drawn—to no professional lawyer not to speak of judges could the distinctness and comparative perspicuity of the instrument thus divided have ever been a secret by no such lawyer could that confusion which in the undivided instruments results from the nonapplication of that principle have been unexperienced have passed unperceived it would therefore have long ago been applied to every such instrument had distinctness been among the ends of judicature   of affidavit evidence that worst sort of evidence on which and which alone so many causes are tried—the only sort which a judge of the learned class ever receives for his own use—mention has been made already to point out how efficient in the character of a cause of clearness the same principle articulate division would be in this case the slightest hint may after what has been said already suffice in the case of a bill in equity the line that separates question from question forms a sort of indirect principle of division and thence of distinctness however inadequate in an affidavit even this faint light is wanting what can be more evident than the utility of affidavit evidence to the ends of judicature the confusion that pervades affidavit evidence is still more favourable to evasion and thence through the medium of deception to misdecision thence to vexation expense and delay through the medium of irrelevancy but its subserviency to the intermediate ends of technical judicature does not lessen its subserviency to these ultimate ends nor therefore supersede the mention of it when in a bill in equity an answer or a deposition the adverse party has observed what to him appears to come under the denomination of scandal or impertinence—he applies to the court that the obnoxious instrument may be referred to the master the subordinate judge of the court to report whether there be any matter of that description and if yes to cause it to be expunged costs to be paid by the delinquent how useful an arrangement if in the equity as the phrase is of this equity practice some master were employed or some other connoisseur in scandal and impertinence to look over the whole of the current mass of practical forms in this view ten volumes of this sort of matter lie before me all in one modern publication virtual folios though nominal octavos impertinence to speak technically he might find to constitute the ground of all of them scandal an appropriate sort of embroidery     in not a few more particularly in those copious effusions of technical eloquence called indictments and informations more particularly still where the effusion comes under the denomination of a libel or on that or any other score comes under the denomination of a state or political offence on the occasion of a libel more particularly certain scandal is or at least used to be regularly employed to encounter problematical vicious or virtuous the defendants life character and behaviour is or was aspersed between the two scandals observe the difference that which is certainly scandal is uttered under a licence and the author paid for it that which may either be scandal or useful truth is uttered without the licence and the author guilty or not guilty together with an indeterminate train of innocent men in the character of printers and venders is made to pay for it in the mean time and until the master here spoken of shall have received the reference and made his report and that report been acted upon and the expunction effected—the way might be paved at any rate for such a reform by a constitutional resolve i mean among jurymen but more especially special jurymen and on the occasion of all those political offences of which the mischievousness is so problematical as it is commonly in the case of state libels—to lay it down to themselves as an inviolable rule to pronounce a verdict of not guilty if among all these charges so coupled together in the conjunctive there be a single one which whether capable of proof or not capable is not fully proved of what use is that mans conscience to him who suffers an attorneygeneral or any other lawyer at the bar with or without the support of an imperious and browbeating lawyer upon the bench to force him to commit perjury chapter vi exclusion of the evidence of a catholic priest respecting the confessions intrusted to him proper among the cases in which the exclusion of evidence presents itself as expedient the case of catholic confession possesses a special claim to notice in a political state in which this most extensively adopted modification of the christian religion is established upon a footing either of equality or preference the necessity of the exclusion demanded on this ground will probably appear too imperious to admit of dispute in taking a view of the reasons which plead in favour of it let us therefore suppose the scene to lie in a country in which the catholic religion is barely tolerated in which the wish would be to see the number of its votaries decline but without being accompanied with any intention to aim at its suppression by coercive methods any reasons which plead in favour of the exclusion in this case will à fortiori serve to justify the maintenance of it in a country in which this religion is predominant or established these reasons seem referable partly to the one partly to the other of two of the heads above mentioned—viz   evidence the aggregate mass of evidence not lessened and   vexation preponderant vexation   first reason in favour of the exclusion mass of evidence not lessened by it suppose it an established and thence a known rule of procedure that a catholic priest is not exempted from the obligation of disclosing if called upon in a judicial way like any other witness statements made to him in such his character by a person appearing before him in the character of a penitent in the catholic sense statements of such a nature as would operate in the character of selfprejudicing including selfcriminative evidence if reported by such his confessor in or for the use of a court of justice what would be the consequence—that of that quantity of confessorial evidence which is now delivered in secret for a purpose purely religious a certain proportion it is impossible to say what but probably a very considerable one would not be so delivered would be kept back under the apprehension of its being made use of for a judicial purpose the rule would operate as a prohibition upon all such confessions for the spiritual purpose as would be applicable to the temporal purpose and the penalty would be whatever consequence of a penal or otherwise burthensome nature might be expected to flow from the decision which such testimony would warrant and would therefore be calculated to draw forth so far as the prohibition thus applied had its natural effect—the effect of preventing the practice—so far the support afforded to the exclusion by the reason mass of evidence not lessened would extend so far as the prohibition failed of being followed by this effect the reason operating in support of the exclusion would be to be sought for under another head vexation preponderant vexation of this vexation then what would be the quality and the amount it would present itself in a variety of shapes— i i set out with the supposition that in the country in question the catholic religion was meant to be tolerated but with any     idea of toleration a coercion of this nature is altogether inconsistent and incompatible in the character of penitents the people would be pressed with the whole weight of the penal branch of the law inhibited from the exercise of this essential and indispensable article of their religion prohibited on pain of death from the confession of all such misdeeds as if judicially disclosed would have the effect of drawing down upon them that punishment and so in the case of inferior misdeeds combated by inferior punishments such would be the consequence to penitents to confessors the consequences would be at least equally oppressive to them it would be a downright persecution if any hardship inflicted on a man on a religious account be susceptible of that now happily odious name to all individuals of that profession it would be an order to violate what by them is numbered amongst the most sacred of religious duties in this case as in the case of all conflicts of this kind some would stand firm under the persecution others would sink under it to the former supposing arrangements on this head efficient and consistent it would have the effect of imprisonment—a most severe imprisonment for life as to those who sunk under it—what proportion of the number would on this occasion be visited by the torments of a wounded conscience and to what degree of intensity those torments would amount in the instance of each individual are questions the answer to which must on this occasion be referred by a noncatholic to the most competent judges amongst catholics but a species of suffering the estimation of which does not require any such appropriate and precise information is the infamy that could not but attach itself to the violation of so important a professional as well as religious duty the advantage gained by the coercion—gained in the shape of assistance to justice would be casual and even rare the mischief produced by it constant and allextensive without reckoning the instances in which it happened to the apprehension to be realized the alarm itself intense and allcomprehensive as it would be would be a most extensive as well as afflictive grievance but the vexation pointed to as above would not be the only price that would be to be paid for so inadequate an advantage the advantages of a temporal nature which in the countries in which this religious practice is in use flow from it at present would in a great degree be lost the loss of them would be as extensive as the good effects of the coercion in the character of an aid to justice to form any comparative estimate of the bad and good effects flowing from this institution belongs not even in a point of view purely emporal to the design of this work the basis of the inquiry is that this institution is an essential feature of the catholic religion and that the catholic religion is not to be suppressed by force if in some shapes the revelation of testimony thus obtained would be of use to justice there are others in which the disclosures thus made are actually of use to justice under the assurance of their never reaching the ears of the judge repentance and consequent abstinence from future misdeeds of the like nature repentance followed even by satisfaction in some shape or other satisfaction more or less adequate for the past such are the well known consequences of the institution though in a proportion which besides being everywhere unascertainable will in every country and in every age be variable according to the degree and quality of the influence exercised over the people by the religious sanction in that form and the complexion of the moral part of their character in other respects but without any violation of this part of his religious duty and even without having succeeded so far as to have produced in the breast of the misdoer any permanent and efficacious repentance modes are not wanting in which it may be in the power as it naturally will be in the inclination of a conscientious and intelligent confessor to furnish such information as shall render essential service to the interests of justice i mean by ministering to the prevention of such individual misdeeds as though meditated are as yet at a stage short of consummation or of such others as though as yet not distinctly in contemplation are in a way to present themselves to the same corrupted mind who the misdoer is the confessor knows better than to disclose as little will he give any such information as may lead to the arrestation of the delinquent under circumstances likely to end in his being crushed by the afflictive hand of the law but without any such disclosure he may disclose what shall be sufficient to prevent the consummation of the impending mischief at such or such an hour go not unless accompanied to such or such a place strengthen such or such a door be careful to keep well fastened such or such a window warnings of this kind if i understand aright have not unfrequently been given—warnings which might have been given and would have been given in better times might had they been given have operated as preventives to the most grievous public calamities at the time of the religious wars in france more than one of the fanatics who with different degrees of success aimed a murderous hand at the person of the monarch prepared themselves for the enterprise according to the histories of the times by previous confessions in the course of which the     design was more or less disclosed without exposing the intended assassin it might naturally have been in the power of the confessor to have frustrated his flagitious project without opportunity the attempt would not have been made and without the attempt the design would not have afforded evidence sufficient for the purpose of penal justice the discussion has been rendered the more particular for the purpose of giving the clearer view of the essential differences by which this case stands distinguished from another with which it might be liable to be confounded i mean the case of those disclosures which may come to be made by an individual criminal or noncriminal to a law adviser in the character of attorney or advocate a topic which will come to be considered in its place chapter vii remedies succedaneous to the exclusion of evidence we have seen how easily it may happen that the evils opposite to the collateral ends of justice shall be greater than the evils opposite to the direct ends that the vexation expense and delay produced by the delivery of this or that lot of evidence shall constitute a greater mass of evil than that of the undue decision or failure of justice that may take place for want of it and this even supposing the misdecision to be not merely the accidental or probable but the necessary result of the exclusion put upon the evidence we have seen that in this case if there be no other resource the propriety of the exclusion is a necessary result but how necessary soever it is manifestly an extreme and a most disastrous remedy it is sitting down under the disease to save the unpleasant consequences apprehended from the remedy it is taking the course the patient would take who should resolve to endure the torment of the stone in order to save the pain and danger of the operation but as under the pressure of that bodily affliction a skilful physician will naturally look out with anxious diligence for whatever milder remedy presents any prospect of relief—so where vexation expense and delay is the disease a vigilant and honest legislator will never embrace exclusion and thence misdecision in the character of a remedy without applying all his industry to the discovery of other remedies that may be applied without contravention of any of the ends of justice if the exclusion of evidence be proper and justifiable in any case it can only be in default or by reason of the insufficiency of such milder remedies the indication therefore of what presents itself in that character is a task which seems indispensable to the present work the following short descriptions may serve in the first instance to afford a general conception of the principal arrangements that offer themselves to this view explanations when they appear necessary will follow let it not be regarded as an objection if a set of arrangements presented here in the character of succedanea to a comparatively narrow abuse exclusion of evidence should be found to include the leading features of a system competent to the extirpation of the immense mountain of abuse of which that inferior hill forms a part its utility with reference to that extraneous purpose neither destroys nor impairs its utility with reference to the direct purpose of this work i against vexation expense and delay taken together—   anticipative survey of the contents of the budget of evidence on both sides   tribunals within reach—in which is included limitation of the local extent of judicial districts thence augmentation or according to what has been or has not been done before restoration or nonreduction of then number the county courts and more especially the hundred courts of former times in england   sittings of each uninterrupted exemplifications the different courts of conscience scattered here and there over the face of the country but more particularly and literally the london police offices also the courts held to so many purposes by justices of peace acting not in general sessions but in voluntary division meetings or singly at their own houses   meeting of the parties coram judice at the outset of every cause for the purpose of the abovementioned anticipative survey as well as for so many other purposes exemplifications—practice of the courts of conscience and of the courts held by justices of the peace as above   examination by epistolary correspondence and by that means of persons resident at any magnitude of distance whether within or without the effectual jurisdiction of the court in question or the government under which it acts this in the case where examination vivâ voce is barred by impracticability physical or prudential ii against expense exclusively or more particularly— †    power to any party to insist upon the production of any evidence notwithstanding     any preponderancy of expense on condition of bearing the burthen of it definitively as well as in the first instance this includes the defraying the expense necessary to the production of evidence deemed necessary to the opposite party in preference to the seeing a decision pronounced in favour of the adversary say the defendant on the ground of the inordinateness of such necessary expense     advertisement for assistance to justice for the expense of evidence the need of such assistance to be certified by the judge if he thinks fit after hearing what on the occasion of the anticipative survey has been said on both sides     abolition of taxes upon justice iii against delay— against delay in respect of the contingently consequent deperition of the matter of evidence—     prompt collection of forthcoming without waiting for the unforthcoming evidence against delay in respect of the contingently consequent deperition of the matter of satisfaction—  0   provisional decision on either side taking sufficient security for restitution ad integrum in the event of a subsequent production of the as yet unforthcoming evidence      provisional sequestration of the matter of satisfaction without ulterior decision at that time iv against vexation to the judicial breasts and consequent delay in the paramount appellate judicature of the house of lords a very particular case peculiar to the british constitution      application of the principle of the grenville act to that upper house of parliament after this summary view let us now descend to particulars i remedy the first—anticipative survey of the contents of the budget of evidence viz of the contents of it on both sides and when there are divers persons on the plaintiffs side or on the defendants side or on both on all sides that vexation expense and delay may be saved by putting an exclusion upon a lot of evidence is manifest enough be the evidence ever so necessary to right decision the production of it will always be attended with some portion be it ever so small of each of those collateral inconveniences exclude the evidence you exclude right decision you exclude justice but on the other hand you exclude along with it those collateral and minor and generally speaking inferior inconveniences among the advantages resulting from the preparatory operation one is obvious enough the exclusion which it would every now and then enable the judge to put upon evidence that would otherwise have been to be received—upon evidence deemed irrelevant or superfluous which is as much as to say of such a nature that by the exclusion of it no prejudice could come to the ends of justice but on the present occasion it is not in the character of a means of exclusion that this operation is proposed but as a means of saving the judge from the necessity of putting exclusion upon evidence from the necessity of an operation so adverse or even fatal to the direct ends of justice in the case where the lot of evidence which but for that survey would have been to be excluded was material and still more if it was absolutely necessary to enable the judge to pronounce such a decision as shall be conformable to those direct and principallytoberegarded ends in this character the use of the anticipative survey is not quite so obvious as in the other character just mentioned   under the blind arrangements made on the ground here in question by english jurisprudence a limited allowance of time for the whole trial including the production of all the evidence—a limited allowance of time for a quantity of business that may be any number of times greater than the whole quantity of the business that can possibly be done in that time—an incident which for want of such anticipative survey must every now and then take place is that in the confusion produced by this forced condensation a quantity of evidence altogether indispensable shall stand excluded while another mass which upon the anticipative survey would have been seen to be superfluous has been admitted introduce the anticipative survey the superfluous evidence is excluded and by means of the room thus gained the indispensable mass of evidence the evidence necessary to the principal end of justice is let in of the blind fixation and limitation of the quantity of time allotted for the reception of a mass of evidence the quantity of which for the purpose of any general rule is incapable of being foreknown—of this imbecility or this fraud the consequence is an indiscriminating exclusion of an indeterminable proportion of the whole mass of the evidence which would otherwise have been delivered of the prevalence of this blind practice in the english system an indication somewhat more in detail has been given in another place rendering the practice on this head completely consistent with the ends of justice is what could not be done without the abolition of those barricades and the restitution   0 of natural liberty but supposing them to remain in the proposed anticipative survey may be seen the only remedy by which the venom of that abuse can be mitigated and the mischief of it reduced english homebred law as also romebred law english as well as continental afford each of them a remarkable exemplification of a blind and indiscriminate exclusion put upon masses of evidence in nature as well as quantity altogether indeterminate english homebred by means of the limited and unextensible quantity of time allowed in most cases for the reception of the whole mass of evidence romebred in consequence of the studied secrecy by the operation of which the door is shut against all such counterevidence or other ulterior evidence the demand for which would have been created and made known had the mass of evidence adduced by each party been known in time to the other these examples while they bring to view the demand for the anticipative survey here proposed will serve to show at the same time how exclusion of evidence is liable to be produced not only without benefit but without thought and while they show the use of this survey in other respects will also show in what it has the effect of preserving from exclusion evidence which would otherwise have been subjected to that fate the following would be the sort of anticipative survey which i would propose— each party in the presence of the other or others produces a list of the contents of his budget of proposed evidence names and descriptions of the proposed witnesses whence they or their testimony have to come with the articles of real and written evidence if any which they will respectively have to produce and the particular purposes for which each article of evidence is wanted each party in a word gives in for the consideration of the judge and the opposite party or parties the same sort of information so far as evidence is concerned that under the existing system each partys attorney puts into the sort of document called a brief for the instruction of the advocate results of such a survey—   all evidence which supposing it to be true will in the opinion of the judge be either irrelevant or unnecessary or unavailing discarded beforehand and the vexation expense and delay attached to the production of it saved   item all evidence from the production of which though material and even necessary a preponderant amount of vexation expense and delay would be inseparable   in the instance of each article arrangements taken in concert for the production of it in such time and manner as shall be attended with least delay vexation and expense it is only where the cause labours under a certain degree of complexity that the demand for this sort of survey can have place in the great majority of causes this one meeting would serve for the termination as well as commencement of the cause as it does in the english courts of conscience in some cases neither the effect nor the substance of the evidence can be anticipated the effect of an original for example from an alleged transcript and the points to which it is possible for a witness to speak may often be foreknown with certainty when the effect of his testimony can not reasonably be presumed many are the cases in which the irrelevancy or inutility of one mass of evidence follows with certainty from the omission of another discard titius all testimonies respecting his character all evidences which are wanted for no other purpose than to operate in opposition or support of his become whether irrelevant or no useless confront the anticipative survey with special pleading the information which special pleading gives or rather professes to give without giving and in the worst possible mode and by a chain of communication purposely wiredrawn through a course of months or years—that and more the anticipative survey gives freely and honestly gives in the course of a single meeting commonly in fewer minutes than the other course would consume months special pleading brings forward the allegations carefully keeping back the evidence if any from which they are to receive their support the anticipative survey brings to view at the same time the allegations and either the evidence itself or the sources from which it is to come special pleading giving i e selling encouragement reward to false allegations to which—exempting them from the punishment provided for allegations recognised in the character of evidence—it has secured the effect of evidence the anticipative survey throwing the sunshine of crossexamination upon every syllable that is said—call it allegation call it evidence meantime this anticipative survey what is it is it vision imagination innovation comes it from formosa from utopia no not it indeed nothing is there in the least new in it but the name you may see it in every court where justice is in honour and at the same time permitted by power to show her face you may see it in every arbitration court in every police office in the court of every justice of the peace throughout the kingdom acting out of the trammels of regular iniquity you may see it in any court of     conscience as often as the nature of the cause admits of its containing a mass of evidentiary matter complex enough to afford a demand for any such distant scrutiny you may see it in every counsels in every attorneys brief with no other difference than between complete correct and voluntarily or involuntarily honest information on the one hand and purposely incomplete purposely incorrect mutilated garbled sophisticated on the other ii remedy the second—tribunals within reach in other points of view the importance of this remedy belongs not to the present purpose diminish in idea the importance of the matter in dispute in the cause increase the distance of the spot from which a witness or the bearer of an article of real or written evidence who to this purpose may be called a witness has to come increase in like manner the number of such witnesses—you may always bring about a state of things in which the vexation expense and delay attached to such conveyance shall severally or jointly form a mass of collateral inconvenience preponderant over the evil opposite to the direct ends of justice in the case in question over the evil of misdecision but wherever this reversal of the more usual and natural proportion takes place exclusion of the evidence though misdecision follow is the result authorized and required by a due regard to the aggregate of the ends of justice but misdecision especially when manifest is a great and glaring evil it is a lamentable resource diminish on the other hand the distance of the spot from whence the witness or witnesses have to come in order to reach the seat of judicature you may make sure of coming to a state of things in which the aggregate inconvenience of vexation expense and delay by reason of attendance can never be equal in weight to the evil of misdecision in any the least important cause the length to which in point of prudential and even physical practicability the application of this remedy can be carried depends it is manifest upon the state of the population confront on this ground the state of london or paris with that of siberia or the back settlements in america in default or aid of vivâ voce deposition and examination comes naturally the epistolary mode as mentioned elsewhere unfortunately the same causes which render the establishment of tribunals within everybodys reach for vivâ voce deposition and mutual examination of the parties impracticable render the epistolary mode of communication unapt to be generally practicable but in this same state of things the substitution of professional agents as under the technical system would in general be not less impracticable and instead of assuaging the inconvenience would be more apt to aggravate it the consequence is that in a thinly peopled country for slight injuries more precisely as to the degree it is impossible to speak the nature of things admits not of a remedy within the bosom of each family absolute power in the head as between a member of one family and that of another independence and anarchy such is the state of things unless in so far as it may be susceptible of relief from the occasional and rare visitations of delegated yet to this purpose absolute power from a distance in a system of abuse particular abuses serve sometimes as palliatives sometimes as covers and apparent justifications to each other in the absence of tribunals within reach may be seen the most plausible pretence for the expulsion of the parties from the presence of the judge out of british ground it would be difficult to form an idea of the pitch to which the grievance opposite to the arrangement now proposed has been raised in england value at stake a few thousands of pounds or a few shillings station of the judge in the metropolis abode of suitors at   0 miles distance even in england it is comparatively an innovation in former times each county each hundred had its court not to speak of minor ones and if for one sort of cause why not for another but the great judges whose lips were close to the sovereigns ear stole the sword from his side and crushed their little rivals at a distance the metropolitan courts swallowed up the country ones by these and other devices personal attendance being rendered intolerable to the parties—admission of substitutes under the name of attorneys was prayed for and granted as an indulgence dependants accomplices and instruments of the judges—these substitutes became the natural enemies and with their confederates the advocates called serjeants and apprentices the sure betrayers of the parties their employers to these real grievances circuit courts added a sham remedy excess of delay crowned by excess of precipitation in each separate cause six or twelve months consumed in the london offices in doing worse than nothing at each one of a given list of county towns from one to four days employed in a year in running causes against time for any given number of causes each of any given length exactly at every place the same time iii remedy the third—sittings uninterrupted this remedy corresponds to another article in the list of the devices of the technical system viz fixed times with long intervals     and consists in the removal of that abuse in other respects the mischievousness of that abuse the consequent importance of this remedy are topics that belong not to the present head what belongs to the present head is to show how the evil attached to misdecision by reason of exclusion of evidence and thence to exclusion of evidence may be removed or lessened by these other means viz by filling up the vast gulfs fixed at present between the today and the tomorrow in the chronology of technical judicature in westminster hall as everybody knows or is supposed to know there are exactly four days and no more in every year each day consisting of twentyeight ordinary days more or less distance between today and tomorrow various minimum about one month maximum more than four calendar months in the rest of england certain northern counties excepted there are according to the same chronology but two days in a year viz in the juridical metropolis the assize town of each county each such day consisting of two ordinary days or thereabouts distance between today and tomorrow half a year in three northern counties there is but one such day† the length of it not differing in any considerable degree from that of a southern day distance between today and tomorrow one whole year to give a complete and accurate system of juridical chronology would be to give a complete institute of a separate branch of science forming as already observed a twig of that branch of the flash language illustration only being the object here the above outline will be sufficiently full and accurate for the present purpose of these great gulfs between day and day the effect in respect of exclusion of evidence is twofold—  to increase the evil of it when it takes place   and thereby the cogency of the demand for it the plaintiffs right rests upon a deed today the original is not could not have been forthcoming tomorrow at least for anything that is known to the contrary it will or would be a transcript a correct and complete transcript is forthcoming now but the original being in existence the transcript not being the best evidence stands excluded unless the defendant by and with the advice of his learned assistants thinks fit to admit it observe now the difference between natural time and juridical time the juridical tomorrow is it the natural tomorrow the delay taken by itself is scarce an object to either party no advantage worth stickling for to a malâ fide defendant and his learned accomplices the expense though commonly an inferior would indeed be something of an object more or less understand the expense of a fresh hearing with its fresh fees but forasmuch as in most cases the costs on both sides fall to the charge of him against whom the decision passes the costs of the delay thus purchased would fall upon the purchaser and the amount of the respite being by the supposition no more than a natural day it can scarce ever happen that the advantage thus to be purchased shall be adequate to the expense he will therefore of course admit the transcript instead of the original in other words not call for the putting upon the original that exclusion which he has a right to call for the juridical tomorrow on the other hand is it so long to look for as this day six months in the ordinary state of things the exclusion of the inferior secondhand evidence will be rigorously exacted the injured plaintiff excepted it is the interest of all parties that the application of the excluding rule be exacted without mercy it is the interest of the malefactors learned accomplices of all classes and they have taken care that it shall be his costs of to days fruitless hearing so much revenge at any rate half a years interest upon the sum due or what comes to the same thing upon a sum equal to the value of the service in what shape soever demanded by the plaintiff at the charge of the defendant at the hands of the judge half a years interest upon the sum due to this amount is the premium which the learned contrivers of the system have taken care to secure for encouraging men to engage and persevere in the teeth of conscience in the defence of a bad cause a bounty to the value of which as any one may see there are no limits add to the above the chance of saving the principal by the deperition of the evidence in the course of this juridical day or the certainty of it by withdrawing the matter of satisfaction the defendants property out of the plaintiffs reach add again two other chances which in a mass of cases covering a great exent of ground in the field of law for the better encouragement of businessmaking injustice the same learned wits have been ingenious enough to provide and happy enough to preserve in many cases upon the death of the malefactor death of the suit for the benefit of his representatives upon the death of the party injured death of the suit for the benefit of the malefactor himself thus stands the premium in the south of england and in the northern counties above mentioned the value of it as above mentioned is exactly double thus at common law but in equity it sets calculation at defiance thus stand the interests of the defendant dishonest or honest thus stand the interests     of the defendants honest or dishonest but in both cases equally unpunishable and irreproachable professional assistants and advisers but the interest of the injured plaintiffs assistants and advisers which way do they point the same way as those of their own client no but the same way and with equal force as those of his adversarys equally learned professional assistants and advisers in this state of things is it in the nature of man—is it in the nature of the man of law that the exertions made for the admission should be equally sincere equally strenuous with the exertions made for the exclusion of the evidence in equity you have plaintiffs and defendants by dozens scores or even hundreds on a side observe the consequence mors ricardi vita roberti from the mortality of the suitors comes the mortality of the suit one of the plaintiffs dying the lawyers kill the suit then comes a bill of reviver to raise it like the phœnix from its ashes iv remedy the fourth—meeting of the parties at the outset in the presence of the judge this remedy corresponds to the first and fundamental article in the list of the devices of the technical system viz exclusion of the parties from the presence of the judge and consists in the removal of that abuse in other points of view the mischievousness of that abuse the importance of this remedy belong not to the present purpose what belongs to the present purpose is simply the importance of this meeting and at this stage of the cause to a preceding article in this list of remedies—the proposed anticipative survey of the contents of the budget of evidence on both sides nor to this operation in respect of every beneficial effect with which it is pregnant but only in respect of the room it is capable of making for material evidence by the exclusion of superfluous and less material evidence in regard to the matter of fact which constitutes the principal subjectmatter in dispute it may in the instance of each one of the parties have happened or not have happened to him to have been in a situation enabling him to deliver evidence direct or circumstantial respecting it but a matter to which it is scarce possible in regard to either of them that he should not be able to speak in the way of evidence—and to which in most cases he will be better able to speak than any one else—is the result and particulars of his information and expectations relative to the quantity and quality of the mass and of each article in the mass of the evidence which he looks upon himself as able with the assistance of the arm of justice to procure† whether the correctness or the completeness of the information on this head be considered—whether in each instance the party be considered as honest or dishonest sincere or insincere—the importance of his presence will still be out of doubt honest his own purpose—dishonest the purpose of his injured adversary—can never be adequately answered by any person in his stead it is from himself in most instances that the information will have to come from any other person from any professional lawassistant of his the information thus afforded would in all such instances be upon no better footing than secondhand evidence derived or pretended to have been derived from the client false perhaps in its origin and without danger to the author of the falsehood or if true truncated or perverted by the negligence or sinister interest of the lawyer through whose lips it would be to be delivered from the original source the breast of the client all pertinent questions that could be put on the other side would come accompanied with a reasonable expectation of their extracting true or false an instructive answer directed to the breast of the lawassistant—if on the part of the client there were any deficiency in respect of the maximum of honesty and sincerity all such expectation would in general be vain such and so much information as in the conception of the client it would be for his advantage to be handed in to the judge—such and so much he would in so far as it occurred to him communicate to his professional substitute for that purpose such and so much as in his conception threatened a contrary effect such and so much it would be equally his care not to communicate in lieu of original vivâ voce testimony conceive the business of the proposed survey     managed in the only way in which learned judges will allow themselves to manage by themselves any sort of evidence—by the affidavit testimony of the parties their respective attorneys or all together with the outside show of justice the learned and venerable personages in question would as usual be delighted with the inward fruit and effect they would not any more than usually be afflicted on this or any other occasion affidavits from the defendants lawyers or nonlawyers would they be an adequate succedaneum to the presence of the deponents themselves yes if like the man the paper could stand up and answer questions could betray what it would wish to conceal—by blushes by hesitation by evasive responsion by selfdetected or otherwise detected mendacity or by silence v remedy the fifth—examination in the epistolary mode this remedy has not its counterpart anywhere in the list of the engines of chicane the idea of this remedy is on the contrary drawn from that fountain in other respects so rich in abuse the practice of the courts of technical procedure the mode here in question is the mode in which in equity procedure evidence is extracted from a defendant by the bill the amendments if any to the bill and the exceptions if any taken to the answer that this mode if substituted to the best mode examination vivâ voce per partes et per judicem is not so favourable to the ends of justice as the same mode subjoined where the importance of the cause warrants so great an addition to the delay vexation and expense—subjoined i say to that vivâ voce mode—seems to be out of dispute but a case has been already mentioned and that a case which in so commercial a country as england cannot but receive frequent exemplification in which vivâ voce examination will be in general not to be obtained viz where at the time in question the residence of the proposed witness is within the dominions of some foreign state in this case if no assurance regarded as sufficient be given that the proposed witness will within a sufficiently short interval be forthcoming in england taking that for the proposed country in such manner that his testimony shall be delivered in the accustomed mode regard being had to the nature of the suit—the effect of the expatriation is thereby to put an exclusion upon the testimony in this same sort of case it will not unfrequently happen that the proposed witness though at the time not resident within the jurisdiction of any english court shall in effect be not the less subject to the power of it as for example in virtue of some property there which he is unable or unwilling to remove or in virtue of any other bond of attachment by which his affections are fastened to the spot in this case give to the party who has need of the testimony the power of extracting the testimony of the proposed witness in this mode you apply a remedy succedaneous to that of exclusion you obtain a mass of evidence which by reason of the delay attached to the production or to the chance of the production of it it might otherwise have been necessary—prudentially or even physically necessary—to exclude upon the face of it this remedy is bad in the way of diet good in the way of medicine bad by reason of the opportunity it allows for mendacityserving premeditation and instruction and of its depriving the cause of the circumstantial evidence afforded by deportment good viz in cases where premeditation being necessary to complete and correct responsion examination vivâ voce is not of itself sufficient and in the cases in which by reason of distance from every judgment seat the power of which is applicable to this purpose such examination is not to be had pursuing no ends but those of judicature—blind when not hostile to all better ends—the english technical system where it does employ this remedy employs it in the way of diet—refuses to employ it in the way of medicine in the room of the mode of examination better adapted as above to ordinary use english equity within the irregular and comparatively narrow field of its jurisdiction employs this mode of examination in all cases in lieu of that preferable mode of examination where rendered impracticable by distance it does not indeed reject altogether the assistance of this remedy but by useless clogs and conditions impairs the efficacy of it the defendant himself being the proposed witness—his own selfregarding testimony being to be extracted by the adversary in the hope of its having the effect of selfprejudicing testimony—a set of commissioners are to be sent to the antipodes or found there to apply to him in the character of a security for veracity by means of the ceremony of an oath that eventual punishment to the application of which no such ceremony is except thus by positive institution necessary from the plaintiff while remaining such no such testimony is permitted to be obtained and from an extraneous witness though in the same cause testimony if in that distant situation extracted at all is not allowed to be extracted in that mode is not allowed to be extracted but in another the vivâ voce mode per judices ad hoc appointed on both sides the parties not present neither by themselves nor by their advocates nor in any mode can it at this distance be extracted but by consent of parties on both sides     out of the comparatively narrow field of equity jurisdiction with the addition of the still narrower fields of ecclesiastical court and admiralty court jurisdiction the remedy except in an extraordinary case presently to be mentioned is alike unknown for diet and for medicine from the superior courts of common law commissions for taking examinations of witnesses extraneous witnesses only not parties in the character of witnesses have been known to be sent into foreign parts in imitation of the commissions issued also at more early periods and in more frequent instances from the courts of equity as above but this appears never yet to have been done but by consent of both parties precious remedy good against bonâ fide inapplicable against malâ fide litigation inapplicable where the disease cries aloud for remedy good where there is no disease or next to none but in this case the mode of examination whether better or worse than epistolary is not epistolary but vivâ voce neither by equity nor by common law is the remedy applied in any other than that class of causes indicated by the denomination of civil synonymous in this case to noncriminal causes such according to a rough outline are the distinctions themselves causa patet here as elsewhere when to give the suitor a partial relief under the denial of justice produced in the practice of the commonlaw courts by the exclusion of both parties from the presence of the judge equity came in and proffered her treacherous assistance—it was on condition of paying her retainers to scribble questions instead of speaking them and thus instead of prompt and spoken answers to extract studied answers manufactured by others of her retainers to be set to work on the other side on what occasions was it that these pretended servants of justice were ready and desirous of lending to this purpose their dearpaid services not on the few occasions alone in which on the part of the party in the right and for the purposes of justice there was a real need of it but on all occasions in which by the sale of their services there was money to be got that is on all occasions whatever that arose within the limits of that field which in the scramble for jurisdiction had fallen to their share vi remedy the sixth—remedy the first applying to expense alone power to either party to charge himself with the expense of an article of evidence to the relief of a party on the other side the application of this remedy admits of two diversities forget not that in both the use of it is to serve in the character of a makeshift provision the intention of which is to save justice from the danger which she cannot fail of incurring as often as the door is shut against needful evidence the first case is where it being presupposed that the burthen of the evidence on both sides is to be made to rest on the shoulders of the party in whose disfavour the cause is decided this burthen as to such part of it as one of the parties has created would when compared to the value in dispute be too heavy to be thrown on the other of the parties value in dispute say £  expense of necessary evidence on the plaintiffs side say £ 00 expense of evidence on the defendants side not worth bringing to account under the natural arrangement respecting costs in ordinary cases the plaintiff producing this expensive evidence would in case of success be entitled to throw the burthen upon the defendant but rather than that any such disproportionate oppression should be inflicted much better would it be that this thus inordinately expensive evidence should be excluded although of such exclusion the consequence by the supposition would be that as to the subjectmatter of the demand the £  the plaintiff would be without remedy but suppose the plaintiff to stand up and say my honour my interest or if so you will have it my caprice is in a way which i do or do not choose to mention in such sort concerned in the business that rather than not have the business settled i am content in the event of my gaining the suit to remain charged with the burthen of this mass of evidence the remedy here in question consists in the making it a matter of obligation or of discretion on the part of the judge to accede to a proposition to the above effect the remaining case is of a nature not so apt to take place nor in respect of the matter of fact so easy to establish the plaintiff having brought his action for the £  as before the defendant stands up and says i have a good defence the money is not due but to produce the evidence necessary to the proof of this my defence an expense of not less than £ 00 would be indispensable i have or have not the £ 00 but whether i have or no the hardship of being charged with such an expense would be extreme a less evil would certainly be the payment of the £  claimed though not due but persuaded as i am that nothing at all is due even this would be no small hardship on me to apply the proposed remedy to this second     case it would be necessary for the plaintiff on his part to stand up and say reasons imaginable as before rather than not have a decision in my favour on this my demand i am content to relieve the defendant from this expense and take it upon myself enormous as it is in the first instance here is the money let it be applied to the production of the evidence in the keeping and under the direction of the court even here the disproportion is not too great to have been actually exemplified but if it appears too great for probability pare it down till you bring it within the pale to preestablish in relation to the article of evidence in question every circumstance necessary to give probability and rationality to the offer above exemplified—the nature and effect of this distant evidence the trustworthiness of it the necessity of that expense to the obtaining it and the assurance of its being obtained by means of that expense—will be apt to be matter of no ordinary difficulty but cases where the necessary expense has been much greater have been already examined and when the expense of a voyage round or about half round the world is considered may easily be conceived and as to the probable nature and effect and the trustworthiness these are points continually exposed to uncertainty and as continually calling for calculations which by each suitor on his own account are as constantly made with more or less anxiety ability and exactness where the expense of producing the evidence rises to a certain pitch the resource of epistolary examination will in most cases be apt to present itself as being upon the whole the more eligible remedy the discussions necessary to the settling of the several points in question as above presuppose the establishment of the proposed anticipative survey and help to exemplify the utility of it they are no other than such as in every days practice come under discussion between client and attorney in the place where the scene lies rests the only difference in the one case the clients parlour or the attorneys office in the other case the place of mutual rendezvous the court of justice technical practice—english or continental english homebred or continental romebred it is but repetition to say knows of no such remedies—knows of no such temperaments the pound of flesh on the one side or the pound of flesh on the other such when the flesh of suitors is concerned is the alternative given by the man of law in either case the man of law makes equally sure of his share vii remedy the seventh—remedy the second against expense alone advertisement for pecuniary assistance for defraying the expense of evidence if ever there can be a beneficial application of money it is this to every man be he who he may what is more valuable what more necessary than justice what is there that is valuable to a man and of which the preservation depends not upon justice by whom can property reputation condition in life life itself be retained—by whom can property reputation or condition of life when ravished be recovered without justice gratuitously bestowed what can be more generously bestowed than assistance given to a man to enable him to call in to his assistance the hand of justice gratuitously or for a price what assistance can be more innoxious more secure against all abuse than assistance lent to justice—lent under the direction of the judge on every occasion on which charity presents a demand what nation so prompt so ardent as the english to pour the balm of relief into the bosom of distress the probability of the demand for an inordinately expensive mass of evidence—the nature materiality and necessity of the evidence so demanded—the inability of the party to defray the expense all these points have been established to the satisfaction of the judge by the anticipative survey he gives a certificate and with it and on the ground of it an authority to solicit for this purpose from the lovers of justice contributions to be lodged in the hands of the officers of the court the lawyer alone continues to uphold the scarecrow set up so many centuries ago to frighten away from this field the hand of charity for depriving the indigent of all chance for justice what has been left undone that could be done claims that for indigence for mere indigence could not be prosecuted have been forbidden as if in odium spoliati—are still forbidden—to be sold advertisement for subscriptions oh yes for relief of distress in other shapes no rule of law forbids it but for distress however exquisite for lack of justice advertisement would be useless subscription would be too dangerous dangerous yes dangerous for has not the man of law contrived to convert it into a crime charity thus exercising itself has it not by the spell of jargon been stamped with the name of barretry or maintenance or champerty or some other stigma on pretence of which charity or mutually beneficial traffic may be alike converted into crimes perhaps yes perhaps no here as elsewhere authorities lean one way authorities lean the other in waters thus troubled and thus deep what is the wonder if men choose not to run the risk of being drowned     forty years ago this abuse was denounced in company with a kindred abuse still more mischievous because still more extensive forty years hence the denunciation may be repeated and with as little fruit for under the reign of jurisprudence one generation witnesses the birth of an abuse three or four more the maturity and then perhaps comes the death as to the buying and selling of legal demands of all sorts the only objection that could at any time have been made against it is in this strain judges are so weak so dependent so cowardly so corrupt—feudal barons so profligate and so formidable that after buying a bad title for the purpose by his own hands or by that of a retainer of his a baron it will frequently happen will by bribery or intimidation engage the judges to give to this bad title the effect of a good one supposing it good for anything what an argument to come from learned lips supposing it at that time good for anything what would it be worth at present between the present state of judicature in that respect and the state of judicature as above delineated is there any more resemblance than between the present state of judicature in england and the present state of it in otaheite three or four centuries ago the benefit had danger mixed with it therefore now that the effects of the remedy would be all pure benefit the proscription put upon it is to continue such is the logic of jurisprudence not that there ever was or could have been a time in which the reason was worth a straw he who could thus convert a bad bought title into a good one what should have hindered him from giving the same effect to a bad one of his own making the purchasemoney would have been so much saved applicable to the purpose of bribing the judge or suborning witnesses for restoring the indigent to a chance of justice there is what is called a remedy in the pauper acts like so many others however to which men of law have given a permit it may be set down to the account of sham remedies what it applies to is that factitious part of the expense which ought not to have been imposed upon the most opulent what it does not apply to is that part that here in question included which presses upon all ranks being natural and inevitable viii remedy the eighth—abolition of taxes upon justice in speaking of this or any other expedient for obtaining pecuniary supplies for the relief of this species of distress it is impossible to avoid thinking of the factitious loads by which it has everywhere been aggravated i speak not here of what has been done by the judge for his own profit but of what has been done by the finance minister for his own use the subject has elsewhere been treated pretty much at large see protest against law taxes vol ii p    † upon evidence itself the tax does not in every instance bear with any peculiar weight but being imposed in the preliminary proceedings rendered necessary to the introduction of evidence and the subsequent proceedings necessary to the giving effect to evidence the influence is the same as if the tax had been imposed directly upon the evidence like most other taxes it operates partly as a burthen partly as a prohibition as a burthen upon him who stands up for his right notwithstanding the tax as a prohibition upon him who through utter inability or in choosing the least evil gives up his right giving up a just debt or other demand or submitting to an unjust one or submitting to be punished for an offence never committed by the coercive force of the tax a tax upon capital when the amount is considerable is regarded as a bad tax why because for the sake of a present supply it nips future prosperity in the bud the force of the objection it is evident depends upon the quantum the tax may be a very bad one or it may be as tolerable as most others but a tax upon capital would be a blessing in comparison with the taxes upon justice it takes men indeed as it finds them but it does not single out the distressed the existing taxes upon justice are a tax upon the distressed falling almost always upon capital carrying off sometimes this or that proportion of capital and by the help of those other taxes upon justice which are imposed by lawyers for their own benefit and sunk in the pockets of the collectors in many instances the whole of it they fasten down in a state of slavery under the rich not those commonly understood by the name of poor—indigent persons of the labouring classes—but the indigent of all classes the tax on medicine though equally bad in principle and the only one that can be so is in comparison owing to its comparative lightness probably much inferior in mischievousness if it were possible that a return should be made of the number of persons killed by it in england in a year i should not expect to find it amount to more than a few hundreds     a lawsuit is a perpetual blister upon the mind if your wish be to do as much mischief as possible by another tax to the same amount as that of the impost upon justice including that part which lawyers have imposed and collect for their own benefit get a return from the physicians and apothecaries all over england of the patients under their care and distribute among them an impost to an equal amount proportions are of course no more to be regarded in the one case than they are in the other but lest the lawyer and his partner the lawtaxing financier should leave you behind them omit not to employ collectors to go about in cold nights to strip the last blanket from the beds of the most wretched of the patients the medicine tax if it kills men suffers them to die at home the lawtax sends them to rot brokenhearted in jails oh but the necessities of the country are so great they furnish us an excuse for bad taxes be the oppression of the tax more or less it is too late to think about it notable excuse for barbarity and ignorance exactly the reverse the greater the aggregate pressure of the taxes the more solicitous should be your study to choose the least oppressive ix remedy the ninth—remedy the first against delay and thence against intervening deperition of evidence and of the matter of satisfaction—collection of forthcoming evidence without waiting for unforthcoming evidence or for fixed days of those things which ought to be done what is there that ought not to be done at the only time at which it can be done because one lot of evidence cannot yet be had or because though it might be had it is not suffered to be got is that a reason why another should be lost in an exclusion thus indirectly put upon a lot of evidence value unknown is there anything like common honesty or common sense this remedy so far as it extends corresponds therefore to two articles in the list of the devices of the technical system viz sittings at long intervals and blind fixation of times and is no more than a particular application of the remedy already proposed under the head of sittings uninterrupted for that barefaced and most pernicious abuse the exclusion to which it is a remedy is purely factitious—the work of the technical system with its blind or too sharpsighted arrangements six or twelve months must elapse before any evidence can so much as begin to be collected what follows that all the evidence which having been obtainable within that time is not obtainable after that time stands excluded in the lump is it possible that in the mind that devised these arrangements any the smallest spark of regard should have been felt for the ends of justice any more effective feeling for the sufferings of the oppressed than the wolf has for those of the lamb he slaughters what is it that the man wanted to be informed of was it a secret to him that witnesses are men or that men die even now in the eyes of an english lawyer this abuse is the very summit of perfection how should it be otherwise it gives him holidays absolutely matchless holidays it subtracts nothing from the mass of fees subtracts it adds to the mass it makes business it forms a capital article in the mass of advantage provided for the encouragement of malâ fide demands and more especially malâ fide defences provision being wanted for a newborn orphan or information lodged for an offence—what if a justice of the peace were to say come again this day six months then and not till then i receive your evidence but when from any one of those seats of natural justice was anything heard thus monstrous no the licence to work iniquity descends not upon these unlearned judges not being granted by them it has been neither granted to them nor to their use if in the arrangement of terms and circuits there be common sense or common honesty give to diseased indigence as well as oppressed and plundered innocence the benefit of it extend it from courts of justice to hospitals let no hospital be founded in future without vacations of two months and four months for physicians surgeons and nurses men die for want of timely medicine but do not men also die for want of timely sustenance for want of the substance which the client by the advice and assistance of his lawyer has ravished and which the official lawyer lest the amusements of his long vacation should be disturbed refuses to restore are not all jails for debt slaughterhouses filled and emptied for their benefit even courts of justice have not received the benefit of this arrangement to its full extent the reason has been already given against the depredations and violence of the unlicensed malefactor neither the house the pocket nor the person of the lawyer are happily for mankind more secure than those of another man and were the matter of wealth to perish so would the matter of fees accordingly instead of once or twice in the year the old bailey sits eight times and the sound of the word vacation is not so much as heard in bow street equity indeed has her examinations de bene esse and her examinations in perpetuam     rei memoriam for equity finding more fees to collect than could be got in within the limits of the commonlaw harvesttime her shops are never shut long together moreover her birthplace was on the continent where men were cursed with no such regalia beneficia as terms and circuits but to measure the ratio of this remedy to an adequate one compare the scanty and irregular and undefined field of equity jurisdiction with the remainder of the field of law criminal and noncriminal compare the examination of an equity examiners dark closet with the examination of a police office efficiency with efficiency delay with delay expense with expense as to common law even those resources miserable and treacherous as they are are more than she has ever had a heart or a head to give herself when she is in a mood to have them she borrows them of equity for now the whole trade being consolidated into one vast firm and all interests mixed together and rendered undistinguishable shop and shop are upon the best terms imaginable on this head equity has a whim or an artifice in so general a view scarce worth mentioning unless it were for curiositys sake if your witness is dying or making off if in short the evidence you depend upon is wanted at any of these odd times in such case although you are in the right and found to be so you must thus far pay the piper as if the right were not on your side the same whim or the same artifice governed on the continent as often as in a suit not criminal any one of the parties called for the testimony of an adversary x remedy the tenth—remedy the second against delay—provisional decision without waiting for the best evidence when the original of a deed or other written document is so situated that the production of it cannot be effected without a more than ordinary degree of vexation expense and delay—lodged in some place between this and the antipodes in the hands of some possessor who proprietor or not does or does not choose to part with it or to bring it—where such is the situation or supposed situation of a supposed or alleged original at the time that an alleged transcript or sufficient extract or abstract is ready to be produced—a question may arise as between the two documents the alleged original and alleged transcript both certainly not being necessary one perhaps sufficient which if either of them shall be admitted were both present the admission of the transcript unless it were for momentary provisional consultation for the purpose or in the course of argument would evidently be attended with some howsoever little danger and with no use a transcript how little soever inferior in point of trustworthiness to the original can never so long as man is fallible be considered as exactly upon a par with it but the original is so circumstanced that rather than load the cause with the vexation expense and delay attached to the production of it it would be better to exclude it nay even although to the prejudice of the side by which it should have been produced misdecision were sure to follow it ought therefore to stand excluded and thereby the whole of the evidence from that source were there no other remedy but the transcript—although in preference to or indiscriminately with the original it ought not to be produced—yet rather than the evidence from that source should be altogether lost and misdecision take place in consequence might if ordinarily well authenticated—might with much less danger than what is frequently incurred in practice be under the conditions above proposed received instead of it nevertheless mischief from misdecision ought at the same time so far as is consistent with the regard due to the avoidance of preponderant collateral inconvenience in the shape of vexation expense and delay to be obviated as effectually as possible accordingly previously to execution obligation or at least liberty ought to be in the hands of the judge for taking from the party thus to be instated sufficient security for the eventual reinstatement of the other party in case that within a time to be limited the propriety of the opposite decision should have been made appear—the authenticity of the transcript or its correctness or completeness with relation to the point in question having been disproved the character ascribed to the proposed arrangement viz that of a remedy succedaneous to the exclusion of evidence belongs to it beyond dispute under english practice but for this remedy both would or might have been excluded—the original and the transcript the original by reason of the preponderant inconvenience attending the production of it the transcript by reason of its being but a transcript and the original still in existence and the production of it though prudentially not physically impracticable in virtue of this arrangement neither   0 stands excluded the transcript is admitted absolutely and at the instant the original left to be produced eventually and if need be at another time in english practice the original being lost—the previous existence of it the subsequent deperition of it and the authenticity of the alleged transcript being proved by what is regarded as sufficient evidence—the transcript is received instead of it the alleged transcript received when there exists no longer the original with which upon occasion it is capable of being compared with how much more safety when the original with which it may be compared is still in existence when in case of perjury the witness swearing to the correctness of the transcript is capable of being detected convicted punished when received if received at all it is in practice received absolutely without any such conditions imposed conditions in case of misdecision on the ground of it providing for the reparation of the injustice xi remedy the eleventh—remedy the third against delay—provisional sequestration this is an arrangement of still more entire security capable of being substituted upon occasion to those measures which would be the natural result of unreserved admission of the evidence and unreserved decision on the ground of it the party in whose behalf this makeshift evidence is produced instead of the regular evidence from the same source is for instance the plaintiff the decision regularly called for by this evidence would be the putting that party in immediate possession of the subjectmatter in dispute on condition of finding security for eventual restitution in kind or other adequate satisfaction as proposed by the last preceding remedy but the character or situation of the plaintiff is not to the purpose here in question at least altogether trustworthy the subjectmatter is a female whose honour and condition in life in the character of daughter ward or wife claimed as such by one or both the parties is at stake the subjectmatter though of the class of things is an article susceptible of a pretium affectionis and thence of damage not to be repaired by money on any of these accounts not to look for others it may be more advisable upon the whole that—until the authenticity of the supposed transcript can be put out of doubt for example by being sent to the original for reauthentication under official or other altogether unsuspected care—the subjectmatter should either be suffered to remain in the hands of the defendant he on his part finding security or be lodged in the hand of the official or other unsuspected third persons satisfaction in the meantime being made to the plaintiff for the loss of possession sustained by him while the bill without the benefit of which equity will not grant even her de bene esse examination is scribbling by the plaintiffs lawyers or an answer to it by the defendants—while the examiners clerk closeted with the witness like a confessor with his penitent is setting down what the witness says between sleeping and waking or what he does not say regardless whether it be sense or nonsense complete or incomplete true or false—all this while the defendant if he be what defendants so often are is making the best use of the time thus given him eating the plaintiffs property or sending or putting it out of reach according to his humour and his circumstances while the boy is running to the chandlers shop to buy the salt to lay upon the sparrows tail an instruction not grudged to infant birdcatchers the bird hops or flies off at leisure if it were in the nature of equity english equity to be sincere she would find her emblem in this child but no the imputation would be unjust to her if this lameness were to be ascribed to blindness by preventing mischief mischief in any of the shapes in which equity is at every mans service to prevent it there would be nothing to be got by making a show and that a false one of being ready to prevent it much is to be got and is got the groom who having a common interest with the horsestealer waits till the steed is stolen and then marches up to shut the stable door in ceremony—he and not the infant birdcatcher is the true emblem of english equity while the bill is preparing to ground the writ ne exeat regno the cuckoo swindler that should have been hedged in is winging his way to the continent laughing at or with the hedgers while the injunction bill by which waste should have been stayed is scribbling the axe of the disseisor or malicious lifeholder is levelling to the ground the lofty oaks from which the venerable mansion has derived shelter and dignity from age to age while in all the luxury of skins and parchment the female orphan is dressing out to make her appearance in the character of a ward of the court the sharper whom the charms of her person or her purse have laid at her feet is clasping her in his arms at the temple of the caledonia hymen laughing with her to think how the union of hearts has been facilitated by the incompleteness of the union between kingdoms malefactor whoever you are you deserve to be confined for idiocy or your solicitor struck off the roll for ignorance if ever it be your ill fate to see your schemes anticipated and frustrated by english equity among the almost numberless uses of the     initial meeting of the parties in the presence of the judge one is as already intimated the putting an instant stop to so sure a course for eluding the power of justice is the partys solvency out of suspicion out of danger no use in conveying him to a jail or to a spunginghouse as little in forcing him to beg or buy sureties for his eventual forthcomingness is his solvency a point too dubious or too complicated to be settled at the first examination a guard placed over him in his own house would give it all the useful properties of a spunginghouse without any of the pernicious—as if a guard could not as well remain in charge of his person as at present of his goods consign the defendant to either a jail or a spunginghouse for no better or other reason than that without any doubt of his solvency the plaintiff believes or pretends to believe that the money he claims of him is due the reason were as good for hanging him the inquiry thus made does his solvency prove dubious seizing his person affords no security in jail or in a spunginghouse his effects for every purpose of removal or dissipation are as much in his power as if he were at home secure the effects themselves all removal all dissipation is at end of this same blind arrangement of which in some instances exclusion of necessary evidence in other instances unnecessary vexation expense and delay for the averting the mischief of such exclusion is the result—and which arrangement consists itself in the constant and inexorable establishment of factitious delay without use or shadow of pretence of which delay a frequent and natural result is deperition of evidence—another fruit is the deperition of the matter of satisfaction in the manner above delineated to secure the subjectmatter in dispute from perishing or going into wrong hands nothing can as yet be done for want of evidence why because it is by evidence alone that the defendants title to it can be made dubious the plaintiffs probable and to this as to all other purposes the receipt of evidence instead of being brought forward as early as possible is put off as long as possible why not brought forward as early as possible because as there has so often been occasion to state it was against the interest of the founders of the system that any evidence fit to be acted upon should be brought forward at this early stage on all these several points the interest of the founders of the system was in clear and diametrical opposition to that of the suitors and more especially to that of the honest among suitors which is as much as to say to the ends of justice it was the interest of these arbiters of human destiny that as much human misery should be produced as the sovereign and the people would bear to see produced and as much misery as the sovereign and the people have borne to see produced has been produced accordingly it was their interest that as little relief under this misery should be afforded as the sovereign and the people would bear to see withholden and as much relief as could be withholden has thus been withholden accordingly what is and ever has been the interest of the people taken in the aggregate in their character of suitors is that as few of them as possible should go to jail that as little as possible of the mass of property at the disposal of the judges should either perish or be lost to the person intitled to receive it and that to avert as far as possible both these mischiefs the defendant in all cases where his solvency was exposed to doubt or where in any other way the plaintiff stood exposed to the danger of suffering irreparable damage should be brought into the presence of the judge to have for the benefit of all his creditors and above all for his own benefit and at his own request the state of his pecuniary circumstances laid open to the judge as early as possible unfortunately on these same subjects and occasions what all along has been and still continues to be the interest of the judges is that on neither side much less on both sides should the suitors ever be suffered to come into their presence when it is possible to prevent it that above all things no such unpleasant company should be forced upon them at the outset of the cause that instead of this as many individuals as possible should go to jail and unless when the jails were already so full as to hold no more be kept there as long as possible that while the defendant is so lying in jail the property which by law and justice ought to have been restored or transferred by him or from him to the use of the plaintiff should remain at the disposal of him the defendant to be wasted or embezzled by him to as large an amount as possible that while in those receptacles of infection debtors were rotting in body and mind while oppressed debtors and injured creditors were dying brokenhearted—judges the authors of this misery with their dependants protégés and bottle companions should have as much time to enjoy and amuse themselves in as possible and that lest business should be presented to them in any other than the most pleasant and least troublesome form the fate of the wretches on both sides should never be disposed of by these its arbiters on any other ground than that of a sort of evidence utterly unfit for the purpose and universally acknowledged so to be     in complaining of this as of any other branch of the system of abuse it has been a practice among men of law to dispute the legality of it dispute the legality of a sort of practice persevered in by the superior courts in general for centuries dispute as well the validity of an act of parliament as if while legislators connive or sleep a law     were not exactly what the judges for the time being are pleased to make of it the cause of this paralogism must be looked for in a notion entertained through prejudice or affected from prudence of the excellence of the law of its subserviency to the ends of justice whatever is not reason is not law whether the opposite inference would not be the more rational one the reader is by this time in a way to judge the subjectmatters of law are persons and things the force of law is occupied in causing them to be forthcoming both incidentally in the character of sources of evidence both ultimately and for precautions sake incidentally in the character of parcels of the matter of satisfaction persons besides in cases of corporal punishment in the character of subjectmatters of the punishment the operations the object of which is to cause them to be forthcoming for the purpose of satisfaction or punishment are in the books of practice ranged under the head of execution by them is done or pretended to be done that which the decision judgment decree commanded to be done in this part of the field of law as in most others the dictates of utility as pointed out by the ends of justice are plain and simple general rule—in no case to omit any operation by which the forthcomingness of the article can be made more sure exception where the operation is either physically or prudentially impracticable—prudentially because the vexation and expense attached to the execution of the decision would be a greater evil than that of its not being executed memento—in the pursuit of this object to take that course in which the quantity of expense and vexation created shall be the least that can be uncertain confused voluminous and by its very voluminousness rendered defective for the more abundant the swarm of absurd and pernicious distinctions and diversifications the more abundant the defects fraudulent to creditors oppressive to debtors beneficial to lawyers—to lawyers of all classes from the chancellor to the bailiffs follower—and to none but lawyers—such in its bearings upon this part of the field of procedure as upon every other is the system still in force in england to frame a system free from all these abuses—a system in which the ends of justice and dictates of utility as above indicated shall be accomplished and in the compass of from ten to fifty pages would be an easy task in from one hundred to five hundred pages an impossible one     part iii view of the cases in which evidence has improperly been excluded on the ground of danger of deception chapter i cases enumerated in regard to evidence admission nonexclusion it has already been shown is the general rule evidence is the basis of justice exclude evidence you exclude justice the propriety of the general rule being so conspicuous—whatever be proposed in the character of an exception the onas probendi in respect of the propriety of it lies upon the proposer of the exception—upon the exclusionist in the last proceding book this task has been performed if as above supposed in the account stated in the proceding book the entire list of the cases in which exclusion of evidence can be reconcilable to the ends of justice is included in all other cases in and for which it ever has been or can be proposed it will be improper having done with the cases in which it may be proper the examination of the cases in which it cannot be proper will occupy the remaining part of this book in technical jargon the question as between admission and nonadmission admission and exclusion is clothed in different language for admission competency is the word—for exclusion incompetency not only so but incompetency finds another synonym or at least a substitute such as would not easily have been suspected and this is credibility an objection is made to the admission of the witness a question is to be argued—the question is now as between competency and credibility whether the objection goes to the competency of the witness or only to his credibility—if being considered as applying itself to his competency the objection is deemed wellgrounded exclusion is the consequence if as levelled at the same mark the objection is considered as illgrounded as insufficient admission is the consequence the witness is to be heard as if no objection had been adduced objections to the competency being objections the effect of which is to operate the exclusion of the witness altogether and objections to his credit having no such effect it might seem that the latter class of objections have no effect at all but that is not the case the objection itself being the allegation of a matter of fact must be made good by evidence if an objection is not good as an objection either to competency or to credibility evidence in proof of the objection is not admitted to be produced if it be allowed to be good as an objection to competency the objection is allowed to he produced and the witness not if it be good as to credibility but not as to competency the witness and the evidence of the objection to him are allowed to be produced together those who support the evidence against an objection to its competency have seldom any unwillingness to have the same objection received in the character of an objection to credibility why because in this case the objection frequently amounts exactly to nothing at all how so because it is so perfectly frivolous that in the scales of common sense the false scales and weights of common law being put out of the way it would not weigh against the evidence to the value of a feather the objection being good is it good as against competency the man is not so much as heard does it apply to credibility he is not the less believed in effect the difference amounts to diametrical opposition in language it is presented as but a sort of a hairbreadth difference so minute so microscopical that by a highseated eye it has happened to it to be overlooked like the difference between purport and tenor it was that sort of difference to which a lawyer if with the reputation of a great orator seated on a high and commanding station—in a word a mansfield might without shame confess himself to have been scarcely sensible in sound the difference is like the famous one between tweedledum and tweedledee nor in effect is there any greater difference than between justice and injustice—a difference which to a learned eye is too minute to have any claim to notice in practice they had been confounded so happily confounded that when a statute had required that a witness or witnesses should be credible it was a matter of doubt whether credibility was or was not the same as competency instead of talking of credibility     speak of inadmissibility nonadmission or exclusion instead of competency speak of admissibility admission and nonexclusion you could then he understood without difficulty the difficulty would then be in contriving how to misunderstand you but well suited as such clearness would have been to the purposes of common sense and common honesty it would have been proportionably ill suited to the purposes of common law the absurdity of the arrangement was in some measure hidden from view by the cloud which hung over the language prevented from knowing so much as what it was that was done nonlawyers were the more effectually prevented from seeing into the irrationality and mischievousness of what was done and upon this part of the ground as upon every other the rubbish thrown up by the lawyers while working and fighting in the dark contributed its part to thicken the entrenchment which defends the garrison of the old castle of chicane deception and vexation have already been mentioned as the two inconveniences in the apprehension of which in so far as any reason or so much as the slightest colour of a reason has ever been assigned or glanced at the exclusionary system in what cases soever it has been applied has had its root exclusions grounded on the consideration of vexation form the matter of the next succeeding part the present part is appropriated to the consideration of those examples of exclusion in which the fear of deception has been the ground real or ostensible incorrectness and incompleteness in these two expressions may be included all the properties by means of which it can happen to the testimony of a witness to produce deception in the bosom of the judge if in respect of either or both these qualities there be any failure on the part of the witness the root or cause of it will be to be found either in the will or in the understanding in the volitional or the intellectual branch of his mental frame with relation to the result here in question the state of those faculties respectively may be said to be an unfit one when on the part of the testimony incorrectness or incompleteness in any degree has its source in an unfit state of the will interest sinister interest is the cause of it when in an unfit state of the understanding imbecility our business at present is to bring to view not so much what ought to have been as what has been done and thought topics different in appearance though in effect coincident have been in the existing systems substituted or added to the above qualities or acts considered as blemishes upon the moral character of the proposed witness have in a variety of instances been considered as grounds of exclusion for the designation of all these one word improbity may on occasion serve but improbity on what score does it present itself in reality or in appearance as constituting a proper ground of exclusion and what relation if any does improbity bear to interest one answer will serve for both these questions— interest when acting in such a direction and with such effect as to give birth to falsehood may be termed sinister interest the effect of improbity is to render a man in proportion to the degree of it more and more apt to be led into falsehood by the force of sinister interest thus it is that improbity considered as a ground of exclusion coincides with and is included in the ground expressed by the word interest be it lying be it what it will no man does anything wrong anymore than right without interest without a motive suppose everything capable of acting in the character of a motive in a mendacityprompting direction out of the question a man of the most profligate character will be no more likely to deliver false testimony than an average man taken at large under the head of improbity may be included to the present purpose that of religion improbity has been generally ascribed to a man on the supposition of his having no religion or having a bad one religion has accordingly furnished pretences for refusing to hear evidence with what reason will be seen in its place he who is considered as having no religion no god is termed an atbeist he whose religion is bad whose god is considered as a bad one whose notions concerning god are considered as bad notions has been termed a cacotheist subordinate to the head religion atheism and cacotheism may accordingly constitute two distinguishable heads subordinate in like manner to the more extensive head of imbecility we shall find three particular heads infancy dotage or superannuation and insanity including casual mental debility by reason of infancy and to the extent of the age denoted by that word every man is kept in a state of relative imbecility in the course of his life every man is subject to have his intellectual faculties more or less disturbed and weakened by mental debility whether caused by bodily debility or not and towards the close of it by dotage putting together these several articles we have eight general heads under which the circumstances that have been employed as grounds or pretences for putting exclusion upon evidence may be ranked viz—     interest sinister interest of all sorts without distinction        pecuniary interest     inprobity at large     atheism     cacotheism     infancy imbecility in respect of infancy     insanity     dotage in the former set of cases which have just been under our review we have seen but little work in the way of exclusion for the providence of the legislator and of that little the greater part left everywhere undone in the set of cases now coming under review we shall see nothing at all in point of propriety to be done in that same way by the providence of the legislator and at the same time in point of fact we shall see him or rather his substitute his essentially and everlastingly incompetent substitute the judge at work everywhere in all directions and with a sort of activity as pernicions in effect as it is rash and unwarranted in principle chapter ii danger of deception not a proper ground for exclusion of evidence §   exclusion of evidence no security against misdecision misdecision is the word to be used in this place not deception why because in misdecision consists the mischief the only mischief suppose deception and yet no misdecision there is no real mischief suppose misdecision yet no deception the mischief is as great as if deception had been the cause of it deception supposes conception previous hearing or what is equivalent the judge who should ascend the bench with a resolution never to hear anybody would conduct himself badly enough but in no case could it be said of him that he had been deceived misdecision as many instances of it as there were causes endeavoured to be brought before him misdecision in abundance deception none the first thing to be done then is to show that on whatever ground exclusion may be placed it is not in the nature of it to afford any security against misdecision this accomplished if it be accomplished the remainder of the book were all minds upon a level with the highest would be but artum agerc but the mind of the public is not so easily satisfied prejudice is not eradicated upon such easy terms in every case the evidence whatever it be which it is on any side proposed to produce is either necessary or less than necessary to the decision prayed for on that side say to take the clearest example the only evidence or not the only evidence on that side   in the first place let it be necessary exclusion if put upon necessary evidence produces if the evidence would have been true a certainty of misdecision deception supposing it to have taken place can do no worse but no man surely will be found who will either think or say that of falsehood supposing the evidence false deception will in any one instance be a certain consequence to say this would be as much as to say every judge is a machine what then is the effect of exclusion to produce for fear of an uncertain mischief—to produce to a certainty and in the first instance the very mischief which it professes to avert it is as if a copyist considering that he now and then makes mistakes should for greater security against incorrectness determine never to copy any more but in the dark what then would the lawyer be with his exclusionary remedy supposing he were sincere he would be like the panicstruck bird which for fear of the serpent flies into its mouth what should we say of a lottery at £ 0 a ticket so many blanks to a prize £ 0 the highest prize—£ 0 paid to purchase a chance of £ 0 among nonlawyers where is the man to be found that would be weak enough to make such a lottery weak enough to put into if it made the learned judge who shuts the door against evidence to save himself or co from being deceived by it makes exactly such a lottery and buys tickets in it he buys tickets in it but with whose money not with any of his own money indeed no truly he knows better things but with the money of suitors rapax owes you £ 0 that he borrowed of you oculatus suspectus was present at the transaction his evidence is the only proof you have of it if the judge refuses to hear oculatus suspectus misdecision to your prejudice is the certain consequence your money is gone you borrowed £ 0 once of rapax he has abundant evidence of it but you paid him — oculatus suspectus saw you pay him of this payment his testimony is the only evidence if the judge refuses to hear oculatus suspectus misdecision to your prejudice is the certain consequence here too your £ 0 is gone on the other hand suppose in either case oculatus to be a false witness is deception on the part of the judge is misdecision and wrongful disposal of the money a certain consequence nothing like it every day false testimony is delivered every day false testimony is detected   next and lastly let the evidence in question be less than necessary being not absolutely necessary it must be because there is other evidence on that same side in this case though the evidence be excluded misdecision is not the certain consequence but in this case the party who adduces the     evidence having other evidence sufficient to warrant a decision in his favour there is nothing gained by the exclusion excluding the evidence you decide in favour of the party who produces it what could you have done more if you had admitted it not that in this case the exclusion is merely nugatory it imposes upon the party on whose side the evidence was produced the additional delay vexation and expense of procuring other evidence and if these exceed his means he loses his cause and misdecision or failure of justice is the consequence in neither case therefore can the exclusionary system be conducive to the ends of justice of the apprehended danger of misdecision from the receipt of evidence of a comparatively untrustworthy kind what is the amount and value in every case either nothing or next to nothing the legislator is sufficiently upon his guard against it indeed more than sufficiently and so much more than sufficiently as to prohibit the reception of it without knowing what it is but being himself so much more than sufficiently upon his guard what ground can he have for the apprehension that the judge on his part will be less than sufficiently upon his guard the judge who with such warning as may be given him by the legislator in the way of instruction is not sufficiently proof against that deception against which the legislator has thus been so sufficiently upon his guard without warning ought not to be deemed qualified for his office from the precautions taken by lawyers who would not have supposed that the danger was all of it on one side—that while it is an event unhappily so frequent for false testimony to obtain a credit that is not its due it was a misfortune that could never happen for true testimony to fail of obtaining the credit that is its due yet in point of fact who is it that can be assured that in a case so open to general suspicion as most of those to which the exclusionary rules refer it may not have happened as often to true evidence to be disbelieved as to false evidence to be believed fortunately for mankind the nature of things does not admit of any such drastic remedy against the former misfortune as the quackery of lawyers has employed against the latter the witness in question supposing him to have been admitted would either have been disbelieved or believed in the first case the rule is superfluous and useless all the use of it consists in warding off a danger which the event shews would not have been realized wherever the witness if admitted would have been believed observe the consequence observe the ground in point of reason upon which the law rests the jury who have seen the witness—who would have heard his whole story—who would have heard him crossexamined and had the opportunity of crossexamining him themselves—who would have heard the other witnesses if there were any—who would have seen who and what the defendant and the prosecutor are—and who would have observed the whole complexion of the case—the jury who would have had the benefit of the observations of the counsel and the judge would have believed his relation to be true the law which has not seen the witness which knows nothing of accused or prosecutor which—in a word knows nothing of the case pronounces him unfit to be believed and so unfit and the danger of hearing him so great that rather than run the risk it chooses as the lesser evil to license the commission of all sorts of offences in his presence when i said the law i might have said the judge—the single judge to whose partial and hasty conception hurried away and engrossed by some particular incident in the particular case before him it first occurred to lay down such a rule all this while the admission of a witness—the disallowance of the rule which on the ground of any supposed objection to his veracity forbids him to be heard—would not preclude the production of the ground of objection whatever it may be the record for instance or other evidence proving his having been convicted of a crime reputed infamous wherever the production of such ground of objection would have had the effect of preventing the jury from crediting his evidence the rule is superfluous and useless the only case where it has any effect is that in which after hearing the objection against him they were to be satisfied of its being insufficient and inconclusive and to credit his testimony notwithstanding against danger of misdecision resulting from the admission of a lying witness or rather of a witness disposed to lie there are abundant remedies there is the natural sagacity of the jury—there is the cultivated sagacity of the judge—there is the perhaps equally cultivated and still more keenly sharpened sagacity of the counsel for the defendant—there is in penal cases especially in cases of the most highly penal nature the candour of the counsel for the prosecution for though in cases of guilt the more flagrant the guilt the greater the glory and thence the greater the zeal of the defending counsel what counsel ever presses for a conviction in a case any way serious of a defendant of whose innocence he is himself assured besides all these securities there is in this country after all the mercy which in this case would be but the justice of the crown     where is the consistency between this utter distrust of juries and the implicit faith bestowed with so much affectation on the decisions they are permitted to give on such evidence as they are permitted to receive when a parcel of people you know nothing of except that they are housekeeping tradesmen or something of that sort are got together by haphazard or by what ought to be haphazard to the number of twelve and shut up together in a place from which they cannot get out till the most obstinate among them has subdued the rest political orthodoxy commands them to be looked upon as infallible i have no great opinion of human infallibility and if it were necessary to believe in it i would go to work by degrees and begin with the pope all i contend for but this i do contend for is that these twelve men whoever they are that have heard what the witness had to say—heard him examined and crossexamined and examined him themselves as long as any of them thought proper—are more likely to judge right as to whether he has spoken truth or no than a judge who lived centuries ago who never set eyes on the man nor ever heard a syllable from or about him in his life is likely to judge right on the question whether the man would say true or no if he were to be heard if there be one business that belongs to a jury more particularly than another it is one should think the judging of the probability of evidence if they are not fit to be trusted with this not even with the benefit of the judges assistance and advice what is it they are fit to be trusted with better trust them with nothing at all and do without them altogether a question continually started to the jury by the judge is—do you believe this evidence—and it happens but too often that the verdict declares the negative indeed little less of their attention is occupied in determining with themselves who is to be believed than in drawing inferences from the evidence on which their belief has been bestowed in all these instances false evidence is poured in upon them without the smallest mark to distinguish it from the true in all the cases of exclusion the witness presents himself with a mark upon his forehead pointing out the reason there is for looking upon his evidence as likely to prove false if he did not there would be no ground for shutting the door upon him habet fænum in cornu are men more in danger of being deceived when they have warning given them than when they have none but when the testimony of a witness being false is not believed the very falsehood itself is a source of instruction and security against misdecision misdecision be it never out of mind is the only real evil falsehood unless in so far as it produces misdecision none at all yet to no such object as misdecision is the eye ever directed by lawyers of no such word is any trace to be found in their books falsehood is the great and only object of all fears what would you lend an ear to falsehood why not if from falsehood you can obtain a clue that guides to truth instruction do you think to derive instruction from a liar why not as well as from any other enemy in what other case can you be so sure of hearing falsehood as when you have to take the examination of a notorious and professional malefactor on the occasion of some offence of which he stands accused yet the surer you are of hearing from him all such falsehoods as promise to suit his purpose the more instructive and satisfactory if pertinent are all such truths as his propensity to falsehood has not enabled him to keep back be the deponent who he may the thread of his testimony should all along be divided by the eye of the judges mind—carefully separated and divided into two parts—that which runs in the presumable direction of his wishes and that which runs in a direction counter to that of his wishes in the former part so far as depends upon bias upon interest may be seen a sort of evidence less trustworthy than if he were indifferent in the other a sort of evidence more trustworthy the severer the impending evil on the score of punishment or on any other the stronger of course will be a mans wishes to avoid saying anything that may help to subject him to it and the more depraved the     disposition of the man the stronger his propensity on every occasion to pursue in word as well as deed the course indicated by the wishes of the moment in spite of all suggestions of ultimate interest and moral obligation both these considerations laid together hence it is that of one part of every malefactors of every liars evidence viz the part which tells against himself it may be said and with unquestionable truth the more determined the liar the better the evidence as to the ratio of the trustworthy part to the untrustworthy it will depend upon the verityinsuring force of the scrutinizing operations to which it is subjected falsehood a certain cause of deception and misdecision on the contrary in how many cases is it a guide to truth a security for rectitude of decision in the very sort of case in which falsehood is most probable deception as a consequence of it is least probable falsehood where wilful forms a species a most instructive and useful species of evidence it forms a particular modification of circumstantial evidence falsehood on any occasion is circumstantial evidence of criminality of delinquency—of consciousness of misbehaviour on either side of the cause and in any shape when a person labouring under suspicion of a crime is in a course of examination is it generally expected that all he says will be true on the contrary—the severer the punishment and the stronger the persuasion of his guilt the stronger is the persuasion that so far as what he has to say to any point will if true tend to his conviction appearing to him as it naturally will to have that tendency whatever it may happen to him to say as to that part will not be true accordingly it is from that sort of source which with the fullest and most universal assurance is looked to as a source of false evidence that whatever assertion operates in favour of one side of the cause viz to the prejudice of the interests and presumed wishes of him whose evidence it is is regarded as the most satisfactory of all evidence regarded and by everybody the very lawyers not excepted who to guard themselves against deception are so anxious to shut the door of judicature against any source of evidence to which it can by possibility happen to yield false evidence but forasmuch as the eyes of all mankind judges themselves not excepted are universally open to the falsity of false testimony universally upon their guard against deception from the source that wears any appearance of yielding it—how can it be that on the part of judges deception by reason of that same evidence deception from whatever false evidence flows from that source should be the certain or so much as the preponderantly probable consequence not that even in the cases where falsehood itself is looked to as the most instructive source of information—not that even in the case of persons thus circumstanced of persons from whom falsehood is expected in a larger proportion than from any others—not that even from them there seems reason to expect that falsehood should come in greater quantity than truth truth even in these cases will be the general rule—falsehood but an exception take what false proposition you will there will be three conditions incident to the utterance of it—  that it appear necessary to the accomplishment of the deponents wishes viz for acquittal if defendant and so in other cases   that if it be not too palpably false to exclude a prospect of gaining credence   that it be not of a sort to expose him to subsequent punishment too severe to be risked symptoms of terror and confusion exhibited in deportment—nonresponsion—indistinct and evasive responsion—all these indications have on the same sort of occasion and in the same character of circumstantial evidence their use their universally felt and acknowledged use yet such is the instruction derivable from falsehood responsion direct responsion is on the same occasions still pressed for as being though replete with falsehood or rather for that very reason pregnant with a sort and degree of instruction and satisfaction over and above any instruction and satisfaction that is to be derived from those other sources any or all of them put together from manifest improbability on the face of it from selfcontradiction from counterevidence—from any of these sources detection may flow and then it is that by operating as evidence of character evidence much more conclusive than any extraneous testimony on that head the falsehood as such and recognised as such affords its instruction produces its effect in the character of circumstantial evidence the case here spoken of is that of a person labouring under the suspicion of criminality and on that score stationed by an act of the judge in the situation of defendant the suit having punishment for its object real or professed in this case where any objection has been made to the propriety of receiving evidence drawn from such a source from the lips or pen of an individual placed in that distressing situation it has been rested not on the ground of danger of deception but on a very different ground—certainty of vexation on the part of the defendant the proposed witness of which in its place true it is that it is only when either recognised or at least suspected to be what it is that falsehood becomes thus instructive becomes a fence against deception instead of a source and cause of it equally true it is   0 that it is morally impossible that in any of the cases in which the door ever has been shut or been proposed to be shut against evidence in consideration of the danger of deception the falsity of it whatsoever falsity it may happen to it to contain should fail of having been suspected thus it is that exclusion can in no case on any assignable ground be put upon evidence without wearing on the face of it a proof of its own injustice—a proof of the unsolidity of the ground will it be said that though the ground of the exclusion be just it may happen to the judge not to be apprized of the justice of it admitting the case to be realized the utmost that it would prove would be that the appropriate arrangements should in every case be taken for making sure that the judge shall be thus aware of it what then on the principle of this observation is the proper course not exclusion to be put upon the evidence but instruction to be given to the judge but this is precisely the remedy which as a succedaneum to be in all cases substituted to exclusion it is the object of these pages to recommend the judge who so much at his ease pronounces a fact not true because the witness by whom the existence of it has been testified may find himself a gainer in the event of its being credited or on this or that particular occasion has been known to have swerved from the path of probity—would this same judge with equal readiness pronounce the same judgment were a fact of the same description to call for his decision for any personal purpose of his own not he indeed because a servant of his is believed by him to be addicted to lying does he on that account lay down any such rule to himself as never to put a question to that servant in relation to his own conduct or to that of any other servant not he indeed if it be his misfortune to have a child whose character is tainted with that vice does he lay down any such rule in his dealings towards this wayward child not he indeed the judge who on the like hastily taken grounds determines that the will of this or that testator shall be void and that the augmentation or diminution intended to be made by it in regard to the share of this or that one of his children shall in consequence be without effect—the same judge if with a view of making an augmentation or diminution to that same amount in regard to the share of one of his own children he has to make inquiry into facts—does he pay so much as the slightest regard to any of these exclusive rules not he indeed why this difference because in regard to the conclusion he forms in his individual capacity he is sincerely desirous that it be just and true whereas in regard to the conclusion he forms in his official capacity he cares not a straw whether it be true or untrue in this case all his concern is that it be found justifiable conformable to the standard whether in the way of statute law or jurisprudential law to which by his superiors and the public his decisions are expected and required to be found conformable §   probable source of this branch of the exclusionary system—its inconsistencies the closer we look into the origin of this system of exclusion the more thoroughly we may be convinced of its hollowness and injustice by whom have the exclusions been put by the legislator in the way of statute law no but by the judge in the way of jurisprudential law if by the legislator operating in the way of statute law the ground for it though still untenable would not have been so completely hollow to the legislator in his situation it might have been competent to say—the judge i fear will not be sufficiently upon his guard against evidence thus circumstanced the safe course will be to exclude it and so excluded it shall be—i will not trust him with it here as already shown there would have been shortsightedness rashness error inconsistency however there would have been none but from the judge nothing could have been more inconsistent nothing on any other supposition than that of improbity more absurd i will not trust myself with this evidence it will deceive me i am not upon my guard against it is such folly conceivable had it been prevalent the practice of taking the examination of the defendant on a capital or other criminal charge never could have taken place yet on the continent of europe in the seat of romebred law from which the doctrine of exclusion was probably imported into england such examination was and is not only customary but indispensable what then ought deafness as well as blindness to be among the attributes of justice is the story of the syrens not fable but history and is every man every ruffian that comes before you a syren so that wherever there is possibility of falsehood in evidence there is no safety for you but in stopping up your ears no learned sir no more than you—you who if honest can thus reason are an œdipus or an ulysses such diffidence—beyond that of the most inexperienced virgin—is it credible in the situation of him who never awakes in the morning but to see the fate of men lying at his feet not qualified to judge of the veracity or correctness of a man speaking to a matter of     fact what is it then that you are qualified for is not this your occupation day by day on one occasion or other is not this the occupation of every man that breathes but no improbity in some shape or other presents to the difficulty a solution much more natural than is presented by the hypothesis of any such morbid diffidence the origin of the exclusive system lies deep in the recesses of distant time it dates in ages of barbarism—ages in comparison with which the present whatever may be the dream of vulgar prejudice is the age of virtue corruption as likely a cause as any—gross and determined partiality whatsoever bond of connexion—sympathy common interest or bribery—may have been the cause in judicature corruption in the worst cases must have a pretence and how many pretences have been acted upon still more shallow and unplausible than this shallow as this is the system of nullification stands not in any part of is upon any equally specious grounds indolence a cause at all times adequate to the effect—a cause still adequate to the production of it even now that on these higher seats within the english pale at least corruption even in its most refined shape may be pronounced rare confined to cases of a particular sort and in its grosser shapes probably without example this man were i to hear him would come out with a parcel of lies it would be a plague to hear him i have beard enough already shut the door in his face as sheep follows sheep judge in the technical system follows judge here quoth judge b is a man who on such or such a score lies under a temptation to speak false in this or that shape in the situation he is in he has an interest in the cause exactly in this sort of situation was a man whom my brother a though it is so long ago i remember it as if it had been but yesterday would not hear exactly in the same situation in respect of exposure to temptation perhaps yes but when brother a refused to hear the man perhaps it was that he had already heard witnesses to the same fact till he was tired and on the same side suppose a riper age history of judicial transactions brought to light in bits and scraps at the command of booksellers no thanks to legislators or to lawyers of the cause of suspicion a short indication but as to the absence or presence of other evidence to the same or a different fact on the same side a man might be a much better reporter than reporters commonly are or at least used to be without thinking of it the grounds of suspicion in evidence may be ranked under four causes—   the fact spoken to—not the fact itself which is in question but a fact supposed to be connected with it—so connected with it that the existence of the evidentiary fact affords a reason for inferring the existence of the fact thus evidenced to this is circumstantial evidence considered as contradistinguished from direct   the information in question not delivered immediately from the source of the information the person the thing or the script from which it is derived this is transmitted evidence considered as contradistinguished from immediate hearsay evidence transcriptitious evidence in their infinitely diversifiable degrees of remoteness from the source   the evidence in question not collected or delivered in the best mode—not delivered under the influence of those securities for trustworthiness which are commonly and might be generally employed for securing the correctness and completeness of the mass of information sanction of an oath examination crossexamination fixation by writing and so forth in this rank are in their own nature and without the default of any person all casuallywritten documents such as letters and memorandums and by the default of the legislator or the judge all evidence collected in any mode inferior in efficiency from a source from which evidence might without preponderant collateral inconvenience in the shape of expense vexation and delay be collected in the best shape examples—affidavit evidence nakedly assertive discourse as in unsworn pleadings and evidence collected per judicem solum sine partibus   the person who is the source of the information exposed to some assignable cause of suspicion affecting the trustworthiness of his statements here then are four causes of weakness in the evidence of which the one here in question is but one in the other three cases either no exclusion at all is put upon the evidence as in the case of circumstantial evidence in general or an exclusion is put in     some instances not put in others according to a system of infinitely diversified and inconsistent rules as in the case of the different modifications of unoriginal and casuallywritten evidence above mentioned or the weakness of the evidence in the state in which it is delivered or offered to be delivered is the act and deed of the exclusionist himself he himself bespeaking it in a weak and bad shape refusing to receive it in a better shape—even when in the best possible shape it would be received with less collateral inconvenience as above this same psychological epicure the delicacy of whose palate refuses all aliment that in its unconcocted state presents a suspicion of any the slightest taint will not suffer it to be served up to any table of his own for his own use unless by cooks from his own kitchen it has been brought by a process of mortification into a sort of carrion state a degree of ridicule attaches itself to the labour of him who perseveres in combating with the arm of reason a practice in the production of which improbity and imbecility took undistinguishable parts and in which as soon almost as the idea is started any one whose eyes are not determinedly closed may see that reason had never any share witnesses each of them with a mark of suspicion stamped upon his forehead present themselves to the english exclusionist for admittance blindfolded by a bandage borrowed certainly not from justice but from knavery or prejudice some of them he rejects in consideration as he says of the mark and in regard to those the objection in the jargon of english jurisprudence goes to the competency others of them he admits notwithstanding the mark and as to these the objection goes only to the credit in plain english amounts to nothing—produces no effect at all the whole assemblage of suspicious characters being thus distinguished into two groups whose lot is so different the elect and the reprobate—a requisition that would be to be made if reason had any share in the concern is that some sign should be shown by which it might be made to appear that in the least reprobate of the reprobate the force of the cause of suspicion is greater than in any of the elect or if this be too much to require that at the least in an average man of the reprobate the force of that same cause was greater than in an average man of the elect such criterion then is it anywhere to be found so far from it that on the contrary instances will be found instances to an indefinite extent in which where the force of the cause of suspicion is at its maximum or but a hairsbreadth below it the proposed witness is admitted notwithstanding—admitted into the class of competent witnesses where that same force is at its minimum a quantity purely ideal utterly incapable of ever having any the smallest effect in practice the witness is shut out the shape in which it may happen to testimony to be collected has just been mentioned as one among the sources of the weakness to which evidence is subject on this ground an argument may be built by the exclusionists let us hear it in romebred procedure the means of detecting or preventing mendacity are so perfectly insignificant that it would be dangerous in the highest degree to admit evidence from any but the purest and most unsuspected source parties not admitted no questions asked but in a whispering room as between confessor and penitent by the judge no counterinterrogation for the crossexamination of romebred law is an abuse of words the penner of the counterinterrogations knowing nothing of the answers to the interrogations no counterevidence for we keep the evidence as close as possible lest there should be any not a creature to hear the evidence but one who cares not a straw whether it be true or false thus circumstanced the evidence is true or untrue pure or impure according to the source from which it flows under such a system ought anything under the degree of angelic purity ever to be heard answer no most certainly accordingly until the time comes when angels can be subpænâ ad under such a system there is but one proper course which is to exclude everybody that done if you think it better to receive evidence than to decide without evidence you will admit the evidence in a shape in which it is fit to be received the argument such as it is serves in the manner we have seen to justify the application of the exclusionary system to the cases in which the evidence is collected in the roman mode it will operate still more strongly in favour of the application of it to evidence received in the english affidavit mode be this as it may—certain it is that under the romebred system upon the continent understand the exclusionary system has been carried to still greater lengths than under the english and accordingly under the former compared with the latter if the mischief be greater the inconsistency is less the rules of evidence are the same in equity as in law so it has been said and always without exception any number of times over by chancellor after chancellor it is not true but so far as it is true in point of consistency at least so much the worse the worse the mode of collection the more select ought to be the evidence there ought to be gradations upon gradations—valves behind     valves one exclusionary system for evidence in causes tried by or before a jury another for causes tried in equity another for causes tried by learned commonlaw judges upon affidavit evidence singlerefined might do for the jury box none but doublerefined ought ever to be received into an examiners office none but treblerefined ever handed up to the bench thus stands it in point of consistency how in point of fact in the shape of affidavit evidence everything is good from everybody from plaintiffs from defendants from felons from perjurers present your evidence to a learned judge he cares not where it comes from so it come in a bad shape—in a shape in which it is filable and filed—anglicè in a shape in which fees are paid upon it chapter iii impropriety of exclusion on the ground of interest §   interest in general not a proper ground of exclusion seeing that deception is so far from being a certain so far from being even a preponderantly probable consequence of falsity in evidence even when the existence of the falsity is certain—it seems almost a superfluous task to show that to regard any of those circumstances which have been held as grounds of exclusion as being in any state of things whatever to a certainty productive of falsehood in the evidence is a presumption altogether unwarrantable the impropriety of it will appear in a clearer and stronger light when we come to view one by one the several alleged causes of exclusion for security against deception the several circumstances of which falsity in the evidence has been regarded as the necessary or at least preponderantly probable result to begin with the article of interest i say here not sinister interest but interest without addition for such is the expression employed in the books of english jurisprudence on this occasion as on every other to understand what interest means we must look to motives to understand what motive means we must look to pain and pleasure to fear and hope fear the expectation of pain or of loss of pleasure—hope the expectation of pleasure or of exemption from pain the causes of physical motion and rest are attraction impulse and so forth the causes of psychological motion and rest are motives action or in opposition to action rest—action whether positive or negative—action without motive without interest is an effect without a cause it is not out of every sort of pleasure out of every sort of pain that a motive an interest is at least in a sense applicable to the present purpose capable of arising some pleasures some pains are of too ethereal and perishable a nature to excite an interest to operate in the character of a motive the pleasures and pains which present themselves as capable of acting in that character have in another work been reduced to a certain number of heads in the estimation of vulgar prejudice there is a natural alliance between improbity and intelligence between probity and imbecility in the estimate of discernment they are differently grouped improbity and hebetude—probity and intelligence ignoramus has for the purpose of this topic composed his system of psychology what is it a counterpart to the learned plowdens system of mineralogical chemistry equal as touching its simplicity—equal as touching its truth two parent metals sulphur and mercury the mother sulphur the father mercury are they in good health they beget the noble metals are they in bad health they beget the base fortes creantur fortibus et bonis with minds of every class the mind of the lawyer has to deal of the structure of the human mind what does the lawyer know exactly what the grub knows of the bud it preys upon by tradition by a blind and rickety kind of experience by something resembling instinct he knows by what sophisms the minds of jurymen are poisoned by what jargon their understandings are bewildered how by a name of reproach the man who asks for the execution of the laws and the formation of good ones is painted as an enemy—the judge who by quibbles paralyzes the laws which exist and strains every nerve to prevent their improvement is pointed out as an idol to be stuffed with adoration and with offerings in the view taken of the subject by the man of law—to judge of trustworthiness or at least of fitness to be heard interest or no interest is flagrant and stigmatized improbity apart the only question men at large are not under the action of anything that can with propriety be expressed by the name of interest therefore they are to be admitted is a man exposed to the action of anything that can be designated by that invidious name so sure as he is so sure will his testimony be false enough all scrutiny is unnecessary shut the door in his face sinister interest—the term and the distinction are alike unknown to them sinister interest everything that can be called interest is to their eyes sinister     sinister interest a term so well known to moralists and politicians is altogether unknown to lawyers who have at least equal need of it what then is it that there are certain sorts of interests that are always sinister interests while there are other sorts which if language like heraldry were made by analogy instead of by accident would be called dexter interests no truly no sort of interest that is not capable of being a sinister interest—no sort of interest that is not capable of being a dexter interest acting in a direction to draw a mans conduct aside from the path of probity any sort of interest may be a sinister interest acting in a direction to confine a mans conduct within the path of probity every sort of interest is a dexter interest the modification of probity here in question is veracity any interest acting in a direction to draw his conduct aside from the line of veracity is a sinister interest—say in this case a mendacityprompting or instigating interest every interest acting in a direction to confine his discourse his conduct his deportment within the path of truth of verity of veracity is a dexter interest—say in this case a veracitysecuring interest man in general not interested devoid of interest his testimony not exposed to the action of interest say rather for so you must say if you would say true no man no mans testimony that is not exposed to the action of interest well and that interest a sinister one not it indeed so far from it there is no man whose testimony is not exposed to the action of is not acted upon by at least three regular and standing commonly four forces of this kind—all tending to confine his conduct within the path of probity his discourse and deportment within the path of veracity and truth   motive belonging to the physical sanction—aversion to labour love of ease trouble of inventing and uttering a false statement which to answer its purpose must be so elaborated and dished up as to pass for true   motive belonging to the political sanction—fear of legal punishment viz if it be a case in which as in general punishment stands annexed by the legislator or the judge to false and mendacious testimony   motive belonging to the moral or say popular sanction—fear of shame in case of detection or unremoved suspicion   motive belonging to the religious sanction—fear of supernatural punishment in this world or in the world to come of these four motives the three first have more or less influence on every human mind the last probably on most minds on most minds did i say on all without exception if the english lawyer is to be believed for by a contrivance of his own he has shut the door against all witnesses on whose hearts motives of this class fail of exerting their due influence in the above list we may see the regular forces which are upon duty on all occasions to guard the heart and the tongue against the seductions to mendacity but in addition to these there may be by accident any number of others acting as auxiliaries in their support no sort of motive even these tutelary ones not excepted to which it may not happen to act in the direction of a seductive one—no motive over and above these tutelary ones to which it may not happen to act also in the direction of a tutelary one for what motive is there to which it has not happened does not continually happen to be employed in stimulating men to actions of all sorts good and bad in the way of reward in restraining them from actions of all sorts in the way of punishment† between two opposite propositions both of them absurd in theory because both of them notoriously false in fact the choice is not an easy one but if a choice were unavoidable the absurdity would be less gross to say no man who is exposed to the action of interest will speak false—than to say no man who is exposed to the action of interest will speak true of a mans of every mans being subjected to the action of divers mendacityrestraining motives you may be always sure of his being subjected to the action of any mendacitypromoting motives you cannot be always sure but suppose you were sure does it follow because there is a motive of some sort prompting a man to lie that for that reason he will lie that there is danger in such a case is not to be disputed but does the danger approach to certainty this will not be contended if it did instead of shutting the door against some witnesses you ought not to open it to any an interest of a certain kind acts upon a man in a direction opposite to the path of duty but will lie obey the impulse that will depend upon the forces tending to confine him to that path—upon the prevalence of the one set of opposite forces or the other all bodies on or about the earth tend to the centre of the earth yet all bodies are not there all mountains have a tendency to fall into a level with the plains yet notwithstanding there are mountains all waters seek a level yet notwithstanding there are waves in a machine motion or rest will depend upon the proportion between the sum of the     impelling and the sum of the restraining forces in the human mind the result will be the same everything depends upon proportions and of any proportions in the case the man of law takes no more thought than the machine does upon the proportion between the impelling and the restraining forces it depends whether the waggon moves or no and at what rate it moves upon the proportion between the mendacitypromoting and the mendacityrestraining forces it depends whether any mendacity be produced or no and in what degree and quantity any interest interest of any sort and quantity sufficient to produce mendacity as rational would it be to say any horse or dog or flea put to a waggon is sufficient to move it to move it and set it arunning at the pace of a mailcoach in the human mind there is a force to which there is nothing exactly correspondent in the machine—the force of sensibility of sensibility with reference to the action of the various sorts of pains and pleasures and their respective sources in the character of motives take what everybody understands money for precisions sake take at once £ 0 the £ 0 of the day whatever be the ratio of it to the £ 0 of yesterday to the present purpose depreciation will not affect it this £ 0 will its action be the same in the bosom of crœsus as of crœsus in the bosom of diogenes as in that of catiline no man will fancy any such thing for a moment no man unless peradventure it have happened to him to have been stultified by legal science in each individual instance whether mendacity temptation presenting itself shall be produced or no will depend upon four distinguishable quantities quantities above indicated on the one side—  sum of the mendacitypromoting motives   the patients sensibility to ditto on the other side   sum of the mendacityrestraining motives regularly acting and occasional   patients sensibility to ditto upon these several quantities consequently upon the ratio or proportion of the sum of the quantities on the one side to that of the quantities on the other of the proportion the exclusionist knows not anything he knows not any of the quantities he will not suffer himself to know anything he regards mendacity as certain he excludes the evidence of none of these several quantities can anything be known or conjectured without examination and sifting of the evidence nothing can be known without experiment and he will not suffer experiment to be made it is in psychology as in shipbuilding and navigation suppose the ships way to depend upon the joint action of six influencing circumstances—six jointly acting but mutually conflicting causes and these each of them say for suppositions sake of equal force if in the investigations and reasonings on this subject so much as one of the six be omitted error is the inevitable consequence the forms of mathematical language instead of a check to the error will operate but as a cloak to it the vessel will be in one part of the world while the lagranges and the eulers are proving it to be in another in this respect what course of ratiocination has been pursued by lawyers debating on the ground of established systems of the whole catalogue of motives each capable of acting upon the will with the most efficient—all consequently with a practically equal force they have taken observation of perhaps one perhaps two while on each side or what is worse on one side only the will of the patient has been acted upon by perhaps twice or thrice the number what in consequence has been the justness of the conclusion much about what it would be in navigation if calculations made for a submarine vessel or an airballoon were to be applied to a ship of ordinary make and size or as if in calculating the course of an ordinary vessel no account were taken of the depth of water drawn by her or of the position of her sails in this state of the progress made by lawyers in the theory of psychology no wonder if we should find the theory and practice on the subject of evidence in no better plight than navigation was among the most polished nations of europe when the scene of it was confined to the mediterranean and when dreading to lose sight of land the navigator creat along the shore between these two otherwise resembling cases there is however one very material and lamentable difference in navigation ignorance deficient in adequate power erred by overcaution and timidity in jurisprudence ignorance supersaturated with power is driven aground continually by hastiness and rashness it would be tedious and surely by this time superfluous to pursue absurdity on this ground through all its mazes no presumption so slender which is not under some established system taken for conclusive if fact notorious or proveable fact run counter it makes no difference mendacity is presumed from affection—from bare wishes wishes themselves are presumed from situations from relations brother will be for brother master for servant servant for master and so on what when you see them fighting with one another every day is it for his excessive fondness for abel that cain would have been excluded by you no matter it makes no difference among the causes of exclusion in scotch jurisprudence imported or not from the continent     is this if a man applies to either party tendering his testimony observe first the absurdity of this exclusion and then the mischievousness of it absurdity what on the north side of the tweed does no such affection exist in any human bosom as the love of justice in a legal bosom it seems no any more than on the south side to the man born blind all colours are alike unknown but was ever blind man found absurd enough to deny or thoughtless enough to forget the existence of colours mischievousness mischief the first a man saw you robbed beaten left for dead him you for your part did not see you were too much engaged to him you on your part cannot apply to testify what he saw for you know not that he saw anything to yourself he on his part must not did you proffer that testimony of yours to the plaintiff asks the advocate on the other side yes i did oh then away with you tell it anywhere else you will you must not tell it here so sure as you opened your mouth so sure you would be perjured mischief the second directions to worthless witnesses to all who in the school of technical jurisprudence have learnt to hate justice to all who are in fact if any such there be as worthless as the man of law supposes every man to be if you see any man barbarously injured and to earn a bribe or save the trouble of testifying you desire he should be without remedy go and offer him your service if you see a man purloining public money making laws for honour breaking them for profit dont stand upon rules of evidence established for the plain purpose of giving impunity to malefactors dont slink under a plea that will ruin you with every man who has any regard for justice go to the prosecutor at once and force upon him your evidence the more obtrusive your address the surer you may make yourself of destroying the competency and if that wont do the credibility of your evidence to this rule such is its absurdity it can hardly have happened to be frequently acted upon but like every other absurd and mischievous rule of which the system is composed it lies in readiness well adapted to serve a cause too desperate to be served by less vile means—perfectly adapted to afford to longrobed iniquity the necessary pretence in this example we may see a specimen of the sort of evidence on the ground of which the technical lawyer builds a pretence for the exclusion of other evidence in partial affection say rather in preferable regard he sees evidence and that conclusive evidence of perjury as if to wish well to your friend and to perjure yourself for him were inseparable in the mere act of saying i saw so and so and am ready to testify what i saw they see evidence of partial affection—scoticojargonicè partial counsel as if it were impossible without injustice to wish to declare to justice what he saw compare scotch and english judicial science in scotland for informing the conscience of learned judges no spontaneous witnesses receivable in england for informing consciences of the same learned texture no witnesses receivable but willing ones† such is the metamorphosis undergone by learned justice in her passage from one side to the other of the tweed between willing and spontaneous there is certainly some difference the expression has carefully preserved it let jurisprudence make the most of it there is not an atom to be lost observe on this ground as on so many others the consistency of the men of law and especially english law delinquency according to them is not ever to be presumed yet as often as on the ground of danger of deception through falsehood they exclude evidence what is it they do but presume delinquency what is it as often as on this ground they exclude testimony that would otherwise be received by them in the character of evidence—what is it they do but presume perjury actual perjury no because their providence has prevented it actual perjury no more than actual murder when the pistol or gun having been fired a tutelary hand has just had time to beat down the guilty hand in the act of pulling the trigger actual perjury not committed but the state of the mind exactly as if it had perjury presumed not indeed for the punishing of the presumed perjurer but for the inflicting punishment or if that be not the word vexation on an innocent and injured man vexation to an unlimited extent suppose the excluded testimony necessary to save the life of a man capitally prosecuted as for murder here one man being presumed an intended perjurer another man suffers death‡     §   peculiar impropriety of exclusion on the ground of pecuniary interest and absurdities of english law under this head if on the ground of interest generally considered—if on the ground of any other species of interest in particular—the unreasonableness of exclusion is demonstrable—it is in the instance of pecuniary interest that it is most palpable in the case of any other species of interest—the interest not having any palpable physical cause the quantity of which might serve as an index and measure of its force—the strength of it where it is strong the weakness of it where it is weak is not so universally manifest and incontestable suppose for example it be contended that enmity known enmity is a reasonable ground of exclusion enmity like any other passion is variable ad infinitum in degree capable of existing in any the lowest degree as well as in the highest but the force of enmity as of almost every other passion except the love of money can no otherwise be measured than by its effects so that if in this or that instance no visible effects have followed from it the only proof of which the existence and action of it is susceptible is wanting to the case in the instance of pecuniary interest the argument stands upon a very different footing without reckoning the variations in degree resulting from the variations in the degree of opulence of which the pecuniary circumstances of the party are susceptible—the degrees of which the force of pecuniary interest is susceptible are not only prodigiously numerous but also in the lowest degrees susceptible of an existence as palpable and ponderable as in the highest as a thousand pounds applied in the shape of reward will be recognised as acting on the mind in the character of a lot of pecuniary interest with a force proportioned to its amount—so in like manner will a shilling a penny or a farthing the legislator and the administrator the great dealers in this species of ware can as well cut out in pennyworths and farthings worths the portion of pecuniary interest which they may be minded to create as in hundred pounds worths and thousand pounds worths and how questionable soever or even hopeless the influence of this species of interest may be when broken down into these minute and almost impalpable lots yet the existence of it in this case is not less manifest and indisputable than in the other thus it is that in the instance of pecuniary interest the impropriety of the exclusion is exposed to view by a circumstance which has no place in any other generally speaking no other species of interest appears so much as to exist but in cases in which it acts not with considerable force only but with effect it is not seen to exist but where it is seen to act nor is seen to act but where it is seen to triumph far otherwise is it with pecuniary interest the portions in which it is seen to exist are in many instances so minute that in those instances the notion of its prevalence is too palpably absurd to be embraced or so much as pretended to be embraced by anybody who for instance speaking of the people of england would take upon himself to maintain with a grave face that the majority of them would be ready upon all occasions each of them to perjure himself for the value of a farthing propositions however far beyond this in extravagance have been implicity assumed by many a decision that on this ground has issued from english benches an interest corresponding to some minute fraction of a farthing has in many instances been assumed as a legitimate cause for the exclusion of a witness on the sole ground of the pecuniary interest generated by that cause in vain would it be to say that this is among the cases in which we cannot draw the line and that therefore in order to shut out the evidence in the cases in which the sinister influence exerted on it by this species of interest would be operative and productive of the apprehended ill effect we must be content to shut it out in many instances in which manifestly enough it cannot be operative the very impossibility of drawing a line a proper line anywhere is an argument and that of itself a conclusive one against the exclusionary principle a line of this sort it must be confessed would in whatsoever place drawn be an improper one but by the principle of exclusion a line of this sort is not only drawn but drawn at the very worst place possible there is an impropriety in drawing the line for example at the sum of forty shillings and in laying down any such proposition as that which is implicitly contained in the court of conscience acts that a man is not to be trusted to give his evidence in a case where he has a sum of     money to that amount at stake upon the result of it there is an impropriety why in the first place because setting aside all such inscrutable circumstances as those which consist of psychological idiosynerasies affecting the sensibility of the individual in question to the respective action of the improbityandmendacityrestraining motives there are some incomes to which four hundred pounds are not more than forty shillings to others in the next place because even supposing it clear in the instance of any particular individual antecedently to experience that forty shillings would constitute a temptation sufficiently strong to engage him in the path of perjury—supposing it possible i say to find sufficient reason for predicating this of a sum of forty shillings—it would not be possible to find sufficient reason for refusing to predicate it of a sum of thirtynine shillings but by the line of exclusion drawn where it is drawn this effect is predicated not only of a sum of forty shillings or of a sum of thirtynine shillings but of a sum less and much less than the thirtyninth or fortieth part of the smallest piece of base metal that ever came out of a mint and this by a sweeping and unbending rule by which people of all degrees of opulence as well as indigence the crœsuses as well as the iruses the diveses as well as the lazaruses are excluded in the lump the force with which a motive of a pecuniary kind acts upon the mind of a given individual will be in the ratio of the sum in question to his pecuniary circumstances in england two individuals may be found one of them belonging to the most numerous class the income of one of whom is to that of the other as  00 to   all other circumstances set aside the force with which a given sum acts upon the mind of one of these individuals will be but one five hundredth part of the force with which it acts upon the mind of the other yet supposing this rule to be observed if on account of his being acted upon by the prospect of gaining in this way a given sum the testimony of the poorer of the two individuals in question is to be rejected so must that of the richer the same effect and that a certain one is to be ascribed for this purpose to two forces of which the one is in truth but the five hundredth part of the other in great britain an estate of the value of  0000 guineas ayear or thereabouts has been known to be at stake upon the event of a single cause value at thirty years purchase  00000 guineas a guinea contains a little more than  000 farthings this same sum then applied to persons whose incomes stand at different points in the scale from the highest to the lowest is capable of acting on them respectively with  000 different degrees of force  00000 being the number of guineas multiplying the  00000 by the  000 here then are  00000000 different degrees of force with which the mind of man is capable of being acted upon by this one motive called pecuniary interest to which by this rule one and the same degree of force and that in every case an irresistible one is ascribed thus different are the degrees of force with which this one among so many causes of falsehood checked by the action of so many counter causes—of so many causes of truth tends to the production of its effect degrees which by the identity of the denomination given to them viz pecuniary interest are represented as being the same from the mere consideration of this diversity it must be sufficiently evident that in a vast number of the instances in which this cause of falsehood has place its influence must practically speaking be equal to 0—not capable of surmounting the mere vis inertia of the human mind supposing this cause of action to stand alone unopposed by any other whereas the whole force of the standing causes of truth is what it has to encounter in every instance without reckoning the force of such of the causes of truth the action of which is but occasional yet this is the cause and indeed stands at the head of the list of the causes the force of which is by the rule which assumes it for a ground of peremptory exclusion regarded as being in every instance infinite and irresistible certain at least of preponderating over the sum of all other forces—of all causes of truth—to which it can happen to stand opposed to it if there were any sort of witnesses imaginable against whom it were prudence to shut the door the sort of witnesses against which the law is so decided to shut the door are precisely those to whom it may be thrown open with least danger all witnesses being exposed to seductive influence all witnesses being dangerous those will be least dangerous against whom men are most upon their guard such are those on whose foreheads the force of the seduction is written down in figures a cloud involves the workings of friendship a cloud involves the workings of enmity a cloud involves the workings of love the existence of the passion the force of its action everything is involved in darkness no juryman no stranger scarcely even the closest intimate can form any estimate of the degree of the enmity the friendship or the love experience may have shown him no such enmity no such friendship no such love but every man knows what ten shillings is what twenty shillings is and what is the difference every man knows the value—every man feels the power of money every     man knows that allowances are to be made for it few men are disposed to make less allowance than truth requires for the force of its action on other people few men are disposed to set the incorruptibility of other men at too high a rate or the force of corruption at too low a one few men there are in whom suspicious thus grounded are in any danger of not being carried up to the full limits of the truth few in whom they are not much more apt to be carried beyond the truth than to fall short of it of the force of money on whatever occasion acting the judge sitting on his bench is fully aware and acutely sensible agreed but is there any other human being to whom that force is a secret sits there that old woman anywhere not to confine ourselves to benches who on hearing a report made to her by another old woman forgets to ask herself in what way and degree if in any the reporting old woman may have to gain or lose by the credit given or not given to her report what can the man of law be sincere in thinking that no sort of men understand either the value of money or the influence of it upon testimony but himself in this case therefore the advantage expected from exclusion of evidence in the character of a security against deception and consequent misdecision is more plainly ideal than in any other the reason in favour of the exclusion more palpably frivolous and yet it is to this modification of interest that exclusion on the score of interest is in a manner confined by english jurisprudence in the eyes of the english lawyer one thing and one thing only has a value that thing is money on the will of man if you believe the english lawyer one thing and one thing only has influence that thing is money such is his system of psychological dynamics if you will believe the man of law there is no such thing as the fear of god no such thing as regard for reputation no such thing as fear of legal punishment no such thing as ambition no such thing as the love of power no such thing as filial no such thing as parental affection no such thing as party attachment no such thing as party enmity no such thing as public spirit patriotism or general benevolence no such thing as compassion no such thing as gratitude no such thing as revenge or what comes to the same thing—weighed against the interest produced by the value of a farthing the utmost mass of interest producible from the action of all those affections put together vanishes in the scale add selfpreservation if you please—selfpreservation from whatever be the worst of evils death not excepted—the farthing will still be heaviest a pin a day is a groat a year instead of the farthing put in a pin the result will be still the same romance romance true but it is the romance of real life the picture here drawn of the human mind is romantic enough no doubt but as to the account here given of that picture nothing was ever more strictly true such are the decisions of the sage of law such his every days practice such his opinions such his thoughts unless on learned benches decision and practice run on without thought for a farthing—for the chance of gaining the incommensurable fraction of a farthing no man upon earth no englishman at least that would not perjure himself this in westminster hall is science this in westminster hall is law according to the prints of the day £  0000 was the value of the property left by the late duke of bridgewater for a fraction of a farthing aristides with the dukes property in his pocket would have perjured himself one decision i meet with that would be amusing enough if to a lover of mankind there could be anything amusing in injustice a man is turned out of court for a liar not for any interest that he has but for one which he supposed himself to have the case being otherwise instead of turning the man out of court might not the judge have contented himself with setting him right would not the judges opinion have done as well as a release† the pleasant part of the story is that the fact on which the exclusion is grounded could not have been true for before the witness could be turned out of court for supposing himself to have an interest he must have been informed of his having none consequently at the time when he was turned out he must have ceased to suppose that be had any  00 another offence for which i find a man pronounced a liar seems to make no bad match with the foregoing it was for being a man of honour oh ho you are a man of honour are you out with you then—you have no business here being asked whether he did not look upon himself as bound in honour to pay costs for the party who called him supposing him to lose the cause and whether such was not his intention—his answer was in the affirmative and he was rejected it was taken for granted that he would be a liar why because he had shown he would not be one if instead of saying yes he had said no who could have refused to believe him and what would have become of the pretence by the supposition the witness is a man of superordinary probity moral obligation naked moral obligation has on him the force of law what is the conclusion of the exclusionist that this man of uncommonly nice honour will be sure to perjure himself to save himself from incurring a loss which he cannot be compelled to take upon himself to observe in an instructive point of view the cases where the exclusionist runs a tilt as here against a phantom of pecuniary interest—contrast them with the cases to be next mentioned in which notwithstanding its being pregnant with that same interest in its most palpable shape he gives his permit to the evidence §   exceptions to the exclusionary rule in english law—reasons of the exceptions subversive of the general rule what has happened in this instance and what in this as well as so many other instances is the best thing that could happen to the laws of our jurisprudential solons—they are contradicted contradicted by themselves and at every turn exceptions selfcontradictions spring up everywhere under their feet exceptions and as far as they extend all reasonable reasonable and why because the rule itself being fundamentally absurd everything must be reasonable which goes to narrow its extent in considering the exceptions as reasonable understand the practice viz the act of admission and no more for as to the reasons on which it has been built they may be reasonable or absurd in any degree the practice is what it is before i enter upon the consideration of the particular exceptive rules each characterized and supported by its appropriate reason it becomes necessary to explain what sort of a thing it is which under the name of a reason one meets with in the books of english common law commonlaw reasons may be distinguished in the first place into technical reasons and vulgar reasons by technical reasons are  0  meant reasons that have nothing to do with utility technical as applied to reasons is an appellative invented by english lawyers to denote such modes of speaking as would not pass for reasons upon anybody but themselves reasons peculiar to the art the science the profession by a reason speaking with reference to a law or rule of law an unlearned man would be apt to understand a consideration the tendency of which is to prove the law or rule of law to be conformable to the principle of utility i e productive of more good than evil these vulgar or popular reasons a learned man will sometimes condescend to take up when they happen to fall in his way but the favourite the privileged reasons are of course the professional the scientific the transcendental—in a word the technical reasons as above described leaving the scientific reasons to scientific men as not being fit to be spoken of under the name of reasons by vulgar lips i confine the application of the word reasons when employed without any such additament to such reasons of the vulgar cast as on the occasion in question have been honoured by the adoption given to them by scientific pens a great book according to the greek proverb is a great evil a law besides what belongs to it as a book is at any rate an evil great or little to form a tolerably correct judgment concerning any law in respect of the question whether the good or the evil tendencies of it predominate—in a word to form his judgment on the question on which side the balance is—every legislation and writer on legislation who understands his business proceeds in his accounts as a perchant does in his has a debtor side as well as a creditor and neglects not any more to make his entries on one side than on the other in the books of english lawyers the ways of speaking which one meets with under the name of reasons are confined for the most part to one side such is the case in particular with the reasons corresponding to the several particular rules by which so many groups of exceptions have been attached to the general rule of exclusion on the score of pecuniary interest to the rule itself no reason at all appears ever to have been annexed the utility of it has been established by assertion and assumption without so much as an attempt to find a reason for it to the exception has been attached a reason such as it is a reason of course in favour of the exceptive rule—a reason on that one side the reason having been thus exhibited its conclusiveness has been presumed as a matter of course no marks are discoverable on this ground at least of any such suspicion as that in the accountbook kept by a legislator supposing him to keep any there should be two sides on the present occasion in presenting a sample of learned reason on this ground i shall confine myself to the case of an extraneous witness the case in which the pecuniary interest at stake is that which a man possesses in the character of a party in the cause plaintiff or defendant is reserved for another place for in this latter case jurisprudence and more particularly english jurisprudence will be found variegated by inconsistencies for which in the situation of an extraneous witness there is no place in point of propriety the exclusion stands in both cases on nearly the same ground if there be any difference it is this—viz that sum for sum the exclusion is more plainly useless in the case of the party than in the case of the extraneous witness why because the interest by which the will is acted upon in a sinister direction is in the case of a party more conspicuously painted upon the face of the situation in which he stands deception is therefore so much the less probable the mind of the judge be he who he may is so much the less in danger of not being sufficiently forewarned against it i exception the mist—interest against interest unless the rule out of which the exception is taken he supposed to be bad in toto the reason of the exception if it has any supposes all other circumstances equal and the quantity of money creative of the interest the same on both sides against the truth of this supposition there is exactly infinity to one the number of possible ratios is infinite of these the ratio of equality is one of the proportion between interest and interest the exception takes no cognizance no mention of it is made† ii exception the second—the interest contingent‡  0  the assumptions here are two—  that in human affairs at least in human affairs of this stamp a line is already drawn between certainty and contingency   that no contingent interest can be equal to any certain one whence came this postulate from euclid from price—from the stock exchange—from lloyds coffeehouse the postulate once admitted demonstrations follow in any quantity and to any effect   that—in the case above alluded to of the duke with his £  0000 ayear his title to the whole of it being contested the duke at the point of death his only son called on his part as a witness the estate unsettled son and father upon the terms that all fathers and all sons ought to be—the son would be a good witness why because his interest is not vested is not certain is no better than contingent secus if the estate be in settlement sixpence ayear settled on the son the father in full vigour the son in a galloping consumption father and son like henry ii and his sons for here le interest del fitz est certain et nemy contingent can it be necessary to observe that in human affairs in matters of gain and loss especially—more particularly in matters of gain and loss that depend upon law—the difference between contingency and certainty is but in name—that what is called a certainty for even death itself is contingent as to time is but a contingency in which the ratio expressive of the degree of probability is more or less greater than in the other case can it be necessary to observe that there is not that contingent sum for which the exact equivalent in a sum called by everybody a certain one is not to be found the lawyer by whose decrees the operations of the money market are governed and perplexed—are they all a secret to him what charityboy what beggarboy was ever at a loss to know that the tossup of a halfpenny was worth a farthing alas when will the wisdom of the sages of the law rise to a level with that of babes and sucklings observe what the £  0000 ayear loses in value by being contingent instead of certain the proportional number of fathers by whom their only children are disinherited is—what shall we say say one out of a thousand say even one out of a hundred and eighty the value of the £  0000 is reduced by this circumstance to what—to £   000 great debates in the days of the schoolmen concerning the comparative value in point of interest of a possible angelship and a present mouseship mr justice would be clearly for the mouse   keeper and concubine keeper rich

exception the third—but here a difficulty occurs a reason to be susceptible of correct scrutiny—a reason like any other proposition should have for its vehicle some determinate and complete grammatical sentence but among the words or assemblages of words which on this ground assume the guise and port of reasons no such propositions no such sentences are to be found what is found consists of here and there a catchword or two out of which if others were added to them reasons of some sort or other might peradventure be composed take for example the words necessity course of trade the matter of gibbons book has been not unaptly stated to be not history but allusions to history the sort of matter here in question may in like manner be said to consist not of reasons but of allusions to reasons   jeweller delivers jewels to his journeyman to deliver them over to a customer journeyman steals them thief good witness  0  to prove delivery why because in speaking of the transaction occasion may be taken to use the words course of trade trade is certainly a good thing but quære what can it be the better for a sort of evidence which in each instance will most probably if not certainly give the goods away from the right owner to a thief secus it the jeweller himself had delivered them for this is not in the course of trade no shopkeeper was ever known to serve a customer with his own hands observe the difference in case of mendacity the jeweller has no interest to serve but that of gaining the value of the jewels the journeyman has that same value to gain and his life to save but in the english lawyers pricebook life is worth nothing reputation worth as little except when money is to be got by parting with it   action for the price of goods sold by factorage factor paid at   per cent question about the price agreed on whether £ 0000 or £  000 if £  000 factor gets £ 0 which if £ 0000 he does not get factor a good witness why because here too you may say course of trade had the factor delivered £ 0 worth of his own goods with his own hands there being nobody else to prove it he would have lost the money for here you cannot say course of trade if in the one case the profit from perjury supposing perjury is no greater than in the other—how much greater the mischief how much greater the loss to gain his £ 0 the factor must in the first case have inflicted on the party injured a loss of twenty times as much in a case of this sort and there are plenty of them some instead of course of trade say necessity the one word is as good as the other any other as good as either of them approve the exception you must first have condemned the rule with reference to what event can it be necessary to admit a species of evidence which is more likely to be productive of injustice than justice for such as we have seen is the fundamental proposition which in point of reason forms the necessary and only basis of the rule with reference to what desirable end to the avoidance of injustice to say so would be a contradiction in terms in these three words course of trade may be seen a complete confutation of the rule a complete disavowal of the principle of it a complete certificate of the nonexistence of that danger which constitutes the sole reason of the rule course of trade—and of what trade of every branch of trade from the highest to the lowest course of dealing—of dealings of all sorts—of every days dealings between man and man the persons exposed to the action of this sinister interest—of this interest which sinister as it is pecuniary as it is as well as so much beyond pecuniary forms no bar to their testimony—are persons of the lowest as well as most numerous order servants and daylabourers while the interest the pecuniary interest of itself rises to any magnitude and with this example not only before your eyes but in your mouths you take upon you to deprive justice of the light of evidence on pretence of interest iv exception the fourth—interest created by a wager a wager laid by the witness on the event of the cause reason for the exception a man ought not to have it in his power to deprive another of the benefit of his testimony† what not to deprive him of a sort of testimony which in your view of the matter is sure to be stained by perjury and to produce misdecision and injustice one thing on one occasion another thing on another occasion one individual must not have it in his power to deprive another of the benefit of his testimony how often do they not these lawyers give that same power to individuals in other instances—how often do they not execute it themselves blessed law a law authorizing parties to hire witnesses and witnesses to be hired—a law establishing a market overt for hired witnesses—effect given to the practice and nothing said against it wagering thus employed is subornation nor yet simple subornation but subornation double distilled subornation simply distilled is £ 00 promised by plaintiff to witness to be received if plaintiff gains the cause a wager of £ 00 between plaintiff and witness plaintiff laying that he loses the cause witness that he gains it acts with double the force‡ in the case of the simple loser  0  though plaintiff should lose the cause witness will indeed gain nothing but neither will he lose in the case of the wager plaintiff losing the cause witness will not only gain nothing but he will forfeit as much as in the other case he would have gained v exception the fifth— after observing the cases in which the excluding rules have been broken through for reasons proper in themselves but yet no otherwise proper than on the supposition of the impropriety of the rule—it may be curious enough to observe a case in which the rule is broken through on the ground of a circumstance out of which nothing like a reason can be made or is so much as attempted to be made a time there was when the witness was not exposed to the action of the sinister interest to the action of which he is exposed now that he is called upon to speak well and what then what follows that at that time had he been examined the cause which exists for suspecting him would not at that time have existed but for not existing then does it exist the less at present question a man who at the time of his examination has an interest in the cause—is he an admissible witness he having had no interest at the time of the supposed fact decision in the affirmative because he was under no temptation when he had not to speak therefore when he is to speak knowing him to be under temptation you are to suppose him not to be so just as if a pilot were to say in a storm the vessel among the breakers sit still there is no danger why so because yesterday it was a dead calm vi exception the sixth voire dire† truth expected in spite of interest one point of practice more may put a finish to this exclusionary rule and the deviations from it when a witness produced against you has an interest in the business meaning always a pecuniary interest and you cannot get other evidence of it or do not care to be at the expense you address yourself to the witness himself and ask him whether he has or no if he speaks truth he is turned out if he perjures himself he is heard this operation is called examining a witness upon the voire dire voire dire is in law french to tell the truth and the examination is called voire dire because upon this occasion the witness is called upon and expected to tell the truth no such requisition being made nor result expected in other cases the practice and the name found for it are not ill matched speak the truth indeed so on this occasion he is to speak truth is he what is it then that he is to speak on other occasions on the exclusionary principle no supposition was ever more completely felo de se if the man has no interest they make sure in the first place that he will not speak the truth and though he have an interest still they expect him to speak the truth on the principle of universal admission nothing would be more consistent nothing more rational than the practice if the situation the witness stands in exposes him to the action of a mendacitypromoting interest he will speak under a bias the judge should know of it that he may put himself on his guard mendacious it may happen to him to be respecting this collateral fact as well as the principal one but mendacious he cannot be in both facts without exposing himself to double danger bad as a passport to jargonicè say competency the examination is good as affording a clue to credibility in a modern book which lies before me the practice of examination on a voire dire is spoken of as being at present out of use how the practice itself can be out of use i do not very well conceive i can conceive the phrase to be out of use—and if it be so much the better a man might look a good while even in the vocabulary of english law before he would find so silly a one come my honest friend i am going to put some questions to you to the first of them the court expects you to speak truth to the others as you please‡  0  we have now seen that if it were in the nature of pecuniarilyinterested evidence to give birth to any such systematical plan of legal depredation as upon a partial and hasty  0  view might seem the inevitable consequence the cases in which notwithstanding the influence of the principle of exclusion this seemingly dangerous species of evidence is actually admitted are of sufficient extent to have long ago let in the mischief in full force at the same time a matter of fact universally notorious is that no symptoms of the prevalence of any such mischief have ever manifested themselves so far is the public from ever having been laid under contribution by a system of depredation grounded on mendacity as in the case supposed—so far has been the practice of laying individuals under contribution in this way by false evidence from being realized to such a degree as to have become a prevalent practice—that even the rewards offered to informers—the standing invitations by which men are called upon at all times to lay offenders under contribution without prejudice to truth and to the great benefit of justice—are not excepted to an extent sufficient to give to the laws thus endeavoured to be supported the degree of efficacy which the interest of the public in that behalf renders so desirable men are not so forward as could be wished to dig for emolument in the mine of litigation even by the invitation and under the full protection of the law can it be looked upon with reason as a mischief seriously to be apprehended that men should be more forward than at present to embark in the same intricate adventure with the reproach of mendacity and injustice pressing all the while upon their consciences and with the fear of punishment and infamy before their eyes chapter iv impropriety of exclusion on the ground of improbity §   convicted perjury an improper ground of exclusion third general cause of exclusion on the score of deception—improbity interest is not in any shape a proper ground of exclusion improbity in whatever shape or degree is still farther from being a proper ground of exclusion entire assurance of mendacity neither ought to be nor is received as a ground for the exclusion of theassuredly mendacious testimony so far from it that on the contrary that sort of evidence which is most assuredly mendacious is when applied in the manner that all mankind are in the habit of applying it regarded even by lawyers as the best evidence evidence in which both causes of suspicion are united and each in the highest degree is received in every days practice to the great advantage of and without any prejudice or so much as suspicion of prejudice to justice and this where in case of deception the mischief would be at its highest pitch these several propositions either have been or it is hoped will be established by sufficient proofs let us begin with perjury in perjury may be seen by far the strongest case the case in which the pretence for exclusion on the score of security against deception wears the fairest outside perjury is a particular modification of improbity but a modification particularly appropriate to the present purpose improbity at large according as it is more or less frequently displayed indicates an habitual or at least frequent prevalence of the force of the improbitypromoting over that of the tutelary or improbityrestraining motives a force impelling the individual into this or that line of immorality and misconduct according to the nature of the seducing motive or motives acting in each individual case perjury in addition to the prevalence of the ordinary motives on some individual occasion or occasions indicates the particular species of delinquency into which the individual has thus been impelled viz mendacity the very species by which the most plausible of all pretences for exclusion on the ground of improbity is afforded in any other case the argument for the exclusion is no more than this he has violated the obligations of morality in some sorts of ways therefore it is more or less probable that he will upon occasion violate them in this sort of way in the case of mendacity it runs thus he has violated the obligations of morality not only in other sorts of ways but in this very sort of way on former occasions therefore it is more or less probable that so he will on the occasion now in hand  0  for suspicion a most perfectly proper ground for rejection none whatever reasons those already mentioned to which may be added those which follow   in this line of delinquency beyond most if not all others the scale is lengthy the degrees are numerous the highest degree upon a level with murder the lowest that sort of conduct shall it be called misconduct which is openly and habitually practised by english jurymen—countenanced approved recommended by english judges to all these different levels the eye of judicial suspicion has the power of adjusting itself exclusion knows no gradations blind and brainless it has but one alternative—shut or open like a valve up or down like a steamengine instead of conniving at the exclusionary system long ago would the legislator everywhere if wisdom had been as easily displayed as power exercised have exhibited a scale of this sort for judicial suspicion to guide itself by an attempt of this sort will be found in an ensuing book   when the door of the witnessbox is shut against a proposed witness on this score it is generally on the ground of some single transgression of this sort but a single transgression of this sort—what does it prove the violated ceremony apart a concomitant purely accidental having no connexion other than accidental with the nature of the mendacity nor with its pernicious consequences the conviction proves no more than this—viz that on one assignable occasion the convict has been known to fall into that sort of transgression which every human adult must also have fallen into more times than one on occasions assignable or unassignable i said says the psalmist—i said in my wrath all men are liars it was in his wrath that the observation came from him but he need not have wished to retract it in his coolest moments from a single lie told in the course of ever so long a life a man may without any grammatical impropriety be denominated a liar but admitting that in this sense the being a liar is what without exception might be predicated of every human being that ever arrived at mans estate the truth of the proposition would not be incompatible with a probability on the side of veracity to the amount on each given occasion of many millions to one and upon the whole he who considers how few in comparison are the occasions in which any advantage howsoever impure and overbalanced by ultimate disadvantage is to be gained by falsehood will i imagine join with me in the opinion that from the mouth of the most egregious liar that ever existed truth must have issued at least a hundred times for once that falsehood wilful falsehood has taken its place again no man is the same as himself at all times it has been said of wisdom—it may be said and with equal truth of probity it may be said and not altogether without truth of veracity that most important because allextensive branch of probity the mind of which the force has sunk under the temptation at one time may stand against it at another the same mind has its stronger moments and its weaker moments without taking into the account that sort of revolution so much oftener talked of than exemplified a thorough change on the part of the temptation likewise the strength of it is liable to variation as hath been already noted upon a scale distinguishable to an infinity of degrees from a mans having borne false witness in some one instance or even as we shall see presently without any such warrant and merely from his having done or thought or having been supposed to have done or thought something wrong in some other way that has nothing to do with falsehood it is inferred and that with the most peremptory assurance that he will never bear true witness in the whole course of his life an induction and  0  such an induction grounded on a single instance to pronounce a man guilty of any other offence without the opportunity of a hearing is allowed to be the summit of injustice to pronounce a man in the same manner guilty of an intention to commit perjury is given on this occasion as a most refined invention for the furtherance of justice he was heard it may be said he was heard before he was pronounced guilty of the fact on which the incapacitation was grounded—he was heard yes but upon what occasion on the occasion on which he is deemed incredible no but on the occasion of a transaction altogether different which may have happened yesterday it is true but between which and the occasion in question an interval of half a century may for any provision the rule makes to the contrary have clapsed the exclusionist at any rate is estopped from representing conviction of perjury as a mark of distinction between the unfortunate liar in question and other men according to him—perjured or unperjured before—every man for the most trifling profit is ready to commit perjury from all this is any such inference to be drawn as that perjury is a light matter that it is no stain upon a mans character that it affords no presumption against the truth of his testimony in succeeding instances far be it from me to have harboured for a moment any such conceit what i am contending against let it never be out of sight is absolute rejection rejection in all cases—not suspicion and distrust the very repugnance with which it is but natural the reader should have received the proposition of opening the door of justice to testimony of this tainted kind is a sort of proof and earnest of the safety of the measure the same precipirate emotion under the influence of which the man of experience the man of law has so generally shut the door against testimony thus stigmatized may be expected to act upon the whole with equal force and with quite as much as its due force even upon men of his own elevated level much more upon the unthinking multitude below so broad so prominent is the stigma—so conspicuous and impressive the warning which it gives—the danger is not that the man thus distinguished should gain too much credence but that he should not gain enough fœnum habet in cornu suppose an inexorable door shut against him or although open suppose an inexorably deaf ear turned to him and observe the consequence—that crimes all imaginable crimes may be committed with impunity with sure impunity on his person and in his presence when the perjurer is a principal in the cause—when the person on whose part false testimony is apprehended apprehended on the ground of false testimony given in a former instance and the person whose purpose would be served by the false testimony whose interest it is apprehended may be the efficient cause of such false testimony are one and the same in this case it is only on the part of one person that the improbity is presumed and in his instance the presumption is but too well justified by former experience but suppose the perjurer not himself a party but only called in by a party in the character of a witness how stands the presumption then without subornation on the one part perjury on the other part is in this case i do not say an impossible crime but at any rate not a natural one spontaneous perjury to serve a person who knows nothing of it and who therefore does not so much as conceive himself to be obliged by it is certainly a possible case but it is not a natural one but if perjury on the part of the witness supposes on the part of the party a sort of subornation more or less explicit—how stands the danger how stands the supposition when to produce the apprehended mischief criminality and in this high degree on the part of two different persons must have taken place on the part of one of them the presumption indeed has a ground to stand upon but on the part of the other it has no ground will it be said that the invoking in this way the aid of a person thus exposed to suspicion affords a suspicion but too natural of a connexion in guilt the suspicion might have some force if on all occasions or on most occasions a man had his choice of witnesses but in general the case affords no such choice chance—the same chance which gives birth to the offence or other cause of dispute to the offence if real or to the event which disproves the reality of it if the accusation be groundless—this same chance brings to the spot the witnesses by whose testimony if obtainable the cause is to be decided to have his witnesses to drag out of the house and the very bosom of the adversary is no uncommon case cases however there are in which a man has usually his choice of witnesses—actual obserring witnesses to the transaction—eventual deposing witnesses in case of litigation i mean the case of attesting witnesses to conveyances and other contracts apply the rule of exclusion for perjury to this case because my witness has since perjured himself am i to be deprived of my estate  0  in considering whether improbity and in particular whether this strongest case of it ought in point of policy to be considered as a ground for the exclusion of testimony—the consequences in point of utility to the public taken in all its parts have on this occasion as on every other been taken by me for the standard of right and wrong but the consideration of these consequences—has it in general been the efficient cause of the decisions given on this head in the established systems of jurisprudence to a certain degree yes exclusively certainly not in the legislation and jurisprudence of various nations and of england among others the offender not the community injured by the offence has been the object in view—antipathy not benevolence the prevailing motive infamy and as a visible sign of infamy exclusion from the sanctuary of justice has been a lot of punishment superadded to what other lots were found at hand a sort of makeweight punishment to fill up the measure it is one of the instances which in but too great number may be found in the english as well as other established systems of the sort of punishment that has been called misseated punishment punishment in alienam personam a sort of punishment which in this particular application of it may be styled chancemedley punishment the punishment does not fall upon the witness who is disqualified but upon all persons who may have need of his evidence a certain person has offended and to add a sting to his punishment an unoffending crowd is collected below and a pailful of punishment is thrown down upon their heads out of a window an innocent stranger is laid hold of and a sword run through his hody that with the point of it a useless scratch may be given to the cartiff who has provoked all this vengeance §   inconsistencies of english law under this head under english jurisprudence the testimony of a proposed witness if previously convicted of perjury is altogether inadmissible so says the general rule not that exceptions are altogether wanting   exception the first—a piece of parchment called a record having been rendered necessary—if anybody has contrived to keep it out of the way for a few minutes the perjurers evidence is good evidence† what the record such part of it as is not itself mendacious can exhibit of the case is as nothing in comparison with what the judges notes might show or the testimony of another person present at the trial on which the perjury was committed but production of the lying parchment produces fees production of the other evidence would not yield fees the oracular and sacred character attributed in the books to everything that bears the name of a record is grounded on the supposition that the instrument if not the composition of the judge has at any rate been authenticated by his perusal this supposition unless by the merest accident is never true while all this honour is paid to the spurious document the genuine one which actually is the composition of the judge himself who tried the cause passes unregarded admitting the judges notes as the best of all evidence when it happens to be attainable is one species of evidence there is which cannot but exist a species of evidence scarcely inferior to the judges notes and greatly superior rationally speaking to the secondhand as well as uncircumstantial evidence furnished by the copy of the record and which is sure to be not only attainable but actually present and that without expense this is no other than the evidence of the perjured witness himself whose conviction on the account in question is supposed to have taken place this however is too sure and simple and cheap a method of coming at the   0 truth to be allowed of an observation that appears to have been made on this subject is that when a man has been convicted of a crime it would be an unpleasant thing to him to speak of it and thence it is that a man whose testimony if admitted will be sure to be delusive for that is the supposition is to be admitted to give this delusive testimony rather than that any questions should be put to him concerning a fact on which perjury without detection would be impossible but if its being unpleasant to a man is a reason for not asking him a question à fortiori it ought to be a reason for not punishing him for how unpleasant soever it may be to a man to say i have been whipped pilloried or transported the operation of whipping pillorying or transporting should one would think be still more so in no possible case can the unpleasant circumstance in question the punishment if it is to be called one be surer of not falling upon one who is innocent than in the present for if he to whom the question is thus put whether he has been convicted of such or such an offence never was convicted of it—how it should ever happen to him to forswear himself and answer in the affirmative unless he takes a pleasure in forswearing himself to his own prejudice is scarcely to be conceived how well disposed soever a man may be to be unjust to others there seems to be no great danger of his being disposed to do injustice to himself this preference of the interests of the guilty to those of the innocent how absurd soever in all cases will at least have the effect it aims at in the case where if a witness is not liable to be exposed by his own confession he is not liable to be exposed at all in those cases some such there are where no other evidence of specific criminality is permitted to be adduced but where the difference in point of unpleasantness is no more than what there is between the confessing his own guilt and the having it proved to his face by evidence which is deemed still more convincing such as the production of the record of his conviction—what possible use there is in this tenderness even to the criminal to whom it is shown seems not very easy to point out   exception the second—where the stain upon the testimony has been done away by any of the approved restoratives of which in the chapter of restoratives†   exception the third—where the testimony being selfregarding viz that of a defendant is delivered in the shape of affidavit evidence and in relation to the irregularity of a judgment in which such person is a party this then must have been in a civil suit what if in a criminal suit try the cause and then you will know examine the authorities and the farther you examine the farther you will be from knowing the reason is a good one provided always that the rule be in the first place acknowledged to be absurd and mischievous it hath been ruled that a conviction of perjury doth not disable a man from making an affidavit in relation to the irregularity of a judgment in a cause where such person is a party for otherwise he must suffer all injustice‡ and would have no way to help himself but it can only be read in defence of a charge i e against a charge and not in support of a complaint∥ not that in the sort of case thus excepted the reason is by any means so good as in the other sort of case so carefully distinguished all other evidence being supposed in both cases unattamable—in what respect is a man less exposed to suffer all injustice by not being admitted to give his own testimony in suppost of a complaint of his own than by not being admitted to give it for the purpose of defending himself against a charge in other words in what respect is he less exposed to suffer injustice by not being permitted to give his own testimony in his own behalf when plaintiff than when defendant on the contrary the danger he would be exposed to from injustice would be greater if the proposition were reversed debarred from being heard as a witness for himself in the character of defendant he is exposed to no injuries but such as may be attempted to be inflicted on him by the intervention of the hand of justice debarred from being heard as a witness for himself in the character of plaintiff he is exposed to all injuries without exception from a charge he cannot in the way of conviction be a sufferer but upon the supposition of a suit of some kind or other instituted and perjury committed or at least misrepresentation made in support of it with the judge upon the watch to protect him against it in this case the scene of the injury lies in curiâ and there he has the probity and compassion of the judge for his defence in the opposite case it has lain jargonicè in pays and there whom had he for his defender if the adversary had ordinary prudence seconded by ordinary good fortune nobody suppose yourself for a moment gentle reader in this unpleasant predicament put into it not by any perjury of your own you would not forgive me the supposition but by the united perjury of two wicked adversaries invited by these lawyers your enemy being stronger than yourself     and catching you alone may beat you to a jelly or if it be more agreeable to him first having tied you to the bedpost he violates your wife and your daughter they also being perjurers or quakers in your presence of himself the privilege thus given him could hardly have occurred to him but he has overheard a lawyer brag of it as a good joke or he he has found it in a book by accident examine the case in another point of view and now with the eye of an exclusionist you may see another reason for taking the exception if an exception there must be elsewhere rather than here let it be in his own cause and therefore in his own behalf here is interest in the case and to a certainty whereas if the cause be one to which he is not a party and in which he has no natural interest perjury on his part if unbribed will be without a motive nor can he be bribed without a person able and willing and bold enough to offer him a bribe three conditions which do not meet in one person every day there remains yet one part of the case which on different occasions has been brought to view already when the most suspicious of all evidence so far as improbity is concerned is received in what shape is it received in the shape of vivâ voce evidence the deponent present in court to be examined and crossexamined by the adversary and the judge oh no this is exactly the shape in which the door was just now expressly shut against it oh no the dish must be served up in the shape of affidavit evidence dressed at leisure with an attorney to dish it up a licensed accomplice to help cook the poison and no taster to detect it thus in regard to the exclusions grounded on improbity stands the matter upon the face of the books but such is the infelicity of the subject such the felicity of the profession there is no trusting even to the freshest of their books the apparent uncertainty of the law is such as we have already had a glimpse of and such as we shall see in a fuller and fuller light in proportion as we advance but the real and latent uncertainty of the law i speak always of the common law is still deeper and more profound ever unfathomable essentially fluctuating such is the ocean such is the common law inquiring among professional friends the degree of observance given to the rules excluding witnesses on the ground of improbity i learn that judges may in this point of view be divided into three classes some treating the objection as an objection to credit not to competency admit the witness suffer his evidence to go to the jury presenting the objection at the same time warning the jury of the force of it and when thus warned leaving them to themselves if after this warning the jury convict a man of whose guilt the judge from whom they have thus received the warning is not satisfied—thence follows as a matter of course a recommendation to mercy—whence follows as a matter also of course a pardon another class suffer the testimony to be given but if they do not find it corroborated by other testimony direct the jury to acquit paying no regard to it a third class again if they understand that no other evidence is to follow refuse in spite of all authorities so much as to suffer the jury to hear the evidence† of what individuals these several classes are respectively composed i do not know and should be very sorry to be obliged to know the object in all these cases is the preservation of the innocent to this object there are these three roads all equally effectual—the first a rational course and conformable to law meaning always the published the known the knowable dispensations of the law—the second arbitrary assuming selfwilled trespassing upon the regard due to the free agency of juries unconformable to the spirit of the constitution but containing nothing absolutely repugnant to any peremptory injunction of the law—the third equally and completely repugnant to reason and to law under the jurisprudence of ancient rome the great and powerful judge called the prætor used at the commencement of his prætorship to hang up for the information of the suitors in a conspicuous situation in some public place a table of the rules by which he proposed to govern himself during his year of the three different courses taken as above mentioned in relation to the same business by so many classes of english judges i having no other interest in being informed than what i possess in the general capacity of an english subject should be unwilling to know which on any given occasion has been or would be taken by any individual judge but in the capacity of a prosecutor in any of the cases in question were it ever my misfortune to find myself standing in that capacity it would certainly be highly material to me to procure if it were possible two tables     the one a standing one containing the names of the twelve judges each being accompanied with the designation of that one of the above three courses which it is his practice to pursue the other an occasional one containing the names of the judges who upon the trial of the cause in which i was in a way to be prosecutor would be destined to preside if the judge i saw reason to expect was a judge who would suffer a jury to hear and to act as if they heard i would under his auspices take my chance for bringing the truth to light but if he were either a judge who would not suffer a jury to hear or one who would not suffer them to act as if they heard most certainly i would have nothing to do that i could avoid doing in the way of prosecution under the direction of such a judge it would be equally incumbent on me to decline bearing a part in any such sham trial whether i consulted the rules of personal prudence or those of social duty—whether i regarded the effect of such a prosecution in the way of burthen on my own finances and my own ease or in the way of example on the conduct of those to whom in the capacity of persons exposed to the temptation of offending information of the practice in this behalf might be of importance the example is bad when a man supposed to be guilty is seen to remain unprosecuted but the example is much worse when a man supposed to be guilty is seen to be prosecuted but prosecuted under circumstances in which it may be and is known beforehand that prosecution will be to no purpose saving always the impoverishment and harassment of the prosecutor impoverished and harassed already by the injury—impoverished and harassed commonly still more by the fallaciously offered and really withholden remedy the escape for want of prosecution is the simple escape of a guilty man from punishment the escape taking place after prosecution and effected by such means is an example of the triumph of him who is guilty and of the punishment of him who is innocent and injured §   improbity in other shapes an improper ground of exclusion if from that modification of improbity which consists in a breach of veracity on the very sort of occasion in question viz judicial testimony no sufficient ground for exclusion can be deduced—much less it is evident can it from improbity manifesting itself in any other shape english jurisprudence furnishes in this part of the field a rich harvest of learning which whoever has an appetite for absurdity may go and feast upon at the table spread for him by hawkins bacon and comyns with their everclashing authorities looking into the offence for this purpose bring a process to which thought howsoever misapplied is necessary and thought being attended with trouble sages have substituted a more expeditions operation which is the looking at the punishment treasons felonies unclergyable and clergyable præmunires misdemeanours by these denominations are expressed all the distinctions they know of in point of malignity or say improbity between one group of offences and another and except the obscure and mostly incongruous intimation given of the nature of the offence in the case of treason and the undistinguishable intimation of misconduct or delinquency in general conveyed by the term misdemeanour none of these terms afford any the slightest intimation of any intrinsic quality in the offence itself nor of anything else belonging to it but the accidental circumstance of the punishment that has been attached to it† a system of arrangement is good or bad instructive or fallacious according as the objects ranked under the same division possess more or fewer properties in common in the system in question the objects not possessing any essential properties in common—any inference grounded on the place occupied by the object in the system must in the case of this system as of any other be preportionably inconclusive to make a complete perambulation of the whole chaos would for this or any other purpose require volumes upon volumes a sample or two must serve instead of a complete list to judge of offences by punishments the most detestable of mankind should be found in the class of traitors treason being the sort of act most offensive to those whose dependent creatures judges used to be treason is in the eye of jurisprudential law the very pinnacle of improbity in the character of a witness a traitor of course supposing him to remain with his bowels in his body never could be heard reason unless the case were particularized would never know what to think of it of what sort of disposition if of any to regard it as evidentiary—whether of     vice or of virtue enemies must be resisted—traitors must be punished but to a traitor it may happen to be among the most profligate or the most virtuous of mankind occasions there are in abundance on which traitor or no traitor depends upon bad success or good success take a monarchy and suppose the title to the crown the legitimacy for instance of the heir apparent of the last monarch to be in dispute half the people believe the legitimacy the other half disbelieve it each half are traitors to the other half which are so by law it depends upon the course taken by a few balls of different sizes but will it be said that the course taken by the balls affords any indication of the side on which the greatest proportion of veracity is to be found in cases like these not to speak of concealed traitors every nonjuror at least is at his heart a traitor but is he the less trustworthy on the contrary who does not see that he is by so much the more so his adherence to veracity his insensibility to the force of sinister interest is established by the most incontestable evidence—by evidence such as no adherent to the successful side has it in his power to give during the warfare between the two roses—that is from generation to generation—the good people of england good and bad together were alternately loyalists and traitors  consequently if the men of law were fit to be believed in all that time scarce a man in the country that was fit to be believed by a numerous and respectable description of men probably by a great majority of those to whom the history of their country is an object of interest russel and sydney russel at any rate seem to be regarded as patterns of heroic virtue of virtue not simply in respect of the general tenor of their lives but in respect of the very act which brought the life of each of them to its close both patterns let us say of heroic virtue yet if in the eye of the law for that is the question these men were not traitors what men ever were or can be next below treasons stand unclergyable felonies among these take homicide in the way of duelling two men quarrel one of them calls the other a liar so highly does he prize the reputation of veracity that rather than suffer a stain to remain upon it he determines to risk his life challenges his adversary to fight and kills him jurisprudence in its sapience knowing no difference between homicide by consent by which no other human being is put in fear—and homicide in pursuit of a scheme of highway robbery of nocturnal housebreaking by which every man who has a life is put in fear of it—has made the one and the other murder and consequently felony the man prefers death to the imputation of a lie—and the inference of the law is that he cannot open his mouth but lies will issue from it such are the inconsistencies which are unavoidable in the application of any rule which takes improbity for a ground of exclusion take it for a ground of suspicion only all these absurdities are avoided on each occasion every man is judged of by his own works a man is not pronounced unworthy of credit merely because other men who have committed other acts accidentally called by the same name as some act of his are supposed unworthy of credit the suspicion is founded not on the class of the offence which as offences are classed shows nothing nor yet on the genus of the offence an indication still pregnant with delusion nor more implicitly so much as on the species but rather on the individual offence and thus each shade of delinquency raises up that shade and that shade alone of suspicion that belongs to it if the legislator had his choice of witnesses upon every occasion and witnesses of all sorts in his pocket he would do well not to produce any upon any occasion but such over whose conduct the tutelary motives exercised despotic sway in a word to admit no other men for witnesses than perfect men but perfect men do not exist and if the earth were covered with them delinquents would not send for them to be witnesses to their delinquency in such a state of things then the legislator has this option and no other to open the door to all witnesses or to give licence to all crimes for all purposes he must take men as he finds them and for the purpose of testimony he must take such men as happen to have been in the way to see or to say they have been in the way to see what had it depended upon the actors would have been seen by nobody a very short argument might be sufficient to satisfy us of the insufficiency of all arguments drawn from the topic of criminality in     the lump the evidence of an accomplice is admitted whatever be the crime at least which is abundantly sufficient for the purpose in crimes which are regarded as being of the deepest dye and as affording the strongest ground for exclusion in the instance of a witness whose criminality whether of the same or a different species is of less recent date supposing criminality in general to be a just ground of incapacitation in this behalf on the part of a witness produced in favour of a criminal prosecution—the criminality manifested by a participation in that very crime would afford a juster ground than can be found on the part of a criminal not in the same predicament superior certainty and superior freshness are circumstances that concur in giving to the ground of exclusion in this case a degree of strength which is scarcely to be found in any other first in regard to certainty certainty of past depravity in other cases the evidence of criminality the only evidence admitted by the law is the record of conviction but the conviction may have been erroneous the man may have been innocent though the jury thought him guilty here he says himself he was guilty and unfolds all the circumstances of his guilt circumstances without which it would not have been in his power to display the guilt of the accomplice against whom his evidence is produced next in regard to freshness for on freshness depends the presumption of present depravity without which past is nothing to the purpose of present depravity as rendered probable by past in other cases the criminality may it is true be recent but what is equally true is that it may be any number of years anterior to the time when the testimony is given long before that period the crime may have been for ever buried in oblivion and the character regenerated here the taint on the evidence is as fresh as the crime by the prosecution of which the evidence is called forth† in a double view so far as the danger of deception is concerned this single example ought to be regarded as conclusive in the character of a proof from experience and in the character of an argumentum ad hominem in the character of an appeal to experience the temptation at the highest pitch the individual exposed to it an individual belonging to that class in whom the proneness to yield to temptation is at the highest pitch the force of the mendacityprompting motives at the highest pitch the force of the mendacityrestraining motives at the lowest pitch and yet mendacity itself unfrequent in comparison with veracity and at any rate what is the only thing ultimately material deception and consequent misdecision extremely rare‡     in the character of an argumentum ad hominem its operation seems to be still more forcible when in case of deception and consequent misdecision the mischief is so great—when in a word it is at the highest possible pitch amounting perhaps to the murder of an innocent man—you scruple not to give admission to the evidence every day you admit it—you all admit it by none of you has so much as a suspicion been entertained or at least been professed to be entertained that the admission of it is upon the whole unfavourable to the interests of truth and justice yet where the temptation amounts to nothing—where the capacity of opposing to the temptation if there were any that resistance which probity requires remains unimpeached—and where the mischief in case of deception and consequent misdecision is next to nothing—even there if but the shadow of an interest flit before your eyes you scruple not to shut an inexorable door against the evidence we have seen in some measure what is to be thought of the incapacitations grounded upon interest we now know what to think of the incapacitations founded on criminality add interest and criminality together and observe what follows interest incapacitates—criminality incapacitates interest and criminality each in the highest degree do not incapacitate in grammarians logic two negatives make an affirmative in lawyers logic two affirmatives make a negative in vulgar arithmetic one and one make two in lawyers arithmetic one and one make not two but nothing oh but lawyers interest is pecuniary interest and this interest which being added to criminality removes the incapacitation is only the mere interest of selfpreservation in regard to life and nothing more well then add pecuniary interest add lawyers only interest to other peoples strongest interest put three grounds of incapacitarion together instead of two the three put together still make nothing as before a pardon together with a reward is offered to one conspirator for the discovery of another neither reward nor pardon given unless the man informed against is convicted this is every days practice such is the invitation and the doors of justice are thrown open to the scum of the earth thus collected after this split hairs and raise quibbles about a farthingsworth of interest in one shape and a farthingsworth in another §   if exclusion on the ground of convicted mendacity were justifiable english lawyers and judges should be excluded first as to the professional lawyer—the lawyer in full practice i speak not of attorneys who when it happens to them to lie lie rather in deportment than in language in deeds rather than in words or if in written words in words prepared for them by the clients lips the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong by what is it kept up but by the indiscriminate advancement of truth and falsehood what the perjurer has done once and perhaps but once the advocate is doing in every days practice occasion motive everything the same except the punishment and the ceremony the kiss given to the book in one case—not given to it in the other the perjurer makes a lie the advocate circulates it the perjurer gives words to it the advocate effect to what amounts the difference to the same as between the part borne     by one man and that borne by another in a plan of forgery the lawyer indeed has his licence to plead his licence under the seal of the moral sanction the perjurer has no such licence unquestionably the licence makes a difference contempt and power sit not on the same head one difference requires to be marked the licence granted to the advocate confines itself to the case where it is in that character that he acts where it is to the use of others that he lies as truly as the courtier said non omnibus dormio the advocate may say non omnibus mentior for the fee and the reputation of impressive and successful lying excepted if he lies to his own use he goes beyond his licence but when the habit thus in ceaseless exercise has been matured into a second nature is it so natural that the line thus faintly marked out should never be crossed is it not more natural that as public wrongs have been known to mix with private the concerns of others should to this purpose now and then mix themselves with a mans own concessum est oratoribus aliquid mentiri in historiis to the orator who laid down the rule was it an unfrequent occurrence to see him affording the example to a butcher it may happen to be a man of humanity he has a licence for shedding blood a licence sealed with the same seal as that under which the advocate acts in the utterance of falsehoods the licence extends to quadrupeds of all sorts it does not extend to bipeds or at least to bipeds without feathers yet when human life is at stake a butcher is never put upon a jury it seems scarcely in the nature of things that in point of testimonial trustworthiness the testimony of a professional advocate should in any country or under any system be in the eye of reason altogether upon a level with that of a man of an equally cultivated mind in another station taken at random but whatever untrustworthiness may be found attached to the character on european ground by far the greatest part of it will be found referable to the technical system and whatever ulterior degree of untrustworthiness may be found attached to it on english ground will be found referable to the peculiar degree of malignity to which the endemial disease of that system has risen in england under the natural system were it ever restored—under the most perfect system imaginable—the profession of the advocate never could cease to be necessary how much less soever might be the demand for the exercise of it but under the natural system the advocate is only the assistant the bottleholder of the suitor under the technical system the champion the substitute under the natural system the suitor being essentially present—present so long and as often as any matter of fact coming in any way under his cognizance is in question—there stands somebody there stands the suitor in his proper person responsible for the truth of everything that is said in his behalf the person so responsible is always present in the face of the bystanders and the judge in vain would the advocate the echo the hearsay witness pretend to believe what the principal then standing before him dares not venture to assert or at any rate to persist in when the client is out of the way not only of punishment but of shame the advocate no longer the hottleholder but the substituted soaring on his own wings believes and proclaims aloud whatever is most convenient to be believed his gospel is in his land in his brief he beholds his sufficient warrant from beginning to end the paper may be composed of lies of lies replete with infamy but the weight of it falls not on his shoulders in the writings of lawyers a topic which of course cannot be an unfrequent one is the respectability of the professional character the transcendant excellence of the functions in the exercise of which it manifests itself whatever in talent is most brilliant whatever in learning is most profound joined together and acting in the service of justice what a maker of sticks has never yet been known to forget is that to every stick there are two ends what a maker of this sort of panegyric takes care never to remember is that to every cause there are two sides and that only one of these can possibly be in the right another case which presents itself as a subject of examination in regard to exclusion of testimony on the score of appropriate improbity is that of english judgeship in speaking of this case of habitual mendacity nothing farther will be requisite than the marking those circumstances which concur in distinguishing it from the last preceding case meantime lest the condition of being habitually stained with this degrading vice should be regarded as a necessary one indelibly attached to one of the most exalted functions in government it may be proper to premise that england is the country on which the imputation will be found to rest if not to the exclusion of any other at least in a degree of most prodigious preeminence even to that other of the three united kingdoms which is contiguous to england the contagion has not extended itself though on the other hand it has crossed the sea and involved the other kingdom the laws of     which have been drawn from an english source even in england the number of the persons thus regularly infected is so small that were numbers the sole object this head of preferable exclusion might seem to have scarcely a claim to notice but when it is considered that the station here in question limited as is the number of the occupants is among the chief fountains from which the public morals are derived and that in one of them in particular sits a reverend personage who among his official titles numbers that of castos morum of the nation guardian of the public morals the paucity of the occupants will hardly be adduced as a sufficient reason why in this point of view any more than in any other the station should be passed by as an object undeserving of regard had clodius in his day paid a visit to this island for the purpose of delivering a set of lectures on the virtue of conjugal fidelity or had messalina come over and purchased the site of camden house for the purpose of erecting upon the premises a boardingschool upon an imperial scale for the education of young ladies the individuality of the two characters would scarcely have passed as a reason why their conduct in their respective situations should be passed by as an object too inconsiderable for notice between the mendacity of the advocate and that of the judge the scene is now confined to england there is this difference among advocates taking any given individual the exemplification of the quality is rather matter of suspicion than proof that a large portion of his time is thus employed is clear beyond dispute but it would not always be easy to say exactly what particular portion or portions—to fix upon the particular cause or hour or minute in the instance of the judge this difficulty has no place in this shape as well as in so many others the fruits of his industry are upon record his name is subjoined to them and in his own hand they are consigned to that sort of instrument which as if to give the better effect and virtue to this its quality is proclaimed aloud as the standard of truth that mass of authoritative and privileged asseveration which no other asseveration come it from what quarter or from whatsoever number of quarters it may is ever to be suffered to contradict a mass the matter of which being constantly in the greater part of it false is on that account to be as constantly taken for true to be at a loss for specimens of the exercise of this talent would be as if an astronomer were to be at a loss to find stars in the milky way in the selection—since for illustrations sake a specimen must be produced—in the selection lies the only difficulty to give them all would be to transcribe no small part of the collection of those fruits of professional industry which in professional language are known by the name of books of practice to transcribe them on the present occasion would be to imitate the labour of the ingenious attorney who on the occasion of the entry of names and baptisms on a blank leaf took occasion to enrich the budget of evidence with an office copy of the bible in the mariage de figaro the travelled valet speaking of england represents cursing and swearing as the matter constituting the basis of conversation though matter of that sort is more abundant than a lover either of good sense or piety would wish yet taken in the quantity there assigned the proposition cannot but be considered as tinctured with that exaggeration which being natural to the occasion shows itself for what it is if instead of that vice he had fixed upon the vice of lying and instead of common conversation upon that sort of regulated discourse in the delivery of which a man might be expected to be more particularly on his guard and had his observation been that in england lying constitutes the basis of judicial procedure his remark would have contained nothing beyond the simple and altogether indisputable truth supported by irresistible power effrontery has hardened itself to such a pitch as to affect to regard mendacity under the palliative name of fiction mendacity in the mouth of judges—mendacity the source of fees as conducive as even necessary to justice such in that exalted station being the practice the habitual practice—what in point of character and reputation is the consequence just what it might naturally be expected to be that in the scale of trustworthiness the assertion of an english judge writing in that character—the assertion of the guardian of english morals stands exactly at the lowest degree conceivable not only is this state of things generally notorious but it is built upon as such by the acts of the legislature and this so truly and effectually that it is upon the known untrustworthiness—upon the infamy of this exalted character that the law depends for the efficacy of its arrangements among the other devices employed by the authors of the jurisprudential system for the attainment of their ends was that of wording their notices in such manner as to convey no information the consequence of which actual as well as intended was that a man was punished and pillaged as for a contempt of the orders thus carefully kept from coming to his knowledge the people of england having been under a course of pillage     in this form for some centuries the cries of the oppressed prevailed at length with the legislature to apply what the authors of the grievance the persons by whose counsels the legislature on occasions of this sort governs itself of course for want of being able of itself so much as to understand the language what the authors of the grievance presented in the character of a remedy instead of the sham notice which till then had been the only notice ever delivered—instead of this sham notice by itself the instrument was in future to contain two notices the one was and is the old sham notice signed by the judge—the customary heap of lies—the official discourse of the judge whose name in his own handwriting conveying the assurance of its verity was inscribed on it the other was and is a true notice—a notice that may be at least and the nature of the contents considered commonly will be a true one signed by some attorney the two notices being in pointblank contradiction to one another on what does the efficacy of the true instrument and of the law by which it was instituted depend on what but this viz that the word of the attorney who unless by accident has the advantage of not being known shall be taken in preference to that of the judge whom everybody knows and who as such is so much better known than trusted that he is regarded as unworthy of all credence the assertion thus delivered it may perhaps be remarked has not received the sanction of an oath true unless any such duty as that of veracity should be understood as comprehended in the oath of office but what is no less true is that the assertion is of that class to which the reverend authors themselves ascribe a degree of trustworthiness beyond any which they will allow to an assertion from any other quarter though backed by the sanction of an oath records instruments coming authenticated from that exalted and thus commanding station—records of the verity of which the above specimen furnishes a correct idea are sure to be believed i e though known for what they are acted upon as if true depositions assertions from all other quarters though sanctioned upon oath may be believed or not they must take their chance—but records are infallible is it the occasion and thence the effect—is it the occasion or the ceremony that makes the political mischief the moral turpitude surely not the ceremony but the occasion if the ceremony then suppose a mass of testimony received without the ceremony and an innocent man convicted and life destroyed upon that ground in this is there no mischief in this is there no turpitude on the other side take two pieces of gold coin two guineas each of full weight and under the eye of an approving judge to change the prisoners doom from death to transportation let the twoandfortyshillingsworth of gold coin be valued by twelve jurymen speaking upon their oaths at nineandthirty shillings and no more look at this which is every days practice and then say whether the distinction between the occasion and the ceremony be to the conscience of an english judge either a subject of doubt or a matter of indifference thus strong is the objection in the case of the english judge stronger than in the case of the advocate—itself a stronger case than that of the convicted perjurer mendacity it must not be forgotten is the only shape in which improbity is here in question extended to other shapes the imputation would be unfounded and in respect of its unquestionable groundlessness revolting the lord high chancellor the lord chiefjustice—you might be every day in his company for any number of years without being under any the smallest degree of apprehension on the score of your watch your table might be covered with plate and not so much as a teaspoon would be in any the smallest danger of finding its way from his hand into his pocket in all such particulars your assurance of probity on the part of the arbiter of the lives of unlicensed depredators might well be as entire as on the part of any such unlicensed depredator your assurance of the opposite quality would but in regard to that particular modification of improbity which alone is here in question the matter may be seen to stand upon a very different footing not to say an opposite one it is to his celebrity and longcontinued experience in the capacity of an advocate that the lord chancellor or lord chiefjustice is indebted for his commanding situation in the character of a judge in the case of the unlicensed depredator mendacity is but a casual practice an accidentallynecessary resource for the purpose of getting your watch no lies are told by the man whose dexterity finds means in the crowd to extract it out of your fob for the purpose of getting your spoons no lies are told by the burglar to whose ingenuity the windowshutter of your butlers pantry has proved an insufficient obstacle if for converting these treasures into others more particularly adapted to his immediate use it be necessary for the acquirer to have recourse to an ordinary and unconfederated dealer—true it is that in that case a story may eventually be to be told but if between the man of dexterity     and the man of thrift there be a regular established connexion cemented by the necessary confidence invention has no need to draw upon itself and though in the shape of depredation improbity thus extends and doubles itself in the shape of mendacity it finds no place far different not to say directly opposite is the case as between the two practitioners on the ground of mendacity on this ground what on the part of the practitioner whose strength lies in his hands was but a casualty is on the part of him whose strength lies in his brains and tongue matter of regular of constant of necessary practice set the one and the other in the witnessbox the dignified practitioner will be the most careful not to hazard any false statement that would be easily open to detection but as often as the nature of the case holds out security against detection a natural consequence is that of the two he shall be the more ready at the utterance of falsehood as well as more adroit and successful in the management of it the field of psychological facts is a field which in its whole extent holds out to learned mendacity this encouraging and fostering security under his brush like drapery under that of the painter intentions motives disposition character—everything of that sort takes on each occasion the exact shape and hue which the occasion and the purpose that arises out of it requires in equity all facts of this class are made by the learned draughtsman at common law by the leading counsel whether of his own stores or by adoption from the attorney from the paper of instructions in one case from the brief in the other is matter of accident and not worth thinking about in all these particulars misrepresentation whether on the wrong or on the right side is matter of course on the wrong side it is matter of duty a duty the more imperious the more perilous the wrong and punishment in the shape of professional dishonour and forfeiture of practice would be the consequence of neglect if on the right side embellishment in this style is if not a duty at least a merit—and reward in the shape of honour awaits the skilful and successful organ in the production of these cases strong as they are let not the purpose for which they are adduced—let not the proposition contended for be for a moment out of sight even in these strongest of all cases that of the advocate anywhere and that of the judge in england the object is not to recommend but to reprobate the shutting the door against the evidence rightly you can never act so long as on the ground of untrustworthiness and consequent fear of deception you shut the door of justice against any human testimony but if you will not act rightly act at least consistently and to do so you must shut the door in the first place against yourselves judico me cremari was the decision of judge blackstones righteous pope take that case for your precedent and say judico me excludi the sacrifice will not be quite so great the decision not less reasonable having done with yourselves proceed upon your learned brethren and their ungraduated fellowpractisers the barristers of the present time the apprentices of the heroic age from them descend to solicitors and to attorneys if any you can find who flying from public odium have not taken shelter under the former the less hackneyed name when the testimony of these venders of falsehood for daily bread is shut out it will be time enough to think about shutting the door against the illfated jonas whose misfortune it was to be detected in acting for once in his life without a licence that part which he sees performed every day with such universal applause and on the highest theatres under the sanction of a licence but above all forget not that most deeplylearned person whom i was in danger to have forgotten the special pleader who having never opened his mouth has never spoken a he but who from his first entrance into the profession unto the present moment whatever be the present moment never knew what it was to set his hand to a single paper without a lie in it let us not mistake if the presumption of untrustworthiness do upon any such grounds as above attach itself with justice upon the english judge it certainly is not upon the station as little is it upon the nation it is upon the system the technical system under which he acts the system that causes him to be false—habitually and constantly false and not only to be false but to be the cause and the constantlyacting cause of falsehood in other men the technical system is a hothouse of mendacity the soil richer far richer in england than under any other clime the advocate picked out in due time from the bed of special pleaders or chancery draughtsmen is trained up in this stove the judge is the advocate run to seed it extends not this disastrous presumption—it extends not in anything like equal force to the judge nor even to the advocate of any other country it crosses not the tweed under roman law if under the name of fiction falsehood be now and then served up to the table of the judge it is only as it were by way of desert and in the character of a   0 casual delicacy it is on english benches that it is gorged and disgorged with an appetite that will bear the epithet of canine if it extends not in any comparatively considerable force to the judge or even the advocate in any other country much less does it even in england to the country magistrate the justice of the peace much less does it in any even the slightest degree to those unlearned judges never have they fed on any such fould diet they have never shaken hands with den or fen with doe or roe no connexion have they with sham pledges with sham bail with sham anything fees flow not into their hands from any such poluted source to the general conclusion be of this set of cases the strength what it may it can never stand against the force of the general answer the more manifest the mendacity the more secure it is against the danger of producing deception that consequence without which mendacity howsoever it be in intention is altogether innocent in point of effect by those from whom it issues and who act upon it as if it were true the mendacity of it is still more fully understood than it can be by anybody else after this conclusive answer others that carry upon the face of them more or less truth have for the present purpose little claim to notice a distinction may require to be taken between the judge and the man and as in the court of exchequer the same robes include two sorts of judges—a commonlaw judge and an equitylaw judge whose vocation consists in stopping and thwarting the proceedings of each other—so in any and every court it may happen to the same envelope to contain two sorts of human beings—a veracious individual and a perpetuallylying judge the remark is certainly not without foundation in experience not that the observation can be altogether free from regret that between the two opposite characters the contact should be so constant and so close that one head should encircle two such faces the claim to competency is beyond dispute but when credibility comes to be considered proverbs in abundance regarded commonly as the emanation of wisdom the offspring experience obtrude themselves and become troublesome nor is it pleasant to consider that the weakness of the union in the character of an objection to what is called credibility depends upon the truth of the proposition that communications thus evil and thus close do not corrupt good manners no it is not for the purpose of advocating but of reprobating exclusion of testimony that these remarkable cases are spread upon the carpet it is not for the purpose of proving that these ought to be excluded but that none ought to be excluded not only not the felon or the perjurer nor even the evermendacious advocate of any country butnot even the constant arbiter utterer bespeaker rewarder and compeller of mendacity the english judge no let them not shut the door of the witnessbox against any human creature but if nothing will satisfy them but that somebody must be excluded—if the demon of exclusion must have victims—let judges and advocates be the first chapter v impropriety of exclusion on the ground of religious opinions §   atheism an improper ground of exclusion in the case of improbity the seat of the disease is in the will in the case of atheism the seat of the disease such let us call it is in the understanding between the two branches of the mental frame the communication is indeed most intimate true but they must not be confounded here the presumption is still more remote and slighter than before could the absence of all sinister interest be ascertained improbity in the case in which the presumption it affords is the strongest—improbity in the shape of perjury—would not afford any the slightest presumption of mendacity in any given instance perjury is improbity but atheism is not improbity that it affords a presumption of improbity is the utmost that can be said of it by anybody from the four sources above mentioned under the name of sanctions the ideas of pain and pleasure are found operating on each man with more or less force in the character of standing tutelary motives the physical sanction the moral or popular the political or legal and the religious the atheist is one on whom the religious sanction has no hold in respect of the extent of the cases in which they respectively operate the physical is confined within natural limits the political by limits more or less casual and scanty the moral and the religious though hitherto variable are altogether unconfined and capable of covering the whole field but human conduct     depends not merely on the number and nature of the moral forces to the action of which on the occasion in question the patient is exposed but also on the sensibility of his mental frame with reference to each such force to restrain this man all four shall be unavailing to restrain that man a single one of them shall be sufficient it has been seen in book   how much may be said in behalf of the opinion that in the character of a security for good conduct in the present life the religious sanction is incomparably less efficient than either the moral or the political if this opinion be true it follows that any presumption of improbity which can be afforded by atheism is very slight the question however whether in any degree and in what degree the absence of religion or this or that erroneous opinion in regard to it affords a presumption of improbity may happily be added to the list of the questions the investigation of which is unnecessary to the present purpose why so answer because the fact of a mans entertaining any such opinion is that sort of psychological fact of the existence of which it is impossible for the judge to obtain sufficient evidence on any other supposition than that of a degree of veracity not only exclusive of the supposition of a more than ordinary propensity to mendacity but in itself so preeminent as to entitle the testimony of the witness to a more than ordinary share of confidence to cause a man for this purpose to be justly regarded as an atheist the evidence must come either from an extraneous source or from discourses formerly committed to writing by himself or from his own lips   coming from an extraneous source the persuasive force of the evidence finds two objections to encounter it in the first place it is at best but hearsay evidence on such or such an occasion he declared himself an atheist in the next place the time of the fact supposing it true is a time past and gone for aught that appears the situation he is in in this respect may be parallel to that of a man who at one time had an interest in the cause—but an interest which before any occasion led him to speak of the fact was extinct once that error was entertained by him admitted but in the existence of a god is there anything so perfectly incredible that when once a man has entertained the contrary persuasion it is impossible for him ever to cease to entertain it   let the evidence be derived from former writings of his own in this case the first of the two abovementioned causes of inconclusiveness has no existence but the second remains and with the same degree of force as in the former case   next and lastly let the evidence whichsoever way it turns come from his own lips being about to give his testimony the first question put to him is are you an atheist answer no or yes first let it be no if there be no extraneous evidence to the contrary the objection is disposed of but suppose extraneous evidence to the contrary viz the hearsay evidence above spoken of primâ facie and in general hearsay evidence is superseded and turned into superfluous equivalent to irrevelant by the immediate testimony of the person whose supposed extrajudicial discourse is reported by it but upon occasion for infirmation or even for confirmation of the immediate and judicial testimony of the supposed extrajudicial discourser it may still have its use comes then the extraneous witness to the proposed witnesss character and says of him—on such a day i heard him declare himself an atheist but be this statement true or false by it the declaration of the supposed atheist the declaration whereby he says i am not an atheist is not contradicted then when he declared himself at atheist he was an atheist now that he says i am not an atheist he is not so if indeed he says—no on the occasion of which the witness speaks i did not declare myself an atheist—then indeed contradiction exists then it is for the judge to make his choice and say to himself which of them he will believe not that the choice is worth making for the fact thus to be determined is the state of the mind of the supposed atheist at that former time whereas the fact on which the alleged cause of the exclusion rests is the state of his mind at the time when called upon to give evidence if a written document is produced as above the contradiction is more conclusive than in the other case unless the meaning put upon the document or its genuineness or its exemption i e the exemption of the act of writing it from force or fraud be contested and rendered dubious next let the answer be yes i am an atheist then indeed the man must be an atheist at any rate he must be taken for an atheist but shall this answer be regarded as a piece of evidence warranting the exclusion no surely and for this reason the answer is either false or true if false the supposed cause of the exclusion fails in point of fact—he is not an atheist he cannot therefore with propriety be excluded on the ground of atheism if the answer be true     the cause of exclusion fails on another ground the presumption of mendacity the presumption grounded on the atheism is proved to be erroneous what is known to every man cannot be unknown to him—viz in the first place the general odium to which this declaration is likely to expose him in the next place to what a degree it cannot but diminish the degree of credence likely to be given to his evidence i e counteract what cannot but be his own purposes if his evidence be purposely false on the other hand if he says no i am not an atheist—the avoidance of that infamy the preservation of his evidence from that discredit is certain mendacity would find the field quite clear disproof would be impossible what then to the present purpose is the effect of such a declaration to show that from the three other sanctions one or all of them his will such is his relative sensibility experiences that degree of influence which on the minds of so large a proportion of mankind all four together are so frequently insufficient to produce compare this case with the abovementioned vulgar notion about interest by that prejudice men in general are presumed ready to give mendacious testimony by the slightest particle of interest here is an interest—and that an interest corresponding to the moral sanction—an interest corresponding to the fear of shame—urging him and with great force to speak falsely on this occasion by saying that he is not an atheist when he is urged by a detachment of that force viz the force of the moral sanction to deviate from the path of truth yet such is the power of that sanction over his will there exists still in his mind the main body of that force for by the supposition all the other three sanctions are out of the question acting upon him with such effect as to keep his discourse steady and preserve him from straying into that sinister path towards which it is thus impelled this is no place for the discussion of opinions on the subject of religion but one general observation belongs strictly to the present purpose were an atheist a worse monster than he has ever been supposed to be—bent upon doing mischief in all possible ways on all possible occasions and by all possible means false testimony among the rest—a rule excluding testimony on the score of atheism would afford no security against the mischief to be apprehended from that source for to get rid of the exclusion he would have no more to do than to put himself to the expense of a falsehood of which the detection is impossible on the other hand the exclusion operates to a considerable extent as a safeguard to all criminals atheists or not who when called upon to bear testimony against one another are willing to make profession of atheism under the exclusions founded on criminality a man has a licence to commit crimes but he will not seek it for the purpose it would be too expensive he must pay for it either with his liberty not to speak of other punishment or with his life under those founded on religion he may seek it for the purpose he may take out the licence and take it out for almost nothing a knot of any sort of criminals may conspire and insure to one another impunity so far as depends on the evidence of each other an atheist is a bad witness but how to know him from another it must be from his own account of himself if from anything for atheism is not written on a mans forehead which then is the true atheist—the man who says he is not an atheist and is one or the man who says he is an atheist and is not so this pretended atheist it should seem must be considered as the true one for every practical purpose those who speak of atheists as lying under the disabilities in question must if they mean anything mean such persons and all such persons as exhibit the only marks of atheism which the nature of the case can by any possibility afford if this be true here is a receipt and that an infallible one whereby any man that pleases may render his testimony unreceivable the conspirators in one of the assassination plots against henry the fourth of france or his predecessor i forget which made use of the sacrament as an instrument for binding one another to mutual fidelity had they brooded over their plots under the shadow of the english common law they might have found in atheism or pretended atheism a security of rather a different nature it must be confessed but applicable to the same use and of rather superior efficacy a man might have taken ever so many sacraments and be never the worse witness but one good declaration of atheism made in proper form and in proper company will be enough to make him as bad as can be desired when a man has been received to serve the king if he would serve with safety he must produce a certificate of orthodoxy as demonstrated by taking the sacrament according to the forms of the english church† when a man proposes to join in murdering the king if he would do the business in safety as against his associates he must make them furnish him with a certificate of their atheism speculation quoth somebody no cases     of evidence excluded on account of atheism have every now and then presented themselves in practice the same strain of imbecility which gave rise to the examination on the voire dire has after suffering the question to be put—are you an atheist—and receiving an answer regarded as amounting to an affirmative shut the door against the witness and in revenge for his veracity administered injustice instead of justice to the party unfortunate enough to stand in need of this evidence besides the offence against the dictates of reason and justice the question thus put was repugnant to the known rules of actually existing law in virtue of a statute still in force† a declaration to any such effect subjects the individual to penalties of high severity and the rule that no man shall in return to any question give an answer that can have the effect of subjecting him to any sort of penalty is the firmlyestablished fruit of that mischievous superstition the war upon which will form the business of the ensuing part question and answer together the disclosure was such as could not but have given no slight wound to the feelings of a great majority if not the whole of the surrounding audience but the wound had for its authors not the honest and intrepid witness but the crew of learned sophists the attorney who put the insinuation into the brief—the advocate who formed a question out of it—but above all the judge who suffered such a question to be put §   cacotheism or bad religion an improper ground of exclusion how impossible it is from atheism to deduce a proper ground for exclusion we have just been seeing from cacotheism though no good ground yet a less bad ground might be made if there were any man whose god commanded him to commit perjury meaning always by perjury what it were so much to be wished were always meant by it mendacity by party or witness on a judicial occasion—oath or no oath the gods of the hindoos if the translations we have of their scriptures are in this instance to be depended upon license such mendacity in certain cases‡ on this as on every other part of the ground common law is up in arms against common sense and common honesty and by its inconsistencies against itself the god of the jews and by a prodigious and modern stretch of jurisprudential liberality the god of the mahometans∥ and the god of the hindoos§ are tolerated as not countenancing perjury¶ the god who     binds men to veracity by broken saucers the god of the chinese—if they have a god though it has so often been said they have none—even he is tolerated the god of the catholics and the god of quakers is not tolerated in intendment of law he either commands perjury or is at best indifferent about it no this account is not yet a correct one were this the law it would be reasonable in comparison with what when correctly stated it will be seen to be i catholics catholics excluded those christians in comparison with whom those who are not catholics compose a small minority church of england men a still smaller catholics than whom till as it were of yesterday there were no other christians evidence of catholics excluded are we then commanded by law to believe that there is neither society nor laws nor judicature nor evidence nor veracity among the greater part of christians† catholics excluded oh no—not all catholics no only those who have exhibited a degree of attachment to the duties of religion such a degree as among protestants would be as rare as martyrdom is rare a catholic as such is not excluded he must be a popish recusant‡ an oath is tendered to him—an oath such that the catholic who takes it renounces his religion denies that he is a catholic it was devised and avowedly for this very purpose thus then under the spirit of this policy a distribution is made of catholics into two classes—perjurers and nonperjurers to all who will perjure themselves the door of the witnessbox is thrown open against all who will not perjure themselves it is shut it is with catholics as we have seen it to be with atheists it is not to atheists that the law is opposed it is only to such atheists as will not perjure themselves∥     ii quakers what is known to everybody is that as far as anything can be true that is predicated of men in whole classes the quakers are the most veracious of mankind whatever regard men at large are wont to pay to that which they say upon oath that and more is paid by this knot of friends to what is said by them on the like serious occasions at least without oath by the legislature itself to say the least they are not regarded as mendacious laws have been made for the express purpose of giving indulgence to their weakness and admitting them to give evidence without the ceremony laws made yes but here comes jurisprudence with its distinctions its perplexities and its inconsistencies in with him on civil ground out with him on criminal occasion there has been to say over and over again that as to all criminal cases where the punishment is not beyond pecuniary the distinction is nominal and frivolous since for the selfsame offence or supposed offence—for the selfsame cause a man may be proceded against at the option of whoever chooses to proceed against him in the one way or the other accordingly to the extent at any rate of this coincidence the admitting law cannot do right but it must do wrong it cannot do right in admitting the quaker in a civil cause without doing wrong in excluding him when the suit chosen has been one of the criminal sort but suppose the punishment ultrapecuniary suppose mans life at stake suppose a quaker—that is a man calling himself a quaker—wicked enough to attempt murder with his tongue has not the law suffering enough at its command to punish him with in nonquakers law exempts not from punishment murder committed with this instrument the punishment which in this case is too much for a nonquaker—might not some of it be reserved for the quaker and serve as a succedaneum to the ceremony to which he is thus recalcitrant conceive a class of men amounting to many thousands on whose persons male or female and in whose presence so there be no other witnesses all other men are left free—have a licence from the law to commit so they be but capital all imaginable crimes—rape robbery burglary mayhem incendiarism and so forth as to property of persons absent destroyed or stolen in their presence this with so many other trifles of the like nature is scarce worth adding i remember the case of a man who in pursuit of a scheme of plunder set a house on fire and who because nobody had seen what he was about but a quaker was turned loose again to burn other houses here again comes the same sort of inconsistency as was observed in the case of the atheist and the catholic obeying the dictates of conscience a man remains incredible violating them he becomes credible iii persons excommunicated you omit paying your attorneys bill if the bill is a just one and you able to pay it this is wrong of you but if unable your lot of which immediately will be just the same if the business done was done in a court called a commonlaw court your attorney is called an attorney and the case belongs not to this purpose if in a court called an ecclesiastical court the attorney is called a proctor you are imprisoned and so forth—but first you must be excommunicated for this crime or for any other no sooner are you excommunicated than a discovery is made that being excluded out of the church you are not under the influence of any religion† you are a sort of atheist to your own weak reason it appears to you that you believe but the law which is the perfection of reason knows that you do not being omniscient and infallible and so forth she knows that were you to be heard it would be impossible you should speak true therefore you too are posted off upon the excluded list along with atheists catholics and quakers forbidden by his religion a quaker will not pay tithes sued in the spiritual court he is excommunicated as a witness he is now incompetent twice over once by being a quaker and again by being excommunicate why by being excommunicate answer per mr justice buller because he is not under the influence of any religion‡ of the exclusionary system a part of the mischief it has been already observed not to speak of other parts is that it involves in it a licence to persons unknown in unknown numbers to commit injustice in all imaginable shapes to commit all imaginable crimes     to the legislator having always an interest more or less unmixed in the wellbeing of the people—being always more or less governed by that interest—to the real and legitimate legislator acting as such it could hardly have happened unless by sinister counsel to give in to a system so obviously hostile to the wellbeing of the people by the judge acting under the feecollecting system and under the sinister impulse given to him by that system—by the judge wielding in disguise the sceptre of legislation public interest would at best and where not exposed to an eye of positive hostility be regarded of course with indifference when lawyers profit the only serious object of his care had mischief in whatever shape—expense delay vexation misdecision failure of justice for its immediate cause or what comes to the same thing its inseparable though but collateral accompaniment—mischief would be the fruit of his choice and hence it was by the exclusion of the presence and thence of the testimony of the parties that the foundation of the exclusionary system that grand support of the feecollecting system was laid when the abovedescribed connexion between lawyers profit and nonlawyers misery either did not exist or did not present itself to his view—then it was that every now and then it would happen to him to produce mischief and misery not purposely not with malice prepense but only as the clown in drydens legend whistled for want of thought in the present case it would appear that so wide a deviation from the line of utility and justice was mainly occasioned by the sentiment of antipathy although punishment admits of no other justificative reason than a probable prospect of the production of greater good—of an increase in the aggregate mass of happiness of a decrease in the aggregate mass of misery yet such has rarely been the final cause of punishment in the mind of the legislator especially in those times of primeval barbarism in which all systems of legislation have had their rise diminution of suffering viz on the part of the community injured by the offence may have been in any given instance the result and fruit of punishment but even where this is the case not diminution but production of suffering—viz on the part of the offender—has but too often and perhaps in the origin of society most commonly been at least the predominant if not the sole object and end in view by the view of such or such a mode of conduct the feeling of antipathy has been excited in the breast of the man in power to gratify it he sets himself to work to plague and torment the individual by whom that unpleasant sensation has been excited by the spectacle of the suffering so produced the appetite receives its gratification at the same time the same spectacle exhibiting itself to the eyes or the imagination of those who were it not for the punishment might have engaged in the practice of acts of the same sort as the act thus punished restrains them to a certain degree from the thus forbidden practice and causes acts of that description to be less frequent than they would be it the mode of conduct whereby the antipathy has been produced be of the number of those the consequences of which have more of evil in them than of good the restraint thus produced is beneficial to the community it is not the less beneficial to the community for not having been present in idea to the mind of the man in power but neither on the other hand from its having been the eventual result of the use he has thus been making of his power does it follow by any means that the idea of it was previously present to his mind if it had been uniformly present to his mind—if the benefit to the community had been the ultimate object of his exertions—if the suffering of the obnoxious person had instead of being the ultimate object been no more than the means the mediatory object—the quantum of suffering would have been measured out according to the object—would have been suited to it in quality would have been adjusted to it in quantity and would not anywhere have overshot the mark not a particle of suffering would have been produced of which the effects had not previously been fully comprehended and accurately ascertained of any such accuracy however—of any such calm and exclusivelyappropriated attention to the aggregate interest of the community and the ends of public justice the very idea is new—even at the present advanced period in the career of perfectibility and civilization much more must the practice have been generally unknown in those rude times in which the art of legislation was in its cradle—in those times of infantine ignorance which are still suffered to rule the destiny of riper age—in this temper of mind among men whose minds were engrossed by these narrow views no wonder that any vehicle or mass of mischief which promised to add anything to the plague should be snatched up and hurled at the head of the obnoxious offender with little knowledge of and as little solicitude about the contents laid hold of and eagerly employed not only without staying to investigate the consequences present and future near and remote certain and contingent with reference to the obnoxious individual—but with as little attention to any effects of which it might be productive on the feelings of other individuals connected by accident only with the individual by whose offence the passion had been excited—individuals whose suffering had it been included in the prospect was     not of a nature to contribute anything to the gratification aimed at antipathy when its exertions are regulated by utility and justice is the handmaid of justice antipathy towards the injurer is the natural and in a human bosom in some degree even the inseparable consequence of sympathy for the injured unhappily for mankind the antipathy thus directed has not been most energetic or most busy when the object to which it pointed was the most noxious they who have diminished the sum of human enjoyment—they who have augmented the sum of human suffering—these find antipathy sooner or later not averse to repose they whose opinions are not our opinions—they whose pleasures are not our pleasures—they whom we oppress they whom we exclude from their share of common benefits—these are they who find antipathy implacable wherever the praise of virtue is to be earned without the expense of selfdenial the most vicious will never be found the most backward in the chase against the perjurer his kinsman the forgerer and the motley fellowship of felons without staying to distinguish one from another the door was shut as it were in a pet and for want of thought the precedent once made the opportunity of stigmatizing and plaguing the traitor and the atheist with his kinsmen the catholic the quaker and the excommunicate was not to be lost always remembered that the more unforeseen exclusions there are and the more unforeseen exceptions to exclusions the more arguments and the more arguments the more fees the outlandish men the mahometan the hindoo and the chinese against whom the door if ever shut has been opened are almost as far from us as the atheist and much farther than the catholic or the quaker but the distance of the outlandish man is his protection blind from birth to the lights by which we are illuminated he is not a rebel to the examples or the arguments logical or golden by which we are governed nuisances it is true all pagans are but happily in their case unless now and then by accident the nuisance is at a distance from the nose chapter vi impropriety of exclusion on the ground of mlntal imbecility and particularly of infancy and superannuation the last ground of exclusion on the score of deception to which our consideration is called is imbecility from whichever source it be derived the propriety of regarding imbecility upon occasion as a cause of suspicion is obvious and indisputable from whichever source derived the taking it for a cause of exclusion will be found equally indefensible mental or corporeal imbecility—a term of relation—admits of degrees ad infinitum imbecility in a variety of respects is the lot of all created beings supposing that in any degree imbecility were capable of constituting a proper ground of exclusion by what mark could that degree be distinguished from any other from the impossibility of finding an answer to that question results the impropriety of taking it for a ground of exclusion in any case in the absence of any universal mark of such a degree of imbecility to form such opinion as the nature of the case admits of there is but one rational course which is the examining of the proposed witness which only rational course is the very course that upon the supposition of the exclusion is not suffered to be taken infancy superannuation insanity whatever be the modification—connected or unconnected with the circumstance of age—the answer will be still the same between infancy and maturity it is necessary for some purposes to draw a line at a venture and that line notwithstanding the wide difference in respect of intellectual strength between individual and individual at the same age—that line a common one fixed for every individual at the same place but to the present purpose no such line is necessary no such line can afford any security against deception no such line can fail of producing if not deception itself yet what is worse misdecision in the case of superannuation the impracticability of drawing any line for that purpose without the most palpable absurdity is plainly obvious imbecility and to such a degree as to make delivery of testimony not merely ineligible but impossible is the effect of infancy at a certain age imbecility to this purpose or indeed almost any other considered as the result of superannuation is but an accidental concomitant and indeed a rare one at any period of old age in the case of insanity a fixed point of time for this purpose is not incapable of being proposed but incapable of being employed     to any good effect when for example a man having by competent authority been deemed incapable of retaining in his own hands the management of his own affairs without preponderant prejudice to himself and others has by competent authority been declared in that state and placed under the authority of a guardian for that purpose here indeed would be a point of time fixed but no line could be drawn through it applicable with any advantage to this purpose from any degree of comparative unfitness in respect of providence and the various other faculties necessary to the management of the variety of affairs that occur in human life no tolerablyassured inference can be drawn respecting the capacity or incapacity of giving a correct and intelligible statement of a single fact which came within the cognizance of a mans senses before the arrangement made a man may have been completely incapable perhaps of obtaining perception of the fact—perhaps of remembering and giving a correct and intelligible statement of such perception though obtained—after the arrangement competent or incompetent to the general management of his own affairs to the purpose of delivering testimony it may happen to him to be as completely competent as another man these observations are brought to view for the purpose of nipping in the hud if possible future contingent exclusions on this ground of the three sources and modifications of intellectual imbecility infancy is the only one that has been taken for exclusion by english law accordingly of the three words mentioned in this view infancy is the only one of which for this purpose any mention is to be found in the books for the same reason imbecility the word here employed for the purpose of including the three cases and bringing to view the ground they stand upon is in these treasures of technical science equally unknown in a direct way infancy cannot at present be employed as a bar to admission howsoever immature the age for with the approbation of the twelve judges in the case of an infant of no more than seven years old and in a case of an infant under seven years old† how much under is not said this evidence was received unfortunately to the admission given in this case two conditions precedent have been annexed one is that the child shall have taken an oath i e gone through the same ceremony by which testimonial relation is preceded in other instances to this operation had it been performed there could have been no objection the misfortune was that in a certain instance it was omitted and the consequence was that a rape having been committed on the body of an infant under seven years of age the man by whom if by anybody the mischief was done was sent out to commit other rapes the prisoner according to the learned reporter‡ was convicted but the judgment was respited on a doubt not having any relation to the fact but created by a marginal note to a case in dyers reports for these notes having been made by lord chief justice treby are considered continues the book of great weight and authority and it was submitted by mr justice buller anno      to the twelve judges whether evidence under any circumstances whatever could be legally admitted in a criminal prosecution except upon oath answer no not in any case   the other condition was and is that the infant appear on strict examination by the court to possess a sufficient knowledge of the nature and consequences of an oath—of the danger and unpiety of falsehood∥ for a more particular description of the knowledge and the danger above spoken of in general terms the following exemplification promises to serve as well as any other that could be substituted to it since neither the questions nor the answers are fixed by law extract from the newspaper called the times dated   th sept   0  proceedings at the old bailey friday sept      0  mary ann carney a daughter of the prisoner only twelve years of age was examined relative to the idea she entertained of an oath and the consequences that would result from telling a falsehood the answer which she returned was exceedingly correct viz that if she told a falsehood when on oath she should be put in the pillory when in this world and go to the devil when in the next to the putting of a question to the effect above described i know of no conclusive objection but to the deducing either from silence or from any answer whatsoever which may have been extracted by such a question a decision pronouncing the exclusion of the testimony objections occur that seem perfectly unanswerable it is requiring of the child as a condition precedent to her being suffered to give a sort of relation which a child of any age that can speak may be perfectly competent to give a sort of account which a child of that immature age to go no farther seems altogether incompetent to give the testimony to the relevant point is to a fact of the most simple nature—a fact which supposing it to have     happened must have presented itself to the senses of the patient and made a very deep impression on them the subjectmatter of the testimony to the irrelevant point is a fact of the most complex and abstruse nature a fact that has been matter of dispute among the maturest the strongest and acutest minds the relevant question—the question to which if to any the child would have been competent to give an answer—was what she had seen and felt the irrelevant question prefixed and in one event substituted to it included a string of questions what on this most abstruse subject she had been taught what she had comprehended and what she had retained the evidence—the only evidence that in answer to such an examination could have been given by such a child was not the opinion of the child but an article of hearsay evidence the account given by the child of the instruction it had received observe the effect of the criterion so unhappily employed the proper question whether the child has been thus injured is put aside and instead of it another question is put in viz whether the child can say its catechism of the substitution thus made or preference thus given of a question foreign to the merits—to the only question belonging to the merits the following present themselves as the natural consequences—   in some cases excluding good and true evidence thus excluding justice and giving impunity to the guilty if the child has not been tutored in the requisite manner and that with effect on the part of the child as well as diligence on the part of the instructors the child may have been abused and mangled the malefactor goes unpunished laughing at the sages from whose zeal so little according to knowledge he has obtained a licence   placing the fate of the cause in a capital cause the life of the prisoner in a state of complete dependence on the will and pleasure of the person or persons under whose power the child is all the time its parents for example is it their wish that the cause should be deprived of the benefit of the childs evidence the catechism is omitted to be administered or a sort of anticatechism administered in the room of it according to the nature of the case by a false answer had the testimony been admitted the child might have been subjected to punishment as for perjury and the parents to legal punishment or at least to disrepute as for subornation of perjury on the occasion of the preliminary examination neither from silence nor from any answer whatsoever—from any such answer as in this view they may have presented need any such consequences be apprehended thus it is that in this way the full benefit of perjury or subornation of perjury may be obtained without any of the risk the full benefit of perjury under the protection and as a fruit of the wisdom of english jurisprudence   holding out to false and mendacious accusation a receipt for fabricating evidence and by a false gloss bestowing on it an appearance of trustworthiness the supposition that the individual whose fate depends upon his knowledge of the law should on any occasion be in possession of any such knowledge may be apt to appear ridiculous but it is what by accident does now and then happen the mother of such a child forms a scheme for ruining a male enemy she employs the requisite time and labour in impressing upon the mind of the child two lessons the one a false story of the supposed injury the other an appropriate catechism such as may afford the requisite satisfaction to the pious anxiety of the judge delighted with the advances made by the sweet child in the science of theology to entertain a doubt of its veracity would be impiety in the eyes of jurisprudential science the same artificial mark of trustworthiness which on the occasion just spoken of gave such complete satisfaction in the instance of a child of twelve years old might in many instances be imprinted with equal facility and success upon the testimony of a child not above half or even a third of that age it might even be imprinted upon the faculties mental and vocal of a naturallyaccomplished and wellinstructed parrot or magpie—with this difference that in the case of the unfeathered witness the questions would require to be in that form to which an advocate is confined when examining a witness of his own   0 side whereas in the case of the feathered witness they would require to be in that more commodious form with the use of which he is indulged in the examination of a witness on the opposite side   the wording of the test being moreover unfixed as is the case with everything that has no more determinate foundation to rest upon than that of jurisprudential law—the testimony of the most trustworthy witness is liable to be sunk by any failure of coincidence between the persuasion of the judge and the persuasion of the child that is of its instructors on a subject thus obscure and delicate not to mention extreme cases such as those of atheists and other unbelievers—christians are not wanting to whose conceptions the devil presents himself in the character of an allegorical and purely ideal personage if in the case of the child whose answers on this head gave such complete satisfaction at the old bailey the expectation of an eventual visit to the president of the infernal regions was regarded as an article of faith indispensable to the present purpose—an answer disaffirming the existence of that tremendous personage might have been fatal to the merits of the cause on this supposition a boy of twelve years whose good fortune it had been in other respects to have been under the tuition of dr priestley or any other equally zealous defender of the christian faith might for want of the necessary protection depending upon his own evidence find himself exposed to the most afflictive personal injuries—or at the expense of real mendacity find himself obliged to purchase the factitious reputation of the opposite virtue learned judges have seldom time to introduce any very searching probe into the bowels of the evidence give them a good round answer satisfaction enters and ejects diffidence i shall be put into the pillory in this world i shall go to the devil in the next—exceedingly correct is the observation of the reporter exceedingly correct unless the reporter were incorrect—exceedingly correct or something to that or the like purport or effect must have been the observation of the judge in the individual cases in question the parties on both sides being low people for of the labours of counsel on their behalf nothing is said—the answer being thus pointed or rounded and adapted to the taste of learned judges passed without further scrutiny his reverend lordship was not less indulgent to the young theologian than a friendly examiner at oxford or cambridge would have been to a candidate for a degree in divinity or a friendly chaplain at lambeth to a candidate for holy orders but suppose this preliminary examination conducted by the tongue of a wellfeed advocate alas what would all the science of the tender student avail against the sharpness of so penetrating a probe conceive a garrow opposed to the tender novice how little would it cost him to drag to light either some jeofail in her creed or the confession of a fact which in the case of her making a tolerable primâ facie answer could never be otherwise than true viz that she had been tutored for the purpose by considerations of the above or some other nature that is to say by some of them an impression appears to have been made on reverend minds mr justice rooke in the case of an unsatisfactory response adjourned the cause and committed the young witness to the charge of a clergyman for religious instruction in the mean time this succedaneum to exclusion obtained the approbation of the other judges to the impressing upon the memory the lesson to be given by the reverend divine six months interval between circuit and circuit was if diligently employed extremely well adapted it would have been equally well adapted to the rendering the fair and tender reporter more and more perfect in any fabricated story of an injury supposing no injury to have been sustained but on the opposite supposition for the keeping alive in the infant memory a correct recollection of the transaction in its true and proper colours the disservice that could not but be done by this long interval presents itself as equally indisputable in this point of view an expedient of the sincerity of which in its design it is impossible to entertain a doubt presents itself as being in its tendency extremely well adapted to every purpose of falsehood and injustice and equally ill adapted to every purpose of truth and justice the case is unhappily of no unfrequent recurrence justice is wanted for it if for any case it is with this as with most other points of procedure the difficulties it is encumbered with are chiefly if not wholly the work of artifice and science in itself it presents little difficulty if mendacity were apprehended who would not rather have to encounter a raw and juvenile prevaricator than a reflecting veteran with length of experience and maturity of age where evidence is concerned the duty of learned judges such has ever hitherto been the case forbade them to do justice their duty is to preserve existing rules and existing rules were made that justice might not be done in a case of this sort—where evidence of this description was a chief ingredient in the composition of the mass of evidence—if it were lawful to discover truth truth might be discovered with at least as much facility and certainty as in the case of     ordinary evidence the fact if there be anything serious in it is established by real evidence—by the physical and physiological marks of violence here we see one of the perpetuallyrecurring cases in which all doubt might so easily be removed one way or the other by the examination of the defendant the examination of the child being taken out of the hearing of its parents on the one hand of the defendant on the other—that of the defendant out of the hearing of both—the light of truth could scarce fail to issue from the collision of the evidence where immaturity of age does not exist in any such degree as to deprive the child of the several degrees of the respective faculties concerned perception judgment memory and expression that are respectively necessary to bestow on the testimony the indispensable degree of correctness—the want of the faculties necessary to the execution of a successful plan of mendacity gives to such immature testimony in a very material respect the advantage of the maturest evidence in the immature and tender mind if the influence of the moral and religious sanctions is apt to be weak unsteady and precarious the mendacityrestraining influence of the physical sanction is stronger then than afterwards of memory if deeply impressed and vigorous as in the sort of case in question when taken fresh it can hardly fail to be the expression is delivered without effort invention under the perpetual condition of not being true and yet appearing to be true is the work of anxious and unremitting labour the less the mind is exercised in the habit of reflection the more apt will it be to sink under the trial by the power of the political sanction concentrated in this case in all its plenitude in the hands of the domestic ruler the will of the patient might be acted upon it is true with a mendacitypromoting force superior to any that may be expected to bear upon the patient in an adult state in a state of comparative independence in few adult minds is any other fear so strongly impressed as the fear of the rod is in general capable of being impressed on the infant mind by a severe and steady hand but the disadvantage to which in this case the interests of truth and justice are subjected by the weakness of the volitional faculty may be expected to be at least compensated for by the weakness of the intellectual faculty the child strives to lie as well as it is able but under the opposing force of crossexamination it is unable to lie with effect this much in regard to the case of infancy which is as already observed the only case of imbecility which has been taken for a ground of exclusion by english law a case however presented itself not many years ago in which a witness was rejected not indeed on account of imbecility but on the analogous ground of a supposed deficiency of appropriate knowledge indictment of a woman for bigamy rex v eleanor whetford guildford assizes saturday  th august   0  before the lord chiefbaron times and morning chronicle   th august both in the same words the first marriage or supposed marriage the parties both english at gretna green in scotland the celebration of the ceremony in the manner usual in gretna green marriages proved by the habitual operator the vicepriest a tobacconist david laing the gretna green parson was first called he stated that he performed the ceremony over the prisoner and her husband in his way that was he read nothing but he said something off the tongue and authorized them to cohabit together the lord chiefbaron said he would not admit this as a marriage he asked him what he was he replied a tobacconist his lordship observed that a fellow or two like the witness did these sort of things but both himself and the parties were liable to punishment     here then the fact was out of dispute the guilt in a moral view to say nothing of the religous equally out of dispute yet the judge acquits the prisoner—acquits her for evermore why because the state of the law in respect of the validity of the marriage was not according to the conception of the learned judge proved by a proper sort of person he would not receive the law of scotland from a tobacconist what nor yet from anybody else that both the fellow and the parties were liable to punishment so much his lordship knew so much he knew but exactly at that point stopped his lordships knowledge and what is more exactly at that point commenced his determination not to know by a special verdict not to mention other means in use he might have been informed and by the same regular course information of no slight importance to the whole country might have been gained in the case quoted above out of gwillem a step altogether out of the regular course was taken the evidence appeared not sufficient for conviction what was the regular consequence that the prisoner should be acquitted instead of that the trial is put off to the next assizes the defendant guilty or innocent in prison all the time the proceeding was reported to the twelve judges it was approved by them it was therefore legal of these twelve reverend and learned persons the lord chiefbaron himself was one had he thought of this when trying eleanor whetford he would have learnt that there are middle courses between instant conviction and instant acquittal if the learned judge thinks proper to employ them delay and of the same length in the one case created in the other case not created when created to what end that an infant under seven years of age might at the option of its parents be instructed in theology or in mendacity or in both while the memory of the supposed fact had if real all that time to fade in when refused to be created what were the circumstances under which the omission took place when the point that might have been aimed at by the delay would have been accomplished by it with the utmost certainty—accomplished to the satisfaction not only of the public at large but of the learned judge himself for says he if you have any advocate of character i will receive his testimony was there in the opinion of the learned judge any such universal perversity at the scotch bar as that no advocate of character would be to be found who in relation to this point of scottish law would be to be prevailed upon to give his opinion to the present purpose called his testimony for his fee in the former case the defendant witness was a fellow that did those sort of things in the guildford case the defendant was a young lady of handsome person and elegant manners and her appearance at the bar excited considerable sympathy on her behalf in the spectators in court why mention this circumstance i mention it in addition to what has already been said on that subject in another place that it may be seen so much the more distinctly how easy it is under the existing system for a judge in meting out justice to have two measures one for fellows—another for young ladies of handsome person and elegant manners and with what unhappy success power in reality arbitrary has been covered up from observation by technical forms by the description of the person of the defendant in the guildford case the recollection of the classical reader is naturally sent back a few thousand years to the incident which in all subsequent causes involved the proceedings of the court of areopagus in habitual darkness of course the handsome person and elegant manners of defendant eleanor whetford cannot possibly have exercised on the decision at guildford any such influence as in the case of rex v phryne proved so salutary to the defendant phryne and so fatal to justice under athenian judicature† concerning living judges where anything of moral blame would attach fiction herself is silent but as over departed ones history so over future contingent ones fiction at any rate maintains an undisputed power availing myself then on the present occasion of the right of fiction for abhorring it as exercised for any purpose of judicature i have not the least objection to it for the purpose of argument the use i make of it is this viz that under the law of england as it now stands viz in virtue of the features above described in it an english judge is at least as much at liberty as the judge of any other country in pronouncing his decisions to consult not to speak of his pocket his party his humour or his taste and that on condition of looking grave all the time and pronouncing certain combinations of learned words such as never can be wanting he will find no more difficulty in acquitting beauties than in browbeating fellows not but that so far as concerns the bare possession of the jus nocendi truth might serve a man for predicating it of all alike the living and the dead it is only when the faculty is to be spoken of as being in actual exercise that truth will decline to serve you recommending it to you to employ fiction in her stead     chapter vii of the restoratives for competency devised by english lawyers if directed to no other end than the avoidance of deception exclusion of evidence is bad altogether bad to the whole of its extent—whatever does anything towards the narrowing that extent is so far good such being the effect of the restorative processes now to be considered the application of them is so far good here then it might seem at first sight that they ought to be dismissed referring to the books for an account of them instead of seeking to augment the load of this work by superfluous matter in two points of view however it may be not altogether useless to bestow upon them a further glance one is the proof they afford if any further proof can be wanting of the impropriety of the rule of which in proportion to their extent they destroy the efficacy for in scarce any instance can the propriety of them be defended but by arguments which prove or assume the impropriety of the rule the other is the poison they keep infusing into so commanding a portion of the public mind the imbecility or improbity or both which on the part of the class of minds by which such conceits have been hatched they presuppose and tend to perpetuate the laws about witchcraft were in their day copious and tremendous sources of injustice the opposite conceit about exorcism might so far have its use if in here and there an instance it served to snatch a victim from the other prejudice or in any other way to narrow the channel of injustice but forasmuch as this quack remedy served to confirm in mens minds the opinion of the existence of the disease and thence to give extent and permanency to an opinion which is in itself a most cruel disease the effect of it was perhaps rather pernicious than beneficial upon the whole what exorcism has been to sorcery and witchcraft the restorative processes here about to be brought into view still are in relation to the practice of treating evidence as if it were betwitched and thence unfit for use in a system of law absurdity even although no immediate practical consequences are deduced from it is never a matter of indifference for whatever is found so exalted is venerated and whatever is venerated is imitated to keep up in the composition of the legal system as large a proportion of absurdity as the stomach of the people can be made to endure is among the deepest and the most favourite arts of lawyercraft the security of the impostor is in proportion to the stupidity of the dupe what renders the device the better adapted to its purpose is that in the situation in which the lawyer acts the most stupid and the most acute find equal facility in the practice of it to adorn a spot with a palace or strengthen it with a fortress demands the skill of the architect or the engineer but to encumber it with rubbish is an operation to which the rudest hands are competent especially if stationed on the heights above if what follows in this chapter should appear to resemble a sick mans dream rather than a work of reflection—should exhibit all the wildness of the arabian nights without any of the beauty—pardon gentle reader such as i have it give i it unto thee by me it has not any of it been made all that i have done by it is to present it in its native colours after stripping it of the mask of sapience in which lawyercraft and bigotry had dressed it up the theory of trustworthiness untrustworthiness and restoration of trustworthiness—of health disease and mode of cure so far as concerns the branch of the pathologicopsychological system here in question has revealed itself here and there in unconnected rudiments and fragments to the sagacity of english lawyers but with shame be it spoken never yet was it formed into a complete and consistent whole never was this interesting branch of the science of evidence placed upon its proper basis till the genius of dr gall arose and dazzled with its effulgence the eyes of astonished europe by the discoveries of that great man we are at length enabled to understand what english lawyers have been at the faculty of delivering true testimony depends like all other faculties moral and intellectual upon a particular organ which is the seat of it a portion or protuberance of the human cranium which may be called the organ of trustworthiness near this precious organ alas too near it are stationed the organs of interest and improbity two of the principal organs of untrustworthiness when the appropriate exciting matter correspondent to either of these respective organs applies itself to the system the organ of untrustworthiness dilates extends itself and by its overbearing influence depresses the organ of trustworthiness on the other hand no sooner is the appropriate and correspondent instrument of restoration taken in hand and applied secundum artem than the tumidity antecedently superinduced upon the organ of untrustworthiness subsides and the organ of trustworthiness like a giant refreshed rises and reassumes its native strength and stature     antecedently to this theory by which all difficulties are now at length cleared up the ingenuity of english sages had discovered though by a method not wholly clear of the imputation of empiricism divers remedies which acting upon the peccant and œdematous matter of the organs of untrustworthiness operate upon the organ of trustworthiness in the character of restoratives the annals of psychology afford a case of an unhappy gentlemen a mr simon browne whose misfortune it was one day to feel his immortal soul perish within him for a species of mortification so fatal in its extent the pharmacopœia of that day at least seems not to have furnished any remedy had the disease been confined to that part of the soul which is the seat of veracity the case would not have been thus desperate for the restitution of the organ of trustworthiness westminister hall affords no fewer than five specifics four of these are drawn from the mechanical school and consist in the scientific application of four several instruments† a burning iron a small seal a great seal and a sort of lever called a sceptre of the fifth the appropriate instrument is a tongue when the peccant matter acts in the shape of interest the small seal will suffice when it is of the nature of improbity nothing less than the great seal will serve the sceptre is applied to the same purposes as the great seal but the scale it acts upon is larger and indeed indefinite by the great seal improbity is discharged in a small stream as it were by a handpump and from only one bosom at a time by the sceptre it is discharged as from a pump worked like that at the royal dockyard at portsmouth by a steamengine the number of bosoms capable of being thus cleared by it and by a single stroke is absolutely without limit   burning iron—in the character of a restorative of competency when impaired by improbity the use of this instrument is confined to felonies and among those to clergyable felonies the iron being made red hot is applied to the hand there must be a hissing and an outcry but of each any the least degree is sufficient the outcry must be performed either by the prisoner or a lawful deputy the hissing may be performed by a piece of bacon in this case the modus operandi of the remedy is so obvious it is almost superfluous to mention it the virus is burnt out by the actual cautery exactly like the virus of a mad dog the organ of untrustworthiness collapses and its antagonist resumes its post somehow or other this remedy has of late years grown out of fashion instead of undergoing the operation of the cautery the patient is sent to breathe the air of new south wales whether the competency of such of the sojourners there on whose evidence others of them have been hanged was previously restored or no is not as yet known the question not having been yet laid before the twelve judges if yes it must have been by the air of the place known as it is to be in other respects remarkably salubrious the action of this restorative depends upon a variety of circumstances some of them not immediately obvious to any but learned eyes the difference for example between a felony clergyable editor illegible word editor illegible word to unclergyable‡ turns upon a farthing editor illegible word if the value of the article stolen being really  0s should be set a farthing too high the operation would fail this is so well known that in that case it never has been employed but if it were really worth eight or ten guineas and valued at as many shillings a case as frequent as the other is unexampled such undervaluation would not impair the efficacy of the remedy the offence may even be precisely the same—and yet no burning no veracity theft to the value of twelvepence farthing is grand larceny and grand larceny is burnable theft to no greater value than twelvepence is but petty larceny and petty larceny is not burnable the grand theft consequently when properly punished—that is properly pardoned—leaves the veracity unimpaired the petty theft till a late statute came in aid destroyed the veracity beyond recovery whether for example the veracity of a londoner who had stolen a quartern loaf was recoverable depended upon the assize of bread in london as settled for that week for stealing the selfsame loaf under the selfsame circumstances would be the grand or the petty offence according to the assize∥     neither is it to any such cause as the consummation of the punishment and the change of character inferred from the operation of its reforming powers that the return of veracity is to be ascribed other punishments may run their course other punishments whatever may be their duration may have run their course and the incredibility remain unextinguished it is not time but heat that works the cure neither does whipping possess any such virtue as that of a restorative to veracity for whipping is not fire a conviction of an offence for which whipping is the sentence expels the veracity but the execution of the sentence does not in this case bring it back again to a plain understanding the incredibility might as well be whipped out as burnt out or the new credibility whipped in as burnt in but this it seems is not law there is no purifier like fire doubts have arisen how an application made to the hand should ever reach the heart there are some people that will raise doubts out of anything some have been seen sitting upon benches for years together without doing anything but raising doubts not many years ago an ingenious physician of the mechanical school used to extract mercury out of the bones it was discharged in an uninterrupted stream by an hydraulic machine of his own invention for years together the advertisement was repeated in the london papers sir kenelm dighys method of curing wounds was by applying a small quantity of his sympathetic powder to a few drops of the blood the cure was performed without hindrance of business or knowledge of a bedfellow the patient might all the while be at any number of miles distant this with him was every days practice vide the cases as reported by the learned knight himself these cases are much stronger than the case in question   a great seal—the sort of great seal to be employed on this occasion is that which is employed for granting pardens supposing what has sometimes happened the ground of the pardon to have been the persuasion of the convicts innocence the restoration of the admissibility would under the rule of consistency be a necessary consequence in every other case whatever propriety there might be consistency is out of the question an experiment was once made by another sort of seal called a privy seal the experiment failed the seal was not found to be big enough† the pardon has it been a pardon upon the merits or not upon the merits what sort of a thing is a pardon upon the merits by what mark is it to be distinguished from a pardon through favouritism corruption or caprice what are the proper grounds for pardon—what lawyer ever thought it worth his while to put to himself any such question all these questions together with many another that might be added to them on the ground of reason are fortunately for the reader rendered superfluous by two determinations on the ground of positive law unless in particular circumstances exclusion on the score of infamy is not done away by a pardon on the merits it is done away by a pardon which cannot by any possibility have been a pardon upon the merits i mean a pardon granted by statute at a particular time to all malefactors without distinction in this case the instrument is   a sceptre—the power of this engine as applied to other purposes is no secret in the character of a restorative of trustworthiness it has never yet received the attention it deserves in the case of the burning iron the principle upon which that instrument acts has to render it clear been declared to be the same as in the case of the statute pardon the sceptre may to this purpose be considered as composed of an     infinite number of burning irons applicable at the same time and like sir kenelms sympathetic powder at a distance to an indefinite number of hands inquiring into each mans conduct and character would give infinity of trouble by so simple a contrivance as the application of a sort of rod called a sceptre to a roll of parchment all this trouble is saved so far everything is as it should be but one consideration presents itself suggesting melancholy reflections the power of trustworthiness and untrustworthiness is vested in the same royal and sacred hands as the power of life and death if it depend upon the pleasure of his majesty to extirpate the virus of mendacity from any the most corrupted hearts and in any number so must it à fortiori in any less tainted hearts—à multo fortiori in all untainted ones observe then the malice—the habitual and hereditary malice of the advisers of the crown for so many successive ages at no greater expense than that of a piece of parchment with the momentary use of a gilt stick the expense of which is incurred already they might banish for ever the spirit of mendacity from the lips of men they might make all men trustworthy—and they will not it has been exactly with these advisers of the defender of the faith and so forth as with those of the pope of rome possessing the key it depended upon him the successor of st peter to throw the gates of paradise wide open as those of kensington gardens on a sunday yet did he keep them shut opening only now and then a wicket all for the paltry profit of selling tickets one by one   to conclude and crown this list of cabalistical and preternatural restoratives of trustworthiness when expelled by improbity—we come to one the operation of which though more powerful than all of these put together is altogether natural and in the ordinary course of things this if in this case as in the others the instrument must be specified consists of the tongue of an attorneygeneral employed in so familiar an operation as that of telling a lie an assemblage of words purporting to be a history of the prosecution with the judgment in which it terminated is written upon a piece of parchment this parchment is called a record lies there are always in it or it would not be what it is—errors scarce ever in the case in question at any rate there are none this will not hinder the attorneygeneral from coming into court and saying if he is in the mood i confess errors in the record so sure as he does so so sure is he to be taken at his word it has been already mentioned as among the intermediate ends of lawyercraft to corrupt the morals of the people and among the means to that end the planting and cherishing in the public breast the love of lies by causing their salvation to be conveyed to them on every favourable occasion through that corrupt channel on the present occasion that sinister policy employs itself with peculiar advantage pursuing this line of policy lawyers have heaped mischief upon mischief that lies upon lies might be employed and popularity upon popularity gained by curing it they have acted as a surgeon would do who having a mad dog tied up should secretly cut or slip the knot that the animal on gaining its liberty might send in to its master a supply of patients in an endless variety of shapes they have entailed ruin upon the innocent and against this ruin they have left no remedy but in a lie for the guilty yes but for the innocent there is no mercy no safety but in a lie a pandoras box is opened upon the people and such is the contrivance of the machine that in nothing but a lie shall there be power to shut it under such a system where is the bosom that can defend itself against the love of lies american savages have been proverbial for cruelty the savage is mild and placable compared with the english lawyer the savage minces or broils his enemy and is satisfied the lawyer at a whisper from above gluts on the child unborn his unprovoked and mercenary cruelty no mischief is so unassuageable as that which employs for its instrument a mass of corrupted language perilluss bull after it had broiled its author was soon laid upon the shelf corruption of blood the invention of a corrupted understanding at the suggestion of a corrupted heart—that most barbarous of all abuses of words—remains if the lawyer have his will remains to corrupt justice as well as language to the end of time by a lie from the attorneygeneral lawyercrafts last shift such virtue is there in a lie even this syphilis so dexterously inoculated and so strictly entailed receives its cure the lie is spoken and the patient is made whole and not he alone but in and through him an endless line of patients     in this same ultimum remedium the suitor to whose indispensable witness guilty or not guilty it has happened to have been convicted of perjury beholds in one case his only hope i say in one case for here comes in quibble upon quibble prosecute at common law the inadmissibility is pardonable prosecute upon the statute for there is a statute against perjury it is not pardonable how is it then in this case and this alone has the sovereign been ill enough advised to tie up his own hands not he indeed but the man of law the corrupter of blood and language has tied them for him the same sophist who by his quirks ousted the innocent of pardon in that former case follows up his blow and ousts another set of innocent persons of whom as in the former case this and this alone is known viz their innocence such is the doctrine as it stands in the books not that any judge need be bound by it any further than it is agreeable to him to be bound by it cleansing our lips of the flash language—emerging from the regious of imposture—let us speak if possible in plain english the power of the privy seal to remit punishment and therewith to restore the faculty of giving testimony having been questioned on the behalf of the chancellor was disallowed but the power of the chancellor as we have seen has its limits among the officers of the crown to the power of the attorneygeneral and to that alone these limits oppose no bar the privy seal it may be said being placeable and displaceable by the king also the chancellor also the attorneygeneral—the distinction is but nominal in every case it is the power of the king acting only by different hands to a second glance however there will be a very substantial difference each functionary so long as he retains his office retains at least a negative upon everything that is done in it restrained by any considerations whatever let the attorneygeneral for the time being refuse to confess errors—unless by some strange mishap there should be errors and then perhaps not in all cases the testimony would be inadmissible meantime in this account is assumed a proposition which not improbably may not be true—viz that in virtue of a record in which at the suit of the king conviction and judgment are registered without outlawry—in the same way as outlawry is done away in a case where the king is nominal plaintiff by the kings attorneygeneral by so easy a process as the telling of a lie—so in case of conviction and judgment may all other penal consequences by the same lie perhaps this may not be true it would be scarce worth walking across the room to see all that has been said about it when once we steer a hairsbreadth out of the sphere of every days practice everything is matter of cross and pile jurisprudence is not among the subjects of human knowledge to predicate certainty of it or anything approaching to certainty—certainty to a discourse which has not so much as a certain word belonging to it is an abuse of language where statute law is and judges in due subjection there and there alone is certainty what the lion has striven in vain to do may sometimes be done by the mouse it has already been stated that if the parchment is out of the way the competency of the perjurer sets the gainsayer at defiance here then is a power of restoration vested in any hand which by fair or foul means with or without risk can gain a momentary command over the necessary parchment i throw out this as a hint to the ingenuity of future functionaries wheresoever stationed and howsoever denominated who with or without right possess the physical faculty of taking in hand these mysterious parchments which would be the more astute contrivance—smuggling the parchment for a few minutes or confessing errors in it when there are none and by a man who has never looked at it on other occasions availing themselves of the power they possess de facto over these precious parchments judges have made out of them for themselves the faculty of leaving a man in possession of a remedy or depriving him of it at pleasure for example in the case of a prosecution deemed malicious they begin with so ordering matters that without possessing a copy of the record the record in which the history of the prosecution is supposed to be given no man thus injured shall have it in his power to seek redress this done they allow him this copy or withhold it from him at pleasure the expedient is so perfectly in the style of jurisprudential science that though an innocent man were to be saved by it from punishment or the widow or the orphan from losing their subsistence for want of evidence i should not despair of seeing it if occasion served employed in practice were any other instance wanting the practice called withdrawing the record might serve to show that these mysterious tabernacles of pretended truth are never employed in a manner so congenial to their destination as when like cups and balls they are in some way or other made the instruments of trick and subterfuge by an unlearned reader a record of the court being a history of the proceedings of the court would naturally be supposed to be the work of an official hand treasured up in official custody and as little in danger of finding itself in any other than official hands as the regalia at the jeweloffice alas by the mob of gazers whose station is at a distance from the curtain how imperfect the     conceptions formed of the mysteries acted behind it it is the destiny of these jewels of the jurisprudential treasury to find a colonel blood in every plaintiff whose attorney sees reason to urge him to this daring enterprise by so simple an operation as the filching anglicojargonicè withdrawing the record—the plaintiff should it be his fortune to discover in time a momentary gap in his evidence gives himself a right to a new trial while under exactly the same necessity a defendant would be left to take his chance trying the cause a second time upon affidavit evidence to know whether it shall be tried a third time upon proper evidence necessity the mother of invention will sometimes give birth to expedients which when once brought to light are afterwards adopted by convenience in the theatre of the ingenious mr astley the lips of the dramatis personæ being sealed by authority scrolls upon great occasions perform the office of sweet sounds from this humble station might not a hint be taken for the use of a more exalted theatre a statue any one of the three kings might serve attired in the costume of the great officer of the crown his majestys attorneygeneral and upon the pulling of a string a scroll as it drops unrolls itself with this epigraph his majestys attorneygeneral confesses errors in the record not that it is in the nature of things that in any rank much less in so high a rank an english lawyer should feel himself less at his ease when saying the thing that is not than when saying the thing that is far be it from this pen to dip itself in any such injustice in that point there could not be any the smallest difference between the living person and the statue but a case not unfrequently realized is that—the habitual station of that high officer being not in that high court in which besides the three wooden kings the king himself is in the intendment of law always present but on the other side of the passage—the consequence is that as often as errors are to be confessed or any other function to be performed by the person of that high officer in that high court the passage is to be crossed this is the inconvenience in tender consideration whereof the proposal is submitted it being considered how perfectly light in the balance any quantity of mischief of which nonlawyers are the bearers is when set against a grain of inconvenience pressing upon any such learned especially any such eminently learned pair of feet or shoulders there needs no rhetoric to impress upon learned minds a due sense of the magnitude and importance of the occasion what if the learned gentleman in office for the time being were to come into court once for all and confess errors in all records present and future taking pro hâc vice lies for errors alas that would never do in the first place it would be true it would rip open the hen whose eggs are fees such are the restoratives to competency under english law is there any part of this theory of restoration capable of being regarded in a serious point of view let us try let us take that which presents the gravest aspect from the burning iron the great seal and the sceptre it may be said no great matters are to be expected admitted—of all these instruments—admitted they leave the man as they found him but the little seal this is quite another affair this does not leave a man as it found him this actually destroys his interest in a will a legacy of £ 0 is given to a man who otherwise would have had nothing does not that give him an interest in supporting the will by his testimony he agrees not to accept the legacy and in evidence of such agreement commits it to writing it is then called a release and puts his seal to the release his right to the £ 0 is now clearly gone and is not his interest the supposed mendacitypromoting motive gone with it no indeed is it not still the same imposture only a little more thickly covered in the first place let it never be out of mind that according to the principles of the exclusionists themselves as far as their principles can be judged of by their practice the nostrum never can be of any manner of use since be the interest which a man is under ever so great they admit him not withstanding they admit him as we have seen already when he is an extraneous witness they admit him over and over again as will be seen further on when he is a party in the next place if the state of the mind be at all considered it is not in the nature of the case that from the operation make the most of it the state of the witnesss mind should experience any material variation he releases he gives up his interest but whence came this sacrifice the sacrifice may be to any the greatest amount but to any the least amount a sacrifice without an inducement is an effect without a cause one cause alone constitutes any rational mode of accounting for such a sacrifice—viz a treaty between the proposed witness and the party to whose interest the testimony it is understood will be serviceable but if any such treaty has taken place the witness must have said over and over again and naturally to or in the hearing of more persons than one so and so is what at such a time and such a place i saw so and so is the testimony i have to give in other words over and over     again it must have happened to him to have delivered extrajudicially in the presence of a variety of witnesses in substance and effect if not in tenor the very evidence which if admitted he will have to deliver in judicial form and place how then can it be said that when the pecuniary interest is out of him supposing it really out of him he is devoid of interest if that be true which is so decidedly affirmed as well as disaffirmed by english lawyers that reputation reputation for truth and honesty is of no value to a man then indeed he is devoid of interest but if reputation be of any the least value to him if he would part with so much as a farthing to preserve it then even in that case he has still an interest and an interest adequate according to them to the production of mendacity in any case here then is an interest and that an adequate one—an interest not taken away by the operation but still subsisting remaining in all cases it supersedes the necessity of looking out for any of those modifications which may be produced by any difference in the nature of the interest in different cases but for illustration and still more complete satisfaction let us look a little way into those differences in the next place then here is a transaction between two parties an inducement there must have been on each side or the transaction could not have taken place on the one hand unless an advantage in some shape or other accrued to him from it the releasing witness would not have performed his part in it and moreover on the other part unless some advantage accrued to the party neither would the party have borne his part but this advantage to the party could not in the nature of the case have been constituted by anything else than a tie of some sort or other direct or indirect engaging the witness to persevere and deliver in court evidence to the same effect as that which had been delivered by him out of court what particular shape it may have happened to this tie to assume in each individual case it would in general be fruitless and always needless to attempt to investigate take the matter in another point of view the testimony thus vamped up—is it true or false if true the vamping is of no use if false what then is the effect of it useless then it is most completely this lawyers pantomime but though useless it is far from being inoperative it is practically mischievous though interest never can be a just cause of exclusion it never can fail to be a just cause of suspicion the object of the mummery the effect of it if it has any and it is not the lawyers fault if it has none is to wipe away this suspicion from the mind of the judge to cause a man whose testimony is really under the action of interest to be regarded as if it were not in some obstinate cases the virtue of the little seal has been found not altogether strong enough for the work assigned to it an occasion is upon record in which maugre all the efforts made by the witness to get rid of the interest and with it of the matter of untrustworthiness it stuck to him like birdlime so that the consequence was he could not be received experiments are not unknown to jurisprudence any more than to other arts the milder howsoever morbid and peccant matter of interest might it not be asorbed as it were by the more acrid matter of felonious untrustworthiness might   0 not the matter of interest be considered as merged in that of felony the doctrine of merger has done in its day greater feats than this if this be admitted everything else is plain sailing witness having an interest not purgeable by release commits a felony nothing more easy felonies are committed every day for much worse purposes plaintiff prosecutes witness pleads guilty puts on a bacon glove and is burnt in the hand attorneygeneral confesses errors in the record which whether there are any or not he is always ready to do on proper occasions and proper considerations if one of these operations will not be sufficient the other will at any rate both together thus if you have the misfortune to tar your coat put a little butter to the tar the tar is merged in the butter rub on a little oil called spirit of turpentine tar and butter are both merged in it altogether merge in air thin air and your coat is as admissible as it was before the pharmacopœia of technical restoratives bears no slight analogy to the impostures that at different periods have been seen acted on the spiritual and medical theatres—to exorcism animal magnetism and tractorism of the operations of the exorcist the success is infallible in the expulsion of nonexistent devils of those of the magnetist and the tractorist no less so in the expulsion of nonexistent diseases of the operations of the lawyer or rather the knot of lawyers for here cooperation is necessary the success in respect of the expulsion of the demon of mendacity out of the breast of the patient is no less assured provided he was never there if he has not been there at the moment preceding the operation neither is he immediately after it but if at that antecedent instant of time the demon was in actual possession of the premises is it in the power of the release with its talismanic seal to eject him the prayers and mandates of the exorcist the arm of the magnetist or the brass of the tractorist would be of equal efficacy in these several impostures as in most others the respective operators have this in common that in the instance of any given individual it is not always altogether easy to determine to which of two congenial and coharmonizing classes he appertains—that of the impostors or that of the dupes as to the jurisprudentialist his most common state is perhaps a sort of middle state between the two what he knows is that the pretence makes business and brings fees what he cares not about is whether it be true or false in one respect the jurisprudential operators fall far beneath the medical and pneumatological by the force of imagination in addition to the nonexistent diseases the magnetizer and the tractorist may not improbably have now and then administered cure or relief to an existent one by the same powerful though unsteady instrument it may even have happened to the exorcist to have quieted or soothed real and excruciating perturbations howsoever derived from an unreal source but after the acts of exorcism performed by the lawyers for driving the demon of mendacity out of the bosom of the witness—if so it was that at the time of clapping the seal to the parchment he was in possession of the premises in any one instance could he ever have been expelled on the north side of the tweed witnesses we have seen† are subject to a kind of disease called partial counsel it seems to be a sort of contagion the matter of which is adherent to the witnesss box fortunately the pharmacopœia edinburgensis affords a specific for it it is of the cathartic class scientifically shall we say or vulgarly called a purge a dozen or two of words are given a man to gabble secundum prœscriptionem he having first placed himself duly in the place and posture of a man giving evidence—and the remedy is at once administered‡ as to the peccant matter fortunately for the bystanders it goes off not by the primæ viæ like the matter of incredulity in the bosom of felix when as in hogarths print expelled by the eloquence of the christian orator but by a sort of insensible transpiration as to its efficacy the proof of it is in every days practice not a case in which the specific has ever failed to be administered not a case in which after the operation a patient was ever known to complain of any the slightest remnant of the disease     part iv view of the cases in which evidence has improperly been excluded on the ground of vexation chapter i vexation to individuals arising solely out of the execution of the laws not a proper ground of exclusion it has already been proved—that is observed for surely this is one of those cases in which to observe is to prove—that there are cases in which exclusion of the evidence on the ground of the vexation inseparable from the delivery of it is a proper measure—viz where the collateral mischief consisting of the vexation is preponderant over the direct mischief produced by the chance of misdecision or failure of justice resulting from the want of the evidence it was at the same time and in the same way proved that there are cases in which such exclusion bottomed on that same ground is not a proper measure—viz all cases in which the balance as between the two mischiefs is on the other side the several cases in which the mischief of the vexation resulting from the delivery of the evidence is capable of being preponderant over the mischief of misdecision or failure of justice for want of the evidence have this common property—viz that the vexation is produced by circumstances entirely independent of the uneasiness produced by the obligation of making any disclosure the effect of which is to subject the proposed witness or any other person to any punishment or other burthensome obligation to which it is the intention of the legislator that he should be subjected it is produced in all these cases by circumstances accidental and extrinsic for example disproportionate expense by reason of a long and expensive journey or voyage irreparable loss of time disclosure of collateral facts such as a third person has no right by law to be informed of besides these accidental lots of vexation there is however one which may be considered as naturally and in the ordinary course of things attached to the obligation of giving evidence and that is the thought of the unpleasant and more or less prejudicial consequences which the evidence may have the effect of producing to the prejudice of the proposed witness himself or some other person by reason of the execution of a judicial decision of which such evidence may constitute or help to constitute the ground by the idea of such consequences considered as liable to be produced by the evidence an unwillingness to deliver it which is as much as to say vexation in the event of its being delivered will in many cases be produced concerning this unwillingness indubitable or presumable a notion has obtained that in many if not in all cases in which the existence of it is regarded as certain or probable it constitutes of itself a sufficient reason for excluding the evidence to which it is regarded as attached and in one of the most enlightened nations of europe this notion having been adopted by judges and under their authority having formed itself into a rule or maxim of jurisprudential law has constituted the basis of an arrangement exercising a most extensive and important influence over the whole fabric of the law of procedure regarding it as one of the most pernicious and most irrational notions that ever found its way into the human mind i propose to allot this whole part to the task of sifting it to the bottom in the hope that the labour employed in a task at once so important and so new will not be regarded as illbestowed to constitute a just ground of exclusion the lot of vexation here in question must be a mass of that evil over and above what would have been produced by a decision to the same effect grounded on other evidence—on any evidence to which the lot of vexation in question would not have been attached for supposing the exclusionary notion to extend to all other evidence—to other evidence at large—to whatever vexation might come to be produced by evidence of whatever description having the effect of subjecting some person or other to the punishment or other burthensome obligation in question—to say that in consideration of the vexation thus resulting no such evidence ought to be received would be as much as to say there ought not to be any such thing as a punishment or other burthensome obligation ever imposed in a word that there ought not ever to be any such thing as a law but it may be said there are such things as bad laws and in no country is the body of the laws altogether free from them now the effect of the practice which in opposition     to the exclusionary rule in question forces testimony from persons of all descriptions without regard to unwillingness and consequent vexation is to give to whatever substantive laws it is employed in giving execution to a degree of efficiency much beyond what they would possess in the opposite case but by giving this extraordinary degree of efficacy to all laws substantive laws without distinction it will give the same degree of efficiency to as many bad laws as it happens to the aggregate body of the laws to include and forasmuch as in every existing system the extent of this mass of bad laws is more or less considerable the mischief of the practice against which the door is shut by the exclusionary rule would be proportionably great in the character of an argument in favour of the exclusionary rule the defect of this argument will i imagine be found apparent upon the face of it but inasmuch as when sifted to the bottom it will be found to lead to discussions of a very delicate and important nature i do not propose to leave it ultimately in its present state to stand altogether upon its own strength or weakness for the present however confining the examination to the question immediately appertaining to the present book i shall content myself with bringing to view by way of answer the following observations viz—   supposing that for the accomplishment of the purpose stated in the argument the exclusionary rule is upon the whole well adapted it can be so in no other respect than that of its operating in the character of a debilitative upon the whole of that portion of the body of substantive laws to which it applies weakening their efficacy—rendering them so much the less efficacious in respect of the purposes which they respectively have in view but so far as this alone is considered as the result of the rule in question and that result a beneficial one it is no otherwise of use than as any other institution or arrangement would be of use that should in an equal degree contribute to weaken the efficacy of the laws on one only supposition would the balance of its effects be on the side of benefit and that is if the aggregate body of the laws were so constituted that the mischief resulting from such as are mischievous outweighs upon the whole the good resulting from such as are of a beneficial character but that even under the worst government of which any accounts are extant the supposition here in question was ever realized seems altogether improbable for on this supposition a state of anarchy would be less mischievous than—would be preferable to—such a state of government   the person to whom it is proposed to form his opinion and consequent decision respecting the propriety of the exclusionary rule is the legislator in the political state in question either that rule is not as yet established or it is already established if not then considered as addressed to the legislator the argument stands thus— monitor in the state subject to your authority there are a multitude of bad laws to weaken their efficacy please to establish this exclusionary rule legislator excuse me of such laws if any as in my judgment are bad laws i shall not content myself with weakening the efficacy i shall abolish them altogether in regard to such of them as in my judgment are good laws i should be sorry to do this or anything else that should in any degree weaken their efficacy shift now the scene to a state in which the exclusionary rule has already been established— monitor in the state subject to your authority there are a multitude of bad laws it has been proposed to you to abolish the exclusionary rule do no such thing it is a most useful rule it serves to weaken the efficacy and thus to diminish the mischievousness of your bad laws legislator thanks for your caution but being also fortunate enough to have a multitude of good laws my wish is to give to those good laws the highest degree of efficiency they are susceptible of the effect of this exclusionary rule which you are so anxious to preserve is taking your own account of it to weaken the efficacy of whatever laws good as well as bad it is applied to taken in its natural state and unless subject to limitations to which you do not propose to subject it it applies to all laws and weakens the efficacy of all it is for this reason i mean that it should no longer have any application to any of the good ones and it is in that view that i mean to abolish it altogether as to the bad laws i shall not content myself with weakening their efficacy convince me of their badness and i shall abolish them monitor but among those laws which in your judgment are bad ones and which accordingly you propose to yourself to abolish may not there be some which regard being had to the affections and prejudices of the people it would appear to you not advisable to abolish legislator i should be sorry to find any such but if such there be there are several courses any or all of which i should prefer to the giving up the benefit of the increase which the abolition of the rule would give to the force of such of the laws as to me seem good ones   i would cause to be laid before the people     the reasons by which my disapprobation of such laws as to me seem bad ones was produced having operated upon my mind probably enough they may operate on other minds especially as coming from a station from whence if tolerably well dealt with men are apt enough to take their opinions as well as their laws and moreover should it so happen that by my reasons thus made known any others should be brought forth that in my maturer judgment should prove preponderant over mine i propose to myself to take the opposite course viz to go over to the side of the people instead of their coming over to mine   in the meantime if i despaired of being able either to bring over the people to my opinion or to carry over mine to theirs i could if i thought it worth while leave the debilitative rule to apply itself to the particular laws thus appearing to me to be bad ones leaving these laws in that state and degree in which i found them the people would have no reason to complain of me and barring the operation of the rule in debilitation of my good laws i should give to them all the operative force which it is desirable that good laws should possess in the case where the evidence in question is of the selfregarding the selfcriminating kind—if testimony extracted from a mans own lips were attended with any the smallest degree of probability of unjust suffering on his part over and above that which results from testimony extracted from an extrancous and indifferent witness there would then on the ground of danger of deception and consequent misdecision be in point of reason a ground not for exclusion indeed but however for suspicion and cantion more than ordinary on the part of the judge but who does not see that the supposition thus brought to view for the purpose of illustration and argument is a supposition which holds good not in the present case but in the case directly opposite viz that of selfserving testimony with only this difference that whereas in that case there is only a chance of the existence of falsehood on that side there is a certainty of the nonexistence of it in the present case it is not every man that will swerve from the truth for his own advantage a man of entire probity will not to the value of a hairsbreadth but there is not that man breathing who being in his right mind and having his own interest alone at stake ever will knowingly swerve from the line of truth to his own disadvantage there is but one sort of evidence which practically speaking is free from all danger of producing deception by mendacity and this is the sort of evidence upon which an exclusion has been put by english lawyers two men have each committed an offence or done each of them an improper act of any other description—an act which in both cases is improper in the same degree and the same way in the instance of one of them it so happens that the act can be proved against him without resorting to his own testimony in the other instance so it happens that though with the help of his own testimony it would be proved upon him yet without that help it cannot is there any earthly reason why the lot of one of these men should be better than that of the other why his suffering should be in the smallest degree less yet under the exclusionary rule one of them suffers not merely less than the other but absolutely nothing while his not more guilty fellow suffers the full rigour of the law cross and pile whether antecedently or subsequently to conviction would not by man in general would not certainly by english lawyers be regarded as a just and proper method of determining amongst two or more equally guilty which should and which should not suffer cross and pile when called in by the common sense of jurymen for their relief in a situation of honest doubt has been reprobated with indignation by their learned and official directors but in the case here in question acquittal by cross and pile would be a signal improvement if substituted to acquittal by the force and virtue of this exclusionary rule in cross and pile the naturallysagacious or learnedlyinstructed knave would not behold any means of safety more open to himself than to his less instructed fellows whereas it is the nature of the exclusionary rule to operate as a licence for delinquency to all those whose astuteness seconded by ordinary good fortune enables them to take advantage of it who shall count the multitudes that day after day have been acting under this licence for it is among the properties of this invitation to guilt that those who act under it with most felicity and success are those who enjoy the ulterior advantage of not being known to have acted under it that under the protection of this licence the impunity of the wicked may be as complete and the encouragement to wickedness as inviting as possible malefactors and lawyers have joined in another practice under circumstances of notorious delinquency liberated in virtue of this or any other incident foreign to the merits malefactors may be seen everywhere holding their heads high and as often as occasion presents itself assuming the port and language of injured innocence accordingly when a delinquent has been thus fortunate to speak of him in the character of a delinquent is an offence punished and with equal rigour as in the object     of the imputation had been a character of the purest innocence in a place where happily for the existence of society the offensiveness of unwelcome truth to the feelings of evildoers does not enable them to transfer upon their censors the punishment due to themselves what a clamour was once raised by the appellation of acquitted felons as if an acquitted felon was a sort of animal no more capable of finding itself in existence on english ground than a spider was supposed be in ireland all this while under the genial influence of this and so many other rules so ingeniously and successfully directed to this end acquitted felons and acquitted malefactors of all sorts and sizes are as much at home in the british isles as venomous serpents in guiana or crocodiles in the nile in a relaxed constitution of the body politic acquitted and unprosecuted malefactors of all kinds are no less congenial to that artificial body than in a constitution of the same character the tænia the lumbricus and the ascaris are to the natural body in one particular the parallel discovers an unhappy failure in the natural body it is not in the power and as little let us hope in the wish of the licensed practitioner to propagate the breed of the vermin to the plague of which it is exposed whereas in the political body by the instruments which there has been such frequent occasion to bring to view we have been seeing the hand of the practitioner occupied with unwearied perseverance in sowing the seeds of wickedness in every imaginable shape chapter ii enumeration of the sorts of evidence improperly excluded on this ground by english law various are the points of view in which the vexation that in this case appears to have been taken for the ground of the exclusion has been contemplated various the correspondent modifications of which the evidence regarded as the cause of such vexation has been considered as susceptible and the correspondent specific denominations that either have been or to express those several points of view and the consequent arrangements they have given birth to require to be respectively affixed to those modifications numerous are even the sources from which those modifications have been derived—   the nature of the consequences of the evidence in respect of good and evil hence the distinction—evidence of a nature to serve evidence of a nature to disserve   the identity or diversity of the person yielding the evidence and the person affected by the consequence of it hence the modifications expressed or expressible by the appellatives selfserving and selfdisserving or selfprejudicing   his station in the cause whether that of a party or an extraneous witness no appellatives deduced from this circumstance but in respect of the legal arrangements much importance given to it   nature and denomination of the suit on the occasion of which the evidence is proposed to be delivered viz criminal or noncriminal—commonly called civil   nature of the evil constituting the vexation viz the evil or disservice produced by the disclosure from this source and the second and fourth taken together come the modifications expressible by the several appellatives selfcriminative or selfinculpative selfdisgracing selfdiscrediting or simply selfonerative as where blame is out of the question   the nature of the affection which is the seat of the vexation viz whether selfregarding or sympathetic where one person a trustee stands charged with the interests of another a fideicommittee or cestuy que trust as in the case of guardian and ward factor or agent and principal lawyer and client especially where the existence of the relation is voluntary on the part of the trustee an affection of sympathy of which the fideicommittee is the object may naturally enough be supposed to exist in the bosom of the trustee this being assumed a consequence is that where from the evidence delivered by the trustee a vexation or prejudice of the selfregarding kind may be expected to befall the fideicommittee a proportionable howsoever short of equal vexation of the sympathetic kind may in like manner be expected to find its way from the same source into the breast of the trustee to this head may be referred the most plausible reason that has been found for the exclusion that has been put upon what taking the only appellative in use and which is of the dyslogistic or vituperative cast may be called trustbreaking or trustbetraying evidence where a number of individuals living together in the character of members of the same family as is the case with husband and wife parent and child evidence delivered by one member would be a cause of vexation to another—vexation in a mixed mass partly sympathetic partly selfregarding is liable to find its way into the bosoms of these several members from that source in this vexation we see the most plausible reason that has been found for the exclusion that has been put upon some of the modifications and some only of     that which may be termed familypeacedisturbing or familydisturbing evidence when the effect of a lot of selfcriminative evidence has been to produce the conviction of him by whom it has been delivered it is capable of receiving the appellation of selfconvicting evidence but forasmuch as antecedently to conviction this effect not having as yet taken place can only be matter of expectation and conjecture the appellation could not without impropriety be applied to selfcriminative evidence at any such antecedent point of time laying together the modifications deduced from the several sources above mentioned we shall find six species each presenting itself as entitled on some account or another to a separate consideration these are—   selfcriminative reaching beyond selfonerative   selfonerative and selfcriminative not reaching beyond it   selfdisgracing   selfdiscrediting   trustprejudicing   familypeacedisturbing the effect of the testimony will be in some respects different and the reasons for and against the admission of it stand upon a correspondently different footing according as the station which the proposed deponent occupies in the cause is that of a party or that of an extraneous witness we will consider him successively in both these stations as a party in the ensuing part as an extraneous witness only in the present chapter iii impropriety of the exclusion put upon selfdisserving evidence by english law §   uses of selfdisserving evidence and mischiefs resulting from its exclusion the fundamental rule on this subject is generally given in latin nemo tenctur seipsum accusare no man is bound to accuse himself taken by itself the proposition as thus delivered having its source rather in the affections than in the understanding has more of rhetoric in it than of logic and presents no clear idea until it be translated into more simple language the part of an accuser is one part that of a witness is another the part of the accuser is that of the plaintiff of which that of the prosecutor and that of the informer are modifications these being names that are given in different cases to the plaintiff according to the nature of the cause by no man shall be bound to do so and so is meant no man shall be liable to be punished for not doing so and so of the proposition no man is bound to accuse himself the literal meaning reduced to clear and unambiguous language is no man shall be liable to be punished for not instituting a penal suit against himself for not preferring a bill of indictment against himself or lodging an information against himself or not bringing a penal action against himself or preferring an appeal against himself—as the case may be in plain english the maxim is neither more nor less than so much nonsense to find an intelligible meaning for it we must have recourse to practice we must shut up our lawbooks and observe what passes before our eyes we then find that the question is not whether a man shall be bound to commence a suit against himself nor yet whether without being called the suit being commenced by any other person he shall be bound to come and give evidence against himself but whether being called and questions being put to him he shall be bound to make answer to such questions the substitution is not a mere impropriety but a sophism a fraud a law which should say to a man—whenever it happens to you to commit a crime come and accuse yourself come and give information against yourself—would on the face of it be an absurd one the object of the sophism is to cause it to be believed that in the liberty of propounding to a man under accusation or suspicion of a crime questions the object of which is to discover whether he is guilty or no this sort of absurdity is involved but that no such absurdity is involved in that liberty is what everybody will see to whom it is not more agreeable to shut his eyes observe too what in this case is the import attached to the terms expressive of obligation—bound forced compelled observe what is the nature of the compulsive force obligation to speak is not here in question in the case where the penal process is of the acute kind punishment directed to this object is what has been commonly expressed in french by the word question—in english by the word torture obligation on the part of the defendant there is in fact in this case none what it imports is mere permission permission to the adverse party the plaintiff and to the judge one or both to put questions to the defendant for the sake of the faculty which thence results to the judge of noting the answers or the silence whichever is the result and drawing his inference from them from the faculty of putting these questions what is it that the defendant has to fear it is this from the known principles of human nature according to a course of observation common to all mankind—according to the result of a set of observations which it can scarce happen to a man to have arrived     at mans estate without having had frequent occasion to make—between delinquency on the one hand and silence under inquiry on the other there is a manifest connexion a connexion too natural not to be constant and inseparable the delusive language in which interested artifice has dressed out the exclusionary rule being thus stript off let us now take a more detailed observation of the mischiefs flowing from it these mischiefs will correspond to the uses of the species of evidence thus marked out for exclusion i e to the occasions on which and purposes for which the demand for it is liable to present itself   in the first place in so far as it is to be had it has already been stated as being not only upon the face of it but by the confession of those who notwithstanding have been in the habit of excluding it the very best possible sort of evidence the evidence the most completely satisfactory evidence in a word so completely and even exclusively satisfactory that according to the roman system after the delivery of such evidence as under english law is deemed conclusive even where the punishment is at the highest pitch the mass of evidence is regarded as deficient without evidence of this kind and the deficiency as being so important that torture howsoever ill employed has under the dominion of that jurisprudence been everywhere employed for the filling it up first use of selfdisserving evidence—augmenting the security against misdecision and failure of justice by furnishing the most trustworthy and satisfactory ground of decision the best security against failure of justice or misdecision for want of evidence—viz evidence of the best most trustworthy most satisfactory kind habes confitentem reum says the roman orator as much as to say having this what more can you desire   this is not all under the distress produced by the exclusion put upon the best evidence recourse has been had through a sense of necessity and that the wound given to justice might not be past endurance to bad evidence of various descriptions evidence the inferiority of which has on other occasions and where for want of better there has been a real demand for it been not acknowledged merely but proclaimed under this description come—  the supposed confessorial testimony of the party delivered through the medium of hearsay evidence and of course in case of misconception designed or undesigned without the opportunity of explanation completion and correction   written discourse supposed to be in the handwriting of the party and supposed to contain on his part a sort of confessorial testimony delivered in the state in which it has been supposed to be found but at the option of the adverse possessor complete or mutilated and at any rate without adequate opportunity given of explanation second use of selfdisserving evidence—adding a security against misdecision and failure of justice by adding or substituting more trustworthy evidence to less trustworthy       the person whose bosom is the source of selfdisserving evidence the plaintiff or more commonly the defendant in the cause is one person that person is forthcoming of course whatever evidence is extractible from that source is extractible on the spot and without addition to the expense stop up that source whatever evidence you can hope to get from other sources if got at all you must get as you can from perhaps a variety of sources from each at the end of an indefinite length of time and under the pressure of an indefinite load of expense hence third use of selfdisserving evidence saving of delay vexation and expense a striking illustration of this last use is afforded by the case in which for the conviction of a defendant it is necessary that his handwriting should be proved as at a trial at common law the party himself the defendant can in no case be examined in behalf of his adversary the plaintiff the plaintiff to prove the defendants handwriting is obliged to go upon the hunt for other witnesses in some instances a witness for this purpose will be to be had without any additional expense but this is altogether matter of chance and for this single purpose it may be necessary to fetch a witness on purpose at any degree of inconvenience to the witness from any imaginable distance and consequently at a proportionate expense this expense rests ultimately on the shoulders of the party who on that side bears the burthen of costs if the burthen of costs rested uniformly on the party who is in the wrong even in that case this unnecessary expense would be a grievance in case of mala fides indeed it may have its use in the character of a punishment but it would be a supposition by much too favourable to the intellectual character of the law and by much too injurious to the moral character of the people to suppose this to be the more common case nor yet does the burthen of costs rest with anything like uniformity upon the party who is in the wrong or even upon the party whom the decision supposes to be in the wrong so far from it that to distinguish the cases in which it shall rest upon the party who is supposed to be in the wrong from those in which it shall rest upon the party supposed to be in the right is a discussion that occupies the contents of a reasonable octavo volume the expense which consists in the pecuniary allowance to the witness added to that of the instrument of summons with the lawyers fees belonging to it appears in pounds shillings and pence but the delay and vexation not to speak of incidental and casual expenses which may be the necessary accompaniments of the process of investigating by reflection and hunting out by inquiry a mans connexions for the purpose of lighting on some person capable of proving his handwriting by the regular mode of proof all this put together forms a mass of inconvenience which though it cannot always be correctly expressed in pounds shillings and pence is neither the less real nor the less heavy when the sort of witness in question or one who is thought to be such or pretends to be such has been hunted out the prize may but too easily turn out to be no better than a snare and a source of miscarriage the suitor whose misfortune it is to stand in need of such testimony is thus rendered dependent upon the probity and prudence of an individual more or less likely to be in connexion with the adversary in case of nonappearance the witness is indeed answerable in damages be it so but suppose the property at stake an affair of thousands while a few hundreds or scores would afford the witness a sufficient inducement to stand an action on that ground or to take himself out     of the reach of it suppose another modification of fraud more simple and more safe to a question put out of court can you prove such or such a mans handwriting the witness who in fact cannot answers however and purposely in the affirmative on the trial he answers in the negative the document a necessary one a note of hand suppose is set aside and the cause is lost what punishment what remedy perjury by the supposition there is none and for the falsehood out of court there is no punishment the only sort of person to whom it is possible speaking of suitors to profit by the pretended tenderness of this rule is the knavish and immoral suitor who being in the wrong and knowing himself to be in the wrong avails himself of the inability of the adversary to fulfil the conditions thus wantonly imposed upon him by the law avails himself of this misfortune to obtain a triumph over justice it is for the purpese of rewarding and encouraging the iniquity of one knave of this description that the useless burthen above delineated is fastened upon the shoulders of perhaps a hundred suitors on the supposition of a perfect calmness as between the parties seconded by an uncommon degree of intelligence as well as disinterestedness on the part of their agents possible it certainly is for this source of delay vexation and expense to be avoided mutual and amicable explanations having taken place the party whose handwriting is in question agrees to admit it at the trial all this is a possible case but is it the most common case let experience declare not that so much as the possibility extends beyond that class of cases which are ranked under the head of civil cases in cases called penal any such sacrifice to truth is altogether out of the question to the list of the uses rendered to justice by this best of all evidence corresponds the list of the mischiefs produced by the exclusion of it promoting in two distinguishable ways misdecision and failure of justice making a factitious addition to the natural and necessary quantities of delay vexation and expense to these mischiefs may be added another the opposite of which could not so conveniently have been presented under the head of uses i speak of the poison continually infused by the exclusionary rule into the moral branch of the public mind hold the virtues of veracity and sincerity in contempt or detestation look up to mendacity and insincerity as your strongholds the pledges of your security look upon the licence of exercising them as the boon for which you are indebted to the mercy and lovingkindness of the man of law hold nothing for base and mean that promises to preserve you from the obligation of rendering justice—from the antireligious and hellborn rules do as you would be done by repent and suffer for your sins hold nothing for base and mean—or holding your heads high and speaking in a tone of firmness and defiance maintain that to practise whatever is most base and mean is among the englishmans most honourable privileges deny your own handwriting in so many words—or denying it in deportment as significative as words refuse or forbear to recognise it deny your written words and when a question is put to you by words spoken keep your lips close lest the truth should make it escape and justice be done such is the exhortation which the exclusionary rule never ceases to deliver to the people such is the lecture delivered by the judge by every judge as often as he marks with his approbation this flagitious rule a man who uninvested with any coercive power should in the character of a moral instructor—of a schoolmaster a lecturer or a divine—stand up and say to his auditors if a man with whom you have a difference happens to have in his hands a letter or memorandum of yours that you apprehend would make against you deny it—do not own it—put him to the proof of its being yours and if he is not able triumph over him as if he were in the wrong—if it were possible that a man without power for his protection should take upon him to preach such doctrines he would be abhorred and not without reason as a corrupter of the public morals what then shall be said of those by whom such baseness is not simply recommended but efficaciously rewarded men sow vice and then complain of its abundance the same hands which are every day occupied in thus planting     and propagating mendacity are as constantly lifted up against it and employed in punishing it the above is not the only mode in which this superstition is a source of corruption to public morals it is from the wanton sacrifice thus made of the purest evidence that the field of justice is regularly inundated by the foulest and most polluted to save one malefactor from the vexation of returning answers to unpleasant questions the answer of a no less guilty malefactor is purchased by impunity crowned with rich remuneration among partakers of the same crime a gang of burglars murderers or incendiaries ille crucem pretium sceleris tulit hic diadema and the order of things which among the corruptions of ancient rome is painted by the poet as the summit of injustice is in the eternally vaunted law of modern britain become the ordinary course of what goes by the name of justice thus it is that to the punishment of one confederate in a knot of malefactors the nourishment and encouragement of another is become a condition almost inseparable and to this together with certain other superstitions alike adverse to the interests of morality and justice—to this and those together it is to be ascribed that—whereas in other countries the arts of depredation are carried on only by fits and starts upon the spur of an occasional temptation by here and there an unconnected and unsupported individual—in england they are carried on professionally and systematically by associations of malefactors bound together in the ties of partnership in bands now and then thinned never extirpated under the eye and with the protection and encouragement of the three constituent branches of government the judicial the executive and the legislative out of the same root grows that system of remuneration which renders it an act of improvidence on the part of the subordinate ministers of justice to remove a scholar in the school of deptedation before he has risen to the head of it—to fasten upon a pilferer till he has ripened into a burglar—to take at £ 0 a prisoner who by a little forbearance might have yielded £ 0 just as among renters of fishponds it would be bad husbandry to take a pike of five pound weight out of a pond in which he might have thriven on to ten pound §   causes of the exclusion of selfcriminative evidence—  interests of criminals and other evildoers   interests of lawyers in seeing the mischiefs entailed by this rule upon the community at large we see its uses to criminals delinquents malâ fide defendants extortious and oppressive plaintiffs in a word to evildoers of all sorts and sizes moreover in seeing the persons to whom it is of use the persons whose sinister interests are served by it we see the hands and the hearts that stand pledged for its support in speaking of the taxes on justice it was mentioned as one of the unfortunate characteristics of this species of tax that though of all taxes actual or possible the most burthensome and in every respect the worst it was not in the nature of it to find opponents because the body of litigants if a body it could be called being ever fluctuating and essentially split was to the purpose of mutual support and opposition to extrinsic pressure no better than a rope of sand and what is more were the body itself ever so well knit together it would still be but a body without a head the tax therefore uniting in itself these two unhappily conjoined properties—viz of producing the greatest possible quantity of misery to the people and the least possible quantity of opposition and uneasiness to the man in office the result was but too obvious relief was hopeless unless the moment perhaps an ideal one should ever arrive that should produce a financier to whom the most important interests of the people should be dearer than his own momentary case† in the present case the tables are unhappily reversed throughout the whole substance of the community extends itself like the tænia in the natural body a cluster of internal enemies possessing amidst whatever other diversity of interests the common sinister interest urging them to behold their security in whatever arrangement contributes to weaken the efficiency of the law the rule in question being as we have seen a capital article in the list of debilitatives will naturally be the object of a proportionate degree of attachment to the body thus composed to the body of litigants besides being divided against itself there is no head the body of delinquents including those who for having the law on their side are but so much the more mischievous find a regular and irresistible head in the man of law—in him who during the sleep or fascination of the legislator possesses and exercises all the authority of the legislator though without the responsibility or the name with all its blemishes the aggregate body of the laws having more in it of that matter which is beneficial to all men than of that which is prejudicial to this or that one—it is more it may be said for the advantage of the whole community taken together that the force of the aggregate body of the laws   0 should be at its maximum than that it should stop short at any inferior degree true if the interest of all were understood by all to be exactly as it is and felt in proportion as it is understood but such is mans nature a slight interest coming home to his own bosom and presenting itself in distinct colours will act on him with greater force than a much stronger one common to himself with others and viewed at an indeterminate distance whosoever on any special account whatsoever regards himself as obnoxious to the adverse pressure of the laws will behold in the weakness of the laws and in every institution that presents itself as contributing to the weakness of the laws the means of safety the advantage depending on the protection afforded to him by the laws against a crowd of possible injuries not presenting themselves individually to his view will in comparison with this conspicuous and distinct advantage act upon his mind with very inconsiderable force the smuggler the official peculator and the political malcontent would each of them find in a regulation which should cure any of the weaknesses of the law an increased security against whatever mischiefs he stands exposed to at the hands of the common herd of malefactors but the more distinct and nearer the danger with which he might conceive himself threatened by the influence of the same remedy the more apt would the new security be to present itself is far from being worth to him the price which he would have to pay for it profit the difference between the old and the new security against depredation at large loss to the smuggler his livelihood—to the peculator his illgotten gains—to the political malcontent the object of his plots the anxiety to preserve the body of the laws from being cleared of these debilitative poisons will according to circumstances display itself with particular force sometimes in the inferior sometimes in the superior classes when in a criminal cause the station of defendant was occupied by john wilkes the vilest quibbles that ever issued from the lips of depredation under the mask of justice were revered as oracles in a mixed constitution like the british by some odd turn in the wheel of fortune it will now and then happen that among a multitude of secret or unnoticed instances of official delinquency some one shall be unfortunate enough to become the subject of prosecution on such an occasion that the defendant how clear soever his guilt should find one at least of two parties zealous in his support is a matter of course here then the debilitative poisons above spoken of become the object of eulogy and attachment in the highest circles if those that have been compounded for past exigencies present themselves as sufficient for the present turn they are made the most of and no others looked for if in the pharmacopæia politica no remedies of this class as yet upon the list promise to come up to the purpose others must be made up inveniam aut faciam such is the alternative a revolution in administration it may be said offers a chance for justice since by motives congenial to those by which one party stands engaged to undermine an opposite party and that for the moment at least the stronger stands engaged to defend the foundations of justice but unfortunately the incentives which animate the assailants are apt to be neither so universal nor so strong in their operation as those which animate the defendants for at the bottom of this momentary interest thus salutary to justice there exists a common interest and that a paramount one by which transgressors of all parties are linked together in an interest opposite to the interests of justice it is to the advantage of all men who partake or hope to partake in the sweets of administrative power that the laws by which they and men in their sphere have made a show of binding themselves should in everything but show he as near as possible to a dead letter if under such a constitution it should at any time happen that of the two contending parties each should contain a delinquent whose delinquency had been flagrant enough to attract public notice it may be imagined how generally dear to all public men every institution would be that was seen to act as a sedative upon the force of justice—how strong and general an aversion would await any remedy that promised shall we say or threatened to render to the arm of justice its due tone under such a constitution a natural not to say a necessary consequence is that the course of procedure so long as it has jurisprudential law for its guide should swarm with rules which without contributing in any degree to the protection of innocence should by the protection they hold out afford in a variety of ways an efficient enconragement to delinquency and injustice of the rules thus made made especially on that level to be assured of their being directed to ends other than the end of justice a man needs no more than to observe the place in which in conjunction with the occasion on which they are made the occasions on which they are made are uniformly of the number of those in which mens individual interests being at stake and their affections heated they find themselves while in the state of parties called upon to make laws for the guidance of their own conduct in the character of judges the same minds whose partialities excited by the incidents of the moment render them no less unfit than the grossest corruption     would do to act with the authority of a legislator in the station of a judge—these same minds when free from the disturbance produced by the sinister interest of the moment may without any departure from the rules of moral probability be expected to join with fidelity and concord in the pursuit of that general interest by which the line of public duty is prescribed witness the grenville act so fair and efficient a step in the improvement of that political constitution the praises of whose excellence are so generally excessive and beyond to the most exorbitant extent its merits but of which this may with justice be said and of much importance it is to be deemed that it can so with justice be said—the british constitution forms a basis for building those improvements which would terminate in a perfect government—a basis the firmest by far that ever was presented by any government that had existence upon earth in seeing the uses of the exclusionary rule to malefactors and evildoers of all descriptions we have seen its uses to the man of law whatsoever is seen to diminish the security against misdecision and failure of justice and thence whatsoever is really productive of that effect is subservient to the interest of the man of law in the minds of transgressors and malâ fide suitors it helps to fortify the opinion that no cause whatsoever no cause however bad ought to be given up as desperate subsequently to transgression in the minds of those who have already transgressed it operates as a premium for dishonest defence or dishonest demand as the case may be antecedently to transgression on all minds exposed to temptation that is in a word on all minds it operates as a premium for transgression for injustice in every shape the vexation expense and delay so frequently attached to the production of the inferior evidence resorted to on the exclusion of the most satisfactory species of evidence have just been brought to view on this occasion as on all others lawyers profit being both cause and effect of that tripleheaded mischief the use which the exclusionary rule is of to the man of law is selfevident by the vexation expense and delay it adds to the quantity of lawyers profit in each cause separately taken by the chance it affords of misdecision or failure of justice for want of the excluded evidence it adds to the encouragement given for dishonest defences and demands and thence to the number of the individual sources from which that pernicious profit may come to be derived meantime although to lawyercraft and the benefit derived from this rule by judge and co the principal share in the establishment of it may be to be ascribed—what cannot but be admitted is that to the production of this effect circumstances of a different and more laudable complexion would probably be found to have been not altogether without their induence in the character of cooperating causes—  tyranny of the times anxiety and on the ground of public utility real need of saving at any price the precious few who were at the same time able and willing to stand in the gap   multitude and extent of bad laws the result either of improbity or folly   savageness of the people in general and of the fraternity of lawyers in particular propensity on their part to fasten upon an innocent man and especially if on any particular account whether political or personal obnoxious to treat him as—under the lash of crossexamination by hireling advocates under the eye of careless or approving and abetting judges—men are but too frequently treated in the character of extraneous witnesses to fasten upon him and by intimidation and misrepresentation to wring out of venial infirmity the appearance of criminality sometimes even the appearance and colour of delinquency out of the purest innocence §   pretences for the exclusion   at the head of everything which with or without the name of a reason has been advanced or is capable of being advanced in the view of securing the attachment of the people to the exclusionary rule let us place the old sophism the wellworn artifice sometimes called petitio principii and which consists in the assumption of the propriety of the rule as a proposition too plainly true to admit of dispute in the minds of some men not to say the bulk of men if you set about proving the truth of a proposition you rather weaken than strengthen their persuasion of it assume the truth of it and build upon it as if indisputable you do more towards riveting them to it than you could do by direct assertion supported by any the clearest and the strongest proofs by assuming it as true you hold up to their eyes the view of that universal assent or assent equivalent to universal dissenters being left out of the account which from your assumption they take for granted has been given to it you represent all men or what comes to the same thing all men whose opinions are worth regarding as joining in the opinion and by this means besides the argument you present to the intellectual part of their frame you present to its neighbour the volitional part another sort of argument constituted by the fear of incurring the indignation or contempt of all reasonable men by presuming to disbelieve or doubt what all such reasonable men are assured of     for exemplifications of the use of this instrument of persuasion—of the application of it i mean to the present purpose—it is altogether useless to make reference to this or that particular book or books you hear it in all discourses you see it as often as occasion serves in all books and in all newspapers   the old womans reason the essence of this reason is contained in the word hard tis hard upon a man to be obliged to criminate himself hard it is upon a man it must be confessed to be obliged to do anything that he does not like that he should not much like to do what is meant by his criminating himself is natural enough for what it leads to is his being punished what is no less hard upon him is that he should be punished but did it ever yet occur to a man to propose a general abolition of all punishment with this hardship for a reason for it whatever hardship there is in a mans being punished that and no more is there in his thus being made to criminate himself with this difference that when he is punished—punished he is by the very supposition whereas when he is thus made to criminate himself although punishment may ensue and probably enough will ensue yet it may also happen that it does not what then is the hardship of a mans being thus made to criminate himself the same as that of his being punished the same in kind but inferior in degree inferior in as far as in the chance of an evil there is less hardship than in the certainty of it suppose in both cases conviction to be the result does it matter to a man would he give a pin to choose whether it is out of his own mouth that the evidence is to come or out of anothers to this to which in compliance with inveterate and vulgar prejudice i have given the name of the old womans reason i might with much more propriety give the name of the lawyers reason when a child has hurt itself and a chirurgical operation is deemed necessary for its cure it may be that here and there an old woman may be found weak enough to exclaim oh the poor dear child how it will hurt the poor dear child how hard it will be upon the poor dear child and so on no it shant be doctored it would be too much to say that such old women do not exist but sure enough they would not in any very considerable number be very easy to be found but the lawyer in disposing of the fate of those who if they were in any degree dear to him would not be dealt with by him as they are has never—let us not say any other—at any rate employs scarcely ever any better style of reasoning the reasons most plenty with him the only reasons that are not rare are technical reasons the reasons that with him are choice and rare the reasons brought out only now and then are these old womens reasons reasons consisting in the indicating out of a multitude of reasons standing on each side some one only on one side nor yet is all this plea of tenderness—this doubledistilled and treblerefined sentimentality anything better than a pretence from his own mouth you will not receive the evidence of the culprit against him but in his own hand or from the mouth of another you receive it without scruple so that at bottom all this sentimentality resolves itself into neither more nor less than a predilection—a confirmed and most extensive predilection for bad evidence for evidence the badness of which you yourselves proclaim and ground arguments and exclusions upon in a thousand cases what every man knows and what even yourselves in spite of all your science cannot be ignorant of is—that of all men the man himself is the last man who would willingly speak falsely to his own prejudice and that therefore against every man his own is the safest the most satisfactory of all evidence and it is of this best and most trustworthy of all possible evidence that your pretended tenderness scrupies not to deprive the interests of truth and justice you know of such or such a paper—tell us where it may be found a request thus simple your tenderness shudders at the thoughts of putting to a man his answer might lead to the execution of that justice which you are looking out for pretences to defeat this request you abhor the thoughts of putting to him but what you scruple not to do and why should you scruple to do it is to dispatch your emissaries in the dead of night to his house—to that house which you call his castle to break it open and seize the the documents by force not that in any such act of violence considered as a necessary means to a necessary end there is anything to blame it is on the score of inconsistency and that alone that it is here worth mentioning two means to the same end the one violent—the other free from violence the quiet one is too violent for you you embrace the violent one and not only in preference to the other but to the exclusion of it and this is your delicacy your tenderness it is not however true that even as towards criminals if taken in the aggregate the plea of humanity can be pleaded in behalf of this rule consistently with truth humanity yes—viz the word for as to the thing itself if effects be considered howsoever it may be with regard to motives and intentions in any practice grounded on any such rule it is no more to be found than the thing called justice     of the man who with the word humanity in his mouth calls for this or that thing to be done the expectation if there be any determinate expectation is this or nothing—viz that supposing the course thus recommended by him pursued the consequence will be that upon the aggregate number of offenders who for the offence in question will have suffered within a given length of time the aggregate quantity of suffering undergone will be less than it would have been had the course pursued been the opposite but of any such rule as that here in question the necessary effect in so far as it has any is not to lessen that aggregate quantity of suffering but to increase it by whatsoever cause the ratio of the number of known but yet unpunished to the whole number of known offenders is increased—in that same ratio the known and apparent probability of punishment in the eyes of a person having it in contemplation to engage in the commission of an offence of that sort is diminished but on the mind of any given person to produce by means of punishment an impression of any given degree of strength and efficiency in proportion as the probability is diminished the magnitude must be increased in playing at cards or dice in buying and selling a lifeannuity or a postobit there is not a proposition more incontestable be the offence be the punishment what it may—in proportion as you exclude this or that quibble this or that device of technical procedure by which a certain proportion of the whole number of delinquents are saved and the probability of punishment in case of delinquency thereby diminished you would put it in your power to make a correspondent and proportionable reduction in the magnitude of your punishment what is the same thing in other words—it is because your law is so full of quibbles exclusionary rules and other points of practice by which impunity is given and seen to be given to known delinquents that the probability of punishment being subjected to constant diminution delinquency receives proportionable increase and for combating it the only other resource remaining and the only resource that a quibbleloving lawyer will endure to hear of is an increase of the magnitude of the punishment to make sure and do at once all that can be done the punishment which on every such occasion he runs to in preference is the punishment of death death simple death as being though not the highest and most impressive which human nature is capable of being subjected to since afflictive death—death accompanied by torture might to an indefinite degree be made higher the highest however which in this age and country men in general would endure the mention of under the influence of such humanity this then is the sort of repetend that takes place by the generation and application of penal law quibbles and of impunitygiving rules a demand real or supposed is produced for addition to the magnitude of the punishment an addition and in each case sooner or later such an addition as consists in substituting to the last antecedentlyestablished punishment be it what it may the punishment of death but by the increase given to the application of the punishment of death increase is at the same time given to the propensity and the pretence for the application of other quibbles and other impunitygiving rules under this system that which consistency would require not that with such humanity any sort or degree of consistency is compatible is that for offences of all sorts there should never be any other than one sort of punishment and that one sort death for so long as quibbles are in honour and applied to delinquency in every shape—delinquency till the punishment be raised to this its maximum will go on increasing thereupon comes the argument—against the act in question there exists a law by which it is converted into an offence to this offence a punishment stands annexed and this punishment notwithstanding it was but the other day that an offence of this sort was committed this punishment is not so great as the punishment of death substitute to it the punishment of death and thereupon if the repetition of the offence be not less frequent than of late years it has been at any rate the utmost will have been done that can be done towards rendering it so this is exactly what sooner or later may be said of every offence that ever has been or can ever be capable of being committed and as often as the punishment of death has been proposed to be substituted to the previouslyestablished punishment more than this never has been said—more than this has never been regarded as necessary to be said—more than this in substance has never been capable of being said thus it is that to one and the same individual to one and the same weakminded and narrowminded the same halfbigot halfhypocrite lawyer it belongs to be fond of quibbles and at the same time to be fond of death in regard to death understand of course to be fond not of suffering it but of causing it to be suffered to be suffered or if not suffered threatened and that under such management as by causing it not to be expected causes the threat not to be productive of the effect pretended to be aimed at such is the genesis of lawyercraft death begets quibbles and quibbles beget death     inflicted or not inflicted when death is threatened the quiver of lawyercraft is exhausted perfection all that is practicable in perfection is supposed to have been attained under such treatment the disease either receives positive increase or at least does not receive anything like that relief which under a more rational treatment might have been afforded in either case the mode of treatment fails but the failure is of course ascribed not to the unskilfulness of the physician but to the perversity of human nature what cannot but be admitted is that by the effect of this impunitygiving rule undue suffering has probably in some instances been prevented prevented but to what extent to the extent of that part of the field of penal law which is occupied by bad laws by laws which prohibit that which ought not to have been prohibited or command that which ought not to have been commanded but in the character of a remedy against the mischief of which such bad laws are productive observe the nature and effect of this rule applying with equal force and efficiency to all penal laws without distinction—to the worst as well as to the best it at the same time diminishes the efficiency of such as are good while it is only by accident and to an amount altogether precarious and unascertainable that it does away the mischief with which such as are bad are pregnant bring up a good fieldpiece or if that be not sufficient a fourandtwenty pounder load it with grapeshot station it at either end of any one of the bridges and at any convenient hour about the middle of the day but without letting it be known what hour fire it off as many times as may be deemed necessary and sufficient doing this you will do in furtherance of justice exactly what in manifestation of humanity and mercy is done by nullification in penali by exclusion of what is called selfaccusing evidence and by whatever other rules and principles there may be which present the like title to the appellation of impunitygiving institutions not that if that sort of humanity were in question which consists in the preservation of the innocent the service done by these institutions to humanity would be anything like so great as the service which by the fieldpiece or the fourandtwenty pounder if well served as above would be done to penal justice by the piece of ordnance the number of killed and wounded must be small indeed if among them were not found in some proportion or other individuals whom in some instance or other the penal system had had cause to place upon the list of its transgressors by the principle of nullification or the rule which excludes selfcriminative evidence not only are the guilty served but it is they alone that are served they alone and without any mixture of the innocent for when though unfortunate enough to have become the object of suspicion a man is really innocent does he fly to any of these subterfuges not he indeed if character be of any value in his eyes for by recourse to any of them what is no secret to anybody is that so sure as punishment is escaped character is sacrificed   the foxhunters reason this consists in introducing upon the carpet of legal procedure the idea of fairness in the sense in which the word is used by sportsmen the fox is to have a fair chance for his life he must have so close is the analogy what is called law—leave to run a certain length of way for the express purpose of giving him a chance for escape while under pursuit he must not be shot it would be as unfair as convicting him of burglary on a henroost in five minutes time in a court of conscience in the sporting code these laws are rational being obviously conducive to the professed end amusement is that end a certain quantity of delay is essential to it dispatch a degree of dispatch reducing the quantity of delay below the allowed minimum would be fatal to it in the case of the fox there is frequently an additional reason for fair play by foul play the source of the amusement might be exhausted the breed of that useful animal might be destroyed or reduced too low the outlawry so long ago fatal to wolves might extend itself to foxes in the mouth of the lawyer this reason were the nature of it seen to be what it is would be consistent and in character every villain let loose one term that he may bring custom the next is a sort of a bagfox nursed by the common hunt at westminster the policy so dear to sportsmen so dear to ratcatchers cannot be supposed entirely unknown to lawyers to different persons both a fox and a criminal have their use the use of a fox is to be hunted the use of a criminal is to be tried but inasmuch as in the mouth of the lawyer it would be telling tales out of school—from such lips this reason must not be let out without disguise if let out at all it must be let drop in the form of a loose hint so rough and obscure that some country gentleman or other who has a sympathy for foxes may catch it up and taking it for his own fight it up with that zeal with which genius naturally bestirs itself in support of its own inventions   confounding interrogation with torture with the application of physical suffering till some act is done in the present instance     till testimony is given to a particular effect required on this occasion it is necessary to observe that the act of putting a question to a person whose station is that of defendant in a cause is no more an act of torture than the putting the same question to him would be if instead of being a defendant he were an extraneous witness whatever he chooses to say he is at full liberty to say only under this condition properly but not essentially subjoined viz as in the case of an extraneous witness that if anything he says should be mendacious he is liable to be punished for it as an extraneous witness would be punished this condition essential in the case of an extraneous witness is not equally so in the case of a party in the cause since a party by being such stands exposed to a sort of punishment intrinsic to the cause—viz the loss of the cause as where a defendant in consideration of false responsion evasive responsion or obstinate silence is concluded to be guilty a punishment of which an extraneous witness not having any interest at stake in the cause is not on that occasion at least susceptible the curious part of the story is that the same sort of persons by whom the identity of a question and a thumbscrew is thus dreamt of or affected to be dreamt of are commonly the same persons who when torture is actually applied and applied to the worst of purposes that of foreing juries to commit a useless perjury are delighted with the operation and proclaim aloud that everything is better than well   reference to unpopular institutions whatever titius did was wrong but this is among the things that titius did therefore this is wrong such is the logic from which this sophism is deduced in the apartment in which the court called the court of starchamber sat the roof had stars in it for ornaments or else certain deeds to which jews were parties and by them called shetars or shtars used to be kept there or possibly there being no natural incompatibility both these facts were true whether it was owing to the gilt stars or to the jew parchments the judges of this court conducted themselves very badly therefore judges should not sit in a room that has had stars in the roof or in a room in which jew parchments have been kept had the conclusion been in this strain the logic would not have been very convincing but neither would the mischief have been very great in the high commission court the judges sat and tried causes in virtue of a commission and they too conducted themselves very badly therefore judges ought not to be appointed by a commision the logic though not less rational than in the preceding case begins to be rather mischievous not to be appointed by a commission how then should they have been appointed but perhaps the commission was too high a one when a judge conducts himself as he ought to do the parchment of the commission he acts under is not above three feet high when unrolled and set up on end but here it was four feet the logic wants nothing of being upon a level with what one usually sees in lawbooks but still something is yet wanting to enable it to impress conviction on a fastidious mind the inquisition meaning the true inquisition of the spanish sort that used to work with such success in the extirpation or conversion of heretics was a court in which it was the way of the judge to inquire into the business that came before him to put questions to such persons as in his conception were likely to be more or less acquainted with the matter and this whether extraneous witnesses or parties now this it is that was and is a most wicked and popish practice judges ought not to put questions be the business what it may that comes before them it ought to be the care of judges never so much as to attempt to see to the bottom of it here then we see the true source of all the odium viz not merely of that which has attached itself to this abominable court but of that which attached itself to those other abominable courts it was not by sitting in a room with stars or parchments in it it was not by acting under a commission too high in itself or that lay on too high a shelf it was not by either of these causes that the two english courts held in such just abborrence by all true englishmen were rendered so bad as they were—but by their abominable practice of asking questions by the abominable attempt to penetrate to the bottom of a cause nonlawyer but we in england—have not we had formerly without complaint and might we not have still our inquests of office have we not still our grand inquests and our coroners inquests and our courts of inquiry and our committees of inquiry and our commissions of inquiry and our commissioners of inquiry and are not they some of them at least very good things lawyer o yes but then if they inquire they do it in the way of inquest or inquiry only not in any inquisitorial way that is observe of course not to put troublesome vexatious questions such as would make a man accuse himself in short whatever the business be not to get to the bottom of it this at least is among those things which they ought not to do for no sooner do they make any such attempt than they become inquisitors popish spanish inquisitors or worse and those who had the truth     come out against them by other means would have been convicts become innocent and persecuted men victims or intended victims of persecution tyranny and so forth of the court of starchamber and the high commission court taken together for to the present purpose they are not worth distinguishing the characteristic feature is that by taking upon them to execute the will of the king alone as made known by proclamations or not as yet known so much as by proclamations they went to supersede the use of parliaments substituting an absolute monarchy to a limited one in the case of the high commission court the mischief was aggravated by the use made of this arbitrary power in forcing mens consciences on the subject of religion in the commonlaw courts these enormities could not be committed because except in a few extraordinary cases convictions having never in the practice of these courts been made to take place without the intervention of a jury and the bulk of the people being understood to be adverse to these innovations the attempt to get the official judges to carry prosecutions of the description in question into effect presented itself as hopeless in a state of things like this what could be more natural than that by a people infants as yet in reason giants in passion every distinguishable feature of a system of procedure directed to such ends should be condemned in the lump should be involved in one undistinguishing mass of edium and abhorrence more especially any particular instrument or feature from which the system was seen to operate with a particular degree of efficiency towards such abominable ends if then in the ordinary courts of law the practice with respect to the admission of this source of information was wavering or the opinion of the profession hesitating nothing could be more natural than that the observation of the enormous mass of mischief and oppression to which it was continually made subservient should turn the scale of this instrument in the hand of justice or of persons in the place of justice what was the characteristic property its sharpness but at that particular conjuncture employed as it was employed its usefulness great and pure as it would have been in other times was converted entirely into mischief its virtue was spent in the giving energy and efficiency to a system of operations bostile to the security and happiness of the body of the people in those days the supreme power of the state was de facto in the hands of the king alone for as to that of parliament it had never been anything better than a contingency and in those days it was a contingency which it was intended by those on whom it seemed to depend should never happen the improbability of its happening must in those days in the view of everybody have been extreme the kings power then was de facto absolute being employed and directed against property liberty conscience every blessing on which human nature sets a value—every chance of safety depended upon the enfeeblement of it every instrument on which the strength of that government in those days depended—every instrument which in happier times would to the people be a bond of safety was an instrument of mischief an object of terror and odium which could it have confined itself to the particular application then made of the instrument and not have extended to the instrument itself would have been no other than just and reasonable and well grounded as to the ecclesiastical tribunal called the inquisition a circumstance that seems not generally understood is that the procedure was little or nothing more than the ordinary procedure employed in the same countries in the higher classes of criminal cases bad as the practice was what there was peculiar to it belonged therefore not to the adjective system but only to the substantive laws the laws against heresy to the exccution of which it was applied besides the close imprisonment and the practice of torture     which was common to both there was indeed in the forms employed by the ecclesiastical tribunal a sort of theatrical exhibition a sort of preaching to the imagination through the medium of the eye beyond anything that in that way has ever been applied to nonecclesiastical offences but this instead of reproach and odium would if viewed in the character of a means to an end abstraction made of the end be considered as an exertion of ingenuity worthy of praise are not romish inquisitors men—do not they eat and drink is that a reason why protestants should do neither in all courts well or ill organized in which justice or what passes for it is well or ill administered must not there be a multitude of features in common the business is to distinguish the good ones from the bad and where upon the whole the result appears vicious to observe in what part of the legal system the defect lies the substantive or the adjective whether the means employed are in themselves bad or bad only in respect of the badness of the end if the ends pursued are mischievous the means employed in the pursuit of them cannot in so far as they are fit for the purpose but be likewise mischievous but upon which of the two objects in this case is the mischief to be charged not upon the means surely but upon the ends of the means nothing more can rationally be required than that they shall be such as shall not be productive of any mischief other than that which results from their subserviency to the ends if you are determined upon war take care that it be not without good cause but think not—no man that ever acted in the character of a statesman ever yet thought was ever weak enough to imagine so much as in a dream—that the strength of his army could ever take anything from the goodness of his cause the perfection of a sword is in its sharpness the sharper it is if employed against friends the more mischief it would do would this be a reason for discarding the use of sharp swords and using none but what had been blunted no the dictate of reason is—let your sword be sharp the sharper the better but take care not to wound a friend with it in the hands of an assassin as in the hands of a constable an oaken staff will give a harder blow than a deal one but on that account would it be reasonable to say that bulk for bulk and shape for shape an oaken staff was a worse weapon than a deal one what cannot be denied is that if it were possible to keep all oaken staves out of the hands of malefactors of every description putting deal ones in their room and giving to constables the exclusive use of oaken staves the effect would be a desirable one pursuing the allusion—to give the benefit of the admission of selfconvicting evidence to him whose aim it is to give execution to bad laws would be it may be said to take the deal staff out of the hand of the malefactor and add to his power of doing mischief by the substitution of the oaken one but there would be the greatest possible incongruity in saying such and such laws shall not have the benefit of selfconvicting evidence such and such others shall the laws to which this benefit is denied are they good laws then why put it out of your power to execute them are they bad laws then why are they suffered to subsist seeing the two descriptions of persons whose interest is served by the exclusion put upon this species of evidence viz evildoers of all sorts and under the technical system lawyers of all sorts in the character of their natural accomplices partners and abettors—we see the two descriptions of persons in whom the exclusionary rule beholds its natural and indefatigable adherents advocates and supporters but in the fraternity of lawyers we behold the only persons who are in the habit of speaking—the only persons who if their words are to be taken for it ever are or can be sufficiently well qualified to speak in the character of censors in the way of approbation or disapprobation of any existing rule of law the persons of whom speaking of the matter of fact it must be confessed how much reason soever there is for wishing that it were otherwise that it is of their voices that on this subject the public voice is composed here then considering the propriety of the rule as a question to be tried at the bar of the public here is a question to be tried and to be tried and decided upon scientific evidence and the persons of whose testimony this body of evidence is composed are all of them persons who considered in the character of witnesses speak under the bias of a sinister interest these selfhired witnesses speaking thus by thousands all of them in the same strain—and amongst them so many each of whom is in possession and in the continual exercise of the faculty of giving that sort of official judicial testimony which has been rendered absolutely conclusive no testimony on the other side being suffered to be delivered—can it be matter of wonder if the judgment of the unblassed part of the public should by such a torrent be overborne and misled again—can it be matter of wonder if a nonlawyer making in the character of an occasional speculator an accidental excursion upon this ground—upon ground lying thus within the acknowledged demesne of lawyers—should join without reflection in the     cry recognising as is so natural in the unanimous suffrage of such a multitude of counsellors the voice of truth as well as the means of safety and thus it is that in this as well as so many other parts of the filed of jurisprudence the public voice is composed the principal parts by a set of hired performers the chorus by a band of dupes in the character of amateurs §   history of the rule excluding selfcriminative evidence the authorities on this subject present as usual darkness visible but where the subject presents nothing better even to see that everything is dark is more satisfactory than not to see the earliest dicta which the industry of viner could discover are of no earlier a date than the thirtysecond of elizabeth here we behold and for the first time the maxim which with its variantes has since become so famous nemo tenetur scipsum prodere in later times accusare it presents itself in two almost contiguous cases the first according to the date given to it is in the thirtysecond year of elizabeth in the common pleas the report by leonard the other in the thirtysecond and thirtythird year of the same reign in michaelmas term in the kings bench two reporters here cooke afterwards judge and serjeant moore in both cases it was an impertinence in both cases the assertion conveyed by it was a notorious falsity in the only case in which a decision appears to have been given for in the earliest the common pleas case time was taken for decision and none reported the decision could not have turned upon the rule in both cases the shape in which the cause came before the court was that of a motion for a writ of prohibition to be directed to the ecclesiastical court on the ground of prætergression of jurisdiction in both cases the alleged prætergression consisted in sustaining a suit for incontinence proceeding therein by an endeavour to examine the defendant upon his oath in the court in which a decision was pronounced the prohibition was granted but in that case the decision had no need of any such or any other general maxim true or false in any other sorts of causes than the two particularly specified viz matrimonial and testamentary administering an oath to the defendant was a practice expressly interdicted to that court by two writs that are still to be found in the registrum brevium the book of the highest authority of any that compose the library of jurisprudential law yet in neither case is any intimation given of any reference made by either court or counsel to this most irrecusable of all authorities neither in the case in which it was conformed to and the prohibition issued accordingly nor in the prior case in which nothing was done in this prior case the reporter leonard gives indeed a reference but apparently as from himself and then not to that authoritative repository of judicial documents but to fitzherberts commentary on it being probably as yet without a precedent the application that had been made to the inferior court the court of common pleas in the case above referred to had produced nothing but doubts the application thus made to the superior court the court graced in intendment of law by the presence of the king himself—its subordinate having no presence higher than that of the king without any such adjunct to boast of—had a more successful issue heartened up by the authority and the latin of her majestys attorneygeneral the great sir edward coke they pronounced boldly that no such proditio should take place leaving out of the question technical and supernatural causes and looking out for natural psychological ones two present themselves as competent one or both of them to the production of this effect one was jealousy of the power of these spiritual rivals—another a sort of personal and prudential apprehension of the lengths to which such impertinent curiosity if unchecked might extend itself on ground of such pecular delicacy i in their anxiety to obtain custom and to make the most of it when obtained the courts of common law had concurred in the manner above explained in giving encouragement to mendacity by exempting from the obligation of an oath and thence from the punishments religious moral and at length political attached to the breach of it the testimony of parties for or against themselves equity spying in this deficiency an inlet opened to successful rivality had taken upon herself to withdraw this licence from the defendants side of the cause thereby giving to the plaintiff the till then unexperienced advantage of the defendants selfdisserving testimony the jurisdiction of equity had not however ventured to extend itself beyond the civil class of causes nor in that to the whole extent of the field of jurisdiction the advantage thus possessed by equity one of the branches of english romebred judicature had all along been possessed by another branch the ecclesiastical but from some uncertain though at any rate early period a resolution had been taken by the commonlaw courts that the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts so far at least as it was to be enforced by the examination of parties     upon oath should not extend to any other causes than such as came under the denomination of testamentary and matrimonial causes in the registrum brevium a writ accordingly is to be found in which the limitation thus put to the jurisdiction of these courts is assumed moreover fitzherbert in his commentary on the registrum brevium takes notice of this same limitation and these same terms† not that the limitation has been adhered to in practice for to this hour the jurisdiction of those courts together with the power included in it of taking such examinations as above has a much wider range ever since an early period of the reign of henry vii a court had existed long known by the name of the court of starchamber a court of criminal jurisdiction and that to a vast extent in which the power of examining the defendant upon oath had all along been exercised‡ during the whole of the reign towards the close of which the oracle was delivered this court had been a busy one in every one of the several reports it is delivered in the form of a general or universal proposition no exception or intimation of any exception being annexed to it taking it thus as it stands it was in respect of verity exactly upon the footing of a proposition denying that the sun ever shone at noonday at that time of day the court of starchamber though since abolished rested upon as firm a foundation as any other of the courts the decisions pronounced were as uncontested law as those of any other court in that character they are reported by all the reporters indiscriminately with those of the several other courts being under the tyrannical and extortions reign of henry vii instituted to serve as a new and more powerful instrument of the crown unclogged by juries it was all along an especial favourite against the power of such a court a power the exercise of which was every days practice it may be imagined of what use or avail could be this or any other proposition though couched in ever such good latin denying the existence of it the oracle is of the rhetorical cast which is as much as to say in the natural style of oracles and having as it was probably designed to have any one of half a dozen meanings whichever happens to be most convement to the purpose it is in proportion guarded against the misfortune of seeing its truth disproved but if the import of it be that no question shall be put to a man the answer of which if true may tend to his conviction the truth of it stands further disproved by the then and still existing every days practice of another sort of court i speak of the court established by the statute of philip and mary∥ the court consisting of a single justice or any number of justices of the peace for the purpose of taking the preparatory examination of the defendant and others antecedently to the trial by jury in the case of felonies at the institution of this preparatory judicature the starchamber with its practice of examining the defendant being in full vigour and no restrictive direction given what could be the intention of the legislature but that the mode of examination pursued every day in the starchamber not to speak of the nurserychamber and every other room in which common sense was listened to should be pursued the examination of the supposed felon was to be taken but to what end take his examination or the examination of any other person but to find out the truth—meaning of course the whole truth the evidence you shall give shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth such is the direction given probably at that time certainly at the present time to every sort of person when examined in the character of a witness what reason for supposing it so much as possible that in the reign of philip and mary when in imitation of the course which the retainers of the spanish monarch had seen pursued all over europe direction was given for extracting the testimony of the defendant any wish so silly should have been entertained as that so much of the truth as should tend to his conviction—that is to the only direct end and object of the suit—should be left out of it   0 oh but says somebody the practice actually is under this act to be cautions of extracting from the defendant any testimony the tendency of which may be to his prejudice and even lest any such testimony should escape him unawares to give him warning to keep his lips well closed i can very easily believe it viz so often as and no oftener than in the eyes of the examining justice the general praise of humanity and the popularity to be gained by it is of more value to him than the advantage public and personal attending the discovery of the truth in that individual instance but the question at present is not what is the practice of modern times but what was the practice of those early times viz in the reign in which this effusion of learned rhetoric is first known to have made its appearance to understand this if it be worth understanding turn to the state trials turn to the case of udall the puritan minister prosecuted and teased to death in the style of the spanish inquisition in those days of supposed english liberty observe there eight personages and among them two peers and great officers of state a bishop a chief justice of the kings bench or common pleas the chief justice taking the lead between three and four monthbefore the emanation of this writ all pressing him urging him by threats and promises to take an oath for the purpose of having his testimony extracted from him he saying that he had already been punished upon such testimony and that he might not fall into the same scrape again deciming to take the oath the guilt imputed consisted in the writing and publishing of a book in which the truth of his religious persuasion was maintained assuming this to be guilt his guiltiness is out of all dispute in the relation we have of the proceedings for it is his relation he avows it what evidence more satisfactory could have been given of it than his inability to deny it with any prospect of success here then was no injustice of what injustice there was and sure enough there was no want of injustice the seat was in the substantive branch of the law it consisted in the converting into a capital crime the act of him who makes known to use the words of scripture the reason of the faith that is in him thus then is it with this famous aphorism at the time when first delivered it was sent out in diametrical opposition to notorious truth but having once found its way into the books there it lay in petto in a dormant state ready under a favourable set of existing circumstances like a fly bottled up in spirits to be revived at any time when first brought out to view we have seen it in the condition of the stone which the builders rejected we see it now triumphant in the state of the headstone of the corner at the time when brought out to what purpose was it brought out to the purpose of displaying the rhetoric and the latinity of the phœnix of the law to the purpose of the cause it was altogether useless the object of the application was to quash the proceedings of the ecclesiastical court on the ground of excess of jurisdiction to prove the excess nothing more was necessary than a reference to the lawyers gospel the register of writs what could have occasioned the time taken for advisation is beyond conjecture but though in the unlimited latitude given to it the maxim was widely and notoriously untrue—yet from that bad authority and the good but unnoticed authority the writs in the register taken together there seems reason enough to conclude that at common law on all trials in which juries bore a share the practice of administering an oath to the defendant and therefore putting questions to him and particularly in criminal causes had never been in use for in both the writs the stress of the censure is laid on the administration of the oath and in the latter it is expressly stated as being contrary to the custom of the nation if then the application of it had been confined to that part of the law designated on some occasions by the name of the common law—viz the practice of the commonlaw courts—the truth of the maxim appears indubitable at least so far as concerns the nonadministration of an oath to the defendant in cases deemed to belong to the class of criminal cases and subjected to the cognizance of a jury but in the maxim nothing is said about the oath it goes further and in as far as any determinate signification can be put upon it it puts an equally decided negative upon the practice of putting particular questions to the defendant with or without the oath but on this head we are left altogether to seek for evidence because no oath was administered to the defendant it follows not by any means that no particular questions were put to the defendant in capital cases to the witnesses called by the defendant no oath was administered till more than a century after† yet witnesses for the defendant     and those too speaking in answer to particular questions could not but have been heard in those dark times in which moral conduct was so much worse and terror derived from supernatural sources so much stronger and more prevalent than at present the ceremony of an oath appears to have been a tremendous bugbear so tremendous that by this consideration concurring with others a doubt presents itself whether originally an oath used to be administered at all to witnesses in any causes civil or criminal on the plaintiffs any more than on the defendants side in the treatise penned by chief justice britton under edward i and upon the face of it purporting to constitute a code of law sanctioned by that kings authority much is said of perjury but the crime there spoken of is throughout the crime of the judge or other official person nowhere the crime of the witness subsequently to the statute of the fifth of elizabeth the first statute by which punishment was annexed to testimonial perjury cases relative to perjury occur in plenty in the books antecedently to that point of time i cannot find one investigating a point of this sort is groping in thick darkness books of reports confined in their subjectmatter to transactions at trials before a jury are but of yesterday in no instance in any of the report books containing the accounts of legal transactions of a date prior to the above is any account of any such trial to be found add nor in relation to any of the points here in question of any transaction carried on in the course of any such trial of an account of the proceedings in any trial before a jury of a date prior to that here in question the only example extant is of the date of      about nine years prior to the date of this statute it is the trial of sir nicholas throckmorton for treason in the first year of queen mary for treason supposed to be committed by participation in the insurrection for which sir thomas wyat had suffered death it is reported from hollinsheds chronicle and the discourses as reported wearing the same dramatic form as on a modern trial the words appear upon the face of them to have been taken down as if in short hand from the mouths of the interlocutors besides a variety of interesting particulars having no immediate relation to the present subject it affords very material information in relation to two points that have here been brought to view   in the first place not only is the defendant heard in his own defence at his own instance but questions upon questions are put to him without reserve in the same manner as if to any extraneous witness questions having as plainly for their object the extracting answers of a nature to criminate him and lead to his conviction as any questions which a man aiming professedly at that object could devise answer given directly and in detail not a question objected to no complaint of the illegality or so much as the hardship of the practice   in the next place what bears directly upon the point here in question it affords no slight reason for suspecting that at this time in capital cases at least the practice of administering an oath to a witness for the prosecution was either a novel proceeding or a ceremony the performance of which was optional on the part of the judge a written confession made by cuthbert vaughan—a man already convicted of the same treasonable conspiracy as that of which the defendant throckmorton stood indicted vaughan still living and producible—had been read in the first instance a proceeding alike repugnant to the manifest principles of reason and justice and to the present practice then ensues the following dialogue attorneygeneral why will you deny this matter     you shall have vaughan to justifie this here before you all and confirm it with a booke oth throckmorton he that hath said and lyed will not being in this case stick to sweare and lye then was cuthbert vaughan brought into the open court sandal or sandell clerk of the crown how say you cuthbert vaughan is this your own confession and will you abide by all that is here written vaughan let me see it and i will tell you then his confession was showed him attorney bycause you of the jury the better may credite him i pray you my lords let vaughan be sworne then was vaughan sworne on a booke to say nothing but the truth†     written confessions and hearsay evidence produced of the supposed testimony of other persons producible and yet not produced exclusion put and without the shadow of a pretence upon the testimony of a person then present and whose testimony had been called for by the defendant acquitting him the jury were prosecuted for it in the chamber and punished by ruinous fines execrably flagitious in these and other respects the proceedings were not the less legal if the station of judge does not give legality to the proceedings of him who acts in it how can any proceedings be legal—here we have the chief justice of the kings bench another judge of the same court a judge of the common pleas a master of the rolls and a master of the court of wards and liveries all learned in the law sense besides a couple of peers and as many privy counsellors the lord mayor of london and a knight all sitting at guildhall as commissioners illegal oh yes if irreconcilable to an antecedent series of uninterrupted practice but in this instance there is not a single case to which it can be opposed it is the only one we have no practice could come in worse company than the practice of putting adverse questions to a party to a defendant—and in a criminal a capital case did in that instance if however the practice be itself subservient to the ends of justice the having been resorted to in company with others of an opposite tendency is a circumstance which how natural a cause soever for reprobation can never be a just one where no oath has been taken false and mendacious testimony there may be in any quantity but perjury there cannot be the causes have been seen by which a suspicion at least is induced that the practice of administering oaths to witnesses and consequently the possibility of committing testimonial perjury was at the time of passing the earliest of the statutes relative to this offence of no very ancient date if so it could not be true that perjury in a witness was punishable to use the words of lord coke by the common law† true it is that in that same passage he gives us the history of a case a starchamber case tenth of james i ad      in which it was resolved that perjury in a witness was punishable at commonlaw but the very fact that a resolution to that effect was at that time necessary to be passed serves i must confess to strengthen the suspicion suggested by the former considerations that it was not true if antecedently to the statute the punishment of perjury had elsewhere at least than in the starchamber ever been exemplified the occasions would have been too frequent to leave the matter involved in any such doubt as it could require an express resolution to remove to what purpose then be at the pains of resolving that perjury was punishable at common law fifty years after the passing of the statute that had been made to punish it—the answer is—because as we learn from lord coke in the same place upon taking measure of the statute about fourteen years before it had been found too narrow‡ among the various devices in use with english judges for stealing legislative power     this may be mentioned as one when a statute which as far as it goes is to their liking is found not large enough or has been unmade by the authority that made it they fill up the deficiency with an imaginary mass of commonlaw commonlaw a creation of then own imagination forms thus a sort of plenum upon which as often as a vacuity is to be filled up they draw at pleasure §   of selfonerative selfdisgracing and selfdiscrediting evidence i selfonerative evidence the distinction between selfcriminative testimony and selfonerative is here employed for the purpose of its corresponding to a distinction to which in the technical system of procedure so many important consequences have been attached i mean the distinction between criminal cases and civil cases it is on this occasion that selfcriminative evidence calls for a distinction of no small practical importance—  testimony selfcriminative to the effect of ultrapecuniary punishment and   testimony selfcriminative to the effect of punishment not more than equivalent to pecuniary—a distinction which seems sufficiently explained by the terms in which it is here expressed unless it be where and in so far as the testimony comes under the appellation of selfdisgracing or selfdiscrediting—selfcriminative evidence when in its penal effects limited to punishment not ultrapecuniary will it is evident to that or any other purpose stand on no other footing than testimony simply selfonerative to the extent therefore of that part of the scale the two species selfcriminative and selfonerative coincide if on the score of any injury or other transgression the delinquent is adjudged to pay in each of two cases a determinate sum say £ 0 his unwillingness to subject himself to that obligation will not be less in the case where the money when taken out of his pocket is put into the pocket of his personal adversary the party injured than in the case where it is put into the pocket of another party with whom he has no quarrel as for example the sovereign whether for his own benefit or for the benefit of the community at large on the contrary if there be a difference it is in the case where the amount of the quantity of the matter of wealth lost to himself is so disposed of as to add to the enjoyment of his adversary—it is in that case that his unwillingness to deliver the testimony which is to be productive of this effect will naturally rise to the highest pitch if—in the case where the effect of the conviction if brought upon himself by his testimony would be to subject him to the payment of the £ 0 to the use of a person unobnoxious to him—his testimony even on the score of the unwillingness and vexation supposed to be attached to the delivery of it were to stand excluded while in the case where the effect of it would be to subject him to the payment of an equal sum to the use of a person more or less odious to him his testimony notwithstanding the at least equal unwillingness and vexation that might well be supposed to be attached to the delivery of it were not to stand excluded flagrant surely would be the inconsistency with which in the judgment of every mind not prepossessed and perverted by technical ideas an arrangement to such an effect would appear chargeable give now to the first of the two cases the appellation of a criminal case—to the other the appellation of a civil case will the real inconsistency thus seen to exist between the two arrangements of law be at all diminished by these two words among the different modifications of selfprejudicing evidence above distinguished the case in which the pretence for the exclusionary rule is most plausible is evidently the case where the testimony is selfcriminative to the effect of ultrapecuniary punishment—where the punishment to which by the testimony in question a man exposes himself rises to a degree of afflictiveness above the utmost to which pecuniary punishment in the highest degree in which a man can be made susceptible of it is regarded as equivalent but even in this case it has been shown that by the vexation be it what it may attacked to the production of the effect by means of evidence of this particular description in contradistinction to other evidence at large i e to extraneous evidence no sufficient or proper ground for the exclusion of the evidence can ever in any instance be constituted a fortiori then neither can it in the case where in respect of the prejudicial effect of it to the deponent the evidence is simply selfonerative or no more than equivalent to selfonerative   selfdisgracing evidence on the subject of selfdisgracing evidence a distinction must again be noted if in the case where the evidence is selfcriminative exposing the deponent to punishment i e to suffering on account of some transgression of the law of the state or of the received rules of morality the effect of the punishment whether in respect of the transgression to which it is attached or in itself is to subject a man to disgrace—a question may be started whether the effect of such disgrace be or be not to raise the punishment above the level of the most onerous pecuniary obligation but for the practical purpose of determining whether the evidence in question ought or ought not on this account to be excluded the inquiry would be purely speculative and useless it being already understood     that by no degree of magnitude on the part of the punishment can a sufficient ground be formed for the exclusion of selfcriminative evidence howsoever modified a use that has been made of the appellative selfdisgracing is this where the offence to which the punishment is attached is of a disgraceful nature—by whatever testimony a man exposes himself to suffer as for that offence he exposes himself of course to the disgrace attached to it thus far then selfdisgracing testimony coincides with and is included under selfcriminative but suppose the punishment already inflicted here we see a case in which in the course of a mans testimony the fact of his having suffered this punishment and thence of his having committed this transgression may be brought to view here then his testimony though it cannot to the effect of its being considered as exposing him to suffer punishment of a disgraceful or any other nature be ranked with propriety under the head of selfcriminative testimony may with not the less propriety be termed selfdisgracing to distinguish it from the case where by the same means to which a mans testimony exposes him to disgrace it exposes him to punishment in other shapes—it may be termed simply selfdisgracing if by testimony which besides being selfdisgracing is selfcriminative no proper ground for exclusion can be constituted—much less can any such ground be constituted by testimony which is selfdisgracing simply selfdisgracing without being selfcriminative not so however says english law† a man is produced as a witness on either side on a former occasion he had been convicted of an offence of which if ascertained the effect would be to diminish his credibility—to weaken the force of the persuasion of which his testimony might otherwise be productive shall the question be put to him whether it be true that on the occasion mentioned the conviction in question took place no says a rule of english law no why not because this is making a man disgrace himself—making a man expose himself to shame and why not make him expose himself to shame if he has done what by the supposition he has done—that to which the opinion of mankind following in this respect the finger of the law has annexed disgrace—properly and deservedly annexed it oh says the prejudice because a selfdisgracing or call it a selfdegrading answer is a sort of selfaccusing selfconvicting answer if it be not exactly the same thing it is analogous to it—it is like it which is enough for us still the same delusion still the same shortsightedness still the same inconsistency and selfcontradiction the witness has been convicted say of perjury if his disgrace be offered to be proved by other evidence—by such evidence as the law chooses to receive say by the record of his conviction—if this be the case it is all well the evidence cannot be disallowed it is not to the act of disgracing him that the prejudice opposes itself it is only to the channel through which the disgrace is conveyed disgraced he may be disgrace him you may and welcome—only he must not be disgraced out of his own mouth in this case as in the case of selfconvicting evidence if so it happens that he has disgraced himself in this same way at some other time—if any other person affirms that in his hearing he has acknowledged the having undergone any such conviction or the penal consequences of it—evidence of this loose extrajudicial confession may be produced and exhibited to his face it is not that the fact is not to be proved but it is not to be proved any otherwise than in a bad way it is not to be proved by immediate evidence—it is only to be proved by unoriginal by hearsay evidence it is not to be proved by testimony the whole of which is covered by the sanction of an oath—it is only to be proved by evidence of which the half only is covered by the sanction of an oath to what end seek to exempt a man from this accidental shame it is a suffering that arises out of his delinquency—and in the nature of the case will bear a proportion as exact a one as can usually be obtained to the degree of his delinquency by the example it affords it will render itself subservient to the main end and purpose of punishment—the deterring others in trials in general publicity is a circumstance not deprecated but aimed at and generally approved beneficial as it is recognised to be on all other occasions what should render it     otherwise than beneficial on this the evil then is no other than a part though an accidental part of the evil of punishment—that evil which by the supposition necessarily involved in the institution of the penal law is outweighed by a greater good the publicity of punishment is one of the constant and applauded aims of the law upon all occasions it is only by that part of it which is public and known that the punishment does any good so much of it as is unknown is so much pure evil so much misery in waste the publicity of its punishments is one of the constant aims of the law on all occasions on the particular occasion in question it is attended with a particular use over and above every use with which in general it is attended to what end with what sort of consistency seek on this occasion to cover that shame which on all other occasions it is the object of the law to uncover to what end seek to cover it now—now when the uncovering of it is demanded for a particular useful purpose the inconvenience of the rejection is this either you cannot prove the fact at all—or if you do prove it you prove it by evidence the production of which is attended with an additional and useless expense the witness in question is by the supposition on the spot get the evidence from him you get it without any additional expense or vexation in any other shape if it is not from him that you get it and yet you get it notwithstanding the evidence you get of it is a record a great mass of parchment which or a copy of it is to be lugged into court at i know not what expense to avoid loading this guilty person with an ideal suffering you impose a real suffering upon some innocent one better for the party perhaps to let the suspected evidence go for unsuspected than to purchase the faculty of throwing the suspicion on it at so heavy an expense this is not all perhaps the record is not producible there is no time for it the stain upon the character of the witness does not come to the knowledge of the party till a few days before the day appointed for the trial the trial cannot be put off for this purpose or not without a disproportionate expense and the interval between the day of the discovery and the day appointed for the trial affords not time sufficient for the production of the necessary parchment two errors are here combined—two opposite excesses when the fact of the conviction is suffered to appear the witness is rejected absolutely when the truth is thus prevented from coming to light the tainted testimony is palmed upon the jury for sound what says reason all this while that in this case as in all others the testimony should be suffered to make its way to the ears of those to whom it belongs to judge but not without the cause of suspicion stamped upon it that they should be free to hear it and free when they have heard it to bestow upon it such credence as shall appear to them to be due to it but cases are not without example in which although no punishment at all be attached to the act or none the application of which could with propriety be trusted to a promiscuous hand disgrace is nevertheless attached to it take for example fornication especially on the part of a female never married and of character otherwise unspotted take again adultery especially on the part of the wife whose infidelity but for the testimony in question might have remained unsuspected and the peace of the husband undisturbed in a case of this sort no good being attached to the disclosure but so much pure evil—the vexation abstraction made of the demand produced for the testimony by the cause for the purpose of which it is proposed to be called for would be not barely preponderant but pure without anything in the opposite scale to weigh against it shall it then be exacted or excluded the answer depends upon the principle already laid down in a former place exacted if the mischief from misdecision for want of the evidence would be preponderant over the mischief consisting of the vexation produced by the disclosure excluded if the preponderance be on the other side exact it if for example but for the benefit of this evidence the defendant the prosecution being capital and he innocent will over and above the disgrace attendant on conviction be unjustly put to death exclude it if the question be no more than whether the defendant be liable to pay a penalty or an alleged debt to the amount of a few shillings in the two opposite cases here exemplified the propriety of admission in the one case of exclusion in the other will scarcely raise a doubt between these two extremes to draw a line of demarcation will be as already observed a task to a certain degree for the legislator and where his means of discrimination terminate for the judge   selfdiscrediting evidence the range of selfdiscrediting testimony is yet more narrow the term may serve to signify selfdisgracing testimony of any kind so far as it is considered as productive of this particular effect far from constituting of itself a proper ground of exclusion on the score of vexation it is not in the nature of it to contribute anything to the formation of any such ground on that score vexation—all the vexation which it is in the nature of such testimony to be     productive of in the breast of the deponent consists in the disgrace as to his testimonys being believed or not believed it being by himself that whatever evil consequences may result from it are to be borne if it were not in any part of it to be believed—if in respect of its effect it were in so complete a degree selfdiscrediting—his vexation would be but so much the less but such as every one sees and as we have seen already is not the effect of acknowledged untrustworthiness on the part of the deponent where it is on his own shoulders that the burthen of the decision falls on the contrary the more untrustworthy he appears as to other points the surer everybody is that whatever part of his evidence is understood by him to operate to his own prejudice is true §   case of evidence selfdisserving aliâ in causâ considered it may happen that the cause by means of which the deponent exposes himself to the mischief attached to the selfprejudicing evidence is not the cause in hand but another cause viz a cause already in prospect or a cause liable to be produced by the disclosure made by the evidence in respect of the quantum of vexation the variation here in question will make no difference but compared with the opposite case with the case in which the mischief consists in an unfavourable termination of the suit actually in hand the reasons in favour of admission the reasons against the exclusionary rule operate in this case with redoubled force against the evil of the selfregarding vexation produced by the selfdisserving testimony of a party there is no other good to be set than the advantage attendant on a right decision instead of misdecision or failure of justice in that one cause but in the case where the proposed deponent is an extraneous witness—in addition to that same lot of advantage in so far as the testimony is in this respect efficacious there comes the advantage attendant on a right decision instead of misdecision or failure of justice in another cause to wit the additional cause to which it is the tendency of such disclosure to give birth prosecution for robbery john stiles examined in relation to it in the character of an extraneous witness a question is put the effect of which were he to answer it might be to subject him to conviction in respect of another robbery attended with murder in which he bore a share on the ground of public utility and common sense is there any reason why the collateral advantage thus proffered by fortune to justice should be foregone refusing to compass the execution of justice by this means by what fairer or better means can you ever hope to compass it the punishment he will incur if any will be a distinct punishment for a distinct offence an offence which at the institution of the suit was perhaps never thought of be it so and should this happen where will be the mischief wherein consists the grievance that a crime which but for the accident might perhaps have remained unpunished comes by means of this accident to be punished of the penal law in question nothing being known but that it is a penal law is it thereby known to be a bad one and to such a degree a bad one that the execution of it is a grievance is the state of the law then such that a law taken at random is more likely to be a bad one than a good one a nuisance than a security or is a law the less likely to be good the more likely to be bad because it is by this accident rather than any other that the transgression of it happens to be brought to light this increase of reason this reduplication of advantage extends itself it is evident with proportionable force from the top to the bottom of the scale of good on one hand of evil on the other attached to selfprejudicing to selfdisserving evidence to all degrees of selfcriminative—to all degrees of selfonerative to all suits called criminal—to all suits called civil but what shall we say if by a summons to appear as a witness in a cause penal or nonpenal between other persons an individual is purposely entrapped and being in obedience to that summons actually in court is interrogated concerning a distinct offence supposed to have been committed by himself and in consequence of his answers stopped and consigned to durance what why—that so a delinquent be but brought into the hands of justice just as well may it be by this means as by any other truth is not violated—fiction is not employed no false tale is told—no falsehood here defiles the lips of justice nor though possible is the case likely to be frequent the question must be relevant pertinent to the cause actually in hand or an answer will not be for it ought not to be allowed to be given the suit not as yet in hand may possibly have been the principal object in view in the summons but what if it be if instead of being in this way stopped when appearing to give evidence in another suit the witness had been arrested in consequence of a direct charge made upon him on the ground of such his offence—in what respect would his guilt have been increased or his suffering in respect of it diminished even now it occasionally happens that a person summoned to appear as a witness in     a cause to which he is not a party appears accordingly and being deemed guilty of perjury is committed but even under the supposition that the admission of indirectly elicited selfconvicting evidence were as such improper still if the admission of directly elicited selfconvicting evidence be proper no distinct mischief can be chargeable to the account of selfconvicting evidence when indirectly elicited why because admitting the propriety and consequent existence of the practice of admitting selfconvicting evidence a regulation excluding the faculty of extracting selfconvicting evidence incidentally would not operate as a bar to the supposed mischief since the evidence in question if not extracted out of the cause in which it happens incidentally to present itself might always be obtained viz by a distinct suit instituted on purpose and with the same mischief and suffering to the party prejudiced—viz the delinquent though not with the same convenience in respect of dispatch and in respect of the throwing those fuller and ulterior lights that might thus be thrown upon the offence first pursued by other offences that happen to be connected with it in a word supposing direct evidence of this kind to be admitted—then if you exclude incidental whatever effects may be apprehended from it of a kind which are with or without reason regarded as inconvenient will still be produced but with additional inconvenience an effect for example which certainly might by design and contrivance be brought into existence by incidental selfconvicting evidence is that of instituting a sort of feigned suit penal or nonpenal for the purpose of bringing to light not the facts belonging properly and directly to the avowed cause of action but others of a complexion differing to any degree of remoteness suppose for example a project formed for bringing down disgrace and punishment on the head of an individual by means of questions to be put to him in the character either of a defendant or a witness in a cause to be instituted on purpose drawing thus out of his mouth the confession of some crime or disgraceful act for which he has not been prosecuted may not this be done yes but not with any advantage to the party whose invention is supposed to be thus employed nor with any disadvantage to the party against whom it is supposed to be employed why because in this there is nothing more than what might be done in a direct and ordinary way by a suit instituted on purpose in every point of view then in which it can be considered the practice in question appears to stand clear of objection in the first place because the result supposed to be produced cannot with any propriety or consistency be reckoned in the number of undesirable results in the next place because though it were no ulterior facility is afforded for the production of this supposed undesirable result no new or ulterior facility is afforded beyond what would exist without it under the systems of procedure derived from the roman law and in particular under that formerly pursued in france selfconvicting evidence being allowed to be extracted in the direct way so is it in the incidental and occasional way above described the result is in the highest degree favourable to the interests of justice at a very early period of my studies accident having conducted me to the collection of remarkable trials known by the name of the causes célèbres comparing what i there observed with such observations as it had fallen in my way to make in relation to trials and especially in criminal causes conducted in the english mode one very striking point of diversity caught my eye in the english mode when any plan of deep and extensive artifice and villainy presented itself it was only into here and there a corner of it that the light of discovery appeared to have been thrown a multitude of circumstances remained still involved in darkness a multitude of particulars still remained in respect of which the mind of the inquirer remained unsatisfied he who should propose to himself to draw up a complete history of the criminal transaction would find materials continually wanting—would in a word find the task impracticable why because out of a multitude of delinquencies committed the inquiry was by the narrowness of the path chalked out for the course of procedure confined to one because by this or that arbitrary and irrational rule a seal was put upon the lips of those who knew most about the matter in the french mode on the other hand every transaction appeared to be sifted to the bottom no doubt remained all the actors—all the sufferers—were brought upon the stage proximate causes remote causes concomitant circumstances and consequences all stood before the reader at a view in the same proportion in which the faculty and practice of reaping the collateral advantage now and then presented by the selfdisserving testimony of an extraneous witness is beneficial to the interests of society it is prejudicial to the opposite and adverse interest—the interest of the professional lawyer under every system—the interest of the official as well as of the professional lawyer under the feegathering system it defrauds him that is if admitted which he has taken care it shall not be—it would defraud him and in a double way of his due in the suit already in hand it defrauds him     of the several advantages already enumerated under the head of the uses of the exclusionary rule to the man of law by means of the effect with which it may be and when the testimony thus obtained is sufficient to warrant the decision it points to ought to be attended it defrauds him of the whole of the profit that might have been extracted from the additional suit had it commenced and been continued in the regular and ordinary course it produces to the community at large the benefit of two suits with the delay vexation and expense and consequently with the lawyers profit of no more than one this being the case it may without difficulty be imagined how sincere an abhorrence the idea of a practice thus informal and irregular excites in their inflexible and learned breasts with what heroic firmness they adhere on this doubly important ground to the exclusionary rule with how tender a sympathy they contemplate as if it were their own the peril of the malefactor or other evildoer—in whatever degree and on whichever side of the cause their customer their partner their best friend chapter iv inconsistencies of english law in regard to selfdisserving evidence this rule this exclusionary rule which grounds itself on the evil of vexation would not be a rule of jurisprudential law more particularly of english jurisprudential law if it had not its exceptions and these exceptions no intimation being given of them in the rule forming so many contradictions and the reasons of them not being good but on the supposition that there are no reasons or none but bad ones for the rule forming so many inconsistencies in a former place there was occasion to mention in the character of so many uses to justice attending the admission of selfprejudicing testimony that is of questions leading to the extraction of it that thereby the receipt of two other species of evidence from the same source—evidences equal at least in vexation inferior in instructiveness safety and trustworthiness—would in general be saved these were—  papers such as letters or memorandums containing a discourse supposed to be that of the party and   the supposed extrajudicial conversation supposed to be held by the party on any occasion not being a judicial one and reported by another person in the character of a judicial witness useful in case of necessity for the purpose of strengthening or weakening the opinion of the trustworthiness of the immediate evidence from the same source—useful though less safe in the character of succedanea to it when it is not to be had—who does not see how bad a substitute these unsanctioned and uncrossexaminable evidences make for the mass of immediate testimony from the same source when it is to be had and under the same securities for its correctness and completeness viz oath or what is equivalent and counterinterrogation as in the case of an extraneous witness these secondary and inferior species of evidence are accordingly admitted but upon what terms upon the terms of their not receiving the confirmation infirmation explanation or completion that could have been applied to them by the immediate evidence from the same original source upon condition of their being freed from that check—of the judges refusing to himself the benefit of that security against deception and misdecision and no otherwise   first contradiction to the exclusionary rule—admission of the supposed casually and extrajudicially written discourse of the person excluded to whom for fear of vexing him he standing or not standing there no questions are permitted to be put   second contradiction to the exclusionary rule—admission of hearsay evidence purporting to contain the casually and extrajudicially spoken discourse of the person to whom for fear of vexing him he standing or not standing there no questions are permitted to be put of the vexation for the avoidance of which such sacrifices have been made—sacrifices not to but of the interests of truth and justice—an estimate may now be made it is the difference between that which a man feels when the testimony in consequence of which he sees himself exposed to suffer whatever it be issues on the occasion in hand immediately out of his own lips or from his own pen—and that which he feels when—testimony to the same effect exposing him to the same suffering neither more nor less having happened on some preceding occasion to escape from his own lips or his own pen—he hears or sees it brought out against him on the occasion in hand from the lips or the pen of some other person—the difference between what he feels at hearing brought out against him information which dropped from him at a time when he was off his guard and knew not the use that would be made of it—and that which he feels at the yielding the same information at a time when he is completely upon his guard now then what is the real value of the mischief in contemplation of which an amendment has been made on the maxim fiat justitia ruat calum—justitia being erased and injustitia substituted but it is a weight added to a mans affliction     it may be said to have the proof that is to subject him to punishment drawn out of his own mouth a weight no not of a feather what is this burthen compared with the burthen imposed without remorse upon individuals completely innocent—upon the individuals convened as witnesses the suffering—the real suffering—is that which is inflicted by the punishment itself a suffering the infliction of which is by the supposition speaking with reference to the aggregate interests of the community a desirable event in that and that alone consists the real affliction as to the supposed addition—a mere metaphorical quantity—except in the mind of the rhetorician it has no existence you are sure of being convicted by what sort of evidence would you choose rather to be convicted by the evidence of other people without any of your own or by evidence of other peoples and your own together—were a question of this sort put to a malefactor would it not be matter of perplexity to him to choose would not a pot of beer or a glass of gin on whichever side placed be sufficient to turn the scale but allowing for the sake of argument that there is a difference between the pain in the one case and the pain in the other—for my own part i can see none—but if there be can it be assumed as a competent and sufficiently broad and solid ground for the establishment of a rule of law is there anything here capable of being set against the mischiefs of impunity the mischiefs of the offence be it what it may which the law in question—the law which the rule of exclusion in question seeks to debilitate—is employed to combat justice out of the question which certainly has nothing to do in it refer the matter to mercy—whatever he meant by mercy—and ask whether a malefactor be the less deserving of mercy because it so happens that without putting any questions to himself evidence sufficient for conviction happens to come in from other sources in england society exists therefore english law must have given admission either to the makeshift or to the regular evidence from that same source it excludes the regular—it admits the makeshift observe then the result of this prodigious scrupulosity of this sentimental tenderness—a preference and that an exclusive one given to inferior evidence lawyer inferior ay in your estimation nonlawyer yes but i speak not of my own estimation only nor of the estimation of men in general only but of your own suppose it the case of an extraneous witness—a person whose testimony it is proposed to call in he having no share or interest in the cause do you in that case accept of a letter or memorandum of his or a supposed extrajudicial discourse of his in lieu of the judicially delivered testimony of his own hand or the immediate evidence of his own lips do you in this instance exclude the regular open the door to the makeshift evidence from the same source not you indeed far from excluding the regular evidence you do not admit the makeshift far from giving an exclusive admission to the makeshift you do not unless incidentally for infirmation or confirmation give it any admission at all   in the short and disastrous reign of philip and mary came out the statute so often mentioned in virtue of which in cases treated as criminal and where the punishment rises to that of felony justices of the peace acting singly are empowered to resort to the mouth of the defendant the supposed transgressor for information on the subject of the offence not a syllable can he utter that may not have—that was not designed at least to have in case of his having been guilty—the effect of selfcriminative evidence not a minute after any such question put to him can he remain silent but his silence at least if the use were made of it that might and ought and was intended to be made of it would in like manner have the effect of selfcriminating evidence contradictory however as this statute is when compared with the jurisprudential rule the charge of inconsistency it must be confessed extends not to this case the rule was the work of the man of law seeking his own ends the exception—a sprig of common sense imported from the continent of europe and planted in a bed of nonsense and hypocrisy by which it has been nearly choked—was the work of the sovereign seeking the welfare of his people through the ends of justice happy the nation had no worse importation taken place under the auspices of spanish influence third contradiction to the exclusionary rule—preparatory examination of suspected felons under the statute of philip and mary thus far we have seen the contradictions given to the rule when the punishment to which the man exposes himself by his selfcriminative evidence is ultrapecuniary rising in its lowest degree above the highest level to which pecuniary punishment is capable of extending itself observe now the contradictions which it has received in the case where the punishment is not ultrapecuniary—does not in its highest degree rise in point of afflictiveness above the level of pecuniary punishment   0 but in the case where in how heavy a degree soever onerous the heaviest obligation to which the party stands exposed does not wear the name of punishment—selfonerative selfonerative simply is the name that has been given to the evidence the cases embraced by selfcriminative evidence exposing the party to punishment not beyond pecuniary and the cases embraced by evidence simply selfonerative are therefore to this purpose at least the same cases the rules and practices therefore that operate in contradiction to the rule excluding selfonerative evidence are so many contradictions to the rule by which selfcriminative evidence to the effect of punishment not ultrapecuniary stands excluded   a motion for an information a criminal information is a suit instituted to know whether a suit shall be instituted a suit carried on upon the worst evidence that can be found to know whether a suit for the same cause shall be carried on upon good or less bad evidence a suit carried on upon premeditated preconcerted uncrossexaminable evidence to know whether the same suit shall be carried on upon unpremeditable unconcertable crossexamined evidence when the prosecution is in this mode and there are few crimes short of capital the prosecution for which may not be carried on in this mode the principal piece is never suffered to be performed before a single judge for the benefit of justice till in this style a prelude to it has been rehearsed at his majestys theatre in westminster hall for the benefit of the lawyers lawyer nay but what is this to the purpose here no questions are asked the defendant says what he pleases nonlawyer true sir no questions are put in the form of questions but allegations have been made—allegations which to the purpose here in hand howsoever imperfectly calculated for the complete and correct discovery of truth have the effect of questions by the affidavits of those willing witnesses whom he has procured to join with him the prosecutor has made his charge the defendant delivers in his affidavit or not as he thinks fit but the rule having been made upon him to show cause so sure as he omits to deliver in an affidavit so surely in this preliminary suit is he cast if he pleases he may be silent taking the consequences and so he may be though the exclusionary rule were abolished of a complete abolition of the exclusionary rule what at least in the case of a party would be the effect not compulsion the exaction of an answer but simple permission—permission to put questions he to whom the question is put answering or not answering at pleasure are you an equity draughtsman you are not to learn then that in equity an allegation a charge is everything—a question nothing is the fact made up into a charge question or no question interrogatory or no interrogatory an answer is compelled and compelled by means far more rigorously coercive is an interrogatory put without a charge for its support it is as if nothing had been said lawyer but can you say the obligation upon him to answer is equally coercive in this case as before a jury at the assizes the old bailey or guildhall nonlawyer oh yes that i can the obligation to speak true no on the contrary if he be guilty he has every encouragement that can be given to him to engage him to speak false and upon his oath—to engage him to commit perjury   time for premeditation   attorneys and counsel to instruct and assist him in the arts of evasion   time for concerting a story with coaffidavit men and coperjurers if he can get any   no questions asked   the assurance that if he swears hard enough his own testimony though with the testimony of the prosecutor in the teeth of it will be conclusive and save him from all further trouble truth therefore if guilty he has every encouragement not to speak but something he is bound to say or condemnation ensues if the charge be strong enough to one or other obligation he stands bound continually—either to criminate himself or to perjure himself lawyer condemnation why talk of condemnation is not the trial the inquiry by the result of which he may be either convicted or acquitted yet to come nonlawyer yes in the case of an information but be pleased to go on to the next article   there are a class of suits which though not much less frequent than the denominated ones have never yet received a name let us call them motion causes the demand—instead of being stated by the pen of one sort of lawyer in the form of a written instrument an indictment an information a declaration lodged in an office—is stated by the tongue of another sort of lawyer in a harangue made in open court called a motion instead of being tried on vivâ voce evidence the question in this case is tried solely upon affidavit evidence on an information after having had the advantage of being condemned once on bad evidence a man may have the privilege of being condemned again upon better evidence but in a motion cause condemned once he is condemned for good and all if condemned at all he is condemned upon the bad evidence of these motion causes some are considered as criminal causes some as civil causes     criminal causes for example motions for attachment motions that the defendant may answer the matters of the affidavit civil causes for example motion to set aside proceedings for irregularity motion to set aside an award that has been made a rule of court under the head of motion causes may be ranked to this purpose at least petition causes the causes by which masses of property are disposed of to any amount in the case where the possessor has been aggregated to that class of insolvent debtors who have been styled bankrupts in these cases whatever motion the ears of the judge are entertained with is preceded by a written instrument called a petition which gives him little trouble in these cases the evidence by which the cause is decided being purely affidavit evidence they present in this respect no difference to distinguish them from the aggregate mass of motion causes   another occasion on which selfdisserving evidence and that selfcriminating is not only allowed to be called for but compelled is that on which the evidence is extracted from a defendant by the subordinate judge called the master by means of ready written questions called on this occasion interrogatories so seldom does the occasion for this operation present itself that it would not have been worth mentioning except that it may be seen that it has not been overlooked in the case of an information the second inquiry before a jury comes on of course if—on motion for leave to file the information and the first inquiry—affidavit inquiry if an inquiry it can be called on which no questions are asked in consequence—the rule to show cause is followed by an absolute rule leave granted and information filed if the second inquiry comes of course the cause cannot to the disadvantage of the defendants side be determined without it in the case of an attachment unless it be in one out of several hundred not to say thousand causes the first inquiry is the only one the fate of the defendant is determined by it but in a case that has been known now and then to happen after the fate of the defendant has been determined on the ground of the affidavit evidence with or without extraneous witnesses on both sides the defendant alone is subjected to a second inquiry performed by the ready written questions as above mentioned on an occasion of this sort no more reserve is used than would have been used had the rule nemo tenetur seipsum prodere never been heard of if time is given him to study his answer and a copy of the interrogatories given him for that purpose he is thereby examined in the way a defendant is examined in the civil suits called equity suits if answers are required of him on the spot he is thereby examined as extraneous witnesses are examined on the occasion of these same equity suits   must it be mentioned yes it must how frequent soever may be the need of mentioning it on other occasions—or the catalogue of the inconsistent infringements of this rule will not yet be complete in cases of indictment and information if the defendant has been convicted by his own default or by a jury upon the good evidence the appetite of the partnership is not yet satisfied the chain of inquiries is not yet regarded as complete without a third inquiry in which the cause is tried over again upon the bad the affidavit evidence i speak of the supplemental inquiry carried on antecedently to or upon his being brought up for judgment by the same evidence by which the same cause is thus tried over again for the third time another cause it frequently happens is tried for the first and last time—another cause of which no jury has had cognizance i speak of the charges so frequently brought against the same defendant for misbehaviour alleged to have taken place at a time subsequent to that of his conviction by the jury for the former cause such is the respect really paid to that most useful of all stalkinghorses an english jury the gorgeous idol under whose convenient mantle so many abuses lodge themselves such is the respect really paid even in criminal causes to the accommodating maxim—to the flexible the truly lesbian rule nemo tenetur scipsum prodere on every man obligation to betray himself to every man encouragement at the same time to perjure himself such is the state of things as often as in regard to a disputed question affidavit evidence is received   coeval or not much short of coeval with the practice on jury trials which admits not of the putting a question to either party in the cause is the practice of the equity courts by which to so great an extent the proceedings in the causes in which juries are employed are obstructed or overruled—not to speak of the wideextending class of demands of which equity alone takes cognizance the allsufficient power of common law not affording to these rights so much as the semblance of a remedy but in no one instance whatever was any cause heard in equity but—in and by the very instrument the bill in and by which the demands of the plaintiff are signified—the defendant is called upon to betray himself as truly as it is possible for a man to be called upon to betray himself the questions     being put in writing time is indeed given him to meditate and concert safe perjury as in the case of affidavit evidence answer he must or when he has been plagued and squeezed sufficiently in other ways his silence is taken for an answer in the affirmative the bill is taken pro confesso and that which to his prejudice the plaintiff prays may be done is done lawyer but equity causes are but civil causes admitting this to be the practice in equity it is not for this instance at least the less true that no man is bound to criminate himself nonlawyer true equity causes are but civil causes so that by the effect of the question put to him a man is not exposed to lose more than his whole estate but of that estate the value may amount to any number of hundreds of thousands of pounds seens which nowadays are running on to millions in a cause denominated a criminal cause did you ever in the whole course of your practice know an instance of a mans suffering a loss to the amount of two thousand pounds were the option your own to which of two losses would you give the preference to a loss of £ 000 to be taken from you in a cause called a criminal cause or to a loss of £ 00000 to be taken from you in a cause called a civil cause contradictions in substance are not to be reconciled by words the jurisdiction of the courts of equity is civil merely be it so for civil is but a word but if vexation or no vexation is the issue—if feelings themselves not the words employed in speaking of them are to be regarded—the quantity of vexation to which a man may thus be made to subject himself by his testimony when extracted from him by this court of purely civil jurisdiction surpasses by a great deal the utmost quantity of vexation of the same kind to which he could be subjected were his testimony extracted from him with a view to punishment to be inflicted upon him under the name of punishment in a court of criminal jurisdiction where either attachment or information and in perhaps the greater part of the cases in which indictment is the name given to the suit taking the ends of justice for the standard here we see a tissue of inconsistencies viewing as the sole ends in pursuit the established ends of judicature all inconsistency vanishes the parties examining one another vivâ voce and at the outset in the presence of the judge as in a court of conscience—so far no pretence for fees no more than in a court of conscience no delay no pretence for delay no motives for producing delay no more than in a court of conscience set them to fight with affidavits manufactured by attorneys fees spring up in plenty affidavits the seed perjuries and fees like ryegrass and clover spring up together set them to examine one another in the epistolary style as in and by a bill in equity that is to say a pair of bills a bill and a cross bill the examination takes up twice or three times as many months as in a court of conscience it would have taken minutes the prolific examination crawling on for ten fifteen or twenty months fees pullulating from it all the time a suit in equity perhaps to do nothing but get the evidence and then a suit at common law six twelve or eighteen months to give employment to the evidence chapter v examination of the cases in which english law exempts one person from giving evidence against another §   the exemption improper if the testimony of a party to his own predudice ought to be compellable so ought that of any other person if the vexation of which it might be productive to rens to contribute by his even evidence to subject himself to the obligations of justice affords no sufficient reason for the dissolving of these obligations—still less can any good reason be drawn from the vexation resulting from that same source for depriving justice of the benefit of any other testimony this sort of secondhand vexation reflected from the former must be of one or other of two descriptions the seat of it in the bosom of one or other of two persons is it in consideration of the vexation that reus himself would suffer from the prejudice that might accrue to him from the evidence of amicus—is it for this reason that justice should be deprived of the benefit of amicuss testimony but it will hardly be said that a mans sufferings will be greater at seeing evidence to his prejudice extracted from another bosom than at feeling it extracted from his own is it in consideration of the vexation that amicus would suffer from the thought of the prejudice that might accrue from his evidence to reus—is it for this reason that justice should be deprived of the benefit of the testimony of amicus but it will hardly be said that a mans sufferings will be greater at the idea of an evil considered as about to befall another person whether from his own instrumentality or from any other cause than at the idea of the same evil—of an evil the same in magnitude probability and proximity considered as about to fall upon himself secus if reus and amicus were nisus and     euryalus but reus and amicus are not nisus and euryalus they are average men it is not to fabulous nor yet to extraordinary characters but to ordinary ones that the provisions of the legislator ought to be adapted suppose such a plea admitted observe the consequence by what criterion shall the degree of sympathetic sensibility on the part of amicus be determined by what sure token open to the eyes and estimation of the judge shall it be discovered that the fate of reus is in any degree an exciting cause of the affection in question in the breast of amicus from the ties of blood the presumption is strong but unhappily not so strong as to be conclusive from any other ties the presumption is weaker and weaker ad infinitum admitted the plea would put into the hands of the judge at least with the concurrence of the proposed witness the faculty of excluding or admitting any mans testimony at pleasure the sentimental candidate for exclusion what in this case should he do—should he speak and weep and faint for himself or fee counsel to speak and weep and faint for him §   lawyer and client english judges have taken care to exempt the professional members of the partnership from so unpleasant an obligation as that of rendering service to justice counsel and attorneys     ought not to be say rather are not permitted to discover the secrets of then clients though they offer themselves for that purpose† on which of the two abovementioned grounds does the exemption rest in those learned bosoms is it that the client would suffer so much more from being hurt by his lawyers testimony than by his own or that a man is so much dearer to his advocate and his attorney than to himself the oracle has given its response—the privilege is that of the client not of the attorney‡ when in consulting with a law adviser attorney or advocate a man has confessed his delinquency or disclosed some fact which if stated in court might tend to operate in proof of it such law adviser is not to be suffered to be examined as to any such point the law adviser is neither to be compelled nor so much as suffered to betray the trust thus reposed in him not suffered why not oh because to betray a trust is treachery and an act of treachery is an immoral act an immoral sort of act is that sort of act the tendency of which is in some way or other to lessen the quantity of happiness in society in what way does the supposed cause in question tend to the production of any such effect the conviction and punishment of the defendant he being guilty is by the supposition an act the tendency of which upon the whole is beneficial to society such is the proposition which for this purpose must be assumed some offences it will be admitted by everybody are of that sort and quality that the acts by which they are punished do possess this beneficial tendency let the offence in question be of the number it is of such only as are of that number that i speak the good then that results from the conviction and punishment in the case in question is out of dispute where then is the additional evil of it when produced by the cause in question nowhere the evil consists in the punishment but the punishment a man undergoes is not greater when the evidence on which the conviction and punishment are grounded happens to come out of the mouth of a law adviser of his than if it had happened to come out of his own mouth or that of a third person but if such confidence when reposed is permitted to be violated and if this be known which if such be the law it will be the consequence will be that no such confidence will be reposed not reposed—well and if it be not wherein will consist the mischief the man by the supposition is guilty if not by the supposition there is nothing to betray let the law adviser say everything he has heard everything he can have heard from his client the client cannot have anything to fear from it that it will often happen that in the case supposed no such confidence will be reposed is natural enough the first thing the advocate or attorney will say to his client will be—remember that whatever you say to me i shall be obliged to tell if asked about it what then will be the consequence that a guilty person will not in general be able to derive quite so much assistance from his law adviser in the way of concerning a false defence as he may do at present except the prevention of such pernicious confidence of what other possible effect can the rule for the requisition of such evidence be productive either of none at all or of the conviction of delinquents in some instances in which but for the lights thus obtained they would not have been convicted but in this effect what imaginable circumstance is there that can render it in any degree pernicious and undesirable none whatever the conviction of delinquents is the very end of penal justice observe the inconsistency between the rule in the case of the particular species of contract in question and the rules observed in general in respect to contracts of contracts     in general the fulfilment is beneficial to society of contracts in general the fulfilment is accordingly enforced but there are some contracts the fulfilment of which would be pernicious to society every crime every offence supposing the prohibition put upon it by the law to be well grounded affords an example viz that of a contract for the joining in the commission of such offence the contract between a delinquent and his law adviser is a contract which has for its object the enabling the delinquent to escape the punishment which is his due with what consistency to what end would the law seek to enforce a contract to such an effect suppose a like contract between a delinquent and his jailer—a contract the object of which shall be to enable the delinquent to escape does the law seek to enforce this sort of contract no not anywhere but why not it might with as much reason as in the other case if the law adviser of his own motion the law neither commanding nor forbidding him were to offer his testimony for the purpose of promoting the conviction of his client the imputation of treachery would have if not a good ground at any rate a better a more plausible ground but the question is not whether the lawyer shall thus offer his testimony but whether the law shall command it or authorize him nay force him to refuse it compare the law in this case with the law in the case of treason—misprision of treason if knowing of an act of treason committed a man forbears to give information of it such forbearance is punished and certainly not without reason as a high crime in the case of the law adviser the rule now under consideration would probably be deemed applicable to the crime of treason as well as to all others the law in this case finds a man in whom it protects that very species of conduct which it punishes in every other man and that species of conduct a mischievous one one of which the effects cannot but be pernicious to what end with what consistency can the law find out a man to receive with safety and even under an obligation of concealment that confidence that pernicious confidence which it punishes in every other man another inconsistency to confidents taken from other professions neither the obligation nor the permission of secrecy as against justice extends a physician a surgeon is compelled to disclose what may operate towards the conviction of his patient to the credit of the judges of latter times this superstition appears to have been not much to their taste by decision after decision they have pared it down and narrowed it to a very considerable degree from a counsel from an attorney evidence may be extracted of facts which came to their knowledge before they were retained of facts disclosed to them by the client after the suit was at an end by compromise† of facts which though falling under their cognizance no otherwise than in consequence of their professional intercourse with their client were not directly communicated and confessed by him‡ of facts which though coming to their cognizance in consequence of such intercourse might it is said have come to their cognizance without it∥ in a word so fine has the hair been split that when an attorney has been consulted with not it is said as an attorney but only as a friend evidence of the facts that come under his cognizance has been extracted from his mouth§ quære by what sign to know when it is the attorney who is present and when it is the friend in the case of the counsel there might have been less difficulty the professional robe by being off or on might distinguish the counsel from the friend hawkins¶ speaking to the question what kind of receipt of a felon will make the receiver an accessary after the fact says it seems agreed that generally any assistance whatever given to one known to be a felon in order to hinder his      suffering the punishment to which he is condemned is a sufficient receipt for this purpose by the word condemned he means no more than doomed by the general disposition of the law not condemned in consequence of a particular prosecution instituted for in all the examples he gives the assistance spoken of is given before prosecution the lawyer who knowing from the confession of his client that such client has committed a felony enables him by his counsel to avoid suffering the punishment to which he is condemned is according to the above definition an accessary to such felony viz an accessary after the fact in practice he certainly would not be deemed so what i mention the case for is to show the inconsistency in the case of the law adviser the policy as it is called of the law is to protect that sort of man in affording to a crime that very sort of assistance the giving of which it punishes in any other sort of man—punishes and even to such a degree as to treat him as an accomplice in a case like this it would certainly be too much to punish the law adviser as an     accomplice for lending his advice which is his mode of assistance to a guilty client or for not spontaneously disclosing such lights towards the ascertainment of his guilt as it has happened to him to collect it might deter the lawyer from lending his assistance to an innocent person when accused by the fear of being involved in the punishment in case of his proving guilty but to what use or with what consistency forbid his disclosing any such proof of guilt even though called upon so to do a distinction which seems an important one is one of which i see no traces in the books the confidence supposed to be reposed in the law adviser—is it reposed after prosecution for the purpose of the guilty partys being enabled to escape the punishment due to his guilt or is it reposed before prosecution—reposed suppose while the offence is in contemplation and in the view of learning the means of committing it with impunity and success in the former case the relation of the law adviser to the offence in case of criminal consciousness on his part is that of an accessary after the fact in the other that of an accessary before or during the fact that sort of accessary who in the technical language of the law is in many cases termed a principal i say in case of criminal consciousness for from the circumstance of an attorneys having it in his power to give evidence the effect of which added to other evidence may be to give birth to the conviction of his client in respect of a crime or other offence—it does not follow by any means that there must have been any criminal consciousness on his part that the picture of the transaction should have been present to his mind clothed with all those circumstances the union of which is necessary to the constituting it a crime in case of perjury for example the attorney may have learnt from his client the existence of a fact incompatible with another fact the existence of which the client has averred upon oath but without having heard of his ever having made any such averment or vice versâ he may have been privy to the making of such averment upon oath without having ever received information either from the client or anybody else of the existence of the fact by which such averment is demonstrated to be perjurious a counsel solicitor or attorney cannot conduct the cause of his client it has been observed if he is not fully instructed in the circumstances attending it but the client it is added could not give the instructions with safety if the facts confided to his advocate were to be disclosed not with safety so much the better to what object is the whole system of penal law directed if it be not that no man shall have it in his power to flatter himself with the hope of safety in the event of his engaging in the commission of an act which the law on account of its supposed mischievousness has thought fit to prohibit the argument employed as a reason against the compelling such disclosure is the very argument that pleads in favour of it this being the professed object of the english system of law as well as of every other system of law—viz the prevention of offences—is it reconcilable to the idea of wisdom or consistency that it should lay down a rule the effect of which without contributing to the protection of the innocent or preventing vexation in any other shape is purely and simply to counteract its own designs in vain would it be to impute the favouring of treachery to a regulation by which such disclosures were to be made obligatory in saying a criminative fact stated by a delinquent to his law adviser shall if called for be disclosed by him in evidence it gives sufficient warning to offenders not to seek for safety in such means thus much as to the case where the effect of the disclosure may be to subject the client to suffer as for an offence where the effect of it does not go beyond the subjecting him to some nonpenal obligation to which he otherwise might not be subjected or to debat him from some right of which he otherwise might have come into possession or remained possessed—the objection is no more reconcilable with the main object of the law than in the other case in every such case though by a process grievously and unnecessarily dilatory and expensive† what the law does or to be consistent ought to do is to compel each party out of his own mouth or to speak literally by his own hand to make disclosure of such facts as lying within his own knowledge are of a nature to contribute towards substantiating the claim of the adversary can there be any reason why that information which he is compelled to give by his own hand should not be obtained with equal facility from another hand from which if there be any difference it may be extracted with less reluctance disclosure of all legallyoperative facts facts investitive or divestitive of right—of all facts on which right depends—such without any exception ought to be—such with a few inconsistent exceptions actually is the object of the law on the part of the individuals of all descriptions by whom information to such effect happens in each instance to be possessed the two species of behaviour by which the     fulfilment of this design may be counteracted in such instance are falsehood and concealment it falsehood is not favoured by the law why should concealment a mode of conduct which without the guilt at least in as far as guilt is measured by punishment is attended so far as it takes place with the same pernicious and undesirable effect concealment of those facts the knowledge of which is necessary to the fulfilment of the prodictions delivered by the substantive branch of the law is a mode of conduct punished in some instances as an offence and even as a crime the least that can be required by consistency is that the species of fraud thus punished in some cases should not in any case be protected and encouraged to give encouragement to the spirit of chicane is an imputation which on here and there an occasion men are bold enough to cast upon the general complexion of the law though not in a hundredth part of the instances in which a just warrant might be found for it an objection to a proposition in which any such term as chicane is the characteristic word is that it is indistinct and vague the rules of the class of that against which i have been here contending may serve at once to fix the import and to exemplify the ground of it expect the lawyer to be serious in his endeavours to extirpate the breed of dishonest litigants expect the foxhunter first to be serious in his wishes to extirpate the breed of foxes idle as a reproach—as a memento this ought never to be out of mind it is thus and thus only that it can be visible to the legislator where to look for opposition and where if anywhere for assistance farther remarks by the editor—in the notice of the traité des preuves judiciaires in the edinburgh review the rule which excludes the testimony of the professional assistant is with much earnestness defended the grounds of the defence in so far as they are intelligible to me reduce themselves to those which follow—   the first argument consists of two steps whereof the former is expressed the latter understood and either of them if admitted destroys the other the proposition which is asserted is that the aid which is afforded to an accused person by his advocate is of exceedingly great importance to justice the proposition which is insinuated is that of this aid he would be deprived if his advocate were rendered subject to examination—if the only purpose for which an advocate can be of use be to assist a criminal in the concealment of his guilt the last proposition is true but what becomes of the former if on the other hand as is sufficiently evident an advocate be needful on other accounts than this—if he be of use to the innocent as well as to the guilty—to the man who has not anything to conceal as well as to the man who has—what is to hinder an innocent or even a guilty defendant from availing himself of his advocates assistance for all purposes except that of frustrating the law   the second argument consists but of one proposition it is that lord russells attorney would have been a welcome visitor with his notes in his pocket to the office of the solicitor of the treasury to the exalted personages whose desire it was to destroy lord russell any person would it is probable have been a welcome visitor who came with information in his pocket tending to criminate the prisoner from this what does the reviewer infer that no information tending to criminate the prisoner should be received—that the truth should not on a judicial occasion be ascertained not exactly only that one means a most efficient means of ascertaining if should be rejected are we to suppose then that on every judicial occasion the thing which is desirable is that the laws should not be executed then indeed the reviewers conclusion would be liable to no other objection than that of not going nearly far enough since all other kinds of evidence might and indeed ought on such a supposition to be excluded likewise so long as the law treats any act as a crime which is not a crime so long it will without doubt be desirable that some acts which are legally crimes should escape detection and by conducing to that end this or any other exclusionary rule may palliate in a slight degree the mischiefs of a bad law to make the conclusion hold universally what would it be necessary to suppose only that the whole body of the law is a nuisance and its frustration not its execution the end to be desired laws are made to be executed not to be set aside for the sake of weakening this or that bad law would you weaken all the laws how monstrous must that law be which is not better than such a remedy instead of making bad laws and then by exclusionary rules undoing with one hand a part of the mischief which you have been doing with the other would it not be wiser to make no laws but such as are fit to be executed and then to take care that they be executed on all occasions   the third argument is of that ingenious and sometimes very puzzling sort called a dilemma if the rule were abolished two courses only according to the reviewer the lawyer would have he must enter into communication with the opposite party from the     beginning to which course there would be objections or he must wait till he had satisfied himself that his client was in the wrong and must enter into communication with the opposite party then to which course there would be other objections what the force of these objections may be it is not necessary nor would it be pertinent to inquire since neither justice nor mr bentham demand that he should enter into communication with the opposite party at all what is required is only that if upon the day of trial the opposite party should choose to call for his evidence it may not be in his power any more than in that of any other witness to withhold it one would not have been surprised at these arguments or even worse from an indiscriminate eulogizer of things as they are this however is by no means the character of the writer of this article it is the more surprising therefore that he should have been able to satisfy himself with reasons such as the three which we have examined not that these are all the reasons he has to give the following paragraph seems to be considered by him as containing additional reasons to the same effect— even in the very few instances where the accused has intrusted his defender with a full confession of his crime we hold it to be clear that he may still be lawfully defended the guilt of which he may be conscious and which he may have so disclosed he has still a right to see distinctly proved upon him by legal evidence to suborn wretches to the commission of perjury or procure the absence of witnesses by bribes is to commit a separate and execrable crime to tamper with the purity of the judges is still more odious but there is no reason why any party should not by fair and animated arguments demonstrate the insufficiency of that testimony on which alone a righteous judgment can be pronounced to his destruction human beings are never to be run down like beasts of prey without respect to the laws of the chase if society must make a sacrifice of any one of its members let it proceed according to general rules upon known principles and with clear proof of necessity let us carve him as a feast fit for the gods not hew him as a carrass for the hounds reversing the paradox above cited from paley we should not despair of finding strong arguments in support of another and maintain that it is desirable that guilty men should sometimes escape by the operation of those general rules which form the only security for innocence in reading the above declamation one is at a loss to discover what it is which the writer is aiming at does he really think that all other things being the same a system of procedure is the better for affording to criminals a chance of escape if this be his serious opinion there is no more to be said since it must be freely admitted that reasoning upon this principle there is no fault to be found with the rule if it be your object not to find the prisoner guilty there cannot be a better way than refusing to hear the person who is most likely to know of his guilt if it exist the rule is perfectly well adapted to its end but is that end the true end of procedure this question surely requires no answer but if the safety of the innocent and not that of the guilty be the object of the reviewers solicitude—had he shown how an innocent man could be endangered by his lawyers felling all he has to tell he would have delivered something more to the purpose than any illustration which the subject of carcasses and hounds could yield if he can be content for one moment to view the question with other than foxhunting eyes even he must perceive that to the man who having no guilt to disclose has disclosed none to his lawyer nothing could be of greater advantage than that this should appear as it naturally would if the lawyer were subjected to examination there is no reason why any party should not by fair and animated arguments demonstrate the insufficiency of that testimony on which alone a righteous judgment can be pronounced to his destruction this if i rightly understand it means that incomplete evidence ought not for want of comments to be taken for complete we were in no great danger of supposing that it ought but the real question is—should you because your evidence is incomplete shat out other evidence which would complete it after the lawyer has been examined is the evidence incomplete notwithstanding then is the time for your fair and animated arguments is it complete then what more could you desire the denunciation which follows against hunting down human beings without respect for the laws of the chase is one of those proofs which meet us every day how little as yet even instructed englishmen are accustomed to look upon judicature as a means to an end and that end the execution of the law they speak and act every now and then as if they regarded a criminal trial as a sort of game partly of chance partly of skill in which the proper end to be aimed at is not that the truth may be discovered but that both parties may have fair play in a word that whether a guilty person shall be acquitted or punished may be as nearly as possible an even chance i had almost omitted the most formidable argument of all which was brought forward by m dumont not as decisive but as deserving of consideration and which the reviewer     who adopts it terms a conclusive reductio ad absurdum this consists in a skilful application of the words spy and informer espion délateur two words forming part of a pretty extensive assortment of vaguely vituperative expressions which possess the privilege of serving as conclusive objections against any person or thing which it is resolved to condemn and against which it is supposed no other objections can be found spies and informers are bad people a lawyer who discloses his clients guilt is a spy and an informer he is therefore a bad man and such disclosure is a bad practice and the rule by which it is prohibited is a good rule such when analyzed into its steps is the argument which we are now called upon to consider but to form a ground for condemning any practice it is not enough to apply to the person who practises it an opprobrious name it is necessary moreover to point out some pernicious tendency in the practice to show that it produces more evil than good it cannot be pretended that the act of him who when a crime comes to his knowledge be it from the malefactors own lips or from any other source being called upon judicially to declare the truth declares it accordingly is a pernicious act on the contrary it is evident that it is a highly useful act the evil occasioned by it being at the very worst no more than the punishment of the guilty person—an evil which in the opinion of the legislature is outweighed by the consequent security to the public call this man therefore an informer or not as you please but if you call him an informer remember to add that the act which constitutes him one is a meritorious act m dumont expresses an apprehension that no honourable man would take upon him the functions of an advocate if compelled to put on what he is pleased to call the character of an informer further reflection would i think have convinced him that this apprehension is chimerical there is scarcely anything in common between the two characters of an informer and of a witness the antipathy which exists against the former extends not to the latter a witness as such does not take money for giving evidence as an informer frequently does for giving information the act of an informer is spontaneous he is a man who goes about of his own accord doing mischief to others so at least it appears to the eyes of unreflecting prejudice the evidence of the witness may be more fatal to the accused than the indications given by the informer but it has the appearance of not being equally spontaneous he tells what he knows because the law compels him to say something and because being obliged to speak he will speak nothing but the truth but for anything that appears if he had not been forced he would have held his tongue and staid away an honourable man acting in the capacity of an advocate would by giving true evidence incur the approbation of all lovers of justice and would not incur the disapprobation of any one what therefore is there to deter him unless it be a hatred of justice the reviewer adds that m dumonts argument might be assisted with a multiplicity of reasonings these as he has not stated them mr bentham probably may be pardoned for being ignorant of the reviewer is modest enough to content himself with the single and very obvious remark that the author evidently presumes the guilt from the accusation a remark which could have had its source in nothing but the thickest confusion of ideas had mr bentham recommended condemnation without evidence or any other practice which would be indiscriminately injurious to all accused persons innocent or guilty—it might then have been said of him with some colom of justice that he presumed the guilt from the accusation but when of the practice which he recommends it is a characteristic property to be a security to the innocent a source of danger to the guilty alone—under what possible pretence can he be charged with presuming the existence of guilt—though he may be charged sure enough with desiring that where there is guilt it may be followed by punishment a wish probably blameable in the eyes of the reviewer who thinks it desirable that guilty men should sometimes escape thus weak are all the arguments which could be produced against this practice by men who would have been capable of finding better arguments had any better been to be found it may appear and perhaps ought to appear surprising that men generally unprejudiced and accustomed to think should be misled by sophistry of so flimsy a texture as this has appeared to be unhappily however there is not any argument so palpably untenable and absurd which is not daily received even by instructed men as conclusive if it makes in favour of a doctrine which they are predetermined to uphold in the logic of the schools the premises prove the conclusion in the logic of the affections some cause hidden or apparent having produced a prepossession this prepossession proves the conclusion and the conclusion proves the premises you may then scatter the premises to the winds of heaven and the conclusion will not stand the less firm—the affections being still enlisted in its favour and the show not the substance of a reason being that which is sought for—if the former premises are no longer defensible others of similar quality are easily found the only mode of     attack which has any chance of being successful is to look out for the cause of the prepossession and do what may be possible to be done towards its removal when once the feeling the real support of the opinion is gone the weakness of the ostensible supports the socalled reasons becomes manifest and the opinion falls to the ground what is plainly at the bottom of the prepossession in the present case is a vague apprehension of danger to innocence there is nothing which if listened to is so sure to mislead as vague fears point out any specific cause of alarm anything upon which it is possible to lay your hand and say from this source evil of this or that particular kind is liable to flow and there may be some chance of our being able to judge whether the apprehension is or is not a reasonable one confine yourself to vague anticipations of undefined evils and your fears merit not the slightest regard if you cannot tell what it is you are afraid of how can you expect any one to participate in your alarm one thing is certain that if there be any reason for fear that reason must be capable of being pointed out and that a danger which does not admit of being distinctly stated is no danger at all let any one therefore ask himself—supposing the law good and the accused innocent—what possible harm can be done him by making his professional assistant tell all that he knows he may have told to his lawyer and his lawyer if examined may disclose circumstances which though they afford no inference against him it would have been more agreeable to him to conceal true but to guard him against any such unnecessary vexation he will have the considerate attention of the judge and this inconvenience after all is no more than what he may be subjected to by the deposition of any other witness and particularly by that of his son or his servant or any other person who lives in his house much more probably than by that of his lawyer whence all this dread of the truth whence comes it that any one loves darkness better than light except it be that his deeds are evil whence but from a confirmed habit of viewing the law as the enemy of innocence—as scattering its punishments with so illdirected and so unsparing a hand that the most virtuous of mankind were all his actions known could no more hope to escape from them than the most abandoned of malefactors whether the law be really in this state i will not take upon myself to say sure i am that if it be it is high time it should be amended but if it be not where is the cause of alarm in mens consciousness of their own improbity children and servants hate telltales thieves hate informers and peaching accomplices and in general he who feels a desire to do wrong hates all things and rules of evidence among the rest which may and he fears will lead to his detection thus much in vindication of the proposed rule as for its advantages they are to be sought for not so much in its direct as in its indirect operation the party himself having been as he ought to be previously subjected to interrogation—his lawyers evidence which though good of its kind is no better than hearsay evidence would not often add any new facts to those which had already been extracted from the lips of the client the benefit which would arise from the abolition of the exclusionary rule would consist rather in the higher tone of morality which would be introduced into the profession itself a rule of law which in the case of the lawyer gives an express heence to that wilful concealment of the criminals guilt which would have constituted any other person an accessary in the crime plainly declares that the practice of knowingly engaging ones self as the hired advocate of an unjust cause is in the eye of the law or to speak intelligibly in that of the lawmakers an innocent if not a virtuous practice but for this implied declaration the man who in this way hires himself out to do injustice or frustrate justice with his tongue would be viewed in exactly the same light as he who frustrates justice or does injustice with any other instrument we should not then hear an advocate boasting of the artifices by which he had trepanned a deluded jury into a verdict in direct opposition to the strongest evidence or of the effrontery with which he had by repeated insults thrown the faculties of a bonâ fide witness into a state of confusion which had caused him to be taken for a perjurer and as such disbelieved nor would an old bailey counsel any longer plume himself upon the number of pickpockets whom in the course of a long career he had succeeded in rescuing from the arm of the law the professional lawyer would be a minister of justice not an abettor of crime—a guardian of truth not a suborner of mendacity and not at his hands only in another sphere whether as a private man or as a legislator somewhat more regard for truth and justice might be expected than now when resistance to both is his daily business and if successful his greatest glory but through his medium the same salutary influence would speedily extend itself to the people at large can the paramount obligation of these cardinal virtues ever be felt by them as it ought while they imagine that on such easy terms as those of putting on a wig and gown a man obtains and on the most important of all occasions an exemption from both—conclusion of remarks by the editor   0 §   trustee and cestuy que trust on the subject of trustprejudicing evidence the decision if not quite so simple as in the preceding cases will be grounded on considerations not less conclusive the testimony being that of the trustee whose are the feelings in consideration of which the testimony in this case can be proposed to be excluded the feelings of the cestuy que trust the fideicommittee to whose prejudice it redounds but if the testimony thus proposed to be called for were his own no vexation of which the obligation could be productive could form any sufficient ground for the exclusion of it will it be said that the vexation produced in his breast by perceiving the evil in question brought on him by the testimony of another person his trustee will be greater than what would be produced by seeing the same evil brought on him by his own testimony the answer will hardly be in the affirmative but—be it on the one side or the other—in regard to the question of exclusion it is not in the nature of things that it should make any material difference is it in tenderness to the feelings of the trustee that the proposed wound should be inflicted on the vitals of justice but the vexation attendant on the delivery of the testimony could never rise to such a pitch as to constitute a sufficient ground for the exclusion of it although it were on the desponents own head that the evil were to fall much less where the head of another person is the head to bear it will the prospect of the suffering of the cestuy que trust be more insupportable to the trustee than if it were his own good as between nisus and euryalus nisus being trustee but our trustee is no hero neither of an epic poem nor a romance nor even of real life he is an average man an exact likeness may be seen of him in the propositus of blackstone and lord coke putting together the selfregarding feelings of the suffering cestuy que trust and the sympathetic feelings of the trustee will they by their joint force constitute a sufficient ground for the exclusion that nothing may be overlooked even this case shall undergo examination be it ever so strong it will never be strong enough to support the exclusive rule that practical point settled the speculative question whether the effect of the decomposition will be on the side of diminution or increase may be left to take its chance the case of trusteeship at least in the common as well as technical import of the word will not rise above the level of that sort of evidence which were it selfregarding would fall under the denomination of selfonerative evidence it will not rise to the level of selfcriminating it has never been proposed that on the ground of his being trustee for a thief or murderer a man should be exempt from the obligation of delivering testimony tending to convict such thief or murderer of his crime in this more afflictive case however the ground for exclusion is in proportion to the difference in point of afflictiveness stronger than in the less afflictive case where the loss of money or moneys worth would constitute the worst evil that could be made to fall on the cestuy que trust by the testimony of the trustee §   husband and wife the question of which the species of evidence for the designation of which the epithet familypeacedisturbing has been appointed is the subject is a question in no small degree complicated the necessity of grappling with it owes its birth to the arrangements made on this subject by english jurisprudence whatsoever be the relations natural or factitious temporary or perpetual subsisting between a number of persons living together in the compass of the same family—relations between husband and wife parents and children masters or mistresses and servants housekeepers and inmates—any event by which the emotion of illwill is produced in any one of them towards any other may pro tanto be said to operate to the disturbance of the family peace and illwill being a bad thing and peace a good thing the more effectually any disturbance can by any arrangement of law be prevented from being given to it so much the better disturbance of the peace of a family is vexation and of vexation if not necessary to the averting of a preponderant vexation the production ought always to be avoided that—testimony being delivered by a person standing in any one of these relations such as to operate to the prejudice of the person standing in the opposite and corresponding relation—vexation will be likely enough to be produced in the breasts of both is manifest enough but in any of these instances ought such vexation to be considered as forming a sufficient ground for the exclusion of the testimony over and over again the answer has been already made the case of husband and wife is the only sample which will here be taken being the only one which is taken in english law for the ground of an exclusionary rule to present a distinct conception the evil of the vexation capable of flowing from this source must in the first place be decomposed evil flowing from sympathy evil flowing from antipathy or illwill—to one or other of these two elements the whole evil of the mixed mass may be referred       as to the evil from sympathy it has already been put into the balance under the head of trustprejudicing evidence in the case of husband and wife whether considered on the part of the male or on the part of the female the affection or sympathy may naturally be considered as operating with greater much greater force than in the case of an average trustee on the other hand a point not to be overlooked is that the opposite affection and that acting with a force proportioned to the mutual vicinity of the two parties and to the inflexibility of the ties of various kinds by which they are connected is no less capable of finding a place yet after all allowances made it will not be less true that as between an average husband and an average wife—as between baron and feme in the character of propositos and proposita—an affection of the sympathetic kind cannot in reason but but be considered as subsisting on either side as between an average trustee and his average cestuy que trust justice thus done to all parties—the propriety of admission in this case and the impropriety of the exclusionary rule considered as placed on the ground of sympathy will not be the less unquestionable with all possible disposition to do justice to the maintained affection maintained on the one hand in the breast of propositus by the amiable qualities of proposita—on the other hand in the bosom of propositus by the estimable qualities of propositus—it seems difficult to avoid admitting that the affection of propositus towards proposita will not be altogether upon a level with the affection of the same propositus for his earlier and still more intimate acquaintance himself and no less so as between the affection of proposita towards propositus on the one hand and the affection of the same proposita towards the amiable partner of propositus on the other for let it not be forgotten that the bosoms to which the thermometer is for this purpose to be applied are the bosoms of propositus and proposita not of poetus and arria any more than of nisus and euryalus in the other case thus much seemed necessary yet not more than necessary to give the corrective requisite for reducing to the standard of plain and ordinary nature the heroic dimensions given to the conjugal flame by the sentimentality of english lawyers as therefore vexation on a selfregarding account has been shown not to be a sufficient ground for exclusion neither can the image of the same vexation presented by sympathy turn next to the evil from antipathy the law will not suffer the wife to be a witness for or against her husband this is a proposition put by a reporter into the mouth of the first earl of hardwicke the reason is     to preserve the peace of families and therefore i shall never encourage such a consent here by good fortune we have a distinct proposition with an assignable author and be of the first degree of professional respectability when on failure of the beaten track of analogy we find among the opinions of professional lawyers an argument that wears upon the face of it any connexion with the principle of utility it consists commonly in a reference to some one head of inconvenience or advantage no account being taken of any other but it is of the essence of law to be a choice of evils  including under the notion of evil the absence or negation of this or that lot of positive good it will happen in many cases that not only there shall be an advantage on one side to set against an inconvenience on the other but in the one scale there shall be a number of perfectly distinct advantages weighing against a number of equally distinct inconveniences in the other a narrow and imperfect lot of reason is better than a mere caprice having no relation to good or evil to pain or pleasure on either side but from an imperfect lot of reason no better than imperfect conclusions can reasonably be expected in legislative argumentation it is not uncommon to have a number of reasons such as they are all grounded on the principle of utiliy adduced on both sides but in judicial argument if you get a single article in the shape of an original reason an indication of convenience or inconvenience it is a sort of a prize cases against cases i e decisions against decisions you will have in plenty but if you have anything in the shape of a rational reason—of a reason referable to the principle of utility—you will find it stand alone and a mere allusion as vague and incompletely expressed as it is possible to conceive is the shape in which it comes hard—hardship—policy—peace of families—absolute necessity—some such words as these are the vehicles by which the exhibits spark of reason that exhibits itself is conveyed these are the leading terms and these are all you are furnished with and out of these you are to make an applicable a distinct and intelligible proposition as you can hawkins one of the best and most comprehensive heads the profession of the law ever possessed had already taken up the same argument and added to it another regularly the one shall not be admitted to give evidence against the other husband and wife nor the examination of the one he     made use of against the other by reason of the implacable dissension which might be caused by it and the great danger of perjury from taking the oaths of persons under so great a bias and the extreme hardship of the case implacable dissension is one argument the same in substance as that which occurred to and weighed with lord hardwicke great danger of perjury is another not stated as having been noticed by lord hardwicke of the words extreme hardship of the case i cannot make out any argument distinct from the two preceding ones these are the reasons for which not only the wife is not allowed to be called as a witness against her husband but even her extrajudicial declarations are not admitted in evidence against him though his own extrajudicial declarations are the argument from the danger of perjury arises out of the supposed sympathy and therefore need scarcely receive any farther notice suffice it to say that if the danger of perjury be an objection against the calling in the sanction of an oath in this case it is an objection against it in all other cases and an objection that applies to the sanction with the greater force the greater the need there is of it if applied to the testimony considered in respect of the danger of falsehood apart from the consideration of the sanction it is an objection to all testimony—if it applies to the case of the wife considered with respect to her presumable unwillingness to do an act whereby her husband may sustain a prejudice it applies with still greater force against all the instances in which a mans own testimony is permitted to be called for against himself it applies to one of the characteristic features of the practice of the courts styled courts of equity as to dissension—which to give force to the argument is presumed without the smallest alleged reason to be implacable— the rule if carried as far as it would go being altogether destructive of the peace of families—of that peace which it is its professed object to protect—in comes in consequence one class of exceptions and that a very large one† in case of an offence involving a personal injury committed by the husband against the wife the testimony of     the wife against the husband is admissible and admitted in ordinary practice when a man has inflicted severe bodily suffering on his wife—has been in the habit of thus filling her life with misery—here is a cause of dissension which powerful as it is experience proves to be by no means unplacable injuries of the like kind it will sometimes happen though by reason of the usual superiority of force on the male side not so frequently shall be inflicted—habitually inflicted on the husband by the wife a man forgives the wife who has put him to bedily forture but it is not in the nature of a man ever to forgive the wife who being called upon in a court of justice for the purposes of justice shall have dared to speak the truth where there is injury and the highest degree of injury forgiveness is expected being in every days experience where there is no injury—where the supposed cause of offence is a compliance with the injunctions of duty forgiveness is regarded as altogether hopeless to be consistent with itself the law should strew danger before every step which it could occur to a man to take in the path of criminality instead of that it is the care of the law itself to remove the principal source of danger out of his way to be consistent with itself it should remove out of his way every possible assistance that can contribute to engage him in any course of conduct which it reprobutes and endeavours to prevent instead of that it secures to every man one safe and unquestionable and ever ready accomplice for every imaginable crime if the dissension were in the nature of the case so implacable as the argument supposes it should consistently speaking operate as a motive with the law to prescribe rather than exclude this source of information if i attempt this crime it may happen to my wife from whom i cannot hope to conceal it to be called upon to bear witness against me and then—even if i should escape from the punishment of the law—the pain of seeing in the partner of my bed the once probable instrument of my destruction will never leave me in the days when the exclusive rule in question took its rise the reason in favour of it operated with a degree of force considerably beyond that with which it acts in these our days the power of the husband over the wife was much stronger and more absolute a time there appears to have been when the exceptions by which a wife is permitted to     seek protection in a court of justice against illusage by the husband were nor yet established morality was at the same time more loose—manners more harsh and savage resentment on so unbecoming a ground as that of a submission to the laws of truth and justice was more likely to be conceived and harboured more easy to be gratified with impunity and more apt to be implacable a law which should exclude the testimony of the wife in the case of a prosecution against the husband for illusage done to the wife would be tantamount to authorizing the husband to inflict on the wife all imaginable cruelties so long as nobody else was present a condition which having by law the command in and over his own house it would in general be in his power to fulfil a law which excludes the testimony of the wife in the case of a prosecution against the husband for mischief done to any other individual or to the state is in like manner in other words a law authorizing him to do in the presence and with the assistance of the wife every kind of mischief that excepted by which she herself would be a sufferer the law which in the former case affords its protection to the wife—with what consistency can it in the latter case refuse its protection to every human creature besides so often as the mask has been stripped off can it be necessary to lay bare the real policy that lies at the bottom of this business a cause between doe and ux admits as many fees as a cause between doe and roe in a case where there is nobody to swear for ux if ux were not admitted there would be no cause no fees rule—admit her evidence very different is the case where the cause is between one of the married pair viz the husband by whom the cause in a dispute with a stranger is in general conducted and a stranger if a man could not carry on schemes of injustice without being in danger every moment of being disturbed in them—and if that were not enough betrayed and exposed to punishment—by his wife injustice in all its shapes and with it the suits and the fees of which it is prolific would in comparison with what it is at present be rare let us therefore grant to every man a licence to commit all sorts of wickedness in the presence and with the assistance of his wife let us secure to every man in the bosom of his family and in his own bosom a safe accomplice let us make every mans house his castle and as far as depends upon us let us convert that castle into a den of thieves two men both married are guilty of errors of exactly the same sort punishable with exactly the same punishment in one of the two instances so it happens evidence sufficient for conviction is obtainable without having recourse to the testimony of the wife in the other instance not without having recourse to the testimony of the wife while the one suffers—capitally if such be the punishment—to what use with what consistency is the other to be permitted to triumph in impunity the film of prejudice once removed a very loose system of morality or rather to speak plainly a system of gross immorality will be seen to be at the bottom of these exemptive rules the very crime which it punishes in one man—punishes even with death—it affords its protection to in another it converts or seeks to convert the house of every man into a nursery of unpunishable crimes the same age of barbarism and superstition the same age of relaxed morality which gave birth to the institution of asylums gave birth there seems reason to think to this privilege which gives to each man a safe accomplice in his bosom the mischievousness of the domestic asylum goes however far beyond that of the asylum commonly so called the church churchvard or monastery whatever it was did not afford to the criminal anything like a complete exemption from all punishment it was itself a punishment it was banishment from his family it included imprisonment or a degree of confinement so close as to be scarce distinguishable from it it placed him in a state of penury humiliation and dependence a rule like this protects encourages inculcates fraud for falsehood positive falsehood is but one modification of fraud concealment a sort of negative falsehood is another i mean concealment of any facts of which for the protection of their rights individuals of     the public have a right to be informed the concealment which is authorized by the law it may be said ceases to be fraud no that it does not i mean in this case a concealment which is authorized by the substantive branch of the law cannot be fraudulent the authorization does away the fraud what is authorized is legalized criminality and legality are repugnant and incompatible but the law cannot without authorizing fraud authorize by its adjective branch the doing of that which by its substantive branch it has constituted a crime by the punishment annexed to the act by the substantive branch of the law the law has acknowledged and proclaimed its mischievousness if the act be not mischievous the legislator has no warrant for marking it out for punishment but if the act be mischievous on what ground with what consistency does it in any instance seek to exempt it from punishment as if it were innocent—exempt it in consideration of a fact purely irrelevant—a fact by which the mischievousness of it is not so much as pretended to be diminished an article of adjective law which is at variance with the substantive law is itself a fraud the substantive branch of the law declares undertakes engages for the benefit of all parties interested that all persons offending so and so shall be punished so and so the judicial authority which by a law of the adjective kind of its own making takes upon itself to exempt a man from such punishment on a ground by which his case is not varied in point of guilt violates that engagement fraudulent in itself—so far as it encourages others to pursue that plan of concealment by which the engagement is violated it is the cause of fraud in others by aggregating the act to the class of crimes and rendering it punishable as such it declares it to be a mischievous act and to such a degree so as to be a crime by authorizing an individual to conceal it in a case in which it is not so much as pretended that its mischievousness is in the smallest degree less than in other cases it at once protects and encourages two different acts of the mischievousness and criminality of which it shows itself sufficiently sensible on other occasions—the principal crime and that concealment of it which when the act so concealed is criminal is itself a crime it debases and degrades the matrimonial union converting into a sink of corruption what ought to be a source of purity it defiles the marriagecontract itself by tacking to it in secret a licence to commit crimes i say in secret for the probability is that an institution so repugnant to moral sentiments is not generally known and on that account is not productive of all the mischief of which if known universally it would be productive no care being taken to enable men to possess themselves of that knowledge on which their security in every branch of it is in a state of continual dependence—the degree of information which they actually have of it depends upon its natural aptitude for being guessed at to the knowledge of what on each head is law they have no other clue than such conception as they are led to form to themselves of what it ought to be oh but think what must be the suffering of my wife if compelled by her testimony to bring destruction on my head by disclosing my crimes—think answers the legislator yes indeed i think of it and in thinking of it what i think of besides is what you ought to think of it think of it as part of the punishment which awaits you in case of your plunging into the paths of guilt the more forcible the impression it makes upon you the more effectually it answers its intended purpose would you wish to save yourself from it it depends altogether upon yourself preserve your innocence to the legislators of antiquity the married state was an object of favour they regarded it as a security for good behaviour a wife and children were considered as being what doubtless they are in their own nature so many pledges such was the policy of the higher antiquity the policy of feudal barbarism of the ages which gave birth to this immoral rule is to convert that sacred condition into a nursery of crime the reason now given was not i suspect the original one drawn from the principle of utility though from the principle of utility imperfectly applied it savours of a late and polished age the reason that presents itself as more likely to have been the original one is the grimgribber nonsensical reason—that of the identity of the two persons thus connected baron and feme are one person in law on questions relative to the two matrimonial conditions this quibble is the fountain of all reasoning among lawyers among divines among all candidates setting up for power in a rude age working by fraud opposed to force scrambling for whatever could be picked up of the veneration and submission of the herd of mankind—there has been a sort of instinctive predilection for absurdity in its absurdest shape paradox as far as it could be forced down has always been preferred by them to simple truth he who is astonished is half subdued each absurdity you get people to swallow prepares them for a greater and another advantage is the same figure of rhetoric which commands the admiration and obedience of the subject class helps the memory of the domineering class it is a sort of memoria technica all these parodoxes all these dull witticisms have this in common—that on taking them to pieces you find wrapped up in a covering of ingenuity some foolish or knavish     and in either case pernicious lie it is by them that men are trained up in the degrading habit of taking absurdity for reason nonsense for sense it is by the swallowing of such potions that the mind of man is rendered feeble and rickety in the morning of its days to burn them all without exception in one common bonfire would be a triumph to reason and a blessing to mankind further remarks by the editor—the exclusion of the testimony of husband and wife for or against each other is in the number of the exclusions which in an article already alluded to are defended by the edinburgh review yet not entirely says the reviewer on account of that dread entertained by the english law of conjugal feuds though these are frequently of the most deadly character but the reason just given in the case of the priest applies this refers to the opinion of mr bentham that the disclosure by a catholic priest of the secrets confided to him by a confessing penitent should not be required or permitted for the confidence between married persons makes their whole conversation an unreserved confession and they also could never be contradicted but by the accused while external circumstances might be fabricated with the utmost facility to give apparent confirmation to false charges but our stronger reason is that the passions must be too much alive where the husband and wife contend in a court of justice to give any chance of fair play to the truth it must be expected as an unavoidable consequence of the connexion by which they are bound that their feelings either of affection or hatred must be strong enough to bear down the abstract regard for veracity even in judicial depositions want of space might form some excuse to this writer for not having said more but it is no apology for the vagueness and inconclusiveness of what he has said the confidence say you between married persons makes their whole conversation an unreserved confession so much the better their testimony will be the more valuable it is a strange reason for rejecting an article of evidence that it is distinguished from other articles by its fulness and explicitness the reviewer must have read mr bentham very carelessly to suppose that his reason for excluding the testimony of the priest is because the discourse of the penitent is an unreserved confession this would be a reason for admitting not for rejecting the evidence the true reason for the exclusion in the case of the confessor is that punishment attaching itself upon the discharge of a religous duty would in effect be punishment for religious opinions add to which that the confidence reposed by the criminal in his confessor has not for its object the furtherance nor the impunity of offences but for its effect as far as it goes the prevention of them to seal the lips of the wife gives a facility to crime to seal those of the confessor gives none but on the contrary induces a criminal to confide the secret of his guilt to one whose only aim will in general be to awaken him to a sense of it lastly it is to be remembered that by compelling the disclosure in the case of the confessor no information would ultimately be gained the only effect being that on the part of the criminal no such revelations would be made not so in the case of the wife who may have come to a knowledge of the crime independently of any voluntary confession by her criminal husband that the testimony of the wife could not be contradicted but by the accused person her husband and vice versâ—which if true would be a good reason for distrusting but no reason for rejecting their evidence—is in the majority of cases not true what the husband and wife have told one another in secret no one but they two can know and consequently what either of them says on the subject of it nobody but the other has it in his power to contradict but is not this likewise the case between the criminal and his accomplice or between the criminal and any other person with respect to any fact which occurred when they two were the only persons present while with respect to all other facts the testimony of husband or wife would if false be just as capable of being refuted by counterevidence as the testimony of any other witness the aphorism on which the reviewer founds what he calls his stronger reason one would not have wondered at meeting with in a german tragedy but it is certainly what one would never have looked for in a discourse upon the law of evidence strange as it may sound in sentimental ears i am firmly persuaded that many nay most married persons pass through life without either loving or hating one another to any such uncontroulable excess suppose them however to do so and their feelings whether of affection or of hatred to be strong enough to bear down the abstract regard for veracity will they in addition to this abstract regard—a curious sort of a regard—be strong enough to bear down the fear of punishment and of shame will they render the witness proof against the vigilance and acuteness of a sagacious and experienced crossexaminer or rather are not the witnesses who are under the influence of a strong passion precisely those who when skilfully dealt with are least capable of maintaining the appearance of credibility even when speaking the truth and à fortiori least likely to obtain credit for a lie but i waste time and fill up valuable space in arguing seriously against such solemn trifling—conclusion of remarks by the editor     part v view of the cases in which evidence has improperly been excluded on the double account of vexation and danger of deception chapter i impropriety of excluding the testimony of a party to the cause for or against himself of the case in which the exclusion appears to have rested on a double ground—that which respects deception and that which respects vexation—one exemplification is constituted by the case in which the testimony in question is that of a party to the cause receive his testimony at his own instance the testimony will be false and you will be deceived by it call for it at the instance of his adversary it will be hardship to him to be obliged to give it such it may be presumed are the reasons by which the exclusions put upon the evidence of a person bearing this relation to the suit have been suggested but in each instance the insufficiency of the reason has been already brought to view nor though they are applicable to the same person does the force of either make any addition to that of the other for whereever the one applies the other does not the consequence is that there is not an imaginable case in which the testimony of a party be he plaintiff or be he defendant ought to be excluded at his own instance—the reason which forbids the admission of the testimony is weaker in this case than in the case of an interested extraneous witness the real magnitude of the interest being the same in both cases—in the case of a party the interest is more palpable the objection created by it is likely to act with greater force upon the judicial faculties of the magistrate his mind is more surely open to it the danger of deception is therefore less if in so far as it operates in his own favour the testimony of the party is liable to be drawn aside from the line of truth by the action of this force which is so obvious even to the most unobservant eye—in so far as it operates in his disfavour it possesses in a degree superior to all other testimony a claim to confidence that in this case the error if any there be in the testimony is not a wilful one—is not accompanied at the same time with a knowledge of the falsity of the information and of the tendency it has to operate to the deponents prejudice—is a proposition the truth of which is far more certain in this instance than it can be in any other accordingly as often as the testimony of a party is received—so sure as it enters into the mind of any one who has to judge of it—so sure is it to be analyzed and as it were divided into two parts to the part which is regarded as operating in the deponents own favour the incredulous the diffident part of the judges mind applies itself of course while the part regarded as operating in his disfavour commands on the part of the judge an almost unlimited share of confidence in a word what portion of the mass is understood as belonging to this division is by the common sense and consent of mankind universally regarded as the best evidence such is the evidence of which on the ideal supposition of extraordinary vexation the rashness of a certain class of jurists has not hesitated to rob the treasury of justice†     a party is not suffered to be examined on his own behalf observe the consequence he is delivered without mercy into the hands of a mendacious witness on the other side your adversary to make evidence for a suit he means to bring against you sends an emissary to you to engage you in a conversation that when called upon as a witness he may impute confessions to you such as you never made when the evidence comes to be given at the trial the witness tells what story he pleases as for you you must not open your mouth to contradict him although were you admitted to state what passed it might be in your power to satisfy the judge that the account given of the conversation by the witness could not possibly have been true if instead of sending his agent the plaintiff had gone with him his testimony it is true would have been excluded as well as yours in words here is a sort of reciprocity but in effect no such thing the plaintiff has no need to tell his own story he has his witness by the supposition a partial and even corrupt one to tell it for him the plaintiff instead of being a sufferer by the exclusion put upon himself is a gainer by it understand where his plan of defence is dishonest as it is here supposed to be in his spontaneous examination he would have had the advantage it is true of joining his witness in the concerted lie but in their crossexamination being kept out of each others hearing for that purpose they might have been brought to contradict one another and thus the lie might have been discovered on this occasion as on so many others mutato nomine the law departs from its own principles the same evidence which it refuses to hear at one time in a cause called by one name it admits at another time in a cause called by another name but the repentance comes too late for justice in the original cause the corrupt witness things being as in the case above supposed stands up uncontradicted and carries his point in another cause if the injured plaintiff has courage and money to venture upon it—in a derivative cause growing out of the original one—in an indictment brought against the perjured witness for the perjury—the mouth of the corrupt witness now converted into a defendant is stopped while that of the quondum plaintiff now called a prosecutor and under that name a witness in his own cause without difficulty is opened here there are two causes one after another in each of which the judge hears but on one side instead of a single cause in which he might have heard on both sides not even     by this second cause—supposing the truth to come out and the judge to be satisfied about it—is it in his power to do justice for in this second cause nothing more can be done than the convicting the perjured witness of the perjury to do justice to the party injured by the perjury there must be a third cause of the same denomination as the first and this is what justice gets by the care taken to defend the wisdom of the judge from deception and the feelings of the parties from vexation by a rampart of excluding rules the man of law is satisfied because suits are multiplied but where is the satisfaction to the injured suitor and to justice another circumstance concurs in rendering the remedy still more inadequate in the prosecution for the perjury conviction ought not to take place and naturally will not take place without the degree of persuasion commencement to the punishment attached to so high a crime whereas in the original nonpenal suit any the slightest degree of preponderant probability would have been sufficient to turn the scale on this head correspond with english law roman law with all its faults distinguishes itself to great advantage in simplicity though absolutely imperfect it is relatively transcendant in his own favour—that is at his own instance—it suffers not the testimony of any party of any person at least whom it recognises in that character to be received and thus far it does wrong but in his own disfavour that is at the instance of his adversary or of the judge in the case of inquisitorial procedure the testimony of the party is in every case received and allowed to be called for and thus far it does right as to admissibility there is no such irrelevant and indefinable distinction as that between civil and criminal the only difference is that in a case recognised as a criminal case the testimony of the defendant is called for of course and in the first instance—whereas in a case recognised as a civil that is a noncriminal case—though the testimony of each party may be called for by the other—unless called for by the opposite party it is not called for or received by the judge it is to english law that we must look for modification upon modification and that confusion and inconsistency with the delectable and evercherished intricacy which where there is but one straight course is the necessary consequence courts upon courts each in this part of the field proceeding and judging by a different set of rules as if the suitors were human creatures in some one of them and beings of a different composition in the other harmonious disagreement all tending to one common end which shall we take for the general rule for elucidations sake let it be the rule of exclusion the rather as being consigned to one of those latin maxims which though in universal currency express with equal infidelity both what is the practice and what ought to be—nemo debet esse testis in propriâ causâ taking this for the general rule we shall find it cut into by exceptions upon exceptions and that in each of the two parts into which we have seen it dividing itself this for the rule with regard to the admission of the partys testimony in his own behalf next with regard to the compulsory extraction of it in behalf and at the instance of the other party comes another latin maxim the absurdity of which has already been fully exposed—nemo tenetur scipsum accusare chapter ii examination of the course pursued in regard to the plaintiffs testimony by english law §   plaintiffs testimony in what cases receivable in his own behalf inconsistencies of english law in this respect among the inviolable rules of english jurisprudence one of the most inviolable is this that no man understand at his own instance is to be a witness in his own cause like other inviolables it is continually violated let us observe the violations and the contrivances by which they are reconciled to the rule in the first place in all causes that are called criminal and more especially capital ones the plaintiff is admitted in cases of this class supposing deception to take place the mischief of it is at its maximum the plaintiff is called prosecutor by this change of name he is divested of all bias—no less effectually than if it was by a little seal a broad seal or a sceptre† oh but at any rate the prosecutor has no pecuniary interest and pecuniary interest is the only sort of interest which in the opinion of an english lawyer can produce any bias in the mind indeed but he has a pecuniary interest as substantial a one in these criminal cases as he can have in any civil i e noncriminal case in theft and other cases of criminal depredation   0 it would be too much to say precisely which—a book might be written upon it the prosecutor upon whose testimony the thief is convicted gets back the stolen goods and that by an almost unexampled exertion of summary justice without the expense of an additional suit in forgery he does or does not by the same means make good his damage but here if he does there must be another suit for it †in assaults in case of success money may visit him in either of two shapes instead of being fined the money going to the green wax—that is to the kings private purse the defendant may be sent to talk with the prosecutor or being fined a part of the fine it must not exceed a third party may be put openly into the prosecutors pocket‡ upon affidavit evidence introduced by a motion for an attachment or by a polite circumlocution that the defendant may answer the matters of the affidavit causes of a pecuniary nature are tried every day in all the courts no sooner is the cause intituled the king against such a one but care must be taken that the title be not put upon it too soon than the cause becomes a criminal one and the money by which the plaintiff would otherwise have been turned into a liar and the judges deceived loses all its influence one thing is clear enough—to any one at least whose eyes are not closed by science—viz that £ 0 is not made less than £ 0 by being given under the name of costs therefore—of whatever nature may be the satisfaction pecuniary vindictive or honorary∥ the prospect of which is the motive that gave birth to the suit—if reimbursement partial as it is at best under the name of costs be among the consequences of success in the suit the interest of it is of a kind as strictly pecuniary as it is in the power of money to create in actions not comprehended under the denomination of penal ones the exclusion put upon the evidence of the party provided always there is but one is no less in effect as well as design inexorable than in design it is in penal actions in the case we have just been viewing the extensive case of injuries to person—the same individual who suing by a civil action and called plaintiff would not be heard suing by an indictment or information and calling himself prosecutor is admitted without difficulty but so long as the words employed are action and plaintiff the difficulty is insurmountable the judge inexorable to the admissibility of the prosecutor in the capacity of a witness there is however one remarkable exception there is a class of offences in regard to which how noxious soever to the public that is to say to any or every individual no one individual can be found who unless by accident has any interest capable of engaging him to take upon himself the expense and vexation attached to the function of prosecutor in all these cases either a fastitions interest must be created or the offence go unpunished and society fall to pieces accordingly in cases of this description as often as by the prohibition and punishment attached to it by the legislature an act was created into an offence rewards were offered to the individual by whose exertions the conditions necessary to the infliction of the punishment should be fulfilled in the whole or in part the punishment was put into a pecuniary shape and termed a penalty the penalty in case of success or a part of it constituted the remuneration of this temporary servant of the public costs—that is a reimbursement never more than partial of expenses of suit under that name were added or not added according as the lawyer by whom the legislator was led happened for this purpose to be faithful or treacherous awake or asleep what on this occasion as on all others was the care of the man of law was that rules of law should be observed what on this occasion as on others was no part of his care was that offences should be prevented it was decided therefore that the testimony of a witness of this sort—a witness who in case of conviction expected to receive the penalty or any part of it—was bad that is to say inadmissible had the person to whom the reward was offered been allowed to earn it by giving his testimony he would have committed perjury judge and jury would constantly have been deceived by the perjury and so instead of the guilty punishment would have fallen upon the innocent how so for this plain reason because the suit     was called civil and in a suit denominated civil the plaintiff is called plaintiff whatsoever else the king may get by the suit what he does not get by it is the title of plaintiff which consequently finding no other place to rest on rests upon the shoulders of him by whom the function is performed all instances of the exclusion of witnesses on prosecutions for offences created by statute are acts of usurpation committed by the judicial authority against the legislative but in the case of the exclusion of informers the usurpation is more particularly flurrant—i had almost said impudent the legislature beckons a man into court the judge shuts the door in his face all this while unless those who know of an offence tell of it it cannot be punished and unless those who know of it are paid for telling of it they will not tell of it this the legislature is convinced of and therefore offers money for the telling of it the legislature satisfied that without a factitious inducement a man who has not the interest of revenge to prompt him will not subject himself to the trouble expense and odium of bringing to punishment an offender whose offence how prejudicial soever to the public produces no mischief that comes home in the shape of suffering to any particular individual—orders that a reward to a certain amount shall be given by the judges to him by whom the information requisite for that purpose shall have been given when the man comes for his reward the judges refuse to give it him why is it that it was not the will of the legislature he should have it no but because the will of the legislature is contrary to their rules such are the effects political and moral of these excluding rules breach of faith as towards individuals—breach of obedience as towards the legislature it is among the maxims of men of law that no man ought to be suffered to be wiser than themselves but unless many men had been wiser as well as more honest than themselves society would long ago have gone to wreck the maintenance of society has all along depended upon the evasion of this rule of law society exists therefore the rule has been evaded the intention of the judges was to defeat the intentions of the legislature individuals by defeating the intention of the judges have rendered to the public that service which it was their object to prevent and to the legislature that obedience on which the preservation of society depends if the man who saw the offence committed has nothing to get by telling of it he is an unexceptionable witness but having nothing to get by telling of it he has no inducement to engage him to tell it and as telling of it in the character of a testifying witness at a distance from home and under a certainty of being baited by lawyers is attended with both vexation and expense he has just so much inducement to prevent him from telling it one of two things either the man who on these occasions appears in the character of an uninterested witness and upon being interrogated declares himself upon oath to be uninterested is really an interested one or he acts without a motive—the effect is produced without a cause as often as the effect can be produced without a cause they are willing these men of science that it shall be produced they are willing these upright ministers of justice and patterns of constitutional obedience that the will of their superior the legislator shall be done as often as the effect cannot be produced without a cause their determination is that it shall not be produced and that the will of the legislator shall remain undone—that the law which they are sworn to execute shall remain unexecuted but they have a reason for what they do and it is this—to gain twenty pounds a man will speak the truth by coming and speaking the truth he will lend his exertions to give execution to the laws—therefore for the some price he will be ready to commit perjury yonder man cut the throat of a pig the other day for sixpence therefore he would cut the throat of his brother for the same price such is the logic of these lawyers that by this logic and this wisdom perjury was ever prevented in any one instance seems not in the smallest degree probable that by the same exertions it has in many instances been produced seems in the highest degree probable by what contrivance the existence of the interest can be denied in words in such manner as to save the witness from the danger of legal conviction—what expedient is in these cases most usually relied on and upon occasion employed—i do not undertake for it is not necessary to know as promising a one as any appears to be this in the present cause in which i am plaintiff you give me your testimony gratis in the next cause you will be plaintiff and then it will fall to my share to return the accommodation another arrangement may be this—the only man who knows of the transgression is forbid to tell of it true but the prohibition does not extend to those who know nothing about the matter well then when a man who means to earn the reward comes to me a b an attorney to know how he is to get it this is the way in which we will settle it between us though he must not tell the judge in the first instance—though he must not put in for the reward since if he did     the judges would not let him give the evidence which he must give to earn it—this will be no hindrance to me who have no evidence to give let him then tell me the story and i or what will do as well john doe will put the story into grimgribber to make it intelligible to the judge when the trial comes on the witness tells the story when execution comes i pocket the reward the witness cannot receive a penny of it but i am a man of honour and too generous to suffer a good witness to be a sufferer by the time he has expended in the public service is interest in reality cleared away by this manœuvre are effects produced without causes as the sages of the bench intended they should be produced is the selfpurgative oath which must be swallowed upon occasion by the witness nothing whose than an equivocation pure from the taint of perjury this will depend upon the skill and attention of the preceptor and the capabilities of the pupil in the first instance the laws turned into a dead letter by the precipitancy of a judicial rule in the next place something to say the least nearly approaching to perjury the constant result of their connivance at the evasions put upon their own rules which is the worst—the disorder or the remedy as the rule which admits the evidence of the plaintiff when called a prosecutor is not without exceptions so neither is the rule which excludes the evidence of the plaintiff when called a plaintiff one exception—a very colossus of inconsistency—stares us in the face and figures in all the books a statute had been made entitling a traveller to receive compensation at the expense of the hundred in case of his being robbed between sun and sun a decision was pronounced by which in this one instance the inviolable rule was violated and the party the plaintiff in an action on this ground was admitted to support his demand upon the district by his own evidence the word given by way of reason was necessity—unless this evidence be admitted the law will fail of its effect it is difficult to see on what ground to rest the passing of this statute was it to excite the hundreders to vigilance was it to dissipate the loss by breaking it down into impalpable portions upon the principle of insurances the first conception is altogether visionary and the second is in repugnancy to it be this as it may obedience to the legislator is always laudable and especially on the part of a judge but for beginning the practice of admitting the plaintiffs evidence it seems difficult to imagine a case in which the demand for the exertion could have been less or the danger more formidable even without any view to protection more journeys are taken in company than in solitude in this case it would have been easier than in a thousand others that might be mentioned for a man to provide himself with preappointed evidence to carry a witness with him might be attended with expense to show to a friend the contents of his purse at starting would involve no expense one circumstance fills up the measure of absurdity conceive the whole number of rateable inhabitants in the hundred escorting the traveller the whole time he employed in traversing it the traveller swears he was robbed the hundreders swear he was not for they were with him all the time the one really interested witness would command the verdict the five hundred nominally interested but really not interested witnesses would not be suffered to open their mouths absurd as the admission is in a relative i mean not to hold it up as such in an absolute point or view under favour of such encouragement here and there a case has probably happened in which a trandulent demand has been made on this ground not impossibly a successful one but from the station which such a law supported by such a decision still maintains in the statute book a pregnant proof is surely afforded were all others wanting how little the interests of truth and justice would have to apprehend from the unreserved admission of the partys testimony in his own favour in any imaginable case equity presents a different scene for the same mode of searching after the truth is good or bad according as in speaking of it you pronounce the words common law or equity     ask an equity lawyer ask any lawyer he will tell you without difficulty and without exception that in equity the testimony of the plaintiff never is admitted no not in any case whatever thus much certainly is true that it never is admitted to any good purpose but thus much is no less time that it is admitted to every bad purpose here on this occasion the arrangement we set out with is unavoidably departed from striving in behalf of existing establishments to find as far as possible for everything an honest reason—a reason referable to the ends of justice—i set out with taking the fear of producing deception and the fear of producing vexation as the causes of the existing arrangements but here both principles of arrangement fail us altogether the phenomena as we see and feel them will be effects without a cause if anything but the pursuit of the spurious ends of judicature the ends really pursued in the formation of the technical system the professional interests had been in view and aimed at in the first place to consider the testimony of the plaintiff as proffend by himself for the purpose of the ultimate decision—for the purpose of giving termination to the suit it is not admitted why lest peradventure the suit should be brought to an untimely end but for the purpose of giving commencement to the suit the testimony of this same party is admitted and here last groundless demands should be excluded and malâ fide suits prevented by the fear of punishment as for perjury that punishment is taken off and the mendacitylicence which we have seen constituting the basis of the technical system of procedure in the commonlaw branch of it is extended to this pretended purer branch the equity branch in the instruments by which suits are commenced in the way of common law the mendacity could be and accordingly was cloaked to a certain degree by the generality of the terms to the equity branch this cloak could not be extended for neither the grounds of demand nor the services demanded at the hands of the judge having been put into any sort of method not even that wretched method into which the matter of common law has been shaken by the fortuitous concourse of atoms a particular story required in every instance to be told a court of equity being a shop at which for the accommodation of those for whose purposes the delays sold by the commonlaw courts are not yet sufficient ulterior delays are sold to every man who is content to pay the price suits are every day instituted in the equity courts by men who themselves are as perfectly conscious of being in the wrong as it is possible for man to be a man who owes a sum of money which it is not agreeable to him to pay fights the battle as long as he can on the ground of common law and when he has no more ground to stand upon he applies to a court of equity to stop the proceedings in the commonlaw court and the equity court stops them of course among the uses therefore of a court of equity one is to prevent justice from being done by a court of common law there are many men who though they have no objection to reap the profit of falsehood would not be content to bear the shame of it notwithstanding the suspension put upon all punishment—legal punishment by the mendacitylicence above mentioned the feer of shame would be apt to stare a man in the face if after reading a story composed more or less of facts which he knew to be false it were necessary for him to adopt them and make himself known for a bar by his signature accordingly care has been taken that no such unpleasant obligation shall be unposed the story is settled between two of his professional assistants his attorney in equity language his solicitor and his counsel as for the complinant himself for so in equity the plaintiff is called the orator for so in the same language he is made to call himself what is probable is that he does not—what is certain is that he need not—ever set eyes on the story thus told under his name such as the seed is such will the harvest be even when the plaintiff is in the right his bill such is the name given to his story is a great part of it to the knowledge of every body a tissue of falsehoods the great judge who knows better than to administer equity unless a composition of this complexion has in regular form been delivered in at the proper office knows it so to be it is accordingly a settled maxim with him that no credit is to be given to anything that is put into a bill falsehood in equity as well as common law—falsehood every equity draughtsman is ready to tell you is necessary to justice accordingly if through delicacy which never happens or from some other cause which frequently happens the attorney and the counsel between them fail of inserting the requisite quantum of falsehoods no equity is to be had till the deficiency has been supplied to assert in positive terms a fact concerning which a man is in a state of ignorance is to assert a falsehood and if there be such a thing as a lie it is a lie a lie of this sort a court of equity exacts from every plaintiff as a condition precedent to his learning from the pen of the defendant what it happens to be necessary for him to know thus then stands the practice with regard to the admission of the plaintiffs testimony considered as delivered at his own instance for the purpose of justice it is not admitted to the effect of vexation and expense and for the purpose of the profit extracted out of the     expense it is admitted—admitted and exacted nor need he entertain the smallest hope for justice unless to swell the account of profitable expense this testimony such as it is is stuffed with falsehoods the real purpose of equity procedure will be seen standing in a still more conspicuous point of view when we come to consider how far under the rules of the same courts admission is given to the testimony of the plaintiff when called for at the instance and consequently with a view to the advantage of the defendant §   plaintiffs testimony in what cases compellable at the instance of the defendant inconsistencies of english law in this respect the plaintiff is he compellable to testify against himself—to testify at the instance of the defendant under this remaining head as under the former let us observe in the first place how the matter stands at common law in cases called criminal cases at the trial the plaintiff we have seen is under the name of prosecutor always a witness at his own instance and consequently for himself frequently the sole witness when in this way he has been testifying for himself the defendant in virtue of the right of crossexamination possesses the faculty of causing him to testify against himself that the plaintiff should be called upon to testify by the defendant in the first instance is what can never happen at least never does happen expecting the plaintiff the prosecutor to come forward and testify of course pro interresse suo it can scarcely occur to the defendant that is to the professional assistants of the defendant to call for his attendance in the defendants name in those criminal cases in which as above there is but one inquiry and that inquiry carried on if the contradiction may be allowed by uninterrogated evidence neither party saying any more than he thinks fit—the plaintiff in particular is not compellable to say anything at the defendants instance here again however to place the case in a correct point of view the distinction between compulsion ab extrà and compulsion ab intrà must be called in the prosecutor is not any more than the defendant compellable at the instance of the adversary by the fear of any collateral punishment like an extraneous witness the prosecutor as well as the defendant is impelled by the interest he has at stake in the cause to say everything that he can say with safety in support of the interest he has in the cause so far then as the defendant in his affidavit says anything that can operate to his own exculpation this defence is a sort of call though an indirect call upon the prosecutor to bring forward any further facts if he has any which he can advance with safety that promise to operate in refutation of such defence the facts thus brought forward in reply—at whose instance are they brought forward at the defendants if at anybodys but in whose favour do they operate as certainly in the prosecutors and his only are there any that if brought forward would operate to the advantage of the defendant—to the disadvantage of himself so surely as he knows of any such so surely does he keep them all to himself so far from being called upon for them by particular interrogation he is not so much as called upon for them by the general terms of his oath before a jury the deponent being an extraneous witness the oath says—the evidence you are about to give shall be the whole truth as well as nothing but the truth the contents of this your affidavit are true says the person by whom the oath is administered to a deponent on the occasion when he is said to make affidavit correctness is stipulated for how ill soever secured completeness absunce of partial imperfection is not so much as stipulated for such is the form the only form in which the judges i speak of that class of which learning is the exclusive attribute will suffer testimony to be delivered to them when the decision grounded on it is to be framed by themselves in the case of those accessory and most commonly redundant inquiries which in indictments and informations precede or follow that principal one which is called the trial—the testimony being likewise in the form of affidavit evidence falls in like manner under the last preceding observations so likewise in the case of those comparatively summary causes in which though ranked under the head of civil causes the suit—instead of commencing by a declaration delivered in at an office and never looked at by the judge—commences by a motion i e by a speech made to the judge in open court by an advocate in the case of the examinations by which in felonious and peacebreaking offences the trial is preceded inquiries performed by a justice of the peace the obligation of the prosecutor to testify at the instance of the defendant and thence to the disadvantage of his own cause stands on the same footing as at the trial as above in a nearly similar though not exactly the same predicament stands the exparte inquiry which in all suits prosecuted by indictment is carried on in secret before the grand jury antecedently to the trial no     defendant being there nor any person on his behalf the plaintiff cannot be compelled to testify at the defendants instance but at the instance of any one of those his judges the prosecutor—whole occupied in delivering his testimony at his own instance and consequently to the advantage of his side of the cause—may and frequently does by questions put to him by any of those judges find himself under the obligation of disclosing what may operate to the disadvantage of it such counterinterrogation has the effect of crossexamination in so far as the zeal and probity of the judge alone may be considered as an adequate succedaneum to that same zeal and probity added to the interested zeal of the party the defendant whose safety is at stake let us next suppose the case civil and the procedure still at common law viz by action principal or sole inquiry the trial on this occasion unless the plaintiff by any of the expedients above spoken of has contrived to deliver his own testimony in his own favour the defendant cannot by the single powers of common law draw upon that same source for any testimony which he on his part may stand in need of but if the plaintiff has contrived in any such way to give himself the benefit of his own testimony the defendant in virtue of the right of crossexamination may also put in for his share in general therefore at common law the defendant has no means of obtaining the benefit of the plaintiffs testimony in no case without the consent of his adversary nor then but at the adversarys own instance and by the adversarys own contrivance that is in no case but where in all probability and at any rate in the opinion of his adversary the plaintiff it will be of no use to him i said by the single powers of common law the limitative clause was necessary for in certain cases though nobody knows exactly what cases by the assistance of a court of equity the testimony of either of two persons about to appear in the characters of plaintiff and defendant at common law may be extracted at the instance and for the benefit of the other to the extent therefore of the aggregate whatever it be of these cases concerning which quære quære et in æternum quære the objection to the admission the forced admission of the plaintiffs testimony has for its psychological cause—not the fear of deception not the fear of producing vexation viz excessive and preponderant vexation but if vexation must be mentioned the fear of not producing enough of it but as the draft drawn upon the breast of the adversary for evidence is more apt much more apt to be drawn by that of one of the two parties who institutes the suit than by the other who is dragged into it—the consideration of this mode of making holes in the door shut against the light of evidence will be considered to more advantage when the defendants side of the cause comes under review thus much for common law we come now to equity law the testimony of the plaintiff is it allowed in these courts to be delivered at the instance and thence for the benefit of the defendant not it indeed but why not because if it was the man of law in all his forms would lose the benefit of a second cause the delay vexation and expense of a suit at common law is not enough for him the delay vexation and expense of an equity suit coming upon the back of a commonlaw suit is not enough for him—there must be a second equity suit—or so it will be in many instances the facts in the case will be but half brought out—will have been brought out only on one side there must be what is called a cross cause commenced by a cross bill in which the plaintiff and defendant change sides and the same individual on whose testimony not a single fact was deemed fit to be believed is now believed and believed to such a degree that the testimony of a disinterested witness by whom his testimony should be contradicted would tell as nothing the judge would not so much as stay to inquire which of the two testimonies the interested or the disinterested seemed most deserving of credit but would ground his decree upon the interested testimony just as if the disinterested had never been received in this particular so far as extortion and denial of justice are improvements the english edition of the roman system of procedure is no small improvement on the continental edition to judge of it at least by the practice in french law in french law in the course of one and the same suit though neither party is supposed to deliver his testimony at his own instance each party obtains the testimony of the other the old french law with all its plagues the french modification of the technical system inclosed no such curse as that of two sets of courts each operating with powers kept imperfect that assistance and obstruction may be obtained from the interposition of the other the inquiry which in the english system occupies three suits—one commonlaw and two equity suits—was in the french system dispatched in one     even under the english edition of the roman system—in that division which in virtue of a connexion already become obsolete goes still by the whimsical name of ecclesiastical law—more honesty or more shame has been preserved than thus to make two grievances out of one in the courts called ecclesiastical as in french law in all the courts in the course of one and the same cause i speak of causes nonpenal each party obtains the testimony of the other chapter iii examination of the course pursued in regard to the defendants testimony by english law §   defendants testimony in what cases receivable in his own behalf inconsistencies of english law in this respect we come next to speak of the case where the suit as before not affecting more than one party on each side the party whose testimony is in question is the defendant is the testimony of the defendant admitted at his own instance here as before the answer will be different according to the species of the suit i e whether it be criminal or civil and it civil whether the theatre be a court of common law a court of equity or an ecclesiastical court and whatever be the suit according to the stage of the cause i e which inquiry it is of the several inquiries which the species of suit admits of where it admits of more than one   case criminal procedure at common law i in this case as in that of the plaintiff in the first place let the cause be a criminal one mode of procedure by indictment inquiry the principal one—the trial at the trial is a defendant allowed to deliver his own testimony at his own instance and consequently in his own favour to his own advantage no and yes no in words yes in effect in words no for in that station let a man say what he will it is not evidence no oath can be administered to him lest if that security for veracity were applied it might have the effect of confining his statements his nonevidentiary statements within the pale of truth which would be inconvenient not so much as a question can be put to him by anybody not by his own advocate if he be rich enough to have one not by that advocate on the side of the prosecution not even by the judge by being circumstantiated distinct complete and methodical his statement if true might be seen to be so if false or incomplete might be made to appear so which again according to established legal notions of inconvenience would be inconvenient in effect yes for so long as it is not called evidence—nor subjected to any of those processes by which evidence is purged or endeavoured to be purged of its deceptitious qualities—he may say whatever he chooses to say under the name of his defence as to the judges ad hoc—the jury with the uniform degree of suspicion naturally called forth by the view of the situation in which they see him placed added to the variable degree of suspicion called forth by the evidence that has been delivered on the other side they form their judgment of the trustworthiness of this nonevidentiary statement taking into account at the same time its consistency or inconsistency with itself and with such relevant faces as are of themselves sufficiently notorious without evidence what they do think about in judging of this statement is its trustworthiness or persuasive force intrinsic and extrinsic as above what they do not think about in judging of it is the kiss that has not been given to the book for as to any security that may be supposed to be given by any such kiss for the truth of the assertion or the performance of the engagement supposed to be sanctioned by it the absence of it cannot be a secret to any one of them who to get out of the box so much the sooner has joined in a verdict of not quilty in favour of a defendant of whose guilt he was at that time persuaded in his own mind no counterinterrogation will the absence of this security for correctness and completeness present itself to a juryman as a reason for paying no regard to what he hears yes when their learned directors cease to receive affidavit evidence—uninterrogated evidence to the exclusion of interrogated evidence in offences of the rank of felony the case is comparatively so rare in which a man in that unhappy situation has anything plausible to say for himself especially in the character of testimony that comparatively speaking the operation of this nonevidentiary sort of testimony seldom presents itself to view   case criminal as before is the mode of procedure by information the chance which a defendant has of profiting in this way by his own testimony will not be essentially different but his situation not being in this case so apt to attract the compassion of the public as in the other—the quantity of suffering to which he stands exposed not being so great as in those cases which occupy the largest space in the list of indictments the defectiveness of his claim to have his nonevidentiary statement received on the footing of evidence will not be so apt to pass without remark moreover among indictments a considerable     number will always be pauper causes ninetenths at least of the cases which come on in the way of indictment are cases of depredation and these have almost all of them either by statute or by jurisprudential law been promoted to the rank of felomes by pauper causes i mean here such wherein the defendant is not rich enough to engage an advocate having no one to speak for him on the part of a jury there will naturally be the more readiness to hear a poor culprit speak for himself besides in felonies the tongue of the defendants advocate when there is one is but half let loose questions—interrogations and counterinterrogations for the extraction of testimony—he is allowed to put statements or observations on the evidence it is not allowed to him to make indictments especially in cases of felony by far the most numerous class of indictable cases are therefore many of them pauper causes but informations are none of them pauper causes a principal recommendation of this mode of prosecution as compared with indictment being the property it possesses of loading the parties with an extra mass of expense—the enormity of which has no connexion with the merits—which being never held up to view in the sentence is of no use in the way of example and has no other effect than that of impoverishing the suitor and enriching the man of law   case criminal as before mode of procedure by attachment principal or sole inquiry if inquiry it may be called where there are no questions by receipt of affidavit evidence here all discrimination all subterfuge is at an end so long as he is not checked by any such inconvenient curb as that of counterinterrogation and on condition of his taking the pen of an attorney to speak through instead of his own lips or rather on condition of his setting his hand to sign what the attorney has said of him and instead of him—for in affidavit evidence the deponent never speaks for himself let his designation be what it may extraneous witness or party plaintiff or defendant his testimony is received with equal deference interested or not interested perjured or unperjured—thus introduced all doors and all ears are open to the testifier when an exclusion is put upon testimony the objection is nominally and ostensibly to the station of the proposed deponent—really and at bottom to the shape in which the testimony is presented give but this shape to the testimony—a shape to the purposes of justice the most unsuitable to their own purposes the most profitable—learned gentlemen on this occasion pay no more regard to their own rules—their own most sacred and fundamental rules—than on this and all occasions they pay unless it be for the purpose of contravention to the ends of justice   these same observations apply of course and with equal force to all that multitudinous and most extensive list of cases in which to the exclusion of all better evidence testimony is received in this unquestioned and thence most questionable shape†   in re criminali—on indictments on occasion of the supplemental inquiry on informations on the preliminary as well as on the supplemental inquiry   in civili—at common law and equity law in all motion causes on the sole inquiry   in the sort of motion causes called petitions—causes relative to the estates of bankrupts‡ and heard by the highest equity judge in a mode that by its summariness forms the most striking contrast to the regular equity mode—on the inquiry which in that unusually important class of cases also is the only one   on the occasion of all those incidental applications which be the cause where it may and what it may are received in the course of the cause and for which the occasion has been manufactured in such abundance and with such successful industry   procedure by indictment as before inquiry the preliminary one the examination as it is called before the sort of judge called a justice of the peace acting singly on this occasion—there being or not being as yet a person established under the name of prosecutor in the station and function of plaintiff—the testimony of the defendant in relation to himself is called for by the judge called for from that commanding station—the occasion and the station of the respondent being more or less perilous—for the most part if he be guilty as in most instances he is it comes from him with reluctance but while what he thus wishes to withhold is extracted from him against his wishes—whatever his wishes prompt him to deliver at the same time pours itself out of course at the same gate what he thus advances on his own behalf is it or is it not evidence once more yes and no yes to the purpose of the question whether he shall be subjected or no to ulterior prosecution     and for that purpose consigned to imprisonment for safe custody no to the purpose of the question guilty or not guilty the question to be decided at the trial yes in the first case in effect no in both cases in words   procedure by indictment as before inquiry the preliminary one before the grand jury on the occasion of this partial and secret inquiry the presence of the defendant being neither compelled nor admitted his testimony as well at his own instance as at the instance of his adversary or the judge is out of the question ii civil cases at common law case a civil one procedure in the way of action inquiry the principal one the trial the only one except the sham inquiry composed of the pleadings—the inquiry carried on by lawyers on both sides for the benefit of themselves and their superiors and protectors by reciprocal effusions of falsehood of vague assertion and nonsense poured out under the mendacitylicence without the signature and as to details without so much as the privity of the suitors who are made to pay for it on the occasion of the trial occasion has been taken to delineate the plaintiff appearing in disguise in causes of this class in the character of an extraneous witness admitted in that character in spite of technical rules and principles to employ his own testimony in the support of his own claims in this advantage the defendant has no means of sharing at the trial he is not shut out because nobody is shut out but at the trial speak he must not not in his own character nor is there a crevice through which he can creep in to speak in any assumed one speak indeed he may if mere speaking will content him without speaking to any purpose for in cases of this class defendant and plaintiff standing on even ground and without any nook for compassion real or hypocritical to plant itself upon and cry hear him hear him whatever he may if he have courage insist upon saying will be watched by men with sieves in their hands and whatever testimony he may take upon him to throw in along with his matter of argument and observations will be carefully separated and forbidden to be lodged in the budget of evidence one case there is which for its oddity as well as its inconsistency and absurdity is worth observing this is the case of a mandamus† like an attachment a mandamus is a writ of a special nature like an attachment this writ is not to be had without asking for in open court and it is by affidavit evidence that on this as on all other occasions the application is supported and opposed in the case of the attachment the writ is directed to the sheriff and commands him to seize the body of the defendant and do with it he knows how in the case of the mandamus it is addressed to the party the defendant but the curious circumstance and that which brings it under the present head is this—when once the writ is issued not only the testimony of the defendant is admitted but no other evidence is admitted when admitted it is admitted not only without the check of counterinterrogation but without so much as the sanction of an oath and in this shape still less trustworthy than even that of affidavit evidence it is not only admitted but made conclusive‡     iii civil cases in equity law in equity procedure the case of a defendant proffering his own testimony without its having been called for on the part of the plaintiff can never happen a suit in equity never commencing in any other way than by an instrument called a bill in which the plaintiff calls for the defendants testimony after so much as has been said it surely cannot require in this place any fresh argument to prove that no real service can be done to the interests of truth and justice by taking or attempting to take each mans testimony by halves cutting out of it whatever part of the facts happen to operate to his advantage—retaining such only as are supposed on the other side to operate to his disadvantage but for the purpose of illustration the consequences of the attempt as conducted may not be undeserving of notice though neither party is permitted at his own instance to bring to light among the facts that have come to his knowledge such as appear to him to operate in his own favour—each party has in a greater or less degree the opportunity of bringing to view those same facts in the event and through the means of the interrogation which may be administered to him by the other but on what depends the defendants chance of bringing to light the whole or any part of such of the facts that come to his knowledge as appear to him to operate in his own favour not upon the merits of his cause—not upon the truth or importance of these same facts—but in the first place and in some degree upon the dexterity of his professional assistant in coupling the facts of the one description with those of the other in the next place absolutely and conclusively upon the pleasure upon the accidental circumstances and exigencies of the situation of his adversary the plaintiff coupled with the sagacity and judgment displayed by the professional assistants on that side in their endeavours to turn to the advantage of their client the views of the law of the facts brought to view by the defendant let those which operate in his favour be ever so true and ever so important not one of them will the judge ever hear of if such of the facts as operate to his prejudice are testified by such other evidence as in the judgment of the advisers of the plaintiff are sufficiently conclusive so that as to all facts derivable from that source the chance which they have of operating with such weight as is their due upon the mind of the judge depends not either upon their truth or their importance but upon the will and pleasure of a party who the juster the claim is to admission is so much the more strongly engaged by interest to refuse it §   defendants testimony in what cases compellable at the instance of the plaintiff inconsistencies of english law in this respect the testimony of the defendant is it compelled at the instance of the plaintiff   case criminal procedure at common law      case criminal procedure by indictment or information inquiry the principal one the trial on this occasion no compulsion direct or indirect not so much as a question permitted to be asked the defendant as already stated says what he pleases in his own behalf tells consequently as often as being guilty he says anything in the way of testimony a  00 false and imperfect story not a question is to be put that can tend to the correction or completion of it our business here is with the fact the actual state of the law with reference to the ends of justice what the consequence is has been already brought to view to the guilty nothing but impunity and triumph to the innocent nothing but danger and inconvenience it is not that no testimony is to be received from this same source on the contrary any testimony is received that either has come from it or though untruly has been said to come from it any testimony so the purport or pretended purport of it be but delivered through the medium of another pair of lips—delivered in the shape of hearsay evidence—is received unsworn uninterrogated if inaccurate uncorrected if imperfect uncompleted here then comes the oftenpresented question followed by the as oftenreturned answer the testimony of the defendant at a criminal trial is it compellable no and yes no in the most trustworthy shape yes in an egregiously untrustworthy one blessed tenderness encouragement to the guilty injury to the innocent resolving itself into a predilection for bad evidence   inquiries of all sorts sole principal supplemental preliminary in criminali in civili on the principal point on incidental points performed by the receipt of affidavit evidence in regard to admissibility at the will of the defendant and consequently in his favour how the matter stands has been seen already but—when coupled with the consequences that have been made to follow upon silence—admission permission is compulsion every assertion contained in the affidavit of the plaintiff or of any extraneous witness testifying in this way in his behalf—every such assertion so it be not irrelevant is in effect a question though a leading a suggestive one deny the fact or you will be considered as affirming it as confessing it but the mass of assertions contained in the plaintiffs affidavit though a sort of succedaneum to a string of interrogatories is a constantly imperfect and inadequate one the interrogatories if such they may be termed delivered uno flatu not arising out of the answers the silent virtual confession returned to some of the questions smothered by the responses satisfactory or evasive distinct or indistinct given to others to display in detail the imperfections inherent in the nature of affidavit evidence belongs not to this place it has been done in a former book thus much may suffice to warrant the introduction of the already presented question followed by the ambiguous answer which there is such frequent occasion to subjoin to it on the inquiries criminal and civil in which the evidence is cast into the shape of affidavit evidence is the testimony of the defendant compellable yes and no not compelled in any good shape compelled in this egregiously bad one tenderness or no tenderness at any rate a predilection for a preference and that an exclusive one to bad evidence   procedure by indictment inquiry the preliminary one the examination before a justice of the peace as above on this occasion too the defendant in respect of the delivery of his testimony lies under a sort of compulsion and that more efficient than we have seen it in the case of readywritten testimony to produce the compulsion no extraneous force is indeed employed but the other sort of compulsion just described compulsion ab intrà in this as in those other cases on this occasion it will seldom happen that the testimony of the defendant is called for that he is put to the bar to be examined till some other evidence some extraneous testimony bearing against him has been previously delivered the question here is whether he shall be prosecuted and committed or liberated from silence as well as from evasive responsion or false responsion proved to be so by contradiction ab extrà or selfcontradiction the magistrate will draw his inference to whatever evidence direct or circumstantial may have been brought out from other lips the circumstantial evidence consisting of this silence will constitute an addition of no unpersuasive kind in a word the mode of collecting the testimony differs in this case from the best mode by nothing but the want of the presence of the adverse party with the faculty of pushing the inquiry to the utmost as on the trial in civil cases and to say the best mode is as much as to say the most compulsive perhaps the subordinate and unlearned judge ad hoc imitating the tenderness of his learned superiors will aid and abet the defendant with a piece of advice which on any other supposition than that of his being guilty will be of no use to him here is the question but unless you have some falsehood ready which you think may help to screen you do not answer it happily the obligation attached to the situation cannot be altogether destroyed by this pious endeavour to destroy it if the advice is taken and silence preserved the judge with all his highborn learning can scarcely keep himself from drawing that inference which common sense unpoisoned by learning  0  cannot avoid drawing from such data though the answer should be a confession he cannot convict and though instead of an answer the silence he bespeaks be presented to him he can scarcely avoid committing and taking order for prosecution and it instead of silence confession had come he could have done no more ii civil cases at common law   procedure by action preliminary sham inquiry the pleadings here as in the case of procedure by affidavit evidence the compulsion though indirect is still compulsion and the admission as it were merged in it the principle of compulsion is not deduced ab extrà but innate as it were arising out of the cause and proportioned in force to the value at stake upon the cause a mass of jargon in the accustomed form has been poured orth by your adversarys lawyers employ yours to reply to it by a correspondent mass or you lose your cause had the object of the framers of this system been the attainment of the truth—as in felonies it was the object of the legislature in ordaining the preliminary examinations—they would here have taken the same course but as anybody may see that chooses it their real and sole object was to produce for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense that system of delay vexation and expense which has been produced accordingly compulsion indirect as it is there is no want of compulsion but to do what not to deliver anything that can serve for evidence—not to speak a syllable of truth or of anything that can serve to bring out the truth—but to pay lawyers for writing lies and nonsense   principal inquiry sole real inquiry the trial here no compulsion any more than in a trial on an indictment or information no compulsion and saving whatever difference there may be in respect of the value and importance of the matter at stake the consequences—the mischievous consequences the ambiguities the inconsistencies—the same here as there iii civil cases equity law in all those civil cases to which the jurisdiction of a court of equity extends by one means or other the testimony of a defendant is compelled without reserve or disguise the question having been propounded—silence silence as to the whole together is taken for confession an inference that would not be unreasonable if the defendant were on the spot to answer for himself—or if instead of one man out of twenty every man were rich enough to be able to speak in the only way in which a hearing is to be obtained but where appearance is in question command does not include permission either in law or equity in both places men know their own business better than to suffer a cause to be begun in a mode which in nine cases out of ten brings it as where conscience presides it is actually brought brought in the selfsame hour to an untimely and unprofitable end propose then the constant question—no other than the constant answer can be returned to it in equity law the testimony of the defendant is it compellable yes and no no in the best most natural most efficacious most prompt least vexatious least expensive mode yes in an inferior makeshift accidentally though but occasionally necessary mode—drawn aside from the ends of justice by factitious delay vexation and expense such then are the shifts to which a man is reduced when straining to find a legitimate reason or so much as the shadow of one for any part of the mountain of abuse of which the technical system of procedure is composed vexation fear of producing unnecessary vexation is that the reason why the testimony of a party is not compelled in the same mode in which it would be compelled were he an extraneous witness to save the vexation of an hour months or years filled with more corroding vexation aggravated by a load of expense which to nineteen persons out of twenty is altogether insupportable here as elsewhere thus it is with those tender mercies in the vaunting of which neither the tongue nor the pen of the lawyer ever tires begun in selfishness continued in hypocrisy it is in cruelty that they end after having been examined in his own station in this mode the defendant is liable to be examined with or against his consent in the station of a witness in a quite different and as far as concerns the extraction of the truth in plenitude and purity much superior mode but this case will come more fully and advantageously into view when we come to speak of the case which presents divers persons on the defendants side iv case civil procedure by common law and equity together in speaking of the plaintiffs side of the cause we had occasion just to note the fact that in some cases by the assistance of a court of equity either party may obtain the testimony of the other to be employed on the occasion of the trial at common law either party consequently the defendant—but the plaintiff i e he who means to become such in the court of common law is the party with whom the application to the court of equity for that purpose will most naturally and frequently originate in this most natural of the two cases the person who proposes to himself to become plaintiff by action at common law begin  0  with occupying the same station in a court of equity a bill having this for its object is distinguished by a particular name a bill of discovery had the bosom from which it was to be drawn been that of an extraneous witness the selfsame testimony would have been compelled by an instrument called a subpœna and delivered in the best shape possible that of vivâ voce subject to counterinterrogation and counterevidence on the spot—delivered in the compass perhaps of a couple of minutes by the assistance of a court of equity it is obtained in an inferior shape without the security afforded for correctness and completeness by the scrutiny of vivâ voce counterinterrogation obtained at the end of as many years perhaps as it would have occupied minutes if delivered in the most trustworthy shape i speak of minutes for even though the article of testimony thus required be ever so simple authentication of a deed for example or communication of the contents a quantity of time more than sufficient for the circumnavigation of the globe may be to be consumed in seeking for it as to the rational the justifying cause—the ground in point of justice and utility on which to the extent of this class of cases the direct exclusion coupled with the indirect and circuitous admission rests—what it is not and what it is are points equally out of the reach of dispute it is not the fear of deception for the same testimony which is excluded in the more trustworthy is admitted in the less trustworthy shape still less is it the fear of producing vexation i e vexation beyond necessity and in excess what fear then is it it is the fear of not producing vexation enough viz that vexation of which there never can be enough the vexation with which delay and expense and the profit official and professional extractible out of that expense keeps pace by a recent decision if the mischief is in one part limited and kept from spreading its inconsistency is increased in the station of an extraneous witness in a dispute with which he has no concern a man may in the direct mode under the subpœna without a bill be compelled to deliver his testimony how heavy soever the but then to which he thereby subjects himself so it be that in speaking of it the word criminal be not employed a forfeiture to the amount of the whole of his estate may thus be imposed upon him so it be that the forfeiture be not called a forfeiture if for the extraction of testimony from unwilling bosoms a bill be so much better an instrument than a subpœna why not extend the application of it to extraneous witnesses unfortunately the times admit not of any such improvement it is now too late in law no abuse too flagrant to be cherished but even in law no new ones must now be made v examination of bail by the two words opposing bail a sort of examination is denoted which anomalous as it is has and under the present head a claim to notice two persons whose relation to the cause is designated by that appellation—a sort of parties added to the cause—present themselves in court and are subjected to an examination analogous to that which is called crossexamination in the case of an extraneous witness a species of examination this which may be seen going forward any day in any of the superior courts of westminster hall the court of chancery excepted an action is brought and such is the established order of things the defendant having with or without necessity or use been apprehended as a malefactor might be—instead of being brought before a judge for examination in the first instance as a felon is to be committed or not committed according as the necessity for that species of vexation has or has not existence—is committed to prison in the first instance—to a prison with or without necessity or as a matter of favour to a spunginghouse—that the money which might have gone to his creditors may be shared among the lawyers who have given themselves a better title to it to liberate him from this vexation two friends of his come forward and engage themselves in the event of the defendants losing his cause to do one of two things to pay the money that he should have paid or to give back his body to the harpies of the law out of court exists having existed time out of mind a sort of officer called the sheriff a common subordinate to all the four courts something between a constable and a judge to purposes of vexation a judge—to purposes of relief anything but a judge as to the use of him in the present state of things i mean to the purposes of justice—for to the purposes of established judicature he is of admirable use conceive this personage with his subordinates interposed in a cause before  0  a court of conscience between the court and their beadle in a cause before a justice of the peace between the magistrate and his constable this interposition supposed conceive the improvement it would make in those instances and you will have a tolerably distinct view of the necessity and use it is of in the several instances in which it continues to have place the bail are now in court for at that august seat of judicature the presence of those incidental parties at that early stage of the cause is as necessary as at every other stage but the last the presence of the principal parties is for so it has been made impossible the bail are in court a cause a sort of incidental cause is to be tried viz whether to the purpose of affording to the plaintiff an adequate security for the performance of their engagement to him they are in a state of solvency it unopposed the fact is sufficiently proved by their own statement made in general terms but upon oath if opposed the opposition is made by employing an advocate to counterinterrogate them to put questions to them in such detail as the patience of the court admits of concerning the particulars of their property without any such scrutiny because without any power of administering an oath this same pair of guarantees or another pair for of the chaos of complication in which the business is involved this diversification forms one of the ten thousand elements the same pair of sureties or another pair have already been received by the sheriff in another place so that these sureties whose sufficiency is to become matter of dispute—these same suspected persons have if the suspicion be well grounded had time to convey themselves out of the reach of justice ask a lawyer whether in a civil case and at common law a party is ever examined—examined in the way in which at the trial a witness is answer no never ask him whether such a thing if done might not be an improvement answer neminem oportet esse saptentiorem legibus ask him whether it could be done answer impossible without throwing everything into confusion and overturning the very foundation of blackstones venerable castle the sole defence of english liberties ask him whether he has ever heard of a sort of person called a bail whether a bail is not to the purpose of eventual responsibility a party and whether he never heard a bail examined—examined just as he might have been had the court at the time had a jury in it and he been a witness on that same side ask him once more whether he has not heard of a sort of a thing called an estoppel†—and whether there be not that in it that shall be a bar to his plea of the impossibility of examining a party at common law without blowing up the old castle either you will find him standing mute like a prevaricating witness struck by a flash of selfcontradiction or if he says anything it will be to some such effect as this—a bail party or not party in effect is not a party in name we never look beyond names would it be less conducive to the ends of justice to examine in this same mode and for this same purpose one principal party at the outset of the cause than two subsidiary and perhaps unnecessarily subsidiary ones in the course of it would not the solvency of the debtor himself be rather better worth knowing in the first instance than that of two strangers might it not be better to know from himself whether he be solvent or no than to begin with sending him to a jail or a spunginghouse and perhaps make him insolvent for fear of his being so answer may be so but why talk to us about the ends of justice what have we to do with them what business is it of ours to look at the subject in any such point of view what should lead us to it who would pay us for it who would so much as thank us for it what is that sort of information which is got from a man under the name of bail at common law in the course of a few minutes exactly the same sort of information which under the name of a defendant would be got from the same man in equity with less security for correctness and plenitude at the end of as many months if for example be were an executor or administrator having possession of a mass of property out of which the plaintiff a legatee or creditor called for his share in the examination of bail if the account obtained by the inquiry be sufficiently detailed and satisfactory to prove a mass of property adequate to the sum for which he binds himself there the inquiry stops as in this case it is fit it should in the case of the executor it may be necessary it should go further it may be necessary it should go to the utmost extending over the whole mass and to show that nothing is omitted exhibiting a separate view of every elementary part of which that aggregate is composed—it would be inadequate  0  to the purpose if a statement framed with that deliberation of which written discourse alone is susceptible did not accompany or rather precede the elucidations extracted by vivâ voce interrogation in the case of the executor—to the vivâ voce responses a document of this permanent nature in equity practice in fact a succedaneum should in propriety be a supplement a concomitant or a preliminary in the case of the bail it would not so constantly be necessary to justice but even in that case instances in which it would be necessary present themselves in every days practice before the income tax unless where extracted by a bill in equity an occurrence of this sort was without example therefore it was impossible now it has existed and existed in every house therefore it is not impossible good logic in a court of common sense if not in a court of common law vi case criminal procedure summary the guards to blackstones castle the castle of lawyercraft are numerous and vigilant but the fortifications they have to defend are extensive the assailants though scattered and undisciplined not a few here and there in some neglected quarter reason will steal in and take post one precedent lets in another jurisprudential law is law made by lawyers never but for the benefit of lawyers statute law is law made by the selfstyled guardians and representatives of the people sometimes for the benefit of the people procedure called regular is the work of jurisprudential law procedure called summary of statute law jurisprudential law is the miserable makeshift of inexperienced ages statute law the regular work of power and experience operating upon the raw materials shot down here and there by jurisprudential law as the sun rises fogs disperse as statute law advances jurisprudential vanishes the legislator who in the reign of philip and mary introduced the preliminary examination of defendants in cases of felonious offences by single justices of the peace ventured not to intrust those magistrates with the power of deciding upon the evidence so collected that power was reserved for a jury saving here and there an exception too intricate and absurd to be here particularized a felonious offence was in those days a capital offence felony meaning then what unclergyable felony means still an inexplicable cluster of punishments of which the only efficient and comprehensible one is that most absurd and to english minds most favourite of all punishments into which all others are gradually ripening death† felony the punishment and by a figure of speech congenial to jurisprudential rhetoric the name of the punishment become the name of an offence but the power of life and death was too much to be intrusted to a single magistrate and as to the applying to any offence that had ever been punished with death any inferior punishment it was a sort of anticlimax not at all to the taste of that age nor much as yet to the taste of any age depredations of which this and that particular sort of article were the subject having excited the passion of revenge in the bosom of the owners of the individual articles and these individuals happening to possess the requisite share of influence with the legislative body—a fresh exertion of legislative authority came as usual to be made though the rules of jurisprudential law are all of them ex post facto laws having all the bad properties of that sort of law with that of uncertainty to boot—the iniquity of the practice when applied to statute law seldom fails to be recognised feigning notice where there is none lawyers who at so easy a price as the saying the thing that is not have established themselves in the habit of dealing with men as they please punish for disobedience where obedience is impossible legislators acting in their own characters shrink with just horror from such injustice but though the individual offence escapes unpunished it is still the individual offender that is in view rarely do the optics of the legislator carry him beyond individual objects—to stretch further were it possible might scarce be prudent it would be abstraction

made for the purpose is spread exactly in the same place such is the logic of your practical statesmen finance excepted an important branch of legislation but not the only one the care of the laws is not the charge nor therefore the care of any man method consistency are never thought of what does not exist cannot be disturbed lawyers love confusion lawyers fatten on it nonlawyers born and bred with the yoke of the lawyer about their necks if haply they have the wish have not the wit to remedy it a quantity of lead and iron had been stolen passions kindled resolution taken to catch  0  the thief if possible lead and in on have been stolen and the thieves not punished ergo the laws against stealing lead and iron are insufficient the laws against stealing lead and iron are insufficient ergo fresh ones must be made the thieves unpunished but how happened it because the fact could not be proved upon them and how happened it that it could not be proved upon them because when questioned about it they knew better than to answer was it there the shoe pinched this shows us how to frame the remedy when a man is taken up for stealing lead or iron provide that if be wont answer and answer to satisfaction it shall be concluded that he stole it and he shall be dealt with accordingly ay but this is making him criminate himself that is against the rule which forbids the putting it to a man to accuse himself a mode of procedure which lawyers abhor except where they find their account in practising it and which nonlawyers taking the interested clamour of lawyers for the voice of reason abhor without reason true and therefore we must not think of hanging or so much as transporting upon such evidence but a penalty really inflicted such a penalty be it ever so trifling is better than a penalty be it ever so severe which is not inflicted a substance be it ever so small has more stuff in it than the largest shadow to make sure say forty shillings and no more to a member of parliament forty shillings is as nothing confine the penalty to forty shillings what the evidence is will be an object not worthy inquiring about so much for the penalty then as to the jurisdiction for that too must be changed before a jury no it cannot be before them putting questions to the defendant would never do they are not used to it they would not come into it besides that before the matter could come to them the thief would be prepared and overprepared with this description tacked to it the offence if it come anywhere must come before a justice singly or in pairs when acting in this mode people it is true are not used to see justices trying theft and trying it without a jury but penalties of forty shillings and ten times forty shillings are levied in this manner every day therefore confine the penalty to forty shillings say nothing about theft nor anything about questions interrogations or examination mask the questioning by words which imply questioning without expressing it lawyers will not see what you are about or other people will not mind them and thus with friends and fortune on your side your bill will pass thus spake the bold and fortune favoured them like the lesbian rule of old the rule bent the bar opened and let in protection for the two favoured metals forty shillings worth of lead or iron being worth forty shillings how much less is the worth of forty shillings worth of any other thing such is the question which common sense might have put had she dared to raise her voice but either she was not there or she did not dare had she spoken thus loud lawyers would have taken the alarm and protection instead of being extended to other things would have been lost to the favoured metals the direct course would have been free from danger the indirect

from such justice to search accordingly in the daytime finding therein accordingly warrant thereupon by such single justice to cause the same and the person in whose house or other place the same were found to be brought before two or more such justices these preliminaries adjusted then comes the clause authorizing the extraction of selfcriminating evidence if such person shall not give an account to the satisfaction of such justices how he came by the same or shall not in some convenient time to be set by the said justices produce the party of whom he bought or received the same he shall be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor penalty for the first offence  0s for the second £  for every subsequent offence £  so that if there were not other laws by which in case of other sufficient evidence these same thefts are punishable under the name of theft and with a degree of severity which certainly cannot be charged with insufficiency this law instead of being a prohibition would operate as a licence give an account to the satisfaction of such justices how you came by the same—or  0  in some convenient time to be set by them produce the party of whom you bought or received the same if as before supposed you know nothing either of the thief or of the stolen goods—the same after having been stolen out of some other place having been stolen into yours without your knowledge—how should you the probability is that notwithstanding your giving no such account as is required and on failure of which the justices are required to convict you—the probability is that you being innocent they would not convict you be it so but if so it be then the case comes to this that the magistrates instead of pursuing the law of the land pursue the law of reason and that instead of extracting or rather receiving testimony from you the defendant in an imperfect mass according to the terms of the statute they extract it from you in a complete state—in that state in which you being by the supposition willing they would have extracted it from you had they dealt with you the defendant as they would have done with any extraneous witness or if dealing with you as a defendant they had examined you as persons apprehended for felony are examined under the statute of philip and mary—for the purpose of being committed or not committed for trial—and as defendants charged with any sort of crime are examined under roman law for the purpose of being convicted or not convicted chapter iv impropriety of excluding the testimony of a party to the cause for or against another party on the same side examination of the course pursued in this respect by english law §   absurdity of the exclusion in this more complicated case as in the former more simple one the task of determining what is right receives not from the complication any additional difficulty already over and over again the determination has been formed for all cases but the difficulty of examining and exposing what is wrong receives from the same cause an enhancement much to be regretted on this part of the field as on every other the rule of simplicity the purest simplicity will be seen to be the rule of utility and reason the system of complication to be a system of absurdity inconsistency and injustice in all its shapes of this case the modifications are— i plaintiffs more than one first question shall each he admitted if willing to give testimony at the instance of the other second question shall each if unwilling be compellable to give testimony at the instance of the other ii defendants more than one in this part of the case the questions likewise are two and of the same import shall each if willing be admitted—shall each if unwilling be compellable—to give testimony at the instance of the other in this case over and above all accidental anomalies and incongruities a curious absurdity is generated by the very nature of the general rule parties how numerous soever  0  being excluded while in the character of an extraneous witness the testimony of a single deponent is sufficient to warrant and if clear of contradiction as well from within as without in a manner to command decision—a single tongue obtains thus a certain victory over a thousand that would have sounded in contradiction to it had they been suffered to be heard every defendant is par etat by his station in the cause a liar a man who if suffered to speak would be sure to speak false and equally sure to be believed every defendant is a liar but every human being may at the pleasure of every other be converted into a defendant therefore and by that means every human being may at the pleasure of every other be converted into a liar and in that character his capacity of giving admissible testimony annihilated the jus nocendi the power of imposing unlimited burthens by calumnies not suffered to be contradicted is thus offered constantly upon sale to every man who will pay the price for it §   plaintiffs more than one—examination of this case examine the subject in detail you will find the mischief as well as the absurdity diversified by no small variety of modifications none having any reference to the ends of justice all arising out of the different modifications of the form of procedure modifications agreeing but in two things their subservience to the ends of actual judicature—their repugnance to the ends of justice in the first place let the multiplicity be on the plaintiffs side i plaintiffs testimony—is it admissible in favour of a coplaintiff   in cases called criminal from what has been brought to view already it may be easily inferred the multiplicity is not productive of any additional injury to the interests of truth and justice where there is but one plaintiff one prosecutor his testimony is not excluded by the interest he has in the cause as the testimony of one is not so neither would that of two or twenty if there were so many but there are not usually more than one   case called civil mode of procedure action at common law neither in this case plaintiffs i e persons having need to appear in that character being plural—neither in this case in the hands of a welladvised attorney need there on that side be any dearth of evidence two persons attacked and beaten by four each of the two brings his action supporting it by the testimony of the other two suits are thus manufactured out of one so agreeable a circumstance may help to account for the establishment of the rule and may be not unfriendly to the preservation of it but suppose a claim of the pecuniary kind with or without injury—in short a demand preferred by two persons linked together by the tie of one common title two tenants in common two jointtenants here either both individuals are obliged to join in the suit and thence become both of them plaintiffs or if one be plaintiff and excluded on that score the other is an interested witness and excluded on that other score true but in the character of a purge to carry off the fæces of interest the virtue of a release has been already brought to view† to each of them let this specific be administered by turns the peccant matter is discharged out of him and he becomes a good witness for the other true it is that the specific admirable as it is is not equally well adapted to the constitution of every case suppose two persons partners in trade there might be an awkwardness in the arrangement were each partner as the exigency of the suit required to give up his share of the business to the other to pursue the inquiry through the whole field of actions and actionable cases would probably be thought rather a superfluous task what for the purpose of illustration has already been brought to view may appear proof sufficient for the establishment of three facts that in one set of cases admission for the testimony of persons in the situation of plaintiffs may be gained that in another it cannot be gained and that in neither has the distinction anything to do with the interests of truth and justice a corollary is that in some cases there may be a convenience in this sort of community of interests as one good turn deserves another each associate may thus in his turn discharge himself of his peccant matter for the benefit of the other whereas when in point of interest a man has the misfortune of standing alone it may not be altogether easy for him to discharge his bosom of peccant matter for want of a friendly bosom to empty it into could anything be done by a sale without warranty or if with warranty might not the interest attached to the warranty be purged off as well as interest in other shapes by the universal elixir apply this to immoveables  0  and to moveables to property real personal and incorporeal learning curious learning in any given quantity might be spun out upon this ground   case called civil mode of procedure bill in equity the mode of pursuing or professing to pursue truth being altogether different according as in pursuing it you pronounce the word law or the word equity—a different field is thus opened for the exercise of professional ingenuity the virtue of the purge is no less acknowledged in equity than in common law but if reciprocity be the condition and the suits instead of contemporary are to be successive the condition of those who have to wait will be still more awkward here than at common law equity procedure is peculiarly adapted to the treatment of complex cases or to speak more properly when a case becomes to a certain degree complex in any mode pursued at common law it is so utterly impossible to administer anything that shall have so much as the semblance of justice that cases of this description are shaken off by necessity into the lap of equity if in the field of common law the inquiry might find matter for one volume—on the ground of equity law it might find matter for another of the matter peculiar to equity i shall content myself with giving one specimen for illustration it will be sufficient and more will hardly be desired in equity procedure in a multitude of cases it will happen that whether a man shall be plaintiff or defendant is matter of contingency matter of choice as parties happen to agree in regard to codefendants the rule in this behalf as there will be occasion to state presently is that they cannot in favour and at the instance of a plaintiff be made to testify one against another—but for himself any defendant can employ the testimony of any other codefendant as extracted by the interrogatories administered to him on the plaintiffs side suppose then three persons primus secundus and tertius who in the most natural order of things would have been coplaintiffs but secundus and tertius stand in need of each others testimony instead of plaintiffs let them be made defendants leaving the part of plaintiff to be played by primus alone and the problem is solved ii plaintiffs testimony—is it compellable at the instance of a coplaintiff the modifications of this case are soon disposed of   cases called criminal on an indictment as already stated it is neither natural nor usual that there should be more than one real plaintiff more than one prosecutor supposing more than one two for example it is not natural that they should have become such without such an agreement as would be incompatible with compulsion at that time men who agree one day may indeed disagree the next but if both are bound to prosecute both are bound also to give evidence but bound or not bound to prosecute no individual being in a criminal case recognised in the character of plaintiff there is no individual defendants excepted who is not bound to give evidence the case is in this respect much the same on an information it is different and indeed opposite where the prosecution is by motion for attachment in those cases all testimony is received in no other form than that of affidavit evidence on trial by affidavit everybody testifies that pleases add—and nobody that does not please† affidavit evidence is moreover as has been already observed the sort of evidence the only sort that is received on the preliminary and worse than useless inquiry which for the benefit and by the hypocrisy of the man of law under the mask of tenderness has been made to precede the trial on an information as likewise on the supplemental inquiry by which in case of conviction as well on indictments as on information the trial is succeeded—and on which on the occasion of the original offence the defendant may without other evidence be convicted of succeeding ones for it is a rule—an inviolable rule with learned judges never to receive testimony when it is for their own use but in the most untrustworthy of all forms compulsion is therefore out of the question in all these cases in the case of felonies on the preparatory inquiry performed by a justice of the peace antecedently to the trial the testimony of every person without distinction is compellable at the instance as well as by the authority of that magistrate thence supposing in the first instance two prosecutors and reluctance to supervene on the part of either his testimony might at the instance of the  0  other be compelled notwithstanding viz by the authority of the magistrate in the same cases the same obligation extends to the other preparatory inquiry—viz that before the grand jury supposing it preceded by the inquiry before the justice of the peace but in such indictable offences as do not come under the denomination either of felonies or breaches of the peace no such previous inquiry before a justice can take place nor in felonies though usually does it necessarily take place still less in breaches of the peace in these cases therefore probably as in attachments certainly justice is on this occasion as on so many others left to take her chance on the inquiry before a justice the mode of compelling attendance for the purpose of testification as well before the grand jury as on the trial before the petty jury is by an engagement called a recognizance into which prosecutors as well as extraneous witnesses are by that authority and on that occasion compelled to enter one person usually possibly in some instances more than one undertaking by one recognisance to prosecute as well as testify another or others undertaking by another recognisance simply to testify nothing being said of prosecuting is there any other mode of compelling the appearance of a man in either character before a grand jury none that i can find in the books i know of none   cases called civil procedure by action at common law compulsion is here altogether out of the question as between plaintiff and plaintiff we have seen how in some cases two men having each of them the sort of interest that a plaintiff has in the event of the cause may each purge himself of the legal part of that interest while the moral part keeps its hold as firmly as ever in his breast but where the patient is a human creature this like other purges supposes consent a suitor cannot be purged with a drenchinghorn like a horse   cases called civil procedure by suit in equity in the case of a single plaintiff we have seen that in that character a man can never be compelled to give testimony—and also for what reason the same reason would if there were a thousand of them be equally conclusive §   defendants more than one—their testimony in favour of one another how far excluded by english law i can the testimony of one defendant be received in favour of another   cases called criminal procedure by indictment or information in these cases as in all others the station of defendant is a situation to which the plaintiff nominates it depends not upon the nominee to resign it if so it would not be often filled for the purpose of the principal inquiry called the trial a man cannot indeed under this mode of procedure be stationed in it without the fiat of a grand jury but unless the story appear preponderantly improbable that fiat will naturally be at least it ought to be commanded by the evidence and it is the characteristic of this species of inquiry to hear evidence but on one side in this case when the inquiry is the principal one the trial can a defendant with his own consent at the instance of a codefendant give testimony in favour of such codefendant no and yes no in words yes in effect no for in that situation let a man say what he will it is not evidence no oath can be administered to him not a question as we have seen can be put to him by anybody yes in effect for to the defendants to each of them be their number what it may liberty is always given to say or to read whatever he may think proper under the name of his defence being allowed to say whatever he thinks fit—if in what he says there be anything capable of operating in favour of a codefendant—what he thus says in favour of another will naturally operate upon the mind of the jury with no less persuasive force—will naturally if there be any difference operate with more persuasive force—than anything which more particularly or exclusively operates with the like tendency in favour of himself as to affidavit evidence and as many inquiries whether principal preliminary supplemental or sole as are carried on in this uninquisitive mode and as many sorts of demands penal or nonpenal as are judged of by the light of this most commodious sort of evidence—we shall find in the case of codefendants admission standing upon the same easy footing as we have seen it stand on in the case of coplaintiffs with the pen of an attorney to speak through let a man present himself in the garb of a witness—be he who he may party or not party interested or not interested perjured or not perjured—be the occasion what it may—thus introduced all doors and all ears are open to him   cases called civil procedure by action at common law in the case of plaintiff and coplaintiff the efficacy of mutual good offices and of purgative releases has already been brought to view but even in that more manageable case we have seen it limited and as between defendant and codefendant—if the action be of the number of those in which conduct of an injurious nature is imputed—the   0 specific is of course in this difficult case no more applicable than in that more easy one in a case of this sort as it is not necessary for the defendant or defendants to be present during the trial so neither is it altogether natural or usual whatever a man guilty or not guilty can find to say in his defence he in general regards it as more eligible to trust to the learning and eloquence of his advocate than to any chance he may have of gaining credit for anything he might wish to say either in his own favour or in favour of a fellowdefendant in the character of testimony though not allowed to be delivered under the technical name of evidence the sort of presumption here supposed is of very rare occurrence certain it is that it will not experience either much inward satisfaction or much outward encouragement from the learned and eloquent gentleman to the remuneration of whose learning and eloquence his money if he has any has been applied if he is guilty their opinion will be and in this case it will probably be a just one that the duty of demonstrating his innocence cannot with equal probability of success be either trusted exclusively to any but themselves or so much as divided with themselves if he is not guilty any endeavour which he may be inclined to use to make known his innocence will naturally be regarded as a sort of invasion of their rights success depends not upon truth and justice but upon that sort of learning which has been created for the purpose of being made the subject of a monopoly of that monopoly of which at the expense of so much money as well as so much labour they have obtained their share where punishment of so high a nature as that which is attached to offences of the rank of felony is at stake the judge is naturally averse to the task of suggesting any observation the tendency of which may be unjustly or even justly to diminish the chance which the defendant may have of making his escape from the severity of the law to the case between individual and individual in which one cannot lose but the other must gain this sort of tenderness does not for the demand created for it by popular prejudice does not extend in summing up the evidence on the trial of an action the judge would say to the jury without scruple gentlemen the defendant nokes has said so and so in behalf of defendant stiles but the law requires you to lay all this out of the case for it is not evidence in all purely pecuniary cases to which the virtue of the mendacityfuge diaphoretic does not extend—the natural effect which in the case of a plurality of defendants results from the exclusion put upon the testimony of individuals in this situation has already been brought to view in english jurisprudence in the class of cases here in question this mischief operates with undiminished strength to rid himself of a troublesome witness an unscrupulous plaintiff has no more to do than to put him upon the list of defendants seeing a man upon that list a learned judge wants nothing more to satisfy him that the testimony of that man be he who he may is unworthy of all regard and to engage him of course to give his assurance to the jury to the same effect if indeed to the same purpose on the same occasion the testimony of the same individual had been presented in the form of an affidavit unchecked by crossexamination the case would have been very different it would then have been good evidence and like the testimony of any extraneous witness have passed with him for what it was worth nay but the plaintiff has no such power we are aware of the mischief and have provided against it he may put a witness if he pleases upon the list of defendants but if no evidence is given that affects such defendant his testimony is received notwithstanding yes verily provision you have made and against this abuse with about as much felicity and about as much zeal as against the rest of that mountain of abuse which is the source and measure of your profit every man who has a farthing to gain by lying will always be sure to he this is your theory this is what you are bound by you are estopped from questioning it if he be not on what pretence do you exclude a defendant from delivering his testimony at the instance of a codefendant if in a case affording in point of moral interest two plaintiffs one of them has been cleared of legal interest by the name of prosecutor or by the relaxatory purge—and the purge though it has given him competency has not given him veracity along with it—to strike the defendant witnesses dumb if there be a dozen of them what has he to do but to say a word or two against each nay but the case you are thus bringing out against us is an extraordinary case—not so very extraordinary but however take this which is but too ordinary a one plaintiff there is but one witness an extraneous witness witness but that one which is sufficient but this one witness is a liar bound to the plaintiffs side either secretly by the only interest that you acknowledge to have any influence or by any or all of the other     kinds of interest put together is it more unreasonable to suppose one liar on this side than a dozen on the other for if you are not sure of their being liars or even if you are what should hinder you from suffering them to be heard but it is vain to argue without data the matter in dispute being given and now let the case be a purely civil one—nothing of injury supposed the question is whether the testimony of the defendant called for by a codefendant will or will not be trustworthy his trustworthiness depends—not upon the cause or the relation the man bears to the cause—but upon the station the judicial station which at the instant of pronouncing the decision you his judge happen to occupy on this as on so many other subjects tell me your station i will tell you your opinions unless your station be ascertained you know no more what your opinions are on the bench than you knew what they were while at the bar till you knew whether it was for the plaintiff or the defendant you were retained are you a chancellor or a master of the rolls the man is a true man are you a judge of the kings bench he is a liar and one that would deceive your jurymen as sure as you suffered them to hear him being a judge of the kings bench are you moreover a commissioner of the great seal the man is trustworthy or untrustworthy according as you sit on the one side or the other of a narrow passage are you a baron of the exchequer his character changes backwards and forwards without your being at any such trouble as that of crossing the passage—from the same bench and without stirring you serve out law or equity whichever happens to be called for if it be law the man is a liar if it be equity he speaks true tell us then what is law—tell us what is equity these are both of your own making each whatever you are in the mood to make it the tissue of inconsistencies and absurdities is not yet at an end in what court is it that the testimony of a defendant called for by a codefendant is not receivable in the court where in case of mendacity the most effectual means of exposing it are in use in what court is it that the testimony from that same source is receivable in the sort of court where no such means are suffered to be employed in a commonlaw court there is crossexamination true that is to say provided a jury be there to hear it—not otherwise in a commonlaw court there is crossexamination in an equity court there is crossexamination in both the crossexamination is the same sort of thing in the eyes of those to whom the most different things become the same thing when called by the same name commonlaw crossexamination—questions put in public by the advocate of the party to the deponent were he to depose after the questions put on the other side with the answers to them have been heard equity crossexamination—questions put in private by a clerk who unless bribed cares not a straw for either party nor for anything but the getting through his task with the least possible trouble questions framed for him by a person to whom it was not possible to know a syllable of what the deponent would say in answer to questions put on the other side tell me then once more on what bench and under what name you sit and i will tell you what you will think or at any rate if the term thinking be improper what you will do is it your business to cancel papers or keep rolls† the sham crossexamination is the only one that you will suffer to be made and it is upon the strength of this mock security that you will give your confidence to the defendants evidence is it your business to hear pleas before the king himself when he is not there‡ nothing less than the true crossexamination will serve you and with this best security at your command forasmuch as you can get nothing better—in this case to make sure of hearing the truth and the whole truth you shut your ears against the evidence are you that double sort of man called a lord commissioner of the great seal or that other double sort sort of man called a baron of the exchequer the true and the sham crossexamination are the same thing to you but at any rate with the good security in your hand your ears are shut against the evidence with the the bad security they are open to it be this as it may—whether you are the single sort of man or the double sort of man you are at any rate that other sort of man in whose judgment where it is by himself that the decision is to be formed no examination at all is a better way of coming at the truth and the whole truth than either the good mode of examination or the bad one should the man be sitting or standing opposite you you know better than to put a single question to him or to suffer one to be put to him by anybody else it must be through the pen of an attorney if you hear him and through that medium you hear anybody instead of missing would you wish to find the truth instead of common law and equity would you wish to administer justice instead of learning and science would you wish to judge according to common law and common honesty go to any court of conscience—go to the study of any country justice learn there to forget your learning in that oblivion you will find the beginning     of wisdom among the shopkeepers more surely for before their court hangs a curtain behind which happily for the great body of the people eyes such as yours have not been allowed to penetrate in the study of the unlearned magistrate more sparingly you must there content yourself with such remains of wisdom as your vigilance has not yet succeeded in rooting out of it ii can the testimony of one defendant be compelled at the instance of another   common law case criminal procedure by indictment or information occasion the principal inquiry the trial the answer in this case is clearly in the negative in the very nature of the case obligation to testify supposes interrogation but on the trial no question can be put to a defendant by anybody therefore not by a codefendant   law common or equity case criminal or civil procedure by indictment or information inquiry sole principal preliminary or supplemental form of testification affidavit evidence whenever the evidence is delivered in this form the answer must still be in the negative no interrogation no compulsion and affidavit evidence is being interpreted uninterrogated evidence   common law case civil or if in some respects considered as criminal and spoken of under the name of penal—procedure still by action answer still in the negative no interrogation no compulsion no question can be put to a defendant by anybody therefore not by a codefendant §   defendants more than one—their testimony against one another how far excluded by english law can the testimony of one defendant be compelled to the disadvantage of another   criminal cases procedure by indictment occasion the principal inquiry the trial to an individual in this situation no question as already observed can be put by anybody therefore no evidence to the prejudice of one defendant can be thus extracted from any other in regard to any statement that may happen to flow spontaneously from the lips of a defendant speaking in his own defence as above the same observations as above are applicable with only this difference that when anything that falls from a person in this suspected situation presents itself to the judge as operating to the disadvantage of another individual in the same predicament—the nullity of it in the character of evidence will by an english judge be much more apt to be noticed and held up to view than in the opposite case where the procedure is by information there is no other difference in this respect than what may be supposed to be produced by the inferiority of the maximum of punishment in this case in comparison with the maximum of punishment applicable in cases prosecutable in the way of indictment seldom indeed if ever in the case of an information will the occasion for any such remark on the part of the judge present itself procedure by attachment evidence affidavit evidence here the evidence being all read of course the judge makes whatever application of it he thinks fit in the cases which we shall come to presently in which the testimony is also presented to the judge in the form of readywritten evidence it is not heard by the judge except in so far as for that purpose it is especially called for and the question for or against whom it shall be employed resolves itself into the question at whose instance it shall be read the evidence being according to his own theory of the deceptitious kind he is according to that same theory constantly deceived by it so much for persons actually in the situation of defendants but of two persons having borne in the same criminal transaction exactly the same part it may happen that one shall be put into that perilous situation the other not this accordingly is the case as often as by a reward of which impunity forms the whole or a part one of two delinquents is engaged to come forward against another in the character of an extraneous witness of this ground of suspicion and untrustworthiness and of the use which english law scruples not to make of this most suspicious of all imaginable evidence to this most dangerous of all imaginable purposes notice was taken at the outset of this research but what is done in this way in the strongest of all cases is done in the same way in all other cases of inferior strength and the like complexion to dwell upon any of these inferior cases would be an anticlimax such admissions are most perfectly consistent with that gigantic exception all of them as completely repugnant to the general rule   civil cases procedure in the way of action at common law in this case also no question can be put to a defendant in behalf of anybody therefore not in behalf of a codefendant   case civil law equity law procedure by bill in equity on this ground confusion is in all its glory the powers of darkness have mustered all their force at common law though testimony in wholesale quantities is pronounced deceptitious without knowing what it is—still take any given lot it is either capable or incapable of being true it is not capable and incapable at the same time     the absurdities and injustice of common law were not enough for equity she has made improvements and in equity the selfsame statement concerning a matter of fact—the selfsame proposition is true and false at the same time for or against a it is true for or against b or c it is false you who read this were you sitting this day twelvemonth at one oclock p m in your study and in your answer or your depositions do you declare as much it is true as against yourself it is false—false beyond all possibility of being true—as against me a defendant along with you in the same cause look to the origin of this difference you will find it in the joint influence of several concurring causes—in the practice of pursuing on the occasion of such cause two modes of collecting evidence by answer and by depositions agreeing in nothing but their unfitness for the purposes of truth and justice in the confusion pervading the whole texture of the answer—claims and concessions confounded with affirmations and denials—what a man says in the character of a party with what he says in the character of a witness—propositions concerning the question of right with propositions concerning the question of fact wherever the object has been to relieve and not to plunder the afflicted to mitigate and not to aggravate their sufferings—where the object has been to bring to light the truth and the whole of the truth for the purposes of justice—where such have been the objects and the obtaining the simultaneous presence of all parties in court has been neither physically nor prudentially impracticable the mode of collecting the evidence everywhere has been alike simple and effectual each party has been admitted to declare so much of what he knows as promises to operate in favour of his own interest each party at the instance at the interrogation and thereby to the advantage of every other—the testimony of each party in his own behalf allowed to be delivered and received for what it is worth the testimony of each party when so delivered allowed to be controverted by every other party scrutinized by counterinterrogation opposed by counterevidence such accordingly is the practice in the courts of conscience such is the practice of the unlearned judges called justices of the peace except in so far as by exclusions forced upon them by their learned superiors they have found themselves compelled to swerve from it such is even the practice on trials before juries deduction made of the still more extensive exclusions by which the budget of evidence is regularly defrauded of those parts of its contents which are likely to be most valuable viz the testimony of those individuals to whose perceptive faculties the facts belonging to the cause were most likely to have presented themselves in equity as already observed in one and the same cause testimony is delivered in masses of two shapes each different from the other as well as from the only good one one mass in the form of what is called an answer containing the ready written testimony extracted from a defendant by the ready written questions contained in the bill—an instrument drawn up by the plaintiffs law assistants and without his perusal or at least without his signature exhibited in his own name and in which those questions the answers to which are expected to be true are preceded by charges—a sort of testimony which as already observed is allowed to be true or false at pleasure in this shape testimony is not called for at the hands of any persons that are not parties nor among parties at the hands of any persons that are not defendants in the cause at common law though the best evidence is so carefully weeded out yet when once a lot of evidence has been permitted to come into existence every use that is capable of being made is permitted to be made of it capable of being true with relation to any one person it is allowed to be equally capable of being true with relation to everybody else far otherwise is it with the sort of evidence extracted under the name of answer by the process employed as above by the practitioner in a court of equity the answer the part of it in question is good as against me the defendant whose answer it is but is it good ought it to be acted upon as good as against you another defendant along with me in the same cause to both questions the response must now be in the negative of what nature is the clause in question an acknowledgment having respect to the question of right or an assertion a deposition having respect merely to the question of fact if it be an acknowledgment of right my right to give up a claim of my own is indubitable but that i ought not to have any such right as to give up any claim of yours is equally indisputable is it a statement concerning a matter of fact even here its title to be admitted as against you in the character of evidence will appear to be bad or at least questionable let the fact be even of the number of those in relation to which at the time at which it happened i myself was if i speak true a principal witness—a fact which if i am to be believed i saw with my own eyes that against myself in relation to any claim that i have made it may and without any danger of injustice to my prejudice he taken for true is manifest enough but as against you and to the defeating of any claim of yours has it an equal title to be taken for true if     any certainly not an equal one for there is this difference you in your situation possess not that faculty of counterinterrogation which for defence against injustice is in your situation necessary but in mine not by misconception i may have been confessing that to be true which in fact was not so in the view of favouring the plaintiff at your expense and at the expense of truth and justice with or without his privity i may have been confessing that to be true which you knew at the time to be false it ought not therefore to be taken for true as against you without your having the faculty to controvert it in the event of your regarding it as false to controvert it viz by questions put to me in the way of counterinterrogation—of crossexamination but questions in this way the forms of the court do not on the occasion in question allow you to put to me what they do allow and require is that each of two defendants shall in an instrument called his answer make response to all such proper questions as the plaintiff in his bill shall have propounded to him what they do not allow is that either of two defendants shall in this stage of the cause at least put any question to the other in the first of these two cases the exclusion is just in itself would be just on every occasion and in every court but what is it that is here excluded not testimony but unjust power a power on my part to give away your rights in the other case the exclusion may also be just but if it be it is so in no other than a hypothetical and relative sense relation being had to the forms of the court—the forms actually in use setting aside that casual and adventitious and deplorable circumstance the proper course is not to exclude the one of two sets of evidence but to admit the other not to prevent my deposition from being taken into consideration as against you but to allow you to put counterquestions to me as you might do if i were not a party in the cause—if the interrogations put to me were put to me in the character of an extraneous witness the judge would not then be reduced as now to the necessity of denying explicitly or implicitly a proposition which the weaker powers of locke bowed down to as impregnable—it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be he would not have been reduced as now he is every day to declare in deeds if not in words that the same evidence is certainly true and certainly false to the philosopher by whom nothing was to be got by it the task was an impossible one but to the lawyer into whose lap every days profit is poured by every days nonsense neither this nor a greater absurdity if the nature of things affords one ever presents the smallest difficulty the other shape in which in the same courts testimony is delivered is that of a mass of depositions a name extending elsewhere to all testimony but confined in english law jargon to the designation of such testimony as is delivered in that particular shape answer is the name appropriated to the testimony delivered by a defendant in reply to the questions propounded to him on the part of the plaintiff in the initiative instrument called the bill depositions is the name appropriated to the testimony delivered by a witness in reply to the questions put to him vivâ voce in a closet by a sort of judge or set of judges whose authority is confined to the collection of testimony without power to make use of it this mode is a mode appropriated to the collection of the testimony of persons spoken of under the name of witnesses but in this same way a defendant every defendant may be examined as a witness—after a course of examination the duration of which is always counted by months not unfrequently by years—reexamined in another and much worse mode under this other name examined but now at whose instance and for what purpose by the bill at the instance of the plaintiff only against him the defendant only his testimony not being at that time obtainable at the instance of anybody else nor employable as against anybody else that is as against any other defendant—as we have been seeing and for the relatively good reasons that we have seen by the interrogatories the name given to the questions now put to him by the examining judge or judges he may be reexamined at the instance of the plaintiff or plaintiffs as against any other defendant or defendants he may be examined now for the first time at the instance of any other defendant or defendants as against the plaintiff or plaintiffs or as against any third defendant or defendants collected in this mode his testimony may now be employed against others beside himself employed and with propriety but if with propriety for what reasons and thence on what conditions on condition that every person against whom it is employed shall have the faculty of employing his exertions for the correction completion and upon occasion contradiction of it by counterinterrogation and counterevidence in this mode—is it at the instance of the plaintiff that he is examined this faculty the plaintiff possesses of course for—with relation to the selfserving testimony which the defendant as far as conscience and prudence will give him leave will not fail to bring forward—the interrogatories formed by the plaintiffs agents and from them received and employed by the examining judge or judges will have an effect analogous to that of the counterinterrogatories     propounded to and in the case of an extraneous witness on this footing stands it should seem the law of reason and on this same footing for aught i know may stand the actually established law but to the faculty of administering to a defendant interrogatories from all those various quarters to all those various purposes actual law adds a limitation a saving clause saving all just exceptions these exceptions selfstyled just—what are they exceptions on the score of interest of what interest this is more than i can undertake to answer at least with any full assurance a defendant without interest in the cause how can that be it he is without interest this very exemption from interest is recognised as a circumstance the effect of which is to preclude the plaintiff from dealing with him in the character of a defendant on the score of interest a defendant not to be reexamined against himself at the instance of the plaintiff why not good or bad the interest did not exclude him from being examined against himself at the instance of the same person the first time why should it a second on the score of interest a defendant primus not to be examined against himself at the instance of defendant secundus why not applied to the present case the import of the word interest is indistinct and obscure speaking of a defendant as having an interest in some cases viz in the cases in which on the score of that interest his testimony is excluded implies that there are other cases in which he has no interest viz those cases for such there are in which his testimony is admitted but a defendant—a party in the cause—and yet without interest in the cause how can that be but it may happen it may be said and every now and then does happen that a person is actually made defendant in a cause in which whether he be thought or no to have an interest he really has none for in every cause it rests with the plaintiff to put upon the list of defendants any person and every person he thinks fit true but when cases of this description are laid out of the question the difficulty remains notwithstanding in this case supposing the existence of it ascertained the name of the defendant the name which ought not to have been put upon the list may be struck out of it those cases in which the defendant has clearly no interest to any sort of purpose being set aside there remain cases in which he has not and at the same time has an interest—has an interest to the purpose of the continuance of his name on the list of defendants—has not an interest to the purpose of his testimonys being regarded as inadmissible   first let it be proposed that he be examined at the instance of the plaintiff it must then be either as against himself or as against another defendant or defendants for though two or more persons happen to find themselves together on that side of the cause it may happen to them to have interests as opposite to each other as that of any one of them to that of the plaintiff inasmuch as it rests with the plaintiff to put upon the list of defendants whatever persons he pleases moreover what may also happen is that on the plaintiffs side of the cause there may be more persons than one say two that as between those two plaintiffs there may be to some purpose or other an opposition of interests as between two defendants for though no person can be upon the list of plaintiffs without his choice yet so it may happen that in consideration of a community of interests in some respects two natural adversaries may enter into this sort of alliance on this occasion as against the defendant himself it is a conceivable case that the plaintiff may wish to examine the defendant though a case not likely to be frequently exemplified a defendant cannot come to be examined on behalf of the plaintiff under the name of examination viz by interrogatories put to him by a clerk in the examiners office or a master in chancery or a set of commissioners appointed for the purpose without having already been examined by the plaintiff himself that is by the lawassistants of the plaintiff himself without the name of examination—viz in and by the instrument called the bill but in general the interrogation by bill—the examination that extracts the testimony in the shape of an instrument called an answer—that examination notwithstanding the time and opportunity it affords for concerting with an attorney the means of evasion and safe perjury will be much more efficient than the examination performed through the medium of the judge or judges ad hoc the examining clerk the master or the commissioners viz the examination by which the testimony is produced in the shape of an instrument composed of depositions more efficient why   because by bill the plaintiff that is his lawassistants with the help of exceptions to the answer and amendments to the bill keep on examining the defendant till the plaintiff and his lawassistants are satisfied with the completeness at least if not with the correctness of the answer or     at any rate till in case of contestation they are informed by the judge ad hoc that they have reason to be satisfied   because it is probable that at least in the judgment of the plaintiff and his lawassistants better care will in this respect be taken of his interests by those assistants than by the examining judge or judges even where half of the number are under the name of a commissioner or commissioners nominated by these assistants themselves and certain that in the judgment not only of those assistants but of every impartial person to whose consideration the case presents itself better care will be taken by those same assistants than speaking of situations and not individuals is likely to be taken by the judge ad hoc if he be an examining clerk or a master sitting in his closet—that is in both cases by a person who in the nature of things cannot have any other wish or object than either to get the business out of his hands as soon as possible for the sake of his case or to keep it in them as long as possible for the sake of the fees after having then and on every point of the cause carried the examination of his adversary the defendant to its utmost length in the more efficient mode that is in the mode which in general bids fairer for being efficient—is there any incident or consideration that naturally and reasonably may engage him to add to it by another examination in the less efficient mode such incidents or considerations may not in every case be wanting despairing of being able to extract the truth where the defendant with an attorney at his elbow has month after month for concerting the means of successful evasion and safe perjury the cause being in point of locality of that sort which under the name of a country cause affords examining judges under the name of commissioners that may be awake instead of one that will be asleep it may happen that in the person of a particular lawyer in the character of commissioner nominated by himself the plaintiff may see an examiner who with the advantage of vivâ voce interrogation—examination in a form which calling for responses on the spot cuts off the opportunity of mendacityserving suggestion and premeditation promises to his expectation a better chance for the effectual extraction of the desired truth than could have been obtained in the mode of examination by bill under the disadvantages above mentioned another case that may happen is that the defendant after having given his answer may go into some foreign territory and a pair or a set of commissioners being to be sent into or found in that foreign territory for the purpose of taking at the instance of the defendant the depositions of extraneous witnesses—it may be deemed more convenient to take the benefit of that opportunity and extract the ulterior testimony of the defendant through the same channel than after adding amendments to the bill to aim at the extraction of the ulterior testimony in the shape of a further answer to the bill   at any rate the case just mentioned will be comparatively an uncommon case but what cannot be an uncommon case is that as against one defendant the plaintiff shall have need of the testimony of another defendant but has he not in the way of bill been examining them both and examining them to the utmost yes but not to revert to the rare incidents and considerations above mentioned against the making use of the testimony of one defendant against another there is this objection as against himself defendant primus has been sufficiently examined for to extract from him such facts and circumstances as make for his own advantage no counterinterrogation can be necessary but as against defendant secundus defendant primas has not been sufficiently examined for in order to extract from defendant primus the whole of the facts and circumstances within his knowledge that make for the advantage of defendant secundus counterinterrogation may be necessary and such counterinterrogation defendant secundus has had no opportunity of administering but if in behalf of the plaintiff and as against defendant secundus defendant primus has been examined in the character of a witness—if pro tanto his testimony has been extracted from him in the shape of depositions as above explained—he having been examined as against defendant secundus in the character of a witness defendant secundus has had or at least might have had and ought to have had the faculty of counterinterrogating him of performing upon him that operation which by an abuse of words is called in equity language crossexamination just as if it were the same operation that in commonlaw procedure goes by that name upon exactly the same plan how imperfect soever in which the operation so denominated is performed upon an extraneous witness suppose two plaintiffs and suppose either defendant say as before defendant primus to be examined at the instance of plaintiff primus as against plaintiff secundus the case may be much the same as the last by the interrogatories put in the bill and therefore put by both as much of the facts and circumstances as make in favour of the one will have been extracted as of those which make in favour of the other true if he to whom the truth taken in its totality is believed by him to be adverse will consent to the interrogations     necessary to the complete extraction of it but such candour is too much to be in every case expected suppose then a failure of union in this respect—the resource will be on the one hand an examination performed on defendant primus on the footing of a witness at the instance of plaintiff primus as against plaintiff secundus on the other hand crossexamination of the same defendantwitness by plaintiff secundus now then in regard to interest some interest opposite to that of the plaintiff defendant primus must have or be liable to have else even though the cause were what in equity law is called an amicable one there could be no cause but it may be that—though the two defendants have each of them an interest opposite to that of the plaintiff—defendant primus as to some point in dispute between the plaintiff and defendant secundus has an interest of his own opposite to that of defendant secundus in this case supposing the interest to be of that sort which in equity law ranks under that name—and supposing the interest to be of that nature that by defendant primuss deposing to the prejudice of the interest of defendant secundus the interest of defendant primus would be served—the allowance of an objection to the admission of the testimony of defendant primus would if made on the part of defendant secundus be consistent enough with the general principle but now let it be at the instance of defendant secundus that the testimony of defendant primus is called for and let the interest of defendant primus be such that by delivering the testimony so called for his own interest would be disserved would an objection on the score of interest lie in the mouth of defendant primus whose testimony is thus called for to his own prejudice and against his own will with the general principle which gives to every man in the character of plaintiff the remedy by bill against every other man in the character of plaintiff such objection would certainly not harmonize for among the distinguishing features of equity law one of the most characteristic is the affording to the plaintiff that power which the gentle hand of common law will not trust him with—the power of extracting testimony in his favour from the bosom of his adversary but—on the ground of another principle acted upon at least if not openly recognised in equity law—testimony adverse to the interest of a defendant ought not to be extracted at the instance of any codefendant—at the instance of any person but a plaintiff from a plaintiff testimony is not allowed by equity law to be extracted in any shape by or at the instance of a defendant why should that of a defendant be allowed to be thus extracted by or at the instance of another defendant not from a plaintiff because were that allowed the lawyers would be defrauded of the benefit of another cause under the name of a cross cause how should it therefore from a codefendant would not a loss of the same nature be incurred it would not be called a cross cause indeed but so long as it had the beneficial properties names would not be worth thinking about the man of law is not consistent in anything—not even in rapacity where at the instance of a defendant the plaintiff is to be examined they will not suffer it to be done without a cause on purpose where at the instance of a defendant another defendant is to be examined it may perhaps not have occurred to them to discover the same impediments chapter v probable origin of the above exclusionary rules we may now take our leave of the two latin maxims under which when laid together little less than the whole subject of the present book may be comprehended—   nemo debet esse testis in propriâ causâ   nemo tenetur scipsum prodere of each of them we see that—   in the character of a general declarative proposition undertaking to represent the actual state of the established law it is notoriously false it swerves most widely and notoriously from the truth   that when compared with the ends of justice and the dictates of utility in that behalf it is in so far as the fact declared by it is true deplorably pernicious   that in delivering these rules each of them as true without exception as blackstone for example and so many others have done they have uttered so many most palpable and notorious untruths trusting—for     the reception of the propositions in the character of true propositions and for their own escape from the disgrace generally and worthily attached to improbity in that disgraceful shape—to the confusion in which the subject has been involved by their arts and to that general and indefatigably cultivated ignorance by which all who do not stand engaged by sinister interest to defend and propagate the misrepresentation are debarred and disqualified from detecting it   that in favour of the rule pretending to oppose an effectual bar to selfdisserving under the name of selfbetraying testimony the plea of humanity and tenderness is a mere pretence   that by the unhappy success with which this pretence has been played off a most pernicious and widely spread correspondent superstition has been propagated and rooted in the public mind insomuch that the people having been generally duped by this imposture have been to such a degree deceived as to regard with emotions of respect and gratitude the treachery by which their dearest interests have thus been sacrificed the truth of the above propositions is it is presumed tolerably well established but being thus mischievous how came it to be established by what considerations did it recommend itself to the minds of those by whom it has been established interest sinister interest though in every country it will account so satisfactorily for the jurisprudential system will not afford a separate account for every particular arrangement in some instances interest would really be neuter in others its indications might fail of being perceived and wherever there is nothing to be got by thwarting public opinion there is everything to be saved by conforming to it the maxims or general propositions to which the most extensively applicable notions of jurisprudential law have been consigned have owed their origin when not to official and sinister interest to some play of the affections or the imagination—to some antipathy sympathy or caprice—now and then to some view of utility though almost always either too scanty or too wide for the times when these maxims have been formed have been times of inexperience—times in which for want of the requisite mass of experience something was omitted that required to be either added to the extent of the proposition or subtracted from it ere it could be rendered commensurate to the exigency of the public interest on that ground suppose the maxim to have had its root in general utility by the inordinate extent assumed by it it would spread far beyond the root including particular propositions in abundance for which no root could be found either on the ground of utility or any other from the observation of the prevalence of selfregarding interest in every human bosom a principle upon which the individual and the species depend for their preservation and of the undesirable influence which this principle was so apt to exercise upon human testimony—judges—men delegated by the sovereign to dispose of the fate of others for whom they had no regard sometimes by punishing their offences sometimes by terminating their disputes—formed to themselves at an early period this general proposition or maxim—no man ought to be a witness in his own cause it is susceptible of more senses than one but in no sense would it ever have gained footing had it not been for the indifference of those by whom it was applied to its effect upon the feelings and interests of those to whose concerns it was applied at bottom in the breast of the judge by whom it was first broached it could have had no more warrantable origin whether he were or were not aware of it than that of a desire to save his own time and trouble for be he who he may—let his existence have occupied this or that portion of space and time—what he could not but be conscious of is that in those instances in which having a real interest in forming a right decision he has felt a real anxiety to render it conformable to the truth of the case—in a word as often as in the character of the father or master of a family he has been really solicitous to come at the truth and the whole truth—his conduct has never been such as this maxim prescribes pursue its application to the daily concerns of a family and extend it to every family you will find it incompatible with the     existence of the species for any considerable length of time whatever was the real reason—the ostensible reason the reason assigned to the public is evident enough the danger of deception—the danger lest the judgment of the judge should be misled by testimony issuing from a source from which it was so liable to receive a direction deviating from the path of truth the only path that leads to justice in this way the system of exclusion first introduced itself attaching upon both parties in a cause defendant as well as plaintiff but in the first instance and with greatest effect upon the plaintiff with whom every suit originates upon the testimony of the plaintiff considered as proffered by himself by favour of the weakness of the human mind and the indistinctness and variability of language—under the influence of supervening circumstances—maxims more especially maxims of jurisprudence have received an extension sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse by the maxim of english constitutional law the king can do no wrong nothing more was probably meant by the first framer of it than to express the inviolability of that functionary under favour of the ambiguity of the sense attached to the word can some opposition lawyer of the day took occasion by a happy exertion of professional art to graft upon that manifestation of power a declaration of impotence had lawyercraft never exerted itself to any worse purpose the demand for these pages would never have existed from the observation of the perturbation that would naturally manifest itself in the countenance of a malefactor when questioned on the subject of his misdeeds some judge actuated by misapplied compassion or possibly by corrupt partiality or society in guilt took occasion to desist from the inquiry grounding the dereliction perhaps on a new and strained interpretation of the maxim no man ought to be a witness in his own cause if the practice originally rested on that ground it did not long remain there since a fresh ground was made for it in the narrower and more apposite maxim no man is bound to criminate—or in language more rhetorical more delusive and therefore better adapted to the purpose to accuse—himself be this as it may the system of exclusions came in this way to be extended to the testimony of a defendant considered as called for against his will by his adversary the plaintiff or by the judge the case thus far under consideration is a simple case parties at most but two one on a side in a suit of the criminal kind instituted and carried on by the judge alone without the intervention of any individual in the character of plaintiff the number of the parties is even reduced to one in a case thus simple—so far as exclusion takes place—there can be no room for doubt as far as utility or the semblance of it is concerned in which quarter that is in which of the two maxims above mentioned the prohibition originates is it by the party himself that the judge is called upon to receive his testimony fear of deception is the reason or the pretence and the maxim is no man ought to be a witness in his own cause is it by the adverse party that the judge is called upon to receive and as it is not in the nature of the case that it should be delivered willingly to compel the testimony fear of vexation is the reason or the pretence and the maxim is no man is bound—or no man ought to be bound—to criminate accuse or to slide it on to noncriminal cases hurt harm injure prejudice himself but for this long time causes have from time to time appeared of a more complicated texture causes presenting either on one side and on either side or even on both sides parties in greater number two or a number indefinitely greater but on this occasion for exemplification two will serve as well as twenty suppose two on each side what is to be done here apply the true reason fear of deception fear of vexation you will now find cases in which they will not hold no matter the maxim is framed it has attained its full growth it has taken root of itself it has become familiar to many a tongue the head containing which saw no reason for it nor ever thought it worth while to look for one if this be so on this ground then we must look for the origin of the practice in one or other of the two maxims giving up the idea of looking for a reason in the conduct of men to whom it never occurred to look for a reason—to look for anything beyond the rule   0 part vi of disguised exclusions chapter i exclusion of evidence for want of multiplicity §   impropriety of exclusion on this ground on the several preceding grounds the impropriety of the practice of excluding evidence has been rendered i am inclined to think sufficiently apparent if so on the present ground it must be much more palpable in those cases a cause of suspicion and for the most part not an illgrounded one exists and the error consists in employing exclusion where watchfulness alone would have been the proper remedy in the present instance not so much as the slightest cause of suspicion is so much as fancied to exist and yet a man is excluded without mercy excluded and for what reason for this and this alone that another man having it in his power to give evidence pertinent to the case is not to be found when suspicion is the ground of exclusion the assumption is that some men i e all men belonging to any of the suspected classes are liars where want of multiplicity of evidence is the ground the assumption is that all men—all men without exception are in this unhappy case take any two men men of the most trustworthy complexion as well in respect of individual character as in respect of station in life take these two men if a demand for their testimony happens to be presented by two different causes they are both of them incorrigible liars and neither of them ought to be heard if on the contrary the like demand happens to be produced by one and the same cause both of them ought to be heard—both these liars become good witnesses i have already had occasion to remark the incongruity of the laws taking upon itself to know more and that in all cases of the degree of credit due to evidence than those who have the evidence before their eyes here the incongruity is still greater in the case of the inadmissibility—the incapacitation the judge or jury have not formed any opinion because they have not been allowed to hear the grounds on which and on which alone an opinion could have been formed in the case of the requisition of two witnesses they have heard evidence and such evidence as hath appeared satisfactory to their minds the jury are satisfied the judge is satisfied the prosecutor is satisfied the advisers of the crown are satisfied everybody who has had any opportunity of knowing anything of the matter is satisfied it is in the midst of all this satisfaction that the legislator who knows nothing about the matter who has no possibility of knowing anything about the matter chooses to remain unsatisfied he chooses rather to suppose that a witness whom he knows nothing about is purjured and a jury a judge a set of ministers whom he knows as little about deceived than than that one accused person about whom he knows as little and whom all these persons have concurred in believing guilty was really so in speaking of the witness i say perjured and such accordingly is the supposition and the only supposition proceeded upon in the case upon which this provision has been grounded for as to any particular danger which the witness may be supposed to be under of having fallen into an involuntary mistake there is nothing in any of the cases in which this regulation has been ever applied to warrant any such supposition nor is the regulation ever supported on any such ground such then is the supposition which the legislator chooses as the most probable that one man of whom he knows nothing has made himself guilty of perjury—a man whom all who have had the opportunity of knowing anything about him concur in believing innocent—rather than that another man whom all who have heard the case concur in believing guilty was guilty of another offence thus much as to the impropriety and inconsistency of the rule next as to its mischievousness in comparison as before with the rules by which an exclusion is put upon witnesses of a particular sort in the latter case the witness or witnesses on whose persons or in whose presence a malefactor is allowed to commit whatever crimes or other offences he pleases must to give the malefactor the benefit of the licence be taken out of the suspected classes in the present case all individuals without exception are allowed to be pitched upon as victims or witnesses in a particular state of things it is true the mischief is greater in those cases than in this in those cases the number of witnesses in whose presence the crime or other offence is allowed to be committed is without stint     on the present ground the number of witnesses in whose presence it is lawful to commit the crime or other offence extends not beyond one but the facility given to delinquency by the removal of the restriction in respect to number in those cases will scarcely be found to be equal to that which is afforded by the removal of all restrictions in respect of quality in the present case the accomplice who is sufficient to enable a man to commit the crime not being sufficient to produce by the testimony of his lips his conviction of and for such crime—each malefactor has thus a ticket of exemption to dispose of in favour of any associate who may be disposed to join with him in any forbidden enterprise thus much as to the effect of the exclusion in causes of a penal nature in regard to those of a nonpenal complexion the effect is still the same in kind varying only in respect of the importance of the cause following the same rules the task of giving it a separate exemplification under this separate head may be dispensed with such is the price paid for the security in question viz for the difference in point of danger between the case where there are two witnesses in proof of guilt and the case in which there is but one such is the price paid for this security and after all what is it worth in the multitude of counsellors says the proverb there is safety in the multitude of witnesses there may be some sort of safety but nothing more it is by weight full as much as by tale that witnesses are to be judged pondere non numero from numbers the particulars of the case out of the question no just conclusion can be formed nothing can be weaker than the best security that can be derived from numbers in many cases a single witness by the simplicity and clearness of his narrative by the probability and consistency of the incidents he relates by their agreement with other matters of fact too notorious to stand in need of testimony—a single witness especially if situation and character be taken into account will be enough to stamp conviction on the most reluctant mind in other instances a cloud of witnesses though all were to the same fact will be found wanting in the balance there is no man conversant with the business of the bar whose experience has not presented him with instances of dozens of witnesses opposed to each other in the same cause line against line and whose testimony has been of such a nature that howsoever it may have been in regard to mendacity falsehood must have been on one side or the other naval trials are pregnant with instances in favour of this remark according to hume on the subject of an engagement between blake and tromp the unanimous testimony of the english captains was contradicted by the unanimous testimony of the dutch let any man read the trials of keppel palliser or molloy and then say whether security resides in numbers let me not be mistaken i do not mean to insinuate it would be absurdity to insinuate that the requisition of a second witness adds nothing to the security against perjury no doubt but that the greater the number of witnesses you require the greater the security against perjury all contend for is that that security be it greater or less is not so necessary as that you should pay so great a price for it as you do pay and must pay by the licence you thereby grant to commit the crime in the presence and with the aid of any one reason says montesquien requires two witnesses because a witness who affirms and a party accused who demes make assertion against assertion and it requires a third to turn the scale this by way of proof of the proposition immediately preceding—the laws which cause a man to perish upon the deposition of a single witness are fatal to liberty this observation short as it is teems with errors   the equality maintained turns upon this supposition and no other viz that it is as unlikely that a person accused being guilty should aver himself to be innocent as that a party accused being innocent an accuser should aver him to be guilty in other words that it is as likely a man should violate truth for the purpose of injuring an innocent person as for the purpose of saving himself such is the supposition but surely nothing can be more ill grounded the assertion of the witness amounts to something—the denial of the accused amounts to almost nothing for he speaks under the terror of the law which devotes him to certain punishment in the event of his not denying   another error is the supposing that any rational conclusion can be drawn from the mere circumstance of number as between accusers and defendants without taking into the account the particular circumstances of each case†   a third incongruity is the confounding     the case of witnesses with that of judges for though witnesses are the persons he speaks of the situation he places them in is that of judges   a fourth incongruity is the making up the proposition and the demonstration in such a manner as not to fit one another in point of extent in consequence of which want of just coincidence nothing can be concluded—the case necessarily supposed extends over no more than one of the two divisions into which the field of law is divided—viz the criminal and the reason is one that applies to civil as well as to criminal though it appears not that montesquieu was aware of the application the occasion to which his view seems to have been confined the only occasion specified is still narrower—that subdivision of the criminal law which concerns offences that have been punished with the punishment of death he might have been right in saying that laws which cause a man to perish upon the evidence of a single witness are fatal to liberry and yet not right if he were to extend the same observation to cases in which death was not included in the punishment the expression cause to perish—font périr—would of itself be sufficient to ease the case of the weight of montesquieus authority if authority were capable of weighing against reason it alludes to all appearance to the practice of the roman law the law under which he had been used to act which makes conviction and thence in capital cases death a necessary consequence of the adverse deposition of two witnesses—leaving no option to the judge another circumstance that contributes to lighten the case of the weight of his authority is that the trials to which alone he had been used and which alone he can be understood to have had in view were trials in the judges closet without a jury and on which crossexamination on the part of the accused was but imperfectly allowed—crossexamination by his counsel not allowed fatal to liberty what means liberty what can be concluded from a proposition one of the terms of which is so vague what my own meaning is i know and i hope the reader knows it too security is the political blessing i have in view security as against malefactors on one hand—security as against the instruments of government on the other security in both these branches of it is the benefit the making due provision for which in the case in question is the object of these inquiries where two witnesses have been required the principle of determination is obvious enough it has been the fear of giving birth to the conviction and punishment of innocent persons if in each case the testimony of a single witness were held sufficient engrossed by the view of this danger the attention has overlooked the so much greater danger on the other side for a single witness to produce by his testimony the conviction of an innocent person it is not sufficient that false testimony on the side of conviction should have been given—it must also have obtained credit with the judge it must have produced in his mind a degree of persuasion of sufficient strength for the purpose but even among the vilest of malefactors as i have already had occasion to state nothing is more uncommon than false testimony on the inculpative side what the argument supposes is that falsehood will prevail ever truth falsehood on the inculpative side over truth on the exculpative the giving security to the innocent is the object and final cause of this illconsidered scruple of what description of the innocent of those and those alone to whom by false testimony it might happen to be subjected to prosecution in a court of justice on the other hand those to whom in consequence of the licence granted by this same rule it might happen and if the rule were universally known could not but happen to suffer the same or worse punishment at the hands of malefactors are altogether overlooked the innocent who scarcely present themselves by so much as scores or dozens engross the whole attention and pass for the whole world the innocent who ought to have presented themselves by millions are overlooked and left out of the account it is to this illconsidered scruple that the european nations have been indebted for the use of what is technically called torture i mean in the most usual and most exceptionable     application of it the testimony of a single witness was not sufficient for the conviction of a defendant but in a case capitally punished it was sufficient to warrant the applying torture to him for the purpose of compelling a confession combined with this tremendous exercise of severity what then was the effect of this false tenderness—in some cases to produce by dint of terror a not very satisfactory confession in other cases to add to the regular punishment this accidental and unnecessary torment in here and there an instance to enable a guilty man by patience under torment to escape death the ultimate punishment in cases in which he would have been subjected to it under the english mode of procedure under the best system of jurisprudence it must happen now and then though under the worst i believe it to be extremely rare that a man completely innocent shall suffer as for a capital crime in these deplorable cases under the english system which admits the grounding conviction on a single witness the innocent victim will suffer the instantaneous and in a manner insensible infliction and no more under the general law of the continent wherever the application above spoken of under the name of torture was in use the unhappy innocent would suffer death in whatever was its prescribed form but with the previous addition of a state of torment more terrible than twenty deaths unless to free himself from it he could succeed in inventing a credible though false narrative of guilt in the complication and intricacy of the discussions of which a rule requiring a multiplicity of evidence will naturally not to say necessarily be pregnant—in this though comparatively a minor inconvenience will be found a certain degree of force assuming that a multiplicity of evidence is necessary how is it that it must or may be composed say that there must be at least two witnesses the difficulty is in appearance at least in a considerable degree obviated happy would it be for the interests of truth and justice if the task of decision were attended with no other difficulty than that which attends the distinguishing of two individuals from one but where nature has made not an atom of difficulty lawyers will make a mountain where common sense would not find a speck to disturb the clearness of the case science i mean always jurisprudential science will find means to raise a cloud two witnesses—good but to what fact if one of them be to the principal fact may not another be to an evidentiary fact—his testimony constituting a presumption in the language of the romanists or in fine in consideration of the number might not two presumptions since there are two of them suffice then comes in the question though in language much less clear—what in all cases and in the case in hand is the principal fact what an evidentiary fact two witnesses again—good but in what shape must or may their evidence be exhibited it one be a witness examined as such in the regular judicial mode may not the place of the other be supplied by a lot of written evidence especially if it be of a nature so superiorly trustworthy as those several species of written evidence which come under the head of preappointed evidence—a deed an entry in a register a judicial record of any kind or again—considering how great the security for trustworthiness derivable from number—may not one of the two pieces of evidence be of some one or of any one of the species of inferior evidence which have been brought together under the general denomination of makeshift evidence or—if one such piece of inferior evidence added to the regularly extracted testimony of an unexceptionable witness be not sufficient—may not the deficiency be supplied by two or three or any and what greater number of these inferior evidences and of any and what sort or sorts and in short if the number of these lighter and makeweight evidences be to a certain and what degree considerable may not their abundance supersede altogether the necessity of a lot of heavier evidence a piece of written evidence again—say a conveyance bipartite to which there is a grantor and a grantee with or without one or more attesting witnesses the evidence presented by this instrument—is it the evidence of one witness only or of more and how many more all these difficulties with abundance more may be started as some of them have been started from the rule laying down the necessity of two witnesses and in any or at least in some of these ways may the number required have been made up without any violence to common sense all these reasonable modes of splitting hairs have not yet sufficed to exercise the industry of lawyers not content with splitting hairs they have proceeded to split men out of one and the same man they have made two witnesses when one man of law has laid down a foolish rule—an illconsidered and palpably pernicious rule—his successor not to fall into the sin of the sons of noah and uncover a fathers nakedness makes his obeisance to the rule throws a cloak over it makes a leak in it and according to the measure of his dexterity draws out the force and efficacy of it we shall see presently when we come to speak of the roman law to what a degree of refinement this policy has been pursued in the present instance such then is the precept which excludes     one witness for the want of other witnesses impropriety inconsistency mischievousness are the qualities which characterize it exceptions however in appearance at least are not altogether wanting to the mischievousness of it   one is the case where from the nature of things witnesses principal witnesses in numbers cannot have been wanting the scene for example in a spot where individuals cannot but have been collected in multitudes a place of worship a theatre a marketplace in markettime a fair a barrack a dockyard a parade in such a state of things what harm it may be asked can result from the requisition of two or even of three witnesses i answer—seldom any harm but never any advantage the case in which the restriction would be proposed will naturally be rather a penal than a nonpenal one quarrel smuggling embezzlement sedition riot the side to which the restriction is applied will as naturally be that of the plaintiff the object real or pretended will be the security of innocence—the preservation of obnoxious innocence from the enterprises of oppressive power but if on the supposition of guiltiness the facility of finding witnesses qualified to make proof of the affirmative is so great on the other hand on the supposition of nonguiltiness the facility of finding witnesses qualified to make proof of the negative will at least be equally so the consequence is—granting the exclusion to be harmless it will still be useless not that it always will be harmless the publicity of the place does not necessarily suppose the publicity of the act a secret blow or wound may be given—a secret word of insult or conspiracy whispered—a secret act of pilfering committed or attempted as well in the most crowded apartment as in the wildest desert in some instances the closeness and bustle of the throng will even be favourable to secrecy another observation the multiplicity of percipient witnesses how great soever is not always sufficient to secure so much as a single deposing witness still less any greater number let ten persons have seen what passed—if they be all of them ill disposed to the plaintiffs side or well disposed to that of the defendant it may happen that none shall have given spontaneous information to the plaintiff none but such as on being questioned with a view to prosecution and before the commencement of prosecution and consequently without those securities for veracity which are afforded by examination coram judice may have given an account purposely false although the same persons if examined upon oath and under the controul of the concomitant securities would not go the length of seeking to accomplish their wishes by perjurious evidence   another seeming exception may be composed of the cases in which it may appear that the mischief of the offence depends if not altogether at least in a considerable degree on the number of the persons present at the commission of it such are those in which the mischief consists in the wound given to the psychological sensibilities of the persons present by acts or discourses offensive to their affections or their taste acts or discourses savouring of indecency discourses expressive of contempt for any of the objects of their worship or respect—for the established religion for the established government and in particular for the person of the chief magistrate where there is one especially if invested with the rank of royalty the greater the number of the persons present on any such occasion the greater the danger of mischief in each of two opposite ways if in the company in question there be any to whom the obnoxious exhibition or the discourse is offensive the mischief of the act respects the present pain of which it is productive if there be any by whom it is regarded with complacency it becomes mischievous on another account on account of the danger lest by the spread of the same obnoxious practice or sentiment the shock given to mens feelings may become more and more extensive by requiring that in support of a prosecution of this sort there shall be two witnesses at least or three witnesses at least provision it may appear is made that for the act to be converted into a punishable offence there shall have been present at the commission of it at least that number of persons that among the effects of an arrangement of this sort may occasionally be found that of operating as a check to overindustrious antipathies and that check a salutary one is not to be denied but that this is the most proper mode of applying such a check cannot be admitted if a regard for the liberty of private intercourse forbids the treating the act on the footing of an offence unless a certain number of persons be present at the commission of it the direct and proper mode is to say so at once to word the condition in such a manner as to apply it not to the number of persons appearing in the character of deposing witnesses but to the number of persons existing at the time in the character of percipient witnesses a consideration which there has already been occasion to bring to view is that amidst any abundance of persons present in the character of percipient witnesses there may be a scarcity or even an absolute want of deposing witnesses the two characters are therefore by no means either identical or convertible another consideration is that unless the objection be obviated by a special provision the function of a deposing witness may be performed     by a person who was not a percipient witness—who was not present at the commission of the offence as where the evidence stands in the relation of a discourse of the confessorial kind held by the party accused or where in any other shape it wears the character of circumstantial evidence from an institution improper in the main useful results may flow by accident that in this way occasional good may result from the species of exclusion here contended against is not to be denied in this way the mischievousness of it may now and then receive occasional palliation thus much may be said but this is all that ever can be said in favour of it in this way as in every other the effect of an institution putting exclusion upon evidence upon the plaintiffs side is to enervate the substantive law to which it applies so far as the substantive law is bad so far according to an observation we found occasion to make in a former instance any such debilitating institution in the line of adjective law may be of service so far therefore as it may be possible to confine the drag the adjective incumbrance to a perniciously active law so far that which is in general a nuisance may have a particular use amidst the pulling and hauling so frequently exemplified in legislative bodies it not unfrequently happens that a party which has not power enough to stop the wheel altogether finds means in this way to attach a drag to it but the very circumstance that constitutes the utility of the institution in these particular cases is its mischievousness in all others the proper remedy is not the establishment of the bad adjective law but the abolition of the bad substantive law in the case of capital punishment but in that alone the mosaic law requires two witnesses from that source perhaps was derived the european rule i should look upon this provision as a great improvement if introduced in england why not as deeming the requisition of two witnesses a proper one but as deeming the punishment of death an improper punishment to authorize such punishment if three witnesses were made requisite so much the better if three dozen better still but from the necessity of two witnesses to authorize the infliction of death in the character of a punishment what follows not that in case of one witness and but one acquittal should take place but that some other punishment should take place different from and thereby inferior to capital §   aberrations of roman and english law in this respect in the roman law two witnesses are pronounced indispensable in the penal branch the higher part at least what followed torture by fewer than two witnesses a man was not to be consigned to death but by a single witness he might at all times be consigned to worse than death if then being guilty he had it in his power to relate and circumstantiate a guilty act at any time if he thought fit he might at the price of future suffering release himself from present torments but if not being guilty and in consequence not having it in his power to circumstantiate the guilty act he had it not in his power to release himself at that price he was to suffer on perishing or not perishing under or in consequence of the infliction as it might happen upon the face of it and probably enough in the intention of the framers the object of this institution was the protection of innocence the protection of guilt and the aggravation of the pressure upon innocence was the real fruit of it in the nonpenal branch the experienced mischievousness of the rule forced men upon another shift of which if the mischievousness be not so serious the absurdity is more glaring i mean the contrivance already hinted at—the operation of splitting one man into two witnesses proposing to himself to make a customer or noncustomer pay for what he has had or not had—a shopkeeper makes in his own books an entry of the delivery of the goods accordingly and by this entry he makes himself one witness a suit is then instituted by himself against the supposed customer for the value of the goods he now takes an oath in a prescribed form swearing to the justness of the supposed debt and by this oath he coins himself into a second witness—the second witness which the law requires by the same rule if three had been the requisite complement of witnesses two such oaths might have completed it if four witnesses three oaths and so on with a splitting mill of such power at his command a man need never be at a loss for witnesses in every cause the plaintiff to gain it must make full proof probatio plena the tradesmans books make half a full proof probatio semiplena his oath as above his suppletory oath it is called makes the other half sixteen paragraphs before in the book of authority from which for reference sake the instance has been taken the reader has been assured and that without exception and in the most pointed terms that a halffull proof though composed of the testimony regularly extracted of a disinterested witness of the most illustrious and consequently trustworthy class goes absolutely for nothing†     from this inexhaustible source of inconsistency and injustice the english law the jurisprudential branch of it at least is free i say the jurisprudential part for on this and that occasion the legislator has interposed and required two witnesses from the first of edward vi to the thirtyfirst of the late reign inclusive seventyfour exemplifications of this unwarranted and perfectly inconsistent scrupulosity may be counted if anything like principle or reason for the distinction were looked for in this catalogue the search would be in vain if in this or that instance a seeming reason of the nature of those above displayed and refuted glimmers through the cloud at the next step the light deserts us altogether in several instances cases naturally more sparing of evidence than any others present themselves as having been selected for the requisition of this superfluity of evidence as if for the express purpose of exposing the substantive law to derision poaching smuggling gaming nocturnal destruction forgery bribery and extortion are of the number bribery has in this way received the protection of the law on three several occasions and on these occasions so effectually has the cankerworm eaten out the substance of the law that it is difficult to say by what means the corrupter or the corrupted the giver or taker of the bribe can possibly be convicted unless they were to join in laying in a stock of evidence for the purpose ambitious of martyrdom in so honourable a cause consistency or any steadier principle than the passion of the individual and the moment not being to be found in any part of the existing chaos—it were in vain to look for any such treasures amidst the scraps of legislation tacked together by so casual a tie the sphinx would have broken her neck a hundred times over before she had discovered why for convicting a man of abusing insulting or obstructing a set of halfyearly officers composing what is called a jury of annoyance† it should require double the quantity of evidence in westminster to what it would require on the inside of temple bar or on the other side of the thames this for one but the same narrowness and the same shallowness may be seen in all the other seventythree instances by the single testimony of a selfacknowledged malefactor—of a character stained with the blackest infamy swearing to save his life and put money into his pocket any man without exception may be consigned to capital punishment and with this case every day repeating itself before his eyes shall a legislator when a fresh patch comes to be put upon the motley tissue stand up in his place and say nay but upon this occasion justice and humanity call upon us to require two witnesses among the cases in which under english law two witnesses are required to support a conviction is that of high treason if in some ancient book of travels in some such country as monomotapa or among the amazons or topinambous we were to read of a people who were governed by a king but among whom it was lawful for any man at any time to kill the king provided no more than one person were privy to the fact or in the company of any number of persons being persons of certain descriptions—we should be apt to reject it at once as fabulous and fabulous to a degree of extravagance were a poet to come out with a play in which the plot turned upon the supposition of such a law we should turn aside from it as grounded on an improbability too glaring even for fable we should rank it with the story of that monarchy which held out the highest of rewards for the successive assassination of every monarch that sat upon the throne by bestowing the throne itself upon the assassin for his reward human blindness has not yet since the saxon times gone so far as to offer a secure reward together with impunity for the assassination of the sovereign in this enlightened country it goes no further than to offer impunity—impunity indeed only in certain cases but those such as are constantly liable to occur it might be worth the consideration of the gentlemen of the long robe and no incompetent subject for the exercise of their ingenuity whether the king be a man and whether george gwelph commonly called george the fourth may not have as good a claim to the protection of the law against assassination as john brown or thomas smith and whether accordingly if any partaker or abettor of any popgun plot past or future successful or unsuccessful were to be arraigned for shooting or shooting at the said george gwelph the court would be obliged to take notice that the said george gwelph happens to be king of great britain for the purpose of affording impunity to his murderers or intended murderers it seems for this purpose high time to know whether the king be a man or not and were it to be determined by the twelve judges for example in the negative it might then     be not amiss to inquire whether it might not be advisable to strip him of a part of his royalty—of so much of his royalty as excludes him from the protection given to all other men for the purpose of declaring that neither shooting him not shooting at him should be punishable picking a pocket of a handkerchief value one shilling is capital felony its being the kings pocket does not make it treason for picking the kings pocket of his handkerchief a man might be hanged on the testimony of a single witness shooting the king being treason a man may shoot the king in the presence of anybody he pleases and not a hair of the murderers head can be touched for it blessed laws under which it is as safe again to shoot the king as to pick his pocket† so long as this regulation subsists a law which taking up any of those offences against personal security which in the case of an individual are capital felonies should in the case of its being levelled against the person of the sovereign declare it to be high treason would instead of adding anything to the personal security of the sovereign diminish it by at least one half—leave it in respect of such offences but half as great as it was before‡ this consequence will not be intelligible to a legal understanding to such an understanding it will be impossible ever to comprehend how so highsounding a word as treason especially with the word high before it should fail of giving a better security than any that can be given by so ordinary a word as felony i would never allow myself to entertain a hope of rendering the proposition intelligible to a lord chiefjustice or an attorneygeneral but i should have no doubt of its being understood at the first word by the man who blacks their shoes but this provision forms part of a statute of king william∥ and that statute is an excellent statute it forms a link and a most valuable one of the chain of securities framed for the subject in the course of that illustrious reign this is the grand argument and here stands the stronghold of prejudice declamation and commonplace were i to be forced to say whether jet and snow are black and yes or no were the only answer that would be admitted i should find myself a little puzzled were i asked in like manner whether this be a good statute or no i should be puzzled in the same way if i were obliged to give an answer i suppose it would be in the affirmative but were the benefit of a distinction to be allowed me i would most certainly pick this clause out of the statute and an answer in favour of the remainder would not he heavy upon my conscience this clause whatever may be thought of it by itself if ever it has been thought of by itself it is natural should derive no small degree of favour from the good company in which it has been always found how far it is entitled to any such favour by its own merits has been pretty fully seen the statute is indeed a statute of king william it was passed by king william but as to this clause at least with equal truth may it be said to have been passed against as by that useful and meritorious but ungracious and illbeloved king it was forced upon him by the party who at that very time     were plotting all of them his expulsion and many of them his death it was accordingly so constructed with the benefit of this clause that besides the protection it afforded to the innocent it afforded most ample protection to whoever might have numbered themselves or might be disposed to number themselves among the guilty looking at this clause of it before i had adverted to the history of the time i wanted no farther proof to say to myself the design of it seems to be to make men as safe in all treasonable conspiracies and practices as possible turning afterwards for curiositys sake to bishop burnets history of his own time i found the same thing said already in the same words so said bishop burnet but little did the good bishop know though we know now half the ground there was for saying so no wonder the parliament should have been overpowered by disaffection when the cabinet was governed by if not exclusively composed of traitors no wonder that the necessity of two witnesses to conviction was contended for with so much anxiety—was put at the head of this protecting statute a minister might thus correspond as so many ministers were then actually corresponding with the exiled king by single emissaries and be safe turn to the papers which macpherson has brought to light read over the names of the marlboroughs the russels the newcastles the leedss the normanbys the shrewsburys the godolphins the sunderlands the abingdons and i know not whom besides we shall see how far this licence was from lying unemployed as to the other provisions then all of them have their merit some of them were no more than the removal of barefaced injustice but as to this it was specially levelled not against false accusations but against true ones the consequences are instructive nowhere can reasonings receive a stronger confirmation from events scarce had the legislature passed the act when the incongruity of this part of it stared them in the face a conspiracy broke out—a conspiracy of the reality of which no one ever entertained a doubt—a conspiracy confessed afterwards by the conspirators and for the proof of this conspiracy at the trial no more than one witness could be found i speak of sir john fenwicks case two witnesses the case had happened to afford but one of them goodman between the finding of the bill and what would have been the period of the trial the friends of the defendant got hold of bought off and sent out of the way what was to be done the case was flagrant the nation called for justice an act of attainder was passed grounded on that same insufficient evidence proscription was resorted to because justice had been made impracticable the flaw that had been made was to be covered but the covering was a cobweb of the moment which left the flaw just as it was for the benefit of future traitors the mischief was permanent—we are saddled with it to this day the remedy was momentary nor at the moment for which it served was there an argument for it that did not prove the incongruity of the law which had created the demand for it under rules of law which had they been calculated for the express purpose of the destruction of society could scarce have been better adapted to it than they are how is it that society is kept together the question presents itself at every page and the answer is still the same—by the unintelligibility and inaccessibility of those rules—by the darkness of the chaos of which they form a part it is on the being known that what there is good in the system of law depends for its effect it is by the being unknown that the mischief of what there is bad in that system is diminished one abuse finds its corrective its palliative at least in another each particular abuse in one enormous universal one each weakness not in a corroborative application but in another weakness each particular negligence not in particular vigilance but in general negligence if society hangs together in the manner which we see it is not so much by what the law does as by the expectation of what it will do grounded on the conception of what it ought to do fascinated by a variety of prejudices pernicious in one point of view salutary in another—a man from conceiving that the law ought to do so and so concludes that so in each individual case it will do the affirmative conclusion is most favourable to the tranquillity of society the negative would probably be found in most cases the one must conformable to the truth in the case of the particular exclusion now under consideration i will venture to suggest a few possible modes of remedying the mischief if these remedies should appear to have little to recommend them in the eye of reason and common sense it will be only because they are cut as closely as possible to the rich pattern of the common law one expedient might be the having in every court of penal jurisdiction a wooden evidence or man of straw under some such name as that of the common witness or common vouchee whose office it should be to vouch for the truth of every deposition given by a single witness in the event of his not having the support of a special evidence of his own kind if as in the case of a common recovery indemnification may be given where there is no property why may not evidence as well be given where there is no knowledge     the testimony of a dumb witness is as good as that of a speaking one and there needs not the skill of a kempel a droz or a merlin to make a wooden or a straw witness capable of kissing the book and giving the requisite tokens of affirmation if extraordinary powers of digestion should be thought requisite for the oath merlin has an anthropomorphic stoneeater ready made if the expense of the attesting puppet should be grudged the part of the puppet might be enacted by a living person such as the crier of the court the same respectable person who for so many centuries has supported the character of the common vouchee or indemniticator general in the common pleas so much to the satisfaction of the best judges it might be objected to this expedient on a hasty view that this on the part of a living witness would be perjury and that it would be an indecent mockery a gross profanation and a practice subversive of the foundations of justice were a judge thus openly to lend his countenance to perjury but it seems difficult to say how if it be proper for a judge to countenance perjury in a juror it should be otherwise than proper to encourage it in a witness or how the perjury should have less of piety in it in the one case than in the other if in the instance of the juror it is in favorem vitæ in the instance of the witness it is in favorem justitiæ which is worth many lives another mode might be the passing a statute for the purpose of declaring that in all cases where two witnesses are or shall have been required by law one witness shall be deemed adjudged construed and taken to be two witnesses this mode would be perfectly of a piece with the established practice the object of which is to add knot after knot to the entanglement avoiding with religious care the solution or removal of any part of the existing mass another mode might be to produce the same effect by practice or rule of court as often as occasion called for it which would save the three or four hundred pounds which it costs the country every time to make a statute this it might be said since there are those who will say anything would be a barefaced usurpation—a direct attack by the judicial power on the legislative—an act tending to the subversion of private and public security by planting uncertainty in the very fountain of legal certainty and destroying all confidence on the part of the subject in the dispensations and threatenings of the law if this were to be allowed judges it might be said whose special duty and cardinal virtue is obedience would thus be suffered to erect themselves not into a fourth estate but into a separate estate independent of and paramount to the three others i answer that this has been done in effect as often as by exclusion of witnesses or ex post facto invalidation of legal acts conditions have been annexed to conviction which have nothing to do with innocence and which have not been annexed by the legislature thus much in a general point of view but the practice of the kings bench the first criminal court of ordinary jurisdiction in this part of the united kingdom affords as has been already seen a special precedent which if not exactly in point seems as near to the being so as can easily be conceived divers statutes give in divers cases treble costs these treble costs the court of kings bench in all these cases refuses to give giving in the room of them rather more than half what the legislature has ordered to be given there would be no greater stretch of authority in requiring but half the number of witnesses that the legislature orders to be required than in giving but half the money under the name of costs that the legislature orders to be given nothing of misconstruction here—nothing of misapprehension that which is done here cannot have been done with other than open eyes legal learning how consummate soever can never have fairly unlearned a man the difference between three and one and a half—between two and one he who continues to know the difference between his right hand and his left must continue to know that right and left together are more than either right or left alone in the commonlaw branch of jurisprudential law we have seen the arrangements on this head conformable to reason and utility what defalcations have been made from the general rule we have seen made by the legislature in consequence of those conflicts and compromises to which a mixed sovereignty is more particularly exposed in the equity branch of jurisprudential law the principle of roman law which requires two witnesses—which excludes every witness without distinction who comes not with another witness in his hand—predominates the defendant a party in the cause is but one witness just as much so as an extraneous witness at the same time though the common law in its wisdom refuses to hear this evidence—in equity law adopting in this instance the decision of common sense in probative force it is looked upon as superior to that of a host of extraneous witnesses to the general rule which requires two witnesses the admission thus established will be an exception or not according to the interpretation put upon the word witness if being   0 coextensive in its import with the words to depose deposition to examine examination and so many others it be understood to include the party when performing the function of a witness the admission operates then as an exception to the rule if the word witness is understood to be confined in its application to the designation of extraneous witnesses the admission given to the testimony of a party has nothing to do with the rule for simplicitys sake let us conceive the rule as having no application to parties—as having no testimony in view but that of extraneous witnesses taking the rule then in this sense equity law does not adopt it in all its rigour the defendants testimony such as it is the plaintiff never can be without for the suit can no otherwise be instituted than by the instrument called a bill of which the interrogatory matter by which the defendants testimony is called for and to which he is bound to make answer forms an indispensable part but in regard to this or that fact facts as material as any to the cause what may easily happen and what continually does happen is that the defendant knows nothing about the matter if then knowing nothing about the matter he declares as much the testimony of a single extraneous witness speaking to that fact is with regard to that fact sufficient evidence but if among the facts inquired of by the plaintiff there be any one the establishment of which is necessary to form a ground for a decree operating in any respect in the plaintiffs favour—and if in relation to this fact the defendant delivers his testimony denying the fact—an extraneous witness and but one affirming it here the law requiring two witnesses has always been conformed to and in this case as in the other cases where two witnesses are required the testimony of a single witness goes for nothing english equity law having been in its first concoction roman law imported from the continent—the first equity judge to whom it was proposed to ground a decree in favour of the plaintiff upon the testimony of a single extraneous witness contradicted by that of the defendant would how thoroughly soever persuaded of the truth of the witnesss testimony—of the falsehood of that of the defendant have acted according to roman law illegally had he made a decree on the ground of the true evidence if a single testimony though uncontradicted is insufficient still more must it be so if contradicted so far as precedents judicial precedents being contrary to truth and justice are not contradicted by other precedents it is not lawful at any rate it is not necessary for a judge to decree according to truth and justice it is incumbent on or at any rate it is lawful for him to decree according to precedents the equity judge who at this time of day refuses to pay any regard to the testimony of an extraneous witness whom he believes to be trustworthy because contradicted by that of a defendant whom he believes to be perjured—this angloroman judge probably thinks nothing at all about the original roman law all he has to do is to think of the english precedents that have been grounded on it if thinking nothing of the precedents in his own law or of the foreign law on which they were founded he were to consider himself as an english judge in putting any such exclusion upon the testimony of the extraneous witness his decision would be as inconsistent with the decisions of his predecessors as well as with the interests of truth and justice as any of their decisions have been when compared with that same standard here are two conflicting testimonies one might say to him the one liable to no objection—the other that against which in order the more effectually to come at the truth your predecessors in quality of english judges have thought it incumbent to shut their ears to the testimony clear of all objection you pay no regard the sort of testimony which according to the rule you are bound to pursue is unworthy of all regard—it is by that you govern yourself on the present head not to speak of others the practice of english equity is reconcilable neither to roman law nor to english law nor to common sense not to roman law since where the defendant is silent it decrees in favour of the plaintiff upon the testimony of a single witness not to english law since where the defendant contradicts the witness it counts testimonies without weighing them not to common sense for the same reason and because it gives the turn of the scale to that one of the two sorts of testimony which according to the principles of human nature has least weight in it the ground on which this arrangement is placed by the account given of it in the books is curious enough here is oath against oath therefore nothing is to be done† the judge who should allege this contrariety as a reason for doing nothing would recognise himself unfit for his office injured suitor to weigh testimony against testimony in a jurybox is the business the every days business of the same sort of man whose business it is when behind a counter to weigh lead or brass against bread or candles what then is the task too hard for     you do you sink under it such imbecility is it the fruit of all your science sue then for a place in the jurybox and learn your business from bakers and tallowchandlers the task the juryman has to perform every day to perform is the deciding between the testimonies of two witnesses both of them equally unobjectionable what are the two between which you profess yourself unable to decide one of them worth as much as anybodys another at least if your rules are good for anything worth nothing lord chancellor it is not but that if i were at liberty i could weigh testimony against testimony as well as any tallowchandler but the mode of inquiry which i am bound and content to conform to does not allow me to weigh evidence where truth is at all doubtful equity is altogether unfit for the discovery of it this we are all sensible of accordingly as often as evidence is worth weighing we send it to the tallowchandlers they have a method of their own which it does not suit the purpose of equity to follow they are allowed to hear witnesses examined and crossexamined in that natural mode which every man who is really desirous of coming at the truth and has power to inquire into it pursues of course whether in a court or in a closet equity receives evidence in a scientific way—a way which was designed not for the discovery of truth but for better purposes i am a learned english judge it is a rule with all learned english judges to receive evidence in any shape except the only proper one they leave that to the tallowchandlers chapter ii exclusion by limitation put upon the number of witnesses §   excess of evidence an evil—peremptory limitation not a proper remedy there are some topics on which on a superficial glance especially it directed by the contemplation of established practice a fatal dilemma presents itself as hanging over the footsteps of the legislator and on one side or other the very nature of things seems to have imposed on him the necessity of injustice on a closer view to him whose eve has strength to penetrate this mist the difficulty may be seen to be in a great measure factitious and to arise out of some irrational practice into which under the pupilage put upon him by the man of law the imbecility of the legislator has been misled by the imbecility or improbity of his guide of the above described state of things an exemplification may be found in the arrangement which forms the subject of the present chapter what number of witnesses shall a party be allowed to produce put a limitation anywhere upon the number you lay the party under the necessity of leaving the mass of evidence on his side incomplete you pave the way to deception and consequent misdecision put no limitation anywhere upon the number you put it in the power of a malâ fide suitor if superior to a certain degree in respect of opulence to overwhelm his adversary with an indefinite load of testimony and the expense vexation and delay attached to it in the case which came under review in the last chapter the ground of the exclusion so far as in respect of reason and utility it had any ground appears to have been the fear of deception in the case now before us the consideration of vexation appears to have been the ground the vexation liable to be produced by multitude of witnesses or to speak more extensively by the quantity of evidence has two branches which being in themselves perfectly distinct require to be kept so in the mind of the legislator why because according as it is in the one shape or the other that the inconvenience presents itself so in so far as the inconvenience admits of remedy will the remedy there are two stations in the cause to which the vexation considered in its first stage is apt to apply itself that of the parties and that of the judge to the station of the parties considered in the aggregate it is pregnant with delay and with expense consider them separately the expense attached to the production of each witness falls in the first instance at any rate upon the party by whom or at whose instance he is produced ultimately either upon that party or another according to the arrangements made by the judge in respect to this part of the costs upon the judge this inconvenience will not naturally fall in any other shape than that of vexation properly so called expense out of his pocket is not destined to come by delay he will not in the manner that a party would be affected it is in the shape of labour only that the vexation falls upon the judge perplexity followed by the labour consisting in the exertions made to remove it the judge being a member of the community as truly as the sovereign by whose authority he has been appointed or the servant by whom his shoes have been cleaned—any pain that on this as on any other occasion falls upon him constitutes as large a part of the pain of the community as an equal pain falling upon either of the other two but on the present occasion be it what it may it can never enter into competition with the mischief that would ensue from the removal of the dolorific cause viz the labour of weighing the mass of evidence that mass by the     supposition being in every part necessary to be weighed—in every part such that the exclusion of it would be productive of a correspondent chance in favour of injustice the burthen thus on the particular occasion in question sustained by the judge is a part of that aggregate burthen the pain of which cannot but be regarded as balanced and more than balanced by the remuneration in whatever shape dignity at any rate attached to his office and even setting aside such recompense it can hardly be supposed that the mischief of the utmost vexation liable to fall upon that single individual can come into competition with the mischief falling in the other case upon the community—the notorious and consequently extensive mischief attached to the corresponding chance in favour of injustice in respect of serious importance the sort of vexation which in this case is borne by the judge is therefore as nothing in comparison with the mischief which in consequence is liable to fall upon the parties that is to say upon that one of them who has the direct justice of the cause on his side the greater the mass of evidence in the cause the heavier the burthen imposed by it on the mental faculties of the judge the heavier the burthen on the judges mind the greater the probability that his force of mind will not be adequate to the sustaining of it—to the acting under it in such manner as to extract the truth from the mass of matter through which it is diffused to frame to himself a right judgment respecting the principal facts in dispute and to decide in consequence in the shape of danger the mischief will in this case be considerable even supposing the clearest impartiality and most consummate probity on the part of the judge these qualities being supposed the state of the law being supposed clear and in respect of the question of fact the cause being supposed not to be attended with any extraordinary degree of intricacy or difficulty—the probability in favour of a right decision will be very great say for example  00 to   but suppose the faculties of the judge in a state of complete confusion and the force of his mind altogether unequal to the task of framing a right decision under the pressure of the burthen thrown upon it by the aggregate mass of evidence—this chance of  00 to   will be reduced to an even chance or chance of   to   at which point the party who is in the right will have no greater chance of prevailing than the adversary who is in the wrong at this point the advantage possessed by him who is in the right is equal to 0 and to this point every additional quantity added to the load of evidentiary matter tends in proportion to its pressure to reduce the cause such is the case even where the probity of the judge is at its highest point and the state of his affections entirely neutral but let either selfconscious partiality or bias be supposed on the part of the judge the danger is much increased every addition seen to be made to the pressure of the burthen of evidence on the mind of the judge himself contending against it with the peculiar advantages attached to his station and appropriate habits of exercise will naturally press with still greater force upon every other mind not bound to the task by duty and less qualified for it by exercise the greater therefore the pressure is by the public eye seen to be the more difficult will it be for the public judgment to detect any aberration on his part from the line of rectitude and moreover even to any man to whom his decision may present itself as taxable with error the greater will be the probability that the error will present itself as standing clear if not of intellectual at any rate of moral blame in a word the greater the burthen of the evidence the greater in appearance as well as reality the difficulty in judging of it and the greater that difficulty in reality the more natural will erroneous judgment be and the greater the difficulty in appearance the more venial in appearance will the error be—the less apt to expose him whose error it is to public censure the evils therefore which arise from excess of evidence are very great and that they form a proper subject for the legislators consideration is out of the reach of dispute but that the propriety of allowing them to be productive of actual exclusion—of giving them in practice the effect of a conclusive reason depends upon proportions viz upon the preponderance of the collateral inconvenience in the shape of vexation expense and delay as compared with the probability of direct mischief resulting from deception and consequent misdecision for want of the evidence proposed to be excluded is a point upon which a decision has already been pronounced on grounds which the reader has had under his view proceeding on this ground the necessary conclusion is that everything that on this field has been done in any of the established systems is wrong for whatever has been done has been done by limiting the number of witnesses receivable without regard to the demand regard being paid to proportions one most obvious consideration is that in respect of number the demand for witnesses will depend upon the subjectmatter of the suit   even where the claim which is the foundation of the suit is itself simple it may happen that the number of witnesses which it may be requisite to hear has no certain limits take for example a claim of a right of way a claim of a right of common a suit     the object of which is to determine the bounds between portions of land the property of different owners   the nature of things affords several sorts of suits in which in respect of the subjectmatter the demand itself is complex and complex to a degree altogether without limit in this case the suit though in name and to some purposes but one suit is in fact a cluster of suits thus in case of an account the complex suit includes as many simple suits as there are items on both sides not one of them but is capable of being taken for the ground of a separate suit in which suit the number of witnesses to whose testimony it may be necessary to have recourse has no certain limits §   remedies suggested as it is with a physical burthen so is it with a psychological one undivided the patient sinks under it divide it he performs the task without difficulty you have a burthen which you wish to have carried within a certain time to a certain place having called a porter you propose the job to him he declines it—he pronounces it impracticable your job must it for that reason remain undone by no means common sense indicates a variety of expedients all of them practicable one or other preferable according to the circumstances of the case the burthen may be divided and distributed between two porters being divided it may be carried by the same porter at two turns perhaps even it may be taken by him at one turn if he be allowed a little more time the burthen being thus of the physical kind the remedies thus applicable to any extraordinary weight that may belong to it will never fail to be applied common sense will dictate the expedients—selfregarding interest will secure the application of them understand if the burthen be mine and if it be for a purpose of my own that i wish it carried and if it be by myself that the charge of getting it conveyed is undertaken for if instead of being managed by myself the business be committed by me to a servant who is lazy or careless or illaffected to me or who has anything to gain by having the burthen miscarry or arrive too late it may make a difference where the burthen is of the psychological kind the remedies will be no less obvious unfortunately the application of them will be far from being alike secure in this case as in the other the advice of common sense if consulted would be equally sure but unfortunately the hands on whom the business rests are such whose purpose is not answered by the taking any such advice had the ends of justice been the ends of actual judicature this like so many other mischiefs with which the technical system swarms or rather of which it is composed never could have taken place had the foundation of every cause been laid in the simultaneous appearance of the parties coram judice no such danger as that of an inordinate influx could have existed so much as the cause really required and by its importance was capable of paying for just so much would be delivered and no more when in this way anything of excess takes place it is only for want of those explanations which in case of the sort of meeting above described cannot fail of taking place but which can scarce ever take place with effect on any other terms this accordingly has already been stated as one of the uses though but one and from the rarity of its occurrence one of the least considerable of the uses of that meeting without which judicature is no better than a game in which justice in spite of design turns up now and then by accident of the established system of procedure it is a fundamental principle not to hear the parties not to suffer either of them so much as to come into the presence of the judge till the very conclusion of the cause not hear the parties whom then would you hear not till the end of the cause what then is the sort of work that is to be going forward in the mean time under a system set up in opposition to the ends of justice the idea of the ridiculous hangs over every step of an inquiry that has for its object the pursuit of any of those ends it is as if a plan for the more effectual propagation of protestantism were to be presented to the pope to find the average quantity of time really in demand for a cause turn to any of those courts in which the path of judicature leads to the ends of justice—turn for example to the courts of conscience—you will find it only a few minutes but as the nature of that jurisdiction admits not of any very complex causes and as here and there a cause will present itself which may require as many months putting all causes together in hotchpot the average upon the sumtotal may thus come to be doubled or trebled in a vast majority of the individual cases that turn up not the faintest glimpse of any such difficulty will present itself such is the simplicity of the vast majority of cases that call for the exercise of judicial powers but when a cause is to a certain degree complex then comes the necessary task of sketching out a plan of the mass of evidence what is your demand what your title and what your evidence three questions these to which a plaintiff if he knows what he is about will always be more or less prepared to give an answer and which a judge if he knows what     he is about will of course put to the plaintiff wherever the plaintiff for want of distinct conceptions has not put them to himself what then is this plan or table of evidence in every cause in which a question of fact is involved the nature of it may be seen at the conclusion of any one of those instruments which among english lawyers are called briefs facts which in the character of principal facts are to be proved persons or scripts by which each such fact is expected to be proved to the plaintiffs table of evidence add that of the defendant you have the sumtotal of that mass of proposed evidence concerning every article of which the judge will have to consider whether at all and if yes then in what event and at what time it shall be delivered   where the demand itself is of a complex nature i e where the cause though in form and denomination but one cause is in reality an aggregate of a number of causes analyze this artificial whole resolve it into its elementary parts suppose an accountcurrent with a hundred items on each side—a hundred items to any one or every one of which it may happen to be contested how absurd in this case to think by means direct or indirect to limit the multitude of witnesses but there being in fact two hundred causes to try under the name of one there is not one of them that may not without prejudice to the interests of truth be tried at a different time at a different place by a different judge or set of judges in a cause of this composite order two witnesses may be one too many two thousand may be not sufficient behold now the legislator with shut eyes and procrustes for his guide by arrangements direct or indirect fixing the number of witnesses which in a cause of this denomination a plaintiff or a defendant shall be permitted to produce no grievance no remedy here is in truth no grievance but if in this way a remedy be attempted to be applied that is anything under the name or notion of a remedy then indeed there is a grievance for the pretended remedy is a real grievance at his own pleasure and by and with the advice of his attorney who in the temple of equity puts on the more respectable and profitable title of solicitor a man who has a business of this sort to settle with an unwilling adversary addresses himself to common law or to equity if to common law—after six months or twelve months spent in doing worse than nothing—spent in affording the occasions for learned pillage the two hundred causes if tried at all must be tried in a day or in the remnant of a day if to equity—after the number of months not to say years employed in doing worse than nothing as above—when the matter in dispute comes to be tried in good earnest the cause is wire drawn through a hole in the judges closet and instead of the one day as above is drawn out perhaps to a thousand the judge called in this case a master under the eye of a conniving chancellor taking care to be paid for three attendances for every one he bestows and cutting out each day into hours that each hour may have its fee on either side of the passage what in all this can there be that could be better than it is on the one side is not work made for a jury on the other side is not everything done by equity by equity the bona dea of english lawyers made by their own hands for their own use unknown to all the world beside   in a cause in which the matter in dispute is a mans right to a station filled by election there may be as many causes as electors including persons assuming to be electors the right of each elector depending upon an indefinite quantity of evidence generally very small but susceptible of extension without any certain limit squeeze now a complex cause of this sort into the compass of a day and observe the consequence before the grenville act causes of that sort were compressed each into the compass of a day and the consequences were such as at length gave birth to that not inconsiderable effort of innovating and meliorating wisdom the condensing engine being broken the quantity of matter which by fiction had been compressed into the compass of a day has now been found to fill in reality the compass of sometimes not so few as a hundred days and a hundred days fully employed but as a cause of this sort consists in truth of so many dozen or score or hundred of causes—if constitutional prejudices and misgivings would but permit what a prodigious load of vexation and expense might not every now and then be saved if in these causes the witnesses could be heard within a reasonable distance of their own doors instead of being imported from the orkneys or the lands end to be fed for an indefinite time at london prices   suppose a cause in which the matter in dispute is the supposed disturbance or abuse of the rights annexed to some station or condition in life domestic or political the disturbance or abuse constitutes one group of facts—the entrance into the station another entrance and disturbance—marriage and adultery entrance and abuse—appointment to an office and abuse of the powers of it the scene of the entrance lies at any number of miles distance from that of the disturbance or the abuse two groups of facts thus distinct and unconnected what need or even what use that the proof of both should be crowded together into the same portion of time—into the same portion of space only that they may     come under the eyes of the same judge or judges in london cohabitation between man and wife on the one hand—adultery of the wife on the other actual marriage in the east indies the cohabitation public and notorious the adultery susceptible of proof—why must redress be made to wait not only for the definitive result but even for the preliminary steps till proof in form of what no one doubts of shall have been sent for and fetched from the east indies the mass of evidence thus decomposed in idea and resolved into its ultimate elements—frequently it will happen not only that by an apt distribution of it among different portions of time and space the quantity of vexation expense and delay attached to the delivery of the evidence may be reduced but that the quantum of the evidence necessary to be delivered may itself be reduced it is in this way and this alone that by any management a retrenchment may be made on the mass of evidence understand relevant evidence and without prejudice to the direct ends of justice a second mass of evidence no   may be relevant—may be indispensable but it is only on the supposition that the mass of evidence no   has already been delivered or not delivered take away the one you take away the demand for another keep back the testimony of titius the proof that would have been offered of his bad character or of his having been elsewhere at the time is no longer relevant expedients upon expedients on a review of the circumstances of the individual cause might be employed for reducing the amount of the evidence and of the vexation expense and delay attached to the delivery of it within the narrowest limits compatible with the due regard to the direct ends of justice   what is it that each man is expected to prove   by what circumstances is he enabled to prove it   from which of the witnesses on both sides is the most decided and satisfactory evidence to be expected   which are those between whom an irreconcilable contradiction may be expected and in whose instance it is most particularly requisite that they be brought face to face   are there any masses of evidence by the use of which if the decision be in a certain way the demand for the other may be superseded where no such preparatory explanation takes place that is under all technical systems superfluous evidence is poured in in abundance not only all that will be wanted but all that by possibility may it is supposed be wanted is provided in continental roman procedure and in english equity the shelves are thus loaded with depositions which when they come to be looked at are found not to be necessary and which accordingly are not employed in argument at common law before a jury crowds of witnesses are in attendance who when the trial comes on remain unexamined either because there is really no need of their evidence or because there is no time for hearing it at the same time that the number of the witnesses and in general the quantity of the evidence of all sorts that may or may not be necessary is thus brought forward on all sides—all circumstances which in the case of this or that witness or other article of evidence in particular may operate in enhancement of the vexation expense or delay attendant on the production of that witness or other article of evidence in like manner should be brought under review and thus and thus only it is that the judge finds it in his power to do what justice requires him to do in respect of collateral inconvenience in the first place to take the arrangements necessary for reducing it to its least dimensions in the next place to determine whether a case which though rarely may sometimes happen the injustice that would result from the production of the proposed evidence would not preponderate over that branch of injustice which stands opposed to the direct ends of justice viz the frustration of a just demand or on the other hand not to make an unnecessary sacrifice of the principal to the collateral ends whether provisionally at least inferior evidence may not be employed instead of superior from the same source makeshift instead of regular transcriptural for instance instead of original in causes that are fortunate enough to find themselves removed out of the hands of the regular courts into those of special arbitrators mutual and preparatory explanations take place of course at any rate there is nothing to prevent them from taking place but those accidental deficiencies in point of probity or intelligence to which all tribunals and all human affairs are exposed in these tribunals it is to the judge that any failure in this respect ought to be imputed for if on a requisition made by the judge any backwardness in regard to compliance be manifested on either side such reluctance will but afford an addiditional reason for insisting upon compliance     these observations if well grounded will be worth the attention of those public tribunals whose hands are not tied up by any of those manacles which have laid the regular courts under the not altogether unwelcome impossibility of obeying the voice of justice i speak of parliamentary election courts courts martial and courts of inquiry military and naval for as to the courts held by justices of the peace out of sessions i speak of the case in which their jurisdiction is definitive it is seldom indeed that a cause coming before any such tribunal will be complex enough to afford the matter for any such arrangement and the same observation may be applied à fortiori to the courts of conscience in these and all other courts in which the ends of justice are the objects of judicature inasmuch as the preparatory explanation in question always may be called for so proportioned to its obvious utility to all persons concerned and more especially to the judges is the expectation one should naturally form of seeing it called for in each individual instance but against this expectation there are two circumstances which operate on the other side   the propensity which all tribunals of inferior account have to imitate the practice of their superiors and   the propensity which all tribunals have to shackle themselves by general rules extending an arrangement from the one case—the one individual case in which it was found conformable—to an unknown succession of other cases in which it would not be conformable to the ends of justice what shall my client then be compelled to disclose the plan of his defence as well might you call upon him to criminate himself or upon me to betray the trust he has reposed in me such is the objection which on an occasion of this sort the consciousness of a bad cause will put of course into the mouth of the experienced advocate such the sort of argument which finds all ears open to it under that system of which the spiritus rector is the spirit of insincerity for under the technical system such is the state of things towards which everything gravitates—such the notions attached to the word equity viz that on every occasion justice and injustice fraud and sincerity shall have an equal chance with reference to this topic causes whether criminal or noncriminal may be distinguished into three classes—   the sort of cause in which on the first meeting the whole stock of evidence which the cause affords is visible at once as where the cause turns on the testimony of one or both parties with or without an adducible script or two or an adducible witness or two on one or on each side under this description will be included the vast majority of causes in this case the cause is already ripe for decision   the sort of cause in which—though the whole stock of evidence be not adducible on both sides—yet on each side every article of evidence proposed to be adduced is capable of being indicated in this case comes the demand for the mutual explanations above indicated and the operation of marshalling the witnesses and documents in consequence ripe for decision the cause may in this case be perhaps the next day perhaps not for any number of years afterwards for who shall say in every case at the end of how many months a witness shall be forthcoming in a country in which voyages to the antipodes are in every days practice   the sort of cause in which a man believes or suspects a fact a principal fact to have taken place but even supposing it to have taken place knows not as yet by what evidence it may be proved e g that an act of murder has been committed the author suspected or not suspected that an instrument produced in the character of a deed or will is spurious or falsified that the parentage attributed to a child is false that a deed or will though genuine was obtained by fraud or force in this case the cause is neither ripe for decision nor ripe for any such exhibition or analysis of the mass of evidence as above to this sort of cause applies the demand for investigatorial procedure that sort of procedure which roman law has confined to criminal cases—english law to the extent of the regular system has denied to all cases feloniously criminal cases alone excepted in which through the medium of the preliminary examinations prescribed by statute it has been blown in as it were by a side wind to pursue through any further exemplifications the decomposition of the aggregate mass of evidence would be beyond the design of the present book what is above will it is hoped be found sufficient at once to indicate the nature of the operation and the use §   aberrations of established systems in this respect in the next chapter we shall have occasion to examine the indirect modes in which all evidence over and above a certain quantity has under established systems been excluded in some cases however the indirect and disguised exclusion not being strong enough and the only rational remedy the preparatory explanation and arrangement being unendurable exclusion was to be applied without disguise and in direct terms such accordingly upon the continent has been the resource take french and spanish law for examples     to any given fact or question fait fact french—pregunta question spanish thirty witnesses were and are allowed by spanish law ten only are or at least were allowed in french law are both right one french witness then is equal to three spanish ones of these limitations what upon earth could be the design to make work for advocates—to give the judge a facility for favouring whom he pleased if so it was well aimed to any good purpose completely useless—on the nature of the cause no distinction grounded under this direct exclusion as under the indirect one the same allowance for all causes fact—question—of the unity of the fact or question who shall give the criterion nobody criterion there is none you are a french judge a man who has produced ten witnesses wishes to produce more would you have him lose stick to the unity of the fact and you stand firm upon the law would you have him gain split the fact into two you may then allow him as many as twenty witnesses are twenty not enough take up the metaphysical wedge and drive it in once more we have seen that to split one man into two witnesses is every days practice that was a clumsy trick men like oaks are gnarled and unwedgeable facts like deals are fisstle† chapter iii exclusion put by blind arrangements of procedure upon indeterminate portions of the mass of evidence a proposition that seems neither to require nor any more than a postulate in geometry admit of proof is that every arrangement of procedure the effect of which is to exclude an indeterminate portion of evidence—of that stock of evidence which the cause in the individual instance in question happens to afford—and that too without the plea of preponderant inconvenience in the shape of vexation expense and delay—is irreconcilably repugnant to the ends of justice in every cause to which the operation of the principle of blind defalcation happens to extend the effect of it is to reduce to an equal chance whatever preponderant probability of success a good cause may under the system of procedure in question give a man as against a bad one such is the result and such the mischief supposing the composition of the defalcated mass to depend altogether upon blind chance suppose on the other hand that it is capable of being influenced by arrangement—by arrangement on the part of either of the parties—the probability of success instead of being equal will be preponderant in favour of injustice he who being in the right is persuaded of his being so will not naturally have recourse to this or any other sinister artifice at least he will not be urged so to do by so strong an impulse as that by which the opposite party supposing him to be in the wrong and conscious of being so will be urged had the ends of justice been in every country the ends to which the system of procedure had in the course of its formation been directed no arrangement pregnant with any such effect would perhaps any where have     been established but in no country has the predominant part of that system been really directed to those ends accordingly arrangements pregnant with that absurd and pernicious effect are to be found established in both of the two systems of technical procedure between which the more enlightened part of the population of the globe has in such unequal proportions been divided in the roman system may be seen one example of an arrangement by which an indeterminate portion of the obtainable mass of evidence is shut out in the english system may be seen an example of another arrangement which discordant as it is with the roman in other points of view agrees with it in this the roman arrangement here in view is that by which whatsoever part of the evidence can by posibility be kept secret from the parties respectively viz every part of it but that which has been extracted from a party himself is with the most anxious care kept from the knowledge of both until the time when the process of collection is closed from this arrangement is apt to result the exclusion of an indeterminate and indefinable mass of counterevidence the portion thus excluded is divisible into two distinguishable branches—  the additional mass which had the already extracted portion been known to them in time might and would have been extracted by the parties respectively whether from the witnesses on their own side respectively or from those on the other—  any such further portion as in explanation confirmation or contradiction of the testimony actually delivered as above might have been extracted from the bosoms of other witnesses such then in a few words is the effect exclusion of ulterior evidence obtainable by counterinterrogation of the same witnesses exclusion of counterevidence extractible by interrogation and counterinterrogation from ulterior witnesses the english practice is that which in civil cases limits the mass of evidence to the quantity the delivery of which can be squeezed into the compass of a single sitting deducting the quantity occupied by the introductory statements made by the advocates on both sides and the recapitulation made by the directing judge of the nature of the mass of evidence thus shut out it is not easy to give any the loosest estimate not so much as the sort of estimate than which nothing can easily be more loose given of that which is shut out by roman practice to assist conception cross over from time to space suppose a court and you need not look further than westminster hall to find four such which in the case of a cause of a nature to excite that sort of interest on which the purity of judicial conduct so essentially depends shall be capable of affording hearing and seeing room to no more than a tenth or a twentieth part of the numbers that would be there if they could nine persons out of every ten are thus excluded from the exercise of the functions of a member of the open committee of the public charged with the inquiry into the conduct of the courts of justice who in each individual instance are the persons on whom the lot of exclusion falls when for this question a precise answer has been found on the back of it will be found an account of the articles of evidence excluded by that law of the judicial drama which substituting the dramatic unities for the ends of justice requires the business to be compressed within the space of time during which a mixed multitude of persons are capable of continuing together in the compass of the same close room without prejudice to the free exercise of their intellectual faculties incompatible as this system of condensation is to the ends of justice it wants nothing of that which is necessary to adapt it to the ends of established judicature sufficient or insufficient to the purpose or doing right to the parties the time is never less than sufficient to the gathering in of fees the door—does it happen to have been shut against this or that article of necessary evidence so much the better then come other exigencies far better adapted than any evidence to the use of lawyers at law necessity for new trials and motions for new trials in equity necessity for bills of review or bills partaking of or in some convenient shape or other approaching to the nature of bills of review an entire cause with all its evidence does it happen to be shut out in the lump because there was not time so much as for the opening of it causes are not like strawberries or mackerel at the end of six months or of twelve months they are as fresh as ever and then they come garnished with fresh fees it is only in causes of a complex nature that the operation of this principle of exclusion can attach causes which whether in any other respect or no are complex at any rate in respect of the number of witnesses from whom relevant evidence might have been extracted call twentyfour hours the utmost extent of a single judicial sitting there are some causes and of this description are the major part of the causes instituted for which a quarter of the number of minutes would be more than enough there are others for which three or four times as many days might be a scanty allowance     where the allowance of time presents itself as insufficient the quantity of evidence discarded by each party at least if acting bonâ fide will naturally be that which in the judgment of the party can best be spared of either party if in malâ fide one resource will be the crowding in evidence in such quantity as to generate confusion and by blinding the eyes of those to whom it belongs to judge to raise in this way the unfavourable prospect to the level of an even chance in any case the undue advantage from the compression gravitates towards the plaintiffs side his evidence being the first heard the more he introduces of his own the less he leaves it possible for the defendant to introduce out of the supposed maximum of four and twenty the greater the number of hours occupied by the one the less the number left to be occupied by the other the advantage of this policy will however be clearer if the plaintiff who avails himself of it be in malâ than if in bonâ fide for in the latter case what he gains by the exclusion of his antagonists evidence may be lost in some measure by the confusion produced by the multiplicity of his own in the midst of all this darkness a difference may however be observed between the effects of the roman and those of the english practice of the disguised exclusions wrapped up in the system of concealment the influence extends without distinction to the most simple as well as to the most complex causes for upon the roman plan of inquiry there is never any want of time for the extraction of evidence if the demand presented for ulterior evidence by the evidence already extracted were but known in time in the english mode the genius of exclusion confines his operations as hath been seen to complex causes the mischief produced by the english is therefore not nearly so extensive as that produced by the roman mode the systems here distinguished by the names of roman and english are both of them it must not be forgotten alike in use in england but on the continent of europe the roman practice extends to all courts at least to all regular courts in england it is confined to the courts called equity courts and ecclesiastical and admiralty courts the compression that is to say the defalcation produced by the rule which confines all causes to the short allowance of time above mentioned is not however by any means the only defalcation to which under the english system the pabulum of justice is condemned those commonlaw causes alone excepted which are furnished by the neighbourhood of the metropolis—in the whole stock of causes the mass of evidence is subjected to an ulterior compression and defalcation to an amount equally indeterminable a certain portion of time two days or thereabouts is allotted with the utmost regularity to whatever number of suits it may happen to a whole county to a thirtieth part of england to have supplied in the compass of half the year six hours for example may by this means be the whole allowance made to a cause which had the scene of it lain within the privileged spot might have had the benefit of the full allowance sufficient or insufficient as above described in both cases how fares it with the aggregate mass of causes in number and bulk unlimited shut up within a limited compass of time as it fares with a multitude of men or other animals shut up within the walls of a town or any other boundaries with a limited and insufficient quantity of food their fate is disposed of by the three coregent powers force fraud and fortune some batten some are pinched and some are starved ever and anon the fruits of necessity in this line are brought to light as it were by chance the nature of the cause opened or begun to be opened—stop cries the judge what sort of a cause is this to try i cant try it—not i i wont so much as attempt it it is not to be done necessity by which every thing is justified—necessity thus invoked comes in and justifies denial of justice from a tribunal which does not afford itself so much as a possibility of doing justice the cause is then shuffled off to another which having time for collecting evidence wants nothing but the means the cause is referred to unlearned judges under the name of arbitrators pressed by the tide of authority though without direct and adequate coercive power the parties whether in bonâ or in malâ fide are wrought upon in some way or other to consent to this arrangement arbitrators chosen one on each side the foreman or some other distinguished member of the jury some advocate mutually agreed on as not being engaged on either side nothing deficient but the power of compelling the production and providing for the trustworthiness of evidence the instruments they possess for bringing the truth to light are good against everybody but those who are dishonest enough to wish and endeavour to suppress it as often as this necessity betrays itself just so often does it appear that in cases of this description trial by jury conducted as it is conducted is incompatible with justice what matters it in the view of lawyers and their dupes what in their creed is this sacred institution not a means to an end but itself an end the use of judicature is—what not to render justice but to make work for juries† and why make work for   0 juries—why but because trial by jury is trial with lawyers with forms upon forms heaped together for the use of lawyers the mutilation of the body of necessary evidence or in other words the exclusion of an indeterminate part of it has thus far been brought to view as an effect produced in every technical course of procedure two arrangements one of the roman the other of the english system have at the same time been brought to view in the character of so many efficient causes by which that effect has actually been produced that under the english system the production of any such effect was so much as in the anticipation of the authors among the final causes of the arrangements themselves is what there seems little reason to suppose but in speaking of the roman system the design of producing this very effect pernicious as we have seen it to be has been expressly stated as a final cause or rather as the final cause of the arrangement the systematic concealment by which the effect is produced concealment a practice so natural to iniquity—a practice unless under special circumstances and as against special mischiefs so unnatural to justice so abhorrent to the general complexion of english judicature—required it seems to have been thought a reason to justify it in the sight of english lawyers when the roman system came to be planted in english soil problem—in all cases except in criminal cases the preliminary ex parte inquiry the receipt of evidence being public at common law required to find a reason for its being kept as secret as possible in equity such being on one hand the problem—such was on the other hand the solution—the only solution that could be found for it first let us observe the practice then gilberts reasons for it state of the practice   in the oath taken by the persons who to this purpose act as judges ad hoc viz in the district of the metropolis the examining clerk—out of the district of the metropolis the commissioners nominated by the parties are these words—and you shall not publish or show the same depositions to any person or persons before publication in the court without consent of the same court   neither the examinations or depositions which are taken by commission can be published in any case whatsoever till publication is duly passed by rule in the office or by motion or petition for it may be done either way†   and in this case viz where the party applies to have the time for publication put off the plaintiff or defendant as the case falls out must make oath and so must his clerk in court or solicitor that they have neither seen heard read or been informed of any of the contents of the depositions taken in that cause nor will they see hear read or be informed of the same till publication is duly passed in the cause  then comes a story of a solicitor who to prevent the solicitor on the other side from gaining the further time necessary to the examination of his witnesses read over to him the depositions already taken on his the readers side such being the practice behold now the learned lord chief barons reasons for it—   if the commissioners on both sides attend the execution of the commission and the one side examines and the other neither examines nor puts in any interrogatories he shall never afterwards examine unless upon special order of the court upon good cause shown because he must not form his interrogatories upon the discovery made to his commissioners of what the other side examined to†   the fair examination by commissioners is not to adjourn without necessity     but if it be necessary they may adjourn not only in time but place and this affair must be performed as far as possible uno actu that there be as little opportunity as possible to divulge the depositions that neither side may better their proof‡   if it shall appear to the court     that the defendants commissioners attended during the whole time of the execution of the commission and never exhibited any interrogatories in this case the court will never grant the defendant another commission and he must take it for his pains since he lay upon the watch and catch only to see what the plaintiff proved and then at another commission to exhibit interrogatories adapted to such matters and questions as might tend to overthrow all that had been done and he shall never be admitted to have this unfair advantage over his adversary for if he is admitted after having knowledge of all that his adversary hath proved to exhibit interrogatories he may easily conceive what interrogatories to exhibit and how to hit the bird in the eye∥ then immediately after follows a passage to state that if a new commission is granted no addition ought to be made to the interrogatories framed for the former one without special leave of the court and then they are to be settled by a master and are never done i e this is never done but in extraordinary cases       afterwards after publication of the depositions already taken there could be no examination of witnesses unless by the special direction of the judge upon good cause shown and an affidavit of the party that he or those employed by him had not nor would see the depositions of the witnesses which were published by reason of the manifest danger of perjury and subornation of witnesses in case examination should be allowed after publication   one reason comes in the form of a parenthesis and that parenthesis an assumption the truth of the observation being supposed too selfevident to be disputed since the very life and vitals of almost every cause and of every mans property lies in keeping close and secreting his evidence till after the depositions are published because after that there is an end of examining    † the view taken by the learned jurist is altogether curious that either of the parties should possess the possibility of bettering his proof‡ he considers as a result fatal to justice a result to be prevented at any price for of such melioration what might be the consequence it might tend to overthrow all that had been done the bird according to his ingenious metaphor might be hit in the eye∥ at the time of his writing this or before the learned author was head shopkeeper of that great double shop in which common law or equity is served out according as the one or the other happens to be bespoke by the plaintiff customer for the clause in magna charta which precludes the sale of justice precludes not the sale of common law or of equity on the commonlaw side whatever truth is to be served out is warranted entire the truth and the whole truth as well as nothing but the truth are the words of the oath expressive of what each witness undertakes for the delivery of but to what purpose is it that from each witness the whole of such part of the facts belonging to the case as happen to have come to his knowledge are required to this purpose surely—viz that from all the evidence together including the depositions of all the witnesses the whole assemblage of facts which the case furnishes may be collected what then on this occasion at least is the aim of common law to come at the truth entire what on the other hand is the aim of equity to get it mutilated to get it in a state in which it shall at any rate be to some degree or other imperfect and no one can say in how great a degree right and wrong shift their places or their natures according as the judge sits as a commonlaw judge or as an equity judge according as the article is served from the one counter or the other on the tuesday the learned judge sitting at common law grants a new trial there his birds are set up by him all in a row though there be a thousand of them—set up like cocks on a shrove tuesday ready to be hit in the eye by anybody who has a stone to throw at them the next day the same reverend person sits in the character of an equity judge—and now secrecy is the order of the day and now the very life and vitals of the cause lies in secreting the evidence but it such counterinterrogatories or counterevidence from counterwitnesses were admitted the danger of subornation of perjury and of perjury he says is manifest yes indeed—but too manifest open the door to evidence meaning sworn evidence you open the door to perjury would you shut the door shut it effectually against perjury two ways are open to you and both sure ones shut the door against all sworn evidence or shut it against all evidence but when the mass of evidence thus to be shut out is anything short of the whole observe the consequence true it is that in such evidence as is not produced no perjury will be contained but how is it in regard to the evidence which being allowed to be produced has been produced accordingly assurance against being crossexamined against being opposed by counterevidence assurance against being exposed to contradiction from themselves or others security against ulterior contradiction from any quarter—such is the security proposed as proper to be applied—such is the security actually applied against mendacity and temerity on the part of witnesses that the arrangement proposed by the learned judge in the character of a security and that a necessary one against the mischief of perjury is naturally not to say necessarily productive of that very mischief is not only manifest enough to everybody but to nobody more so than to the learned judge himself for by what is it that when one party only say the plaintiff has examined his witnesses the commissioners of the other party the defendant having been present at such examination the defendant is enabled to hit the bird in the eye his commissioners in violation of the letter of their oaths communicate to him the party the depositions extracted by the commissioners on the other side for unless this were the case whatever were the demand for such suppletory and complementory counterevidence and counterinterrogation the party could not have any knowledge of it so that in the perjury with which the     arrangement is seen to be pregnant consists the reason and the only reason given in justification of that very practice this precaution is exactly of a piece with the policy which in some ages and countries has under the auspices of roman law governed the arrangements in criminal cases the prosecutor on his part producing his evidence the defendant on his part was not to be allowed to produce any why because at this rate the charge might come to be contradicted a licence which was not to be suffered being relevant the ulterior evidence thus excluded would it have been true or false if true no great harm one should have thought would have been done by it if false—but what is there that should make it false this subsequent rather than any antecedent mass of evidence evidence the testimony of an extraneous witness delivered in a preceding cause between other parties is not received in a succeeding one why not because in the preceding cause the party against whom it operates in the succeeding cause had no opportunity of endeavouring at the correction or completion of it by counterinterrogation or counterevidence in this case the propriety of the exclusion is not in question here what is to the purpose is that such is the established rule—established not at common law only but in equity the depositions having been published i e communicated to the parties evidence respecting the character of each witness may be poured in without stint evidence on the one side attacking his character—evidence on the other side supporting it evidence of this sort generally speaking says the learned judge ends in nothing more than putting the party to an expense to no purpose here then if superfluity of evidence were the mischief to be cut off—here would be a species of evidence for the knife to operate upon no such thing where the evidence is known and known to be of that sort which is extendible ad infinitum and after all of little or no use no such idea is started as that of excluding it where the importance of the mass of evidence in question is beyond all estimate then it is that it is to be barred out and secrecy is the bar set up against it those who introduced this arrangement into the system of procedure gave no reasons for it they did wisely—they had none to give on this as on some other occasions gilbert has taken it into his head to give reasons† here as elsewhere being given they are worse than none under the technical system the safe course and the only safe one to be taken with judges reasons is the course taken with them in the house of lords to enter them as given and to give none—none at least which the subject whose conduct is to be governed by them and whose fate depends upon them has a possibility of being aprised of chapter iv exclusion by rendering a particular species of evidence conclusive §   impropriety of the exclusion admission of counterevidence is one of those securities of the necessity of which much it may be thought would not require to be said exclude out of the budget any article of evidence whether on one side or another in proportion to the probative force with which such excluded lot would had it been admitted have acted upon the mind of the judge in that same proportion is the aggregate mass of evidence incomplete exclude on either side the whole of the mass of evidence that would or might have been delivered on that side leaving the door open to whatever evidence is ready to be delivered on the other misdecision in disfavour of the side on which the evidence is excluded is not indeed by so doing rendered the certain result since there remains the possibility that the unexcluded evidence may not gain credit but at any rate the tendency of such arrangement to give birth to misdecision seems too palpable to be matter of doubt to any one so palpable as to produce as it were a mechanical and instinctive idea of one of the most revolting modifications of injustice audi alteram partem says the common adage before you give judgment hear whatever there may be to be said on the other side as a memento good for information for guidance not sufficient to be said—in what way in the way of evidence in the way of observation upon evidence there are few cases in which observation on evidence may not be of some use there are none at all in which evidence itself is not absolutely necessary to exclude evidence indiscriminately on both sides is turning fortune loose to do the work of justice to exclude evidence from one side only leaving the door open to it on the other side is a sort of arrangement which to judge of it in the abstract could have been dictated one should have thought by no other principle than that of determination to do injustice under the technical system however not only has evidence been excluded in detail—evidence of such and such a particular nature in consideration of its nature but evidence has even been excluded in the lump without     any consideration of its nature the whole mass of evidence whatever evidence might had it not been for the exclusion have been delivered on this or on that side if it really be not conducive to the ends of justice to shut the door on either side against evidence—against all evidence in the lump without knowing what it is—to show in any instance that by this or that arrangement in any established system a door has thus been shut in this way against evidence is to show that the arrangement in question is repugnant to the ends of justice thus to class it is to condemn it to condemn it and on the surest grounds in one of two senses given to it the word conclusive as applied to evidence seems in a manner peculiar to english law the reason will appear presently in one sense it puts no exclusion upon evidence of any sort evidence thus spoken of as conclusive may be said to be spoken of as conditionally conclusive conclusive primâ facie—conclusive nisi in another sense it puts an exclusion upon evidence—upon all evidence on the other side not to speak of real evidence—not to speak of other circumstantial evidence—it pronounces all witnesses on the other side liars all witnesses be they who they may and in whatsoever number in this sense the absurdity of the propositions of which it makes the leading term the rashness the inutility the mischievousness of all decisions grounded on them is when once stated too evident to be proved it pronounces some fact or other impossible is it then really impossible what probability then is there that it will be not only asserted by a witness but also credited by the judge is it not impossible then why will you pronounce it so evidence spoken of as conclusive in this sense may be said to be spoken of as absolutely conclusive evidence absolutely conclusive is that to which the effect is given of putting an exclusion upon all counterevidence the question concerning conclusive evidence—whether this or that lot of evidence shall be treated as conclusive regards species of evidence it regards the propriety of laying down a generic or as on this occasion we may term it a specific rule pronouncing that the truth of the sort of fact shall be inferred by the judge as often as any evidence of the sort in question is produced it regards i say the genus of the lot of evidence for as to the individual lots no decision is or ever can be grounded on any lot or body of evidence but that lot or body of evidence is treated as conclusive with relation to the individual suit in hand but in so far as the lot under consideration is no more than the individual lot the question whether it shall be conclusive or no has no place in any book of jurisprudence—in any book in which from the decisions pronounced in individual cases the author takes upon himself in the way of abstraction to deduce general rules   if the mass of evidence be made conclusive absolutely observe the consequence the nature of this will vary according as the suit is of a penal nature or of a nonpenal nature and in each case according as the side in favour of which the evidence is thus made conclusive is that of the plaintiff or that of the defendant let the mass of evidence thus rendered conclusive be composed suppose of the concordant testimony of two persons—two witnesses exhibited on the same side in the penal branch—to render the testimony of any two witnesses in this way conclusive absolutely against the defendant—to force the judge to convict a defendant upon the testimony of two witnesses whether it does or does not produce in his mind a persuasion of the fact of their delinquency—whether the testimony thus exhibited appears to him correct or not veracious or not—is as much as to give to any two ruffians a power to ruin any individual whatever or any number of individuals at their choice in point of property person reputation or life as the case may be in the penal branch again—to render the testimony of any two witnesses conclusive in this same way in favour of the defendant—to force the judge to acquit him in consequence of the want of such evidence to convict him believing him at the same time as above to be guilty—is as much as to confer on any two hireling perjurers a power to give a virtual pardon—to give even beforehand a certainty of impunity to any malefactor at their choice—to any number of malefactors at their choice whatever be their crimes in the nonpenal branch—to render the testimony of any two witnesses conclusive in this same way in favour of the plaintiff—to force the judge on the ground of such testimony to confer on him the right he sues for the judge at the same time not believing him possessed of any good title to such right—is as much as to confer on any two and every two hireling perjurers a power of conferring a proprietary right of any kind upon any individual at their choice or any number of proprietary rights of all kinds and with reference to all subjectmatters upon any number of individuals at their choice and thereby to impose upon any individual the obligation correspondent to such right to impose therefore upon any number of individuals the obligations respectively correspondent to all manner of proprietary rights with reference to all manner of subjectmatters     in the nonpenal branch again—to render the testimony of any two witnesses conclusive in this way in favour of the defendant—to force the judge on the ground of such testimony to refuse to the plaintiff the right he sues for the judge at the same time believing him possessed of a good title to such right—is as much as to give to any and every two hireling perjurers a power of debarring any individual or any number of individuals at their choice from the acquisition of all such rights however necessary to their existence for the acquisition of which the law has made it necessary for them to obtain the decision of a judge to exempt accordingly any individual any number of individuals at their choice from the obligations respectively correspondent to those rights i e by the imposition of which and not otherwise those rights would be conferred away with all exaggeration—begone all false conceptions on a ground on which so much depends on truth and accuracy a power is one thing—a licence is another of a power the virtue is to enable a man to produce the effect in respect of which he is empowered of a licence the virtue is to exempt him from punishment in the event of his producing such effect to give to the two confederates in question the power of producing all these pernicious effects would be the result of any such rules as these respectively contended against to enable them to produce those same effects with certainty of impunity to themselves is not among the results of any of those respective rules for by the supposition perjury is necessary in each case to the production of the corresponding mischievous effect and from the punishment whatever it be that happens to be attached to perjury no exemption is given by any of these rules of the sort of licence in question in addition to the power what would be the consequence the utter destruction and subversion of political society in any community in which it should be established the ruin of all innocent persons the impunity and triumph of all malefactors the ruin of all persons having a title in each case to the rights sued for the exaltation of persons having no such title   where the effect of the rule is not to render the mass of evidence in question conclusive absolutely but only conclusive nisi the mischief is not so great yet still the effect if any is mischievous and it has no sort of advantage in any shape to help to balance it it is only in default of evidence on the other side that the certainty of prevailing is bestowed upon it but in the case where this certainty takes place what is it that truth and justice get by it here are two pieces of evidence each of them susceptible of an infinity of degrees of persuasive force—each of them susceptible of the lowest degree both together the degree of persuasion they would be productive of in the conception of the judge is not beyond the second degree in the scale of probative force—comes the rule and forces him to act as if the degree of his persuasion were at least somewhere above the middle of the scale the evidence appears false to him and he is obliged to act as if it appeared to him to be true one class of cases there is and that a most extensive and important one in which it may appear that evidence circumstantial evidence of this or that description is built upon as conclusive and even absolutely conclusive and that with perfect propriety and good effect this is the case of those acts which in consideration of their connexion with some principal act obnoxious on its own account and on that account put upon the list of crimes are therefore though in themselves and were it not for that connexion not obnoxious also put upon that list as in the case of those clusters of offences each composed of a principal offence and an accompaniment of accessory offences which come respectively under the titles of forgery coming smuggling and the like but in these cases the truth as upon a closer inspection will appear is that no such conclusion is really formed or at any rate that to warrant the course taken by the legislator it is not necessary that any such conclusion should have been formed of him by whom an act of the description of the accessory act in question is performed it has been deemed probable by the legislator that an act of the nature of the principal act has been or was to have been performed or that he has been or was to have been in some way or other assistant to the enterprise of him by whom such principal act has been committed but the propriety of the treatment in the extent thus given to it—in the extent by which it embraces the cluster of accessory acts in question—depends not altogether upon the rectitude of the inference whatever be mens views in the performance of the accessory acts thus converted into offences the legislator is warranted in converting each of the acts in question into offences if so it be that the prejudice if any that results to the agents in question and others from their nonperformance is not equal to the advantage gained by the check thus applied to the principal offence hence it is that in point of propriety any conclusion thus formed rests on very different grounds according as it is formed in the station of the legislator or in that of the judge formed by the legislator it is not necessary     that it should be true in every individual instance it may not be necessary that it should be true in so much as a majority of individual instances formed by the judge—formed that is to say with such effect as to have served for the foundation of a general rule of jurisprudential law—it is productive of mischief if there be but a single instance in which it is not true it is productive of mischief at any rate in that one instance why because the individual in question had no warning to abstain from the act—like most other rules of jurisprudential law it falls upon the victim with the weight and is attended with the barbarity and iniquity of an ex post facto law if the evidence which in the cause in hand it is proposed to consider as conclusive is evidence that has been exhibited not in that same cause but in another cause that has no relation to it—the impropriety of the regulation is still more enorinous of the inference drawn from a lot or mass of evidence in any preceding cause no use no mention ought to be made in any succeeding cause here not only is mention made of it but the judgment then passed upon it is made to command the decision in such manner as to prevent the subject from being so much as viewed at all in its own proper lights in the one case extrancous matter is mixed with the proper matter the proper matter not being excluded in the other case not only is the extraneous matter admitted but in consequence of that improper admission the proper matter is excluded the case of conclusive cridence must be distinguished from the case of conclusive decision the case in which the decision in question is considered as being commanded by the evidence already adduced must be distinguished from the case where the decision is considered as being commanded not immediately by any document of the nature of evidence but by a document of the nature of a decision—a decision already pronounced pronounced whether in the same court or in any other court if in any other court whether in a court acting under the dominion of the same sovereign or in a court acting under the dominion of a foreign sovereign such is the distinction which has been rendered requisite by the inaccurate genius of technical nomenclature for the purpose here in question decisions decisions of other courts are spoken of under the name of evidence supposing the decision of the other court in question to have been grounded on evidence received on both sides it follows that from the admission of such decision as conclusive in regard to the facts on which it was grounded no such absurdity no such mischief follows as from the giving to evidence itself on one side a conclusive and thence an exclusive effect on what occasions and on what grounds may it be proper for one court to allow viz with regard to the question of fact this authority to the decision of another a question alike curious and important which belongs not however to the present head but to that of makeshift evidence there is one case in which in the absolute sense the term conclusive may be employed with propriety and yet the evidence upon which the exclusion is put by such conclusive evidence cannot with propriety be ranked under the denomination of counterevidence this is where on the ground of evidence in its own nature insufficient and inconclusive appearing on one side a sort of practical conclusion is built in favour of that same side to the exclusion of all such evidence as might have been adduced on that same side in the sort of case here in view no exclusion is put upon any evidence on the other side no exclusion is put on any evidence characterizable by the appellation of counterevidence why because the circumstances in which the practical conclusion in question is drawn are such that a conclusion of that sort must be made at a time when it is impossible as yet to know whether that side of the cause does or does not afford any counterevidence the case in question is this for the sake of simplification take as being the more common case the case where it is on the plaintiffs side that the insufficient evidence is thus conclusive the plaintiff using the forms prescribed by the technical system gives commencement to a cause—say a criminal one on the defendants side the time being come in which in the track marked out for defence something should have been done by him nothing in fact is done in the state of things thus described judgment of conviction is pronounced or some grievous load of vexation imposed on the defendant the plaintiff although able neither being required nor admitted to establish the fact of delinquency by any better evidence in this case the evidence such as it is on the ground of which the burthen in question is imposed upon the defendant belongs to the head of circumstantial evidence it consists of two distinguishable lots or evidentiary facts—first evidentiary fact the step taken or progress made by the plaintiff in his suit second evidentiary fact the negation of the step in question the step made necessary to defence on the part of the defendant to these two evidentiary facts corresponds in the character of the fact evidenced the delinquency of the defendant in respect of the offence charged     this kind of circumstantial evidence never is—in point of reason never can be of itself sufficient to support any such practical inference why because if the defendant be really guilty it is impossible but that some better some more apposite and direct evidence at any rate some ulterior evidence must be to be had but the authors of the technical system have found their convenience in putting it into the power of any man in the character of a plaintiff to put any other into a state of conviction or into a state tantamount to conviction on the ground of this flagrantly insufficient evidence having their reasons for not requiring nor so much as admitting better or ulterior evidence even when direct evidence of the most completely satisfactory description is to be had this abomination the result of the most barbarous iniquity or the grossest stupidity has been adopted by every existing modification of the technical system and in every country it covers a prodigious though everywhere a variable extent in the field of judicature but in the exclusion thus put upon evidence nothing we see that can with propriety be spoken of under the appellation of counterevidence is comprised suppose all that evidence that direct and satisfactory evidence which is thus excluded—suppose it all delivered there could not perhaps or at least would not in that stage of the cause be delivered any counterevidence any evidence on the defendants side on the part of the plaintiff whether the defendant knows as yet what has been done against him—what he knows where he is or whether he even exists is not as yet known the fact inferred in these cases is nonexistence of evidence on the defendants side and thence nonexistence of right the inference considered as being what it is a sweeping and allcomprehensive one is big with injustice everywhere there are two states of things the existence of which in the character of the efficient causes of the failure is at least not less probable than the nonexistence of evidence indigence want of the means of selfdefence in the judicial field want of notice viz want of knowledge of the obligation by which the party is urged to bring those means into action want of notice is the but too natural and lookedfor result of the contrivance employed by the genius of chicane for preventing the means employed under the notion of conveying notice from being productive of that effect in regard to indigence—to estimate the comparative probability as between this state of things and the consciousness of the nonexistence of evidence and thence of title—in the character of causes of failure in respect of the taking on the defendants side the steps requisite for the continuance of the cause say thus—of the whole number of inhabitants in the country in question england—as the number of those who are not able respectively to command in addition to the sum requisite for their subsistence for and during the continuance of the cause say a twelvemonth the least sum sufficient for the carrying it on on that one side say £ 0 is to the remaining number—so is the probability that the failure is the effect of indigence to the probability of its being the effect of the nonexistence of evidence and consequently of right on that same side†     the mischief being thus brought to view—the nakedness of iniquity official and professional being uncovered—the remedy is almost too obvious to admit mentioning render not to the plaintiff in any case the demanded service till after he has on his part produced appropriate evidence of some sort or other in support of it is it out of the mouth of his antagonist the defendant that the evidence or an essential part of it must come though in this case it is out of his power to produce that evidence at the worst he may produce though it he out of his own lips alone evidence that shall be sufficient to satisfy the conscience of the judge in such manner as to warrant him in subjecting the defendant to whatever vexation may be necessary for extracting from his lips or in case of necessity from his pen the evidence alleged to be necessary for the final substantiation of the demand obvious and effectual as is the remedy the bar opposed to it is no less so it supposes one party at least to be heard and heard at the outset of the cause but that neither party shall be heard especially at that stage is of all established principles the most inviolable a principle the violation of which would reduce westminster hall to a heap of ruins it would leave prisons empty it would lead captivity captive it would render offices neither worth selling nor worth giving it would bring the greater number of suits to an untimely end and leave the remainder not worth the continuance confined to the viles animæ—to the souls too wretched to yield fees—the creatures to whom it would be beneath the dignity of law or equity to do justice—the experiment was endured the father as it could not be prevented extended to those for whom alone that justice was made that is worth rendering it would be subversive of the very ends of judicature it was observed above that in one sense no exclusion could be said to be put by this arrangement no exclusion put upon evidence on one side as where an article of evidence produced on the other is made conclusive on one side alone true it is that by this arrangement no exclusion is put upon evidence why because the exclusion that is put involves the evidence on both sides in a word all evidence on the defendants because either he has had no notice or it is out of his power to profit by it on the plaintiffs because having done the needful having run the gantelope through the offices he is excused from giving evidence lest he should have none to give why should evidence be received what is there to be got by receiving evidence if anything what is scarce worth stooping for what is there to be got by receiving that which is not evidence look to those arcana imperit that have been divulged by the treachery of false brethren look to the lists of fees §   an article of evidence may with propriety be made conclusive for the purpose of an incidental decision a distinction requires to be made in regard to the stage of the cause the stage to which the evidence in question applies the case in which this disguised exclusion is absurd and mischievous is the case where—the fact to which the evidence is applied is the principal fact or among the principal facts on which the demand or the defence is grounded—the matter of fact upon which the ultimate decision has to be pronounced—and the decision to be grounded on that fact is also an ultimate decision as above very different may be the case where the     decision to be pronounced is no more than an incidental decision and the conclusion to be drawn a conclusion by which such incidental decision shall be warranted in this case and for the purpose of grounding such incidental decision frequently indeed does it happen that this or that article of evidence may be treated as conclusive this or that fact may in the quality of an evidentary fact with relation to this or that other in the character of a principal fact be treated as conclusive such is the case wherever upon the application of one party a decision is pronounced a judicial act done as of course upon an ex parte representation no opportunity of contesting the truth of it having been given to the other as where upon a representation made by a person saying that goods of his have been stolen and as from such and such circumstances he suspects by titius a warrant is issued for the arrestation and provisional confinement of the supposed thief for the purpose of an ultimate decision pronouncing titius guilty of the theft this evidence is not deemed conclusive for the purpose of the incidental decision pronouncing the guilt of titius to a certain degree probable to such a degree as to warrant his arrestation and confinement for the purpose of judicial inquiry this same evidence is deemed conclusive and it is even made absolutely conclusive for by the nature of the measure taken all faculty of combating the proposed decision by counterevidence exhibited antecedently to the delivery of it is taken away to the purpose of an incidental decision of any sort evidence of any description may be treated on the footing of conclusive absolutely conclusive evidence exclusive of all counterevidence—where the utmost mischief producible by the exclusion is outweighed by the advantage produced by the decision in relation to the several ends of justice thus in the case just mentioned the price paid for the advantage consists in the vexation and that commonly attended with expense produced by the restraint thus put upon locomotive liberty the advantage itself consists in the security afforded for the forthcomingness and thence for the justiciability of the supposed thief give him the opportunity of contesting the necessity and thence the propriety of his confinement the provisional and temporary confinement—if he is innocent he will come in and contest it but if being guilty he apprehends the proof will be strong enough for his conviction he will make use of the summons as a warning not to comply with the requisitions of justice but to elude them and make his escape to a certain degree every step on one side which on pain of greater inconvenience calls for any step to be taken on the other side is productive of vexation for in judicial procedure every step that is taken is attended with vexation in every instance therefore the evidence to which this effect is given is to a certain degree productive of that sort of ill consequence which is attached to the giving it the effect of conclusive and thereby of exclusive evidence if instead of a warrant for arrestation directed to a minister of justice a simple summons addressed to the suspected thief and requiring his attendance had been employed the vexation would have been lessened indeed but it would not have been done away and so far as this minor vexation is concerned the giving this effect to the evidence would have been productive of that sort of ill effect which is produced by the employing any lot of evidence in the character of conclusive and thence of exclusive evidence but be the vexation what it may—if it be productive of preponderant benefit and if at the same time the quantity of it be the least that it can be made consistently with the production of that benefit—it will always be warrantable by this observation we are led to the practical caution never to give to any lot of evidence the quality and effect of conclusive evidence till in respect of persuasive force it has been rendered as strong as it can be rendered without the production of preponderant vexation or other inconvenience viz to the person from whom the evidence is required which is as much as to say not to impose upon either party in particular upon the defendant the necessity of taking any step or ulterior step in the cause without the other partys the plaintiffs having antecedently been made to produce whatever evidence he is able to afford without preponderant inconvenience general rule— for the purpose of commanding an interlocutory decision in what cases shall any and what lot of evidence be regarded as conclusive answer in such cases in which the certain mischief—in the shape of collateral inconvenience by vexation expense and delay attached to the receipt of counterevidence with the consequent discussions—would be greater than the contingent mischief in the chance of direct injustice incurred by the chance of untrustworthiness understand proveable untrustworthiness produced by the absence of the light that might have been thrown upon the subject by the excluded counterevidence such is the general description of the cases in which the exclusion of counterevidence in opposition to evidence for grounding an interlocutory decision may be proper to the propriety of the principle no objection seems likely to be made how in each instance to determine whether this or that particular case comes within this general description is a     problem the solution of which threatens to be attended with considerable difficulties but though it is not possible to lay down any general rule indicative of the cases in which a certain portion of evidence may for the purpose of an interlocutory decision be treated as conclusive and counterevidence excluded—it is not difficult to point out two cases at least in which it cannot without impropriety be so treated viz   if the interlocutory decision is liable to be productive of irreparable damage   if the decision apparently on an interlocutory point have the effect of a decision on the main point §   aberrations of roman and english law in this respect in the roman law i do not observe any traces of evidence regarded as conclusive in the improper sense to a hasty glance the suppletory oath and the expurgatory oath wear somewhat of the appearance of it examined more closely they seem not either of them to be productive of any such effect the suppletory oath is admitted in default of other sufficient evidence on that side and does not command the decision—does not put an exclusion upon any evidence on the opposite side the expurgatory oath on the defendants side is not called for or admitted till after the plaintiff has had full liberty to adduce whatever admissible evidence he can obtain on his side in all these cases the testimony in question is admitted in default of more satisfactory evidence and is not understood to put an exclusion upon any other evidence in all these cases the arrangement is abundantly improper but the cause of the impropriety has already been indicated in another place it consists in the want of scrutiny it belongs not to the present head in english jurisprudence there is one remarkable case in which the effect of conclusiveness has been given to a mass of evidence this is the case of wager of law the conclusive operation is confined to the nonpenal branch of the law it operates on the side of the defendant and of the defendant only on the other hand the conclusiveness of it is absolute and after all these reductions the effect of it in practice is as pernicious as it is absurd in principle and from the degree of mischief of which it has been productive on this narrow ground a sort of anticipation may be formed how inadequate soever of the mischief of which it would be productive were the ground it covered more extensive in former days when the practice called wager of law that of a mans waging his law was in use the manner of it was this†—the demand on the part of the plaintiff having been exhibited in the accustomed form the defendant if he thought proper was at liberty to exhibit himself in open court to go through the ceremony of an oath and under favour of that sanction to deny the justice of the claim in terms altogether general prescribed by a formulary of the same tenor in all cases no details called for or permitted no other witnesses called for or permitted on that side no faculty of crossexamination allowed to the adverse party the plaintiff a certain number of fellowswearers were indeed not only admitted but called for on his part swearers but to what point not to any particular fact belonging to the case but merely to the general and irrelevant fact the opinion a favourable opinion respectively entertained by them in regard to the veracity of the party by whom they were thus produced to whatsoever evidence of the direct kind the cause might happen to afford—circumstantial evidence and that of the most vague and inconclusive kind evidence of character was substituted so much for the absurdity now comes the mischief two sorts of claims were originally infected by this debilitating plague   the sort of claim made by what is called an action of debt a demand of a sum of money a demand of the nonpenal kind by which the plaintiff in making his application to the judge called upon him to impose upon the defendant the obligation of conferring on the plaintiff the property of a sum of money liquidated in amount payable of course in coin of which the individual pieces were determinable by the defendants the intended collectors choice   the sort of claim called an action of detinue in debt the thing claimed was a mass of money liquidated in value—not liquidated—but as in such case is necessary left to the option of the debtor—in respect of the individual pieces of which the sum of money was to be composed in detinue the thing claimed was an individual article of the moveable class a horse a piece of furniture a picture a trinket and so forth by a conceit of the number of those which in the manufactory of legal decisions occupy the place of reason the effect of the wager of law on actions of debt has in one way or other been got rid of in some cases it was put aside and in other cases to which the pretence for putting it aside did not apply another sort of action an action with another name was fabricated—an action to which at the same time and in this view the wager of law was pronounced inapplicable i mean the action of indebitatus assumpsit which is the same thing as the action of debt in other words a promise indeed to comply with the obligation is alleged but the promise   0 is presumed that is where there is none feigned averred by an assertion wilfully false the consequence is that the demand of a sum of money is tolerably well cleared of this ground of defence by perjury and injustice relief is given justice is administered in a manner little if at all different from that in which it would be administered if the conclusive species of evidence in question the waging of a mans law were not applied to this case the action called an action of debt is thus far spoilt but in so far as it is spoilt another action is given which answers the same purpose far from being alike innocent is this remnant of ancient barbarism in the case where the subject of the demand is a specific material object in this case the remedy originally provided is the species of action called the action of detinue by the same baleful influence by which the action of debt is spoilt as above this action is spoilt also in the case of the action of debt for the part thus spoilt a succedaneum as we see has been provided in the case of the action of detinue no such succedaneum has been provided and the damage has continued for so many centuries unrepaired upon the principle of analogy nothing was more obvious nothing would have been more easy than the repair for the purpose of compelling the delivery of money where due—to the fact of the obligation you added in the way of fiction another fact a promise to fulfil it why not for the purpose of compelling the delivery or redelivery of a specific article yes analogy is the grand source and instrument of invention in this as well as every other line but to apply it usefully—to apply it steadily comprehensively and consistently belongs to none but an inventive mind the action of detinue is spoilt another action called an action of trover is given in the room but by this new device unfortunately the purpose is not answered a blunder is made and instead of the specific thing which is a mans due damages are given that is a sum of money according to the value which on the ground of the imperfect data that are commonly exhibited to them the judges of fact think fit to put upon it the remedy instead of that which belongs to the action of detinue is the remedy that belongs to the action of debt whence came the blunder not from a regard—a more scrupulous than consistent regard to truth a falsehood is called in—a proposition is assumed and a proposition more uniformly false in this case than in the case of the indebitatus assumpsit the story is that the article claimed by the plaintiff has been found by the defendant found by him and by him converted to his own use thereupon comes the action calling upon the judge to cause to be delivered to the plaintiff not the thing that belongs to him but a sum of money in lieu of it the defendant takes note of the price thus put upon it if it is more than he chooses to give for it he restores it if less that is if it be any advantage to him to keep it he keeps it the plaintiff pockets the money and the injury the defendant triumphs in improbity under the protection of the law there are things the value of which to a feeling heart is beyond all price these are precisely the things which the law abandons to the wrongdoer and to all wrongdoers there is a remedy in kind indeed to be had in some cases in that sort of a court which is called a court of equity but the optics of a court of equity are too highseated to spy little things and a mass of value equal to the expense of more than a years subsistence to an individual of the most numerous class is set down by every court of equity to the account of little things so much for the remedy itself and the cases in which it is to be had at any price and as to the price that is to be paid for it that is for the chance of it in time and money—where law reckons by months equity reckons by years where law reckons by crowns equity reckons by pounds so delectable is this institution the wager of law in the eyes of lord coke that he seems to pride himself in his countrys exclusive possession of it† its merit consists in what in this that it does he says no harm why because for the same demand though there be one sort of action an action of debt which is clogged with this appendage there is another an action on the case which stands clear of it wherever it has no effect at all there and there only it has no bad effect unhappily the reason given for the supposed harmlessness of an institution confessedly useless is not true in fact for notwithstanding the silence of this archlawyer on the subject another sort of demand there is as we have seen to which that clog does apply and which being spoilt by it and having no succedaneum leaves the subject without a remedy in regard to this institution of which the highest supposed merit is that of doing no harm while its real character is that of operating as a denial of justice—the matter of triumph to lord coke that no other country has the like blackstone‡ shows to be very far from well grounded     an institution that is peculiar to england or nearly so is crossexamination in nonpenal causes by neither of these professed panegyrists has this truly honourable peculiarity been noticed by neither of them has it been observed that it is by the exclusion this unnatural institution puts upon crossexamination that the poisonous quality of it operates to have been consistent if consistency had been a quality capable of adhering to english law especially at the rude period here in question the privilege should have been extended not to the defendant only but to the plaintiff and then the effects of the institution as applied to the two sides of the cause being equal and contrary would have destroyed one another to the plaintiff i say as well as to the defendant or if to one alone rather to the former than to the latter why because if for a man to swear falsely to save himself from a loss is wicked and in proportion to its wickedness improbable—to swear falsely for no more excusable purpose than the obtaining an undue profit for himself at the expense of subjecting another man to an undue loss is still more wicked and in that respect still more improbable this chapter having been left unfinished by the author what follows has been added to it by the editor a few paragraphs which for distinction have been put in inverted commas consist of fragments written at different times by mr bentham for the remainder the editor is alone responsible this is not the only sort of case in which the sworn but uncrossexamined and selfserving testimony of a party to the suit is received as conclusive that is to the exclusion of counterevidence the practice in chancery we are informed by phillipps invariably is that a party is entitled only to extracts of letters if the other party will swear that the passages extracted are the only parts relating to the subjectmatter there is another rule by which a mans own testimony is rendered conclusive evidence in his favour and that too on such a subject as that of his own character the witness indeed in this case is not a party in the suit but for anything that appears he may be the vilest of malefactors and he is at any rate under the influence of an interest which is one of the strongest of all interests in the bulk of mankind while even in the vilest it cannot be a weak one a witness as we have seen† is not compellable to answer any question the answer to which it true might tend to degrade his character if however he chooses to answer the party who asks the question is bound by his answer and is not allowed to falsify it by counterevidence‡ the above seem to be the only instances worth mentioning in which an article of orally delivered testimonial evidence has in english law been made conclusive the instances in which similar effect has been given to an article of circumstantial evidence are innumerable and many of them have been already brought to view   as often as a decision has been given against either of the parties in a suit on no other ground than that of his having failed at a particular stage of the suit to perform any operation which has been rendered necessary at that stage by technical rules to the obtainment of justice so often has the nonperformance of that operation been taken as evidence and conclusive evidence of what is called in the language of lawyers want of merits that is of the badness of his cause of the justice of the demand whatsoever it be that happens to be made upon the defendant provided the suit does not happen to be called a criminal one nonresistance on his part is regarded and acted upon as sufficient evidence and to the plaintiff possession is given of the object of his demand just as if the justness of it had been proved even a lawyer will not pretend that on any ground of reason the inference is a conclusive one pecuniary inability especially under the load of factitious expense imposed everywhere by the technical system is another cause equally adequate to the production of the effect in every part of the empire of the technical system and more particularly in england this inability will have place in the case of a vast majority of the body of the people if a presumption thus slight were not received in proof of the justice of the plaintiffs claim and in the character of conclusive evidence—if such direct proof of it as were to be had were in every instance to be required—a     number of malâ fide suits with the produce of which the coffers of the man of law are at present swelled would have no existence thus it is that under the technical system every court calling itself a court of justice is in effect an open shop in which for the benefit of the shopkeeper and his associates licences are sold at a fixed or at least at a limited price—empowering the purchaser to oppress and ruin at his choice any and every individual obnoxious to him or not on whom indigence or terror impose the inability of opposing effectual resistance the real condition in which the great majority of the people in the capacity of suitors have been placed by the factitious expenses manufactured by the man of law is an object too reproachful to him to be suffered to remain undisguised in this as in every other part of the system extortion and oppression find in mendacity an everready instrument the real condition in which the suitor has been involved the misfortune of defencelessness through indigence is put out of sight a crime is imputed to him in its stead and for that crime not only without proof but under the universally notorious consciousness of his innocence he is punished contempt is the word constantly employed to designate this imaginary crime the real the universally notorious causes of his inaction are fear and impotence but a man cannot be punished avowedly for fear he cannot be punished for impotence mankind would not submit themselves to tyranny so completely without a mask adding calumny to mendacity they pretend to regard his inaction as originating in contempt and it is on this mendacious accusation of their own forging that they ground the ruin they inflict on him under the name of punishment in equity the defendant who from his own poverty or ignorance or the carelessness of his lawyer is so unfortunate as not to put in an answer to the plaintiffs bill stands a great chance if a poor man of being a prisoner for life he is committed to gaol for the contempt and as he is not released without payment of fees—unless he has money to pay these fees or can find some one else who will pay them for him he must remain there all his life instances of this sort have not unfrequently through the medium of the newspapers been presented to the public eye   as often as a contract or any other legally operative instrument is pronounced null and void on account of the nonobservance of any formality—so often the sort of exclusion of which we are here treating has place a man claims a landed estate under the will of the last proprietor the will is produced in court it is found to have the signatures of two witnesses only instead of three or one of the three is proved to have put his name to the will in the absence of the testator the will is rejected and the party loses his estate the rejection of the will may perhaps be considered as a penalty for noncompliance with that injunction of the law which requires that certain formalities should be observed considered in this point of view it has been shown in a previous book† to be unnecessary and objectionable but it may also be regarded as grounded on the presumption that the will was spurious or unfairly obtained here then is this one circumstance viz nonobservance of legally prescribed formalities received as conclusive evidence of spuriousness or unfairness the fallacy of this supposition has also been made sufficiently manifest in the book already referred to this article of circumstantial evidence which is conclusive in law is so far from being conclusive in reason that it scarcely amounts even to the slightest presumption until two things be ascertained first that the party knew that these formalities were prescribed and secondly that compliance with them was in his power that spurious or unfair instruments have not frequently been prevented by the peremptory requisition of these formalities is more than i would undertake to say but an assertion which one may venture upon without much danger of mistake is that there is scarcely an instance of any instruments having been actually set aside for the want of them in which there was not a considerable if not a preponderant probability of its being genuine   almost all estoppels are exclusions of the sort now under consideration you are estopped say the lawyers from proving so and so the meaning of which is that they will not permit you to prove it for this they have sometimes one pretext sometimes another something which you yourself have said or done or something which has been said or done by somebody else there is a great variety of instances in which they tell you that you are estopped by a previous decision either of the same court or of some other court of justice these have been already noticed under the head of adscititious evidence‡ at other times you are estopped by what they term an admission you are said to make an admission if you say or do anything or if any other person says or does anything for you which a judge construes as an acknowledgment on your part that a certain event has happened that is anything from which he chooses to infer its     happening after which though everybody perhaps who knows anything about the matter knows that it has not happened and would say so if asked the judge to save the trouble of asking chooses to act exactly as if it had admissions are of two kinds—express or presumed and the former are either admissions upon record or admissions not upon record it is a rule with lawyers that no evidence can be received to dispute admissions upon record that is admissions in the pleadings if this rule went no farther than to confine the evidence to such points as are actually in dispute between the parties it would be a good rule in a lawbook a man may reckon himself fortunate if he hits upon a rule which has a reason if he expect that where the reason stops the rule will stop too it is very rarely that he will not be disappointed one example will serve as well as a thousand when a man against whom an action is brought for a sum of money denies that the plaintiff is entitled to the whole sum which he claims but admits that he has a just claim upon him for a smaller sum—the practice is for the defendant to pay into court the amount of the sum which he acknowledges to be due that it may remain in deposit until the cause is decided this payment lawyers choose to call an acknowledgment upon record and now mark the consequence the party cannot recover it back although he has paid it wrongfully or by mistake† as for extrajudicial admissions it is not always that they are even receivable when they are they are generally taken for conclusive for it may be observed in regard to this part of the law of evidence as in regard to so many other parts of it that neither the lawyers by whom it was made nor the lawyers by whom it has been expounded ever seem to know that there is any middle course between taking an article of evidence for conclusive and rejecting it altogether accordingly in reading the dicta of judges or the compilations of institutional writers from those dicta one is continually at a loss to know what they mean in speaking of this or that evidentiary circumstance what they tell you concerning it is that it is evidence now and then superadding as it were for the sake of variety the epithet good to the general appellative evidence would you know whether they mean that it is conclusive or only that it is admissible observe their actions see whether they send it to a jury for anything that you can collect from their words they are as likely to mean the one as the other the following will serve as an example as well of the ambiguity of which i have been speaking as of the sort of logic which passes for irrefragable under the dominion of technical rules when a party interested in the cause makes an admission against his interest—if he has not made it by mistake it is nearly the best evidence against him that you can have ergo it ought to be taken for conclusive against him when he has made it by mistake ergo the admission of a person who is merely a nominal plaintiff and who is not interested in the cause ought to be conclusive against the person who is so at least it was decided in the case of bauerman v radenius in which the admission of the plaintiffs on the record though not the parties really interested was received as conclusive and the plaintiffs were nonsuited i say received as conclusive because when a plaintiff is nonsuited—that is to say when his claim is dismissed by the judge without going to a jury—it is because if he had gone to a jury the jury must have found a verdict against him which would have been a bar to any future prosecution of the same claim whereas a nonsuit leaves it still in his power to bring a fresh action after remedying the defect which would have compelled the jury to find against him the court of kings bench afterwards affirmed that is confirmed the nonsuit on which occasion mr justice lawrence said the present plaintiffs either have or have not an interest but it must be considered that they have an interest in order to support the action and if they have an admission made by them that they have no cause of action is admissible evidence this judge here with much naïveté displays the manner in which under the influence of technical rules what is known to be false is taken for true in order that what is evidently unjust may be done he knew as well as the nominal plaintiffs knew that they had not an interest in the cause but what of that the law knew that they had there is an overflow of legal learning on the question what effect to your prejudice shall be given to the admission of your agent and here again recurs the usual alternative it is either not received or it is received as conclusive it either excludes all other evidence or it is itself excluded thus in one case† a letter from the defendants clerk informing the plaintiff that a policy had been effected was held to be good evidence meaning here conclusive evidence of the existence of the policy and the defendant was not allowed to prove that the letter had been written by mistake and that the policy had not been made while in another case‡ where the fact sought to be established was that     a bond had been executed by the defendant to the plaintiff which the defendant had got possession of the master of the rolls refused to admit as evidence of this fact the declaration of the defendants agent who had been employed to keep the bond for the plaintiffs benefit and who on its being demanded by the plaintiff informed him that it had been delivered to the defendant it might seem to a cursory reader on comparing these two decisions either that the predilection of judges for bad evidence was such that rejecting an admission in other cases they were willing to receive it upon the single condition of its being made by mistake or that in laying down rules of evidence blind caprice was the only guide in this apparent inconsistency however there is a principle though no one would have thought it it is this that the admissions of an agent are not to be received unless made by him either at the time of his making an agreement about which he is employed or in acting within the scope of his authority it is not that what he says on these occasions is more likely to be true than what he says on other occasions it is that it is impossible to say a man is precluded from questioning or contradicting anything that any person may have asserted as to his conduct or agreement merely because that person has been an agent and as it would be unjust to preclude him from contradicting it it is not permitted so much as to be heard besides these express admissions there is an extensive assortment of presumed ones when a man precludes himself from disputing a fact by the tenor of his conduct and demeanour the meaning of which is that the court will presume an admission from anything that a man does which they think he would not have done if the fact had not been true this is the principle but as to the extent of its application there is no criterion of it except the index to the reports it has usually been applied only to cases in which the presumption afforded by the act is really strong and might reasonably be held conclusive in the absence of counterevidence though certainly not to the exclusion of counterevidence since there is not so much as one of the cases in which the presumption is not liable to fail without touching upon the grounds of failure which are peculiar to this or that case there is one obvious ground which is common to them all a mans actions can never prove the truth of a fact except in so far as his belief of it is evidence of its truth and to hinder a man from proving that a thing did not happen because at some former period he believed that it did even if you were sure that he believed it which in general you are not it being only inferred from his actions would be unjust in any case but is more especially absurd when the fact in question is one of those complicated and frequently recondite facts which are constitutive of title take a few instances by accounting with a person as farmer of the tolls of a turnpike a party is estopped from disputing the validity of his title when sued by account stated for those tolls by paying tithes to the plaintiff on former occasions a defendant admits the right of the plaintiff to an action for not setting out tithes where a party rented glebe lands of a rector and had paid him rent he was not permitted in an action for use and occupation to dispute his lessors title by proving that his presentation was simoniacal in actions of use and occupation when the tenant has occupied by the permission of the plaintiff he cannot dispute the plaintiffs title although he may show that it is at an end in an action of ejectment by a landlord against his tenant the tenant cannot question the title of his landlord although he is at liberty to show that it has expired† in all these instances the presumption upon which if upon anything the decision must have been grounded is that if the plaintiff had not really had a good title the defendant would not have paid rent tithe c to him as the case may be to justify the rendering this presumption conclusive it would be necessary among a crowd of other suppositions to suppose that a tenant never paid rent to the de facto landlord without first demanding his titledeeds and going over them with a lawyer for the purpose of assuring himself that they did not contain any flaw   a whole host of exclusions lurk in the admired rule that the best evidence which the nature of the case admits of is to be required a rule which seems to please everybody and with the more reason as having no distinct meaning of its own it is capable of receiving any which any one thinks proper to attach to it there is a charm too in the sound of the words best evidence which no lawyer and scarcely any nonlawyer is able to resist the following seems to be nearly the train of thought in so far as anything like thought can be said to have place which passes through the mind of the submissive and admiring student when he hears this maxim delivered ex cathedrâ as something which like holy writ is to be believed and adored good evidence it naturally occurs to him is a good thing à fortiori therefore     it is unnecessary to say the best evidence cannot but be a good thing what however can be more proper than always to require and insist upon having the best of everything how admirable therefore the rule which requires the best evidence whether it is to be had or no and how admirable the system of law which is in a great measure made up of such rules as a preliminary to praising this rule a desirable thing would be to understand it for this however you have no chance but by looking at the practice the attempt to find a meaning for the words would be lost labour the meaning attached to it by lawyers has been different according to the different purposes which they have had to serve by it one use which they have made of it is to serve as a reason for excluding an inferior and less trustworthy sort of evidence when a more trustworthy sort from the same source is to be had as for example a transcript when the original is in existence and forthcoming applied to this purpose the rule if it were not so vague would be justly entitled to the appellation of a good rule the purpose at any rare with the limitations which have been seen in the book on makeshift evidence must be allowed to be a good purpose another use which has been made by lawyers at times of this rule is to enable a judge at no greater expense than that of calling a particular sort of evidence the best evidence to treat it as conclusive in favour of the party who produces it or the nonproduction of it as conclusive against the party who it is supposed ought to have produced it in both cases putting an exclusion upon all other evidence and it is in this application of the rule that it presents a demand for consideration in this place take a sample of their best evidence—of that best evidence which by such its bestness puts an exclusion upon all other evidence speculative position or antecedent—written evidence is better than parol evidence practical inference or conclusion—therefore in case of a contract when there exists written evidence of it with certain formalities for its accompaniments oral evidence is or is not to be admitted in relation to the purport of such contract is or is not whichever is most agreeable and convement to the judge such is the plain and true account of the matter for distinctions are spun out of distinctions and the light of reason by which they would be all consumed being effectually shut out on and on the thread might continue to be spun without end observe the inconsistency in english law circumstantial evidence of the weakest kind comparison of hands by persons acquainted or not acquainted with the hand of the person in question—or even the bare tenor of the instrument i e the circumstance of its purporting upon the face of it to have been executed i e recognised by the person or persons therein mentioned—this circumstance if coupled with the evidentiary circumstance ex custodiâ is if the assumed date of the instrument be as much as thirty years anterior to the day of production held sufficient and in default of counterevidence conclusive a dozen or a score of alleged percipient witnesses all ready to concur in deposing that to the provisions in the instrument mentioned this or that other had been agreed to be added or substituted—shall they be received and heard to say as much oh no that must not be it is against our rule about best evidence the general rule on this subject is that oral evidence is not admissible to contradict or vary or add to the terms of a written agreement cut down as this rule is by almost innumerable exceptions there is still enough of it left to do much mischief the exceptions if their practical effect be looked to are reasonable as narrowing pro tanto the extent of a bad rule in principle however there is scarce one of them which is tenable unless it be first granted that the rule is absurd it would be difficult for example to discover how in respect of the propriety of admitting oral evidence to show the abandonment of a written agreement it should make any difference whether the agreement was or was not under seal or why in equity on a bill for the specific performance of a written agreement evidence to prove that by reason of accident or mistake the written instrument does not correctly express the agreement should if tendered by the defendant be in certain cases admitted if tendered by the plaintiff refused the origin of the exceptions to this rule as well as to so many other technical rules is visible enough they were established by the same sort of authority which established the rules viz that of judges deciding pro hâc vice under the guidance of no principle but in accordance with the interest or whim of the moment or frequently with the laudable view of doing justice not withstanding technical rules a judge sees plainly that in this or that particular case if he adhere to the rule he will do injustice and without daring to set it aside or even allowing himself to suppose that a rule which had descended from wise ancestors could be other than a good one he has honesty enough to wish to do justice to the cause in hand and accordingly cuts into the rule with a new exception for every new instance which presents     itself to him of its mischievous operation taking care never to carry the exception one jot farther than is strictly necessary for his immediate purpose another judge follows and takes another nibble at the rule always upon the same diminutive scale and so on hence it comes that at length after the lapse of a few centuries the body of the law considered as a whole has become a little more just and a great deal more unintelligible while the law books have degenerated from the primitive simplicity of the old textbooks where everything was comprehended under a few simple principles in which whatever trespasses you might find against justice or common sense you will find none against consistency—and which would be perfect if conduciveness to human happiness were a quality that could without inconvenience be dispensed with in law and have swelled into an incoherent mass of mutually conflicting decisions none of them covering more than a minute spot in the field of law and which the most practised memory would vainly strive to retain or the most consummate logic to reduce to a common principle oral evidence it seems is receivable to explain in many cases in which it would not be receivable to vary the terms of an agreement the general rule is that in case of a latent ambiguity—that is to say an ambiguity which does not appear on the face of the instrument but is raised by extrinsic evidence—extrinsic evidence will be received to explain it thus if a testator bequeaths to john stiles his estate of blackacre and it appears that he has two estates known by that name oral evidence will be received to show which of the two he meant provided always that there be no possibility of giving effect to the instrument in terminis without the aid of other evidence for if it have a definite meaning though a different one from that of the testator it does not signify when they cannot by any means contrive to give execution to the ipsissima verba of the will then it seems they will condescend to inquire what the testator intended not so when the ambiguity is patent that is apparent on the face of the instrument in this case the door is inexorably shut upon all extrinsic evidence and if the intention of the party cannot be inferred from the context the clause will be void on account of its uncertainty you are unskilled in composition after making mention in your will of two persons your brother and your younger son you bequeath to him an estate in this case it may possibly admit of dispute to which of the two you meant to bequeath it what however can admit of no dispute is that you meant to bequeath it to one or other of them as therefore it is doubtful whether you intended that a should have it or b the judge will not give it to either of them but gives it to c the heiratlaw whom it is certain you intended not to have it or if he gives it to either of the two persons who and who alone can possibly have been meant he gives it upon the slightest imaginable presumption from the context there were twenty persons standing by when you executed the will all of whom knew perfectly well from your declarations at the time which of the two parties in question you meant but none of whom he will suffer to be heard and this is what lawyers call requiring the best evidence for this rule two reasons have been given one a technical that is avowedly an irrational one the other one which pretends to be rational the technical reason is the production of lord bacon it is this the law will not couple and mingle matter of specialty which is of the higher account with matter of averment which is of inferior account in law for those to whose conceptions the incongruity of so irregular a mixture might fail to present itself in colours sufficiently glaring a subsequent lord chancellor brought forth the following less recondite reason that the admission of oral evidence in explanation of patent ambiguities would tend to put it in the power of witnesses to make wills for testators an objection which would be very strong against any one mode of proof if it did not unhappily apply to every other all hearing of evidence lets in some danger of falsehood what however was probably meant is that the admissibility of oral evidence to explain a will would frustrate the intention of the law in requiring preappointed evidence a better sort of evidence than oral and less likely to be false if this be the meaning it is enunciated far too generally it is true that preappointed evidence consisidered as a genus is better than oral but it is not true that every particular article of the former is better than the best conceivable article of the latter it is not true that the signature of three witnesses is better cæteris paribus than the oral depositions of twenty yet this rule excludes the latter evidence on the plea of its inferiority to the former†     another consequence of the technical maxim that written evidence is better than parol a maxim which like almost all other general maxims of technical law is not true in more than half the cases which it extends to is the exclusion in a great number of cases of oral evidence to prove that there exists a written document evidentiary of a particular fact the judges on the occasion of a reference made to them in the course of the late queens trial declared that the contents of every written paper are according to the ordinary and wellestablished rules of evidence to be proved by the paper itself and by that alone if the paper be in existence good provided always it be a necessary consequence that a paper is forthcoming because it is in existence upon the strength of this rule the judges decided that the supposed writer of a letter could not be questioned concerning the contents of the letter unless the letter itself were first produced and the witness asked whether he wrote it thus the only evidence perhaps which you have got and that too of so good a kind as the testimony of a writer concerning what he himself has written is excluded because another sort of evidence is not produced which would be better if you could get it but which in all probability you cannot get the superior evidence though not forthcoming to any practical purpose cannot be shown not to exist and it is therefore said to be forthcoming to the purpose of excluding all inferior evidence a volume might be filled with specimens of the injustice and absurdity which are the fruit of the rule requiring the best evidence take this example among others—a written instrument with certain formalities being the best evidence if in the written instrument any one of these formalities be omitted neither the agreement nor any other evidence of the transaction will be received thus a written instrument which requires a stamp cannot be admitted in evidence unless it be duly stamped and no parole evidence will be received of its contents if therefore the instrument produced is the only legal proof of the transaction and that cannot be admitted for want of a proper stamp the transaction cannot be proved at all as in an action for use and occupation if it appear that the defendant held under a written agreement which for want of a stamp cannot be received the plaintiff will not be allowed to go into general evidence for the agreement is the best evidence of the nature of the occupation† an agreement on unstamped paper not being itself receivable it follows naturally enough that if it be lost parol evidence will not be received of its contents nor even if it be wrongfully destroyed by the other party notwithstanding another technical rule that no one is allowed to take advantage of his own wrong but you can never guess from the terms of a rule to what cases it will be applied take the following still more barefaced piece of absurdity as a final specimen of the operation of this vaunted rule— the acts of state of a foreign government can only be proved by copies of such acts properly authenticated thus in the case of richardson v anderson where the counsel on the part of the defendant proposed to give in evidence a book purporting to be a collection of treaties concluded by america and to be published by the authority of the american government and it was proposed further to prove by the american minister resident at this court that the book produced was the rule of his conduct this evidence was offered as equivalent to a regular copy of the archives in washington but lord ellenborough rejected the evidence and held that it was necessary to have a copy examined with the archives‡ we may expect in time to see a judge arise who more tenacious of consistency than his predecessors will refuse to take notice of the existence of the city of london unless an examined copy of the charter of the corporation be given in evidence to prove it     can any exposure make this piece of technicality more ridiculous than it is made by merely stating it   i shall notice only one more instance of the species of disguised exclusion which forms the subject of the present chapter the sort of evidence which in this instance is taken for conclusive is the species of official document called a record records says phillipps are the memorials of the proceedings of the legislature and of the kings courts of justice preserved in rolls of parchment and they are considered of such authority that no evidence is allowed to contradict them thus if a verdict finding several issues were to be produced in evidence the opposite party would not be allowed to show that no evidence was offered on one of the issues and that the finding of the jury was indorsed on the postea by mistake on this piece of absurdity after what has already been said it can scarcely be necessary to enlarge somehow or other however lawyers seem to have found out that like everything else which is human so even a record—however high its authority and however indisputable its title to the appellation bestowed upon it by lord chiefbaron gilbert a diagram whatever be meant by a diagram for the demonstration of right whatever be meant by the demonstration of right—is still notwithstanding it be written upon parchment liable to error for they have found it necessary to determine that a record shall be conclusive proof only that the decision or judgment of the court was as is there stated and not as to the truth of allegations which were not material nor traversable this is fortunate the fact of the judgment being one of the very few matters contained in what is called a record which unless by mistake are generally true but however fallible in respect of other facts in respect of this one fact they hold it to be infallible and its infallibility itself needing no proof supersedes all proof of the contrary which therefore as it cannot prove anything it would be loss of time to hear accordingly it is not heard but inexorably excluded† chapter v of the rule that evidence is to be confined to the points in issue‡ this rule though good in principle is frequently as it is administered an instrument of mischief partly from being combined with a bad system of pleading partly from the perverse application which has been made of it to purposes for which it was never intended being an exclusionary rule it demands consideration in this place and the occasion seems a suitable one for taking notice not of the bad effects in the way of exclusion only but of the bad effects of other descriptions which are the fruit of it nothing can be more proper than to exclude all evidence irrelevant to the points in dispute and if the points in issue on the pleadings were always the points and all the points in dispute nothing could be more proper than to exclude all evidence irrelevant to the points in issue unhappily however to determine what are the points in dispute though the professed object of all systems of pleading is very imperfectly attained even under the best and the points really at issue are often very different from the points in issue as they appear on the pleadings in so far as the representation given in the pleadings of the state of the question between the parties fails to accord with the real state—in so far at least as any point that is of course any material point which is really in dispute is omitted or misstated in the pleadings in so far the rule which requires that the evidence be confined to the points in issue those points not being the points in dispute operates to the exclusion of all evidence     which bears only upon the real points in dispute this includes all cases of quashing grounded on what is called a flaw in the pleadings as for instance the case of a misnomer if you indict a man under the name of john josiah smith and it turns out that his real name is john joseph smith though nobody has the least doubt of his being the person meant and though he himself would not have the effrontery to declare upon oath a belief that he was not it is no matter—the indictment is quashed because the only question at issue as indicated by the indictment relating to the supposed guilt of josiah proof however convincing of the criminality of joseph is foreign to the issue on the same ground in an action for nonresidence the designation of the parish by the name of st ethelburgh instead of saint ethelburgha was held to be as lawyers term it a fatal variance on another occasion the ground of the quashing was that a party to a bill of exchange had been called couch instead of crouch on another that the prisoner was charged with having personated mcann while the evidence went to show that the man whom he had personated was mcarn it was not that in any of these instances any real doubt existed as to the purport of the charge nor was it that in the guilt of defrauding two persons with names so different as mcann and mcarn are there was deemed to be any such difference in point of enormity as could justify so great a diversity of treatment it was that the unbending spirit of technical rules requires that you should prove verbatim et literatim the very thing which you have asserted and whatever may be the real issue ties you down to the nominal one that the substitution of an r for an n could in any other way be effected than by dropping the proceeding and beginning de novo is what you will never get any common lawyer to understand it is the same when any other circumstance legally material is misdescribed in the pleadings as when the declaration stated an absolute promise and a conditional one was proved and when a declaration for assaulting a constable in the execution of his office alleged that he was constable of a particular parish and the proof was that he was sworn in for a liberty of which the parish was part a notable reason for depriving the plaintiff of justice or putting him to the expense of another suit to obtain it† the root of the evil here lies in the system of pleading to eradicate it entirely that whole system must be abolished the mode in which what is called pleading is now conducted namely by a sort of written correspondence between two attorneys must give place to oral pleading by the parties themselves in the presence of the judge when either no such mistakes as the above would be made or if made they would be instantly rectified even under the present vicious system however the quashing of the suit might be avoided much oftener than it is there are mistakes that are of consequence—there are others which are of none there are mistakes by which the opposite party may have been misled—there are others by which he cannot it is just certainly that after a party has intimated to his adversary his intention of proving a certain case he should be allowed to prove that case and no other since if there were no such rule the other party might be taken by surprise he might come prepared with evidence to rebut what be imagined was the claim against him and might find on going to trial that the one really brought was quite different this being the reason what then is the practical rule let the remedy be confined to the single case in which alone there is any evil to be remedied it the opposite party has really been misled or put to any inconvenience by the error he cannot one would think have any reasonable objection to saying so nor to delivering the assertion under all those securities which are taken for the truth of testimony in any other case unless therefore he is willing under these securities to declare that in consequence of the error he has been either prevented from bringing the necessary evidence or induced to bring evidence which was not necessary let the error he rectified and the cause go on as it would have done if there had been no error if he be willing to make such a declaration and if his adversary admit or fail to disprove its truth let the necessary delay when any delay is necessary be granted and let the party by whose fault the error was occasioned be subjected to the obligation of indemnifying the other for all bonâ fide expenses which he can prove to have been occasioned him by it if the rule in the cases above examined is attended with bad effects it is not that it is a bad rule but as has been already intimated that it is accompanied by a bad system of pleading there is however another set of cases in which the rule is applied in a sense in which it is altogether absurd facts being shut out under pretence of their not being the facts at issue which though unquestionably not the facts at issue are of the highest importance as evidentiary of those which are thus the custom of one manor is not to   0 be given in evidence to explain the custom of another manor unless it be first proved that both manors were formerly one or were held under one lord or unless the custom is laid as a general custom of the country or of that particular district why because customs are different in different manors and in their nature distinct but although the customs of different manors are different they may nevertheless be analogous and though the custom of one manor cannot of itself prove that of another it may assist in clearing up apparent inconsistencies in it or in obviating an argument grounded on its supposed improbability there is also another reason of still greater weight which we owe to the ingenuity of lord chief justice raymond for says he if this kind of evidence were to be allowed the consequence seems to be that it would let in the custom of one manor into another and in time bring the customs of all manors to be the same in the contemplation of so overwhelming a calamity it is no wonder that lord raymond should have lost sight of whatever inconvenience might happen to be sustained by the party in the right from losing his cause for want of such explanations as a reference to the custom of a neighbouring manor might have afforded especially if advertence be had to the appalling fact that the customs of all manors would come to be the same if suffered to be shown for what they are the reader will not of course indulge in any such vain fancy as that the custom which is good for one manor can be good or even endurable for the manor adjoining or that the inhabitants of one village could even exist under rules and regulations which bind the inhabitants of another village as well as themselves again in a question between landlord and tenant whether rent was payable quarterly or halfyearly evidence of the mode in which other tenants of the same landlord paid their rent is not admissible† yet what can be more strictly relevant the determining motive in such cases usually being the landlords convenience which may reasonably be presumed to be the same in the case of one farmer as of another mr harrison gives an abstract of eight cases decided under the rule that evidence is to be confined to the points in issue seven of which include this same sort of absurdity it cannot be pretended that the evidence thus shut out is irrelevant and to maintain as a general maxim that evidence of relevant facts is to be excluded because those facts are not expressly averred in the pleadings would be too great a stretch of technicality even for a lawyer for the above decisions however no better reason can be given—unless that of lord chief justice raymond which mr phillipps styles an argument of inconvenience be so considered with as good reason might any other article of circumstantial evidence be excluded a murder suppose has been committed the prisoner was near the spot he was known to be a personal enemy of the deceased and at a former interview he had threatened to kill him stains of blood were found upon his linen when he was apprehended and he had a bloody knife in his pocket what then none of these facts are in issue it is not said in the indictment that he was an enemy of the deceased nor yet that he had used threatening language towards him he is not charged with soiling his linen and though indeed it is alleged in the indictment that he killed and slew the deceased with a knife value sixpence it is nowhere imputed to him that he stained the knife at this rate the plaintiff would need to include in the declaration every fact which in the character of an evidentiary fact he might have occasion to bring to the notice of the judge we have now considered the rule in both its applications its abusive application which can never be other than mischievous and its legitimate application which to be purely beneficial wants only to be combined with a rational mode of pleading suppose the system of pleading reformed this rule to be a good one would only need to be always employed in its legitimate and never in its abusive sense when thus restricted however what does it really mean only that evidence is not to be admitted of any facts except either those on which the decision immediately turns or other facts which are evidentiary of them general as this rule is greater particularity will not in this instance be found to be attainable since the question on what facts the decision turns is a question not of evidence but of the substantive branch of the law it respects the probandum not the probans it does not belong to the inquiry by what sort of evidence the facts of the case may be proved it belongs to the inquiry what are the facts of which the law has determined that proof shall be required in order to establish the plaintiffs claim this circumstance obvious as it is might easily be overlooked by one who had studied the subject only in the compilations of the english institutional writers who not content with directing that the evidence be confined to the points in issue have farther proceeded under the guise of laying down rules of evidence to declare on each occacion what the points in issue are one whole volume out of two which compose     mr phillippss treatise on the law of evidence—with a corresponding portion of the other treatises extant concerning that branch of the law—is occupied in laying down rules concerning the sort of evidence which should be required in different sorts of actions or suits at law but why should different forms of action require different sorts of evidence the securities by which the trustworthiness of evidence is provided for and the rules by which its probative force is estimated if for every sort of cause they are what they ought to be must be the same for one sort of cause as for another the difference is not in the nature of the proof it is in the nature of the facts required to be proved there is no difference as between different forms of action in reason or even in english law in respect of the rules relating to the competency of witnesses nor in general to the admissibility or the proof of written documents nor in respect of any other of the general rules of evidence what mr phillipps i mention him only as a representative of the rest professes under each of the different forms of action to tell you is what facts in order to support an action in that form it is necessary that you should prove now what are these facts in every cause either some right is claimed or redress demanded for some wrong by a wrong is of course meant a violation of a right some one or more of those facts therefore by which rights are conferred or taken away or violated must at any rate be proved and if proof of any other fact be necessary it can only be as evidentiary of these if therefore a man professes to tell you all the facts some one or more or all of which you must prove in order to get a decision in your favour—he must furnish you among other things with a complete list of all the facts which confer or take away—and all the acts which violate all the rights which have been constituted and sanctioned by law this accordingly is what mr phillipps and others of his brethren attempt to do but to enumerate the facts which confer or take away rights is the main business of what is called the civil branch of the law to enumerate the acts by which rights are violated—in other words to define offences—is the main business of the penal branch what therefore the lawyers give us under the appellation law of evidence is really in a great part of it civil and penal law another part of it consists of rules which are called rules of evidence but which are really rules of pleading these are laid down under the guise of instructions for adapting the evidence to the pleadings it is not often however that a man has it in his power to mould the evidence as he pleases but he always has the power—that is to say his lawyers have it for him—of moulding the pleadings those on his own side at least as he pleases these rules therefore for adapting the evidence to the pleadings are in fact rules for adapting the pleadings to the evidence two examples will illustrate the intermixture of the substantive law with the law of evidence and one of them will also afford a specimen of the intermixture of rules of evidence with rules of pleading under the title burglary mr starkie begins by saying that on an indictment for burglary it is essential to prove— st a felonious breaking and entering  dly of the dwellinghouse  dly in the night time  thly with intent to commit a felony he then proceeds to inform us that there must be evidence of an actual or constructive breaking for if the entry was obtained through an open door or window it is no burglary that the lifting up a latch taking out a pane of glass lifting up foldingdoors breaking a wall or gates which protect the house the descent down a chimney the turning a key where the door is locked on the inside—constitute a sufficient breaking that where the glass of the window was broken but the shutter within was not broken it was doubted whether the breaking was sufficient and no judgment was given and so on in the same strain who does not see that all this is an attempt—a lame one it must be confessed which is not the fault of the compiler but still an attempt—to supply that definition of the offence of burglary which the substantive law has failed to afford the title burglary consists of twelve octavo pages not one line of which is law of evidence it is all like the part above extracted penal law except three pages which are occupied in stating how the ownership of the dwellinghouse in which the offence was committed must be laid in the indictment and which therefore belong to pleading to take our next example from the nonpenal branch of the law when mr phillipps in treating of the sort of evidence required to support an action of trover informs us that the plaintiff in this action must prove that he had either the absolute property in the goods or at least a special property such as a carrier has or a consignee or factor who are responsible over to their principal and further that he must show either his actual possession of the goods or his right to immediate possession and that he must prove a wrongful conversion of the goods by the defendant and that the denial of goods to him who has a right to demand them is a wrongful conversion and that the defendant may show that the property belonged to him or to another person under whom he claims or that the plaintiff had before recovered damages against a third person for a conversion of the     same goods or that he was joint tenant of the property with the plaintiff or tenant in common or parcener or had a lien on the goods or a hundred other things which it would be of no use to enumerate—what can be more plain than that he is here telling us not by what evidence an action of trover is to be sustained but in what cases such an action will lie that he is telling us in fact what we are to prove not by what evidence we are to prove it that he is enumerating the investitive facts which will give to the plaintiff a right to the service which he claims to be rendered to him at the charge of the defendant and the divestitive facts by which that right will be taken away from him yet of this sort of matter the whole of the chapter a few sentences excepted is composed and this it is that composes the greatest part of almost all the other chapters in the volume which yet does not include any sorts of causes except those which in form at least are nonpenal i do not mention this as matter of blame to the institutional writers from whose compilations the above examples are drawn—there are some things really belonging to the subject of evidence which it is necessary to state in treating separately of each particular kind of action viz the nature of the corresponding preappointed evidence if the law has rendered any such evidence necessary to support the claim that is the subject of the action and also the nature and amount of the evidence which the law renders sufficient to establish a primâ facie case and throw the onus probandi upon the other side with this matter really belonging to evidence it may be convenient to mix up such matters belonging to civil and penal law as ought to be adverted to by the professional agent of the party who brings the action the arrangement which is best for the practitioner or the student of the law differs as much from that which is best for the philosopher as the alphabetical arrangement of words in a dictionary differs from the methodical classification of them in a philosophical grammar chapter vi of negative exclusions whatever be the matter of fact in dispute of considering rights and obligations antecedently to all dispute whatever be the matter of fact on which the existence of the right or obligation in question depends taking things as they exist at any given point of time let us conceive as existing at that point of time a certain quantity of evidence operating in affirmance or disaffirmance or part in affirmance part in disaffirmance of such right or obligation setting aside the case of preponderant inconvenience in the shape of vexation expense and delay—the established system of procedure if perfect in this respect but no more perfect than it might be and ought to be must have secured the existence of two results—  that the whole stock of evidence so existing shall in case of the existence of a demand for it for a judicial purpose be actually presented to the cognizance of the judge   that the evidence so presented be presented in the most trustworthy shape of which regard being had to the particular nature of it whether testimonial real or written it is susceptible arrangements directed to the former of these ends have for their object the forthcomingness—those directed to the latter end the trustworthiness—of the stock of evidence regard being had to collateral inconvenience as above mentioned—to make the most effectual provision which the nature of things admits of for securing the forthcomingness of the existing stock of evidence as above described is among the incontestable duties of the legislator this being admitted—if in this or that particular a provision directed to that object has altogether been omitted to be made—or having been made has failed of being effectual in the degree in which it might and ought to be effectual—the consequence is that to the extent of such deficiency an exclusion may be said to have been put in a sort of negative way—a negative sort of exclusion may be said to have been put upon the correspondent lot or article of evidence if in any instance in consequence of any such exclusion a particle of any such obtainable evidence fail of being presented to the cognizance of the judge—and the consequence of such failure be misdecision or failure of justice whereby the benefit of the right in question is lost—injustice proportioned to the value of such benefit is the result noncompulsion is negative exclusion to refuse to take at the instance of the party having need of the evidence the steps necessary to cause its being forthcoming is to exclude it various are the shapes in which denial of justice manifests itself various are the shapes and this is one of them if in this point of view we cast an eye over the collection of established systems we shall find the deficiencies under this head deplorably abundant—the mass of these exclusions and these injustices proportionably ample it is only however pro memoriâ that the subject is in this place brought to view to give a view of the system of arrangements by which on the head of forthcomingness the demands of justice promise to be satisfied     and the existing deficiencies as above supplied belongs to the subject of procedure at large to the head of negative exclusion belongs as we have seen a large division of the cases of direct exclusion which have formed the subjectmatter of this book but in those cases the exclusion was in every instance the result of express determination called forth by actual views taken of the subject by the ruling powers in the present case it may in many instances have been the result of mere oversight and want of reflection and in every instance this purely negative cause would have been adequate to the production of it book x instructions to be delivered from the legislator to the judge for the estimation of the probative force of evidence chapter i preliminary observations §   use of instructions from the legislator to the judge relative to the probative force of evidence we have seen the causes—the psychological causes—by the operation of which on the mind of the witness deception is liable to be produced in the mind of the judge sinister interest improbity and imbecility—to one or other of these we have seen all those causes to be referable had the immediate causes alone been to be taken into the account the catalogue might have been still shorter improbity might have been omitted since it is only in as far as it is coupled with sinister interest—it is only through the intervention of sinister interest that to this purpose or any other improbity is capable of operating in the character of an active principle we have seen that in no instance can any one of these circumstances be employed with propriety as a ground for the exclusion of any article of evidence but what we have also seen is that there is not one of them by which a just cause is not presented for regarding the evidence with a suspicious eye for regarding the trustworthiness of it as diminished by the influence of the circumstance hence the propriety of delivering a set of instructions to the judge pointing out to his observation the source and degree of its inferiority in point of trustworthiness—of its tendency to produce deception and thus putting him upon his guard for exclusion substitute the rival remedy instruction nothing it will be seen can be more innocent nothing in every point of view more unexceptionable in so far as the instruction is operative all the good that could have been done by the rough remedy of exclusion is done by this gentle and rational substitute if inoperative inasmuch as the same line of conduct as that which is indicated and recommended by the instruction would have been practised without it—even then and at any rate it does no harm but under the system of instruction and in spite of the instruction—in this and that instance it may be said it may happen to the judge to give credence or appear to give credence to this inferior evidence and thus being in reality or perhaps in appearance only deceived and misguided by it misdecide in consequence an injustice which if the deceptitious article of evidence had by an obligatory rule of law stood excluded would not have taken place true after hearing under the system of instruction an article of evidence that under the exclusionary system would have stood excluded it may happen to the judge to misdecide but so it may and ever and anon does happen to the judge to misdecide after hearing evidence of a sort to which no exclusion has under any system been applied under the system of instruction the judge has before him the instruction which in its nature cannot be so much as intended to serve as a guide to the understanding of a judge without also serving as a check upon his willserving on each occasion to point the attention of the public to the course taken on that occasion by the judge of the exclusionary system in so far as it extends the effect is to tie up the hands of the judge it is the application of will to will—of arrogance to subjection—of a man without understanding to another labouring     as he presumes under the like misfortune it is the policy of one to whose perverted optics all men are liars and all judges fools so many exclusionary rules so many insults offered by the author of each rule to the understanding of those whose hands are expected to be tied by it coming from the legitimate legislator addressed by him to his subordinate the judge—whatsoever selfconceit and rash presumption there might be in it there would be at least no usurpation no pretergression of the bounds of official authority the hands he ties up are the hands of his constitutional subordinate—hands to which be the occasion what it may in some way or other he applies additional bands by every word he utters but in fact so it is that in england at least the exclusionary rules have not in any instance had the will of the legitimate legislator for their source in every instance they have had for their author some lawyer in the character of a judge who tying or pretending to tie his own hands has provided a set of manacles—ready made manacles into which his successors to save the trouble of thinking have spontaneously introduced their hands but though in this or in any other system of incongruous arrangements the influence of folly ought never to be left out of the account there seems reason enough to suspect on the grounds so often already referred to that in the composition of this system improbity lawyercraft acting under the spur and the direction of sinister interest had an important share hitherto whether in the character of legislator or pseudolegislator man has manifested and certainly not altogether without reason less confidence in the ascendency of his understanding than in the efficiency of his will had it been otherwise laws would have been somewhat less numerous instructions i mean from the legislator to the judge would not have been as they are to this day almost without example one consolation is that in the way of instruction it is not altogether out of the sphere of industry and intelligence though unclothed with power to be of use when the individual is out of the way jealousy dies with him and then comes the time for his words to pass for whatever may be their value among the living wisdom is nowhere to be found but in the seat of power she lodges under the privileged robes and is passed from hand to hand in company with seals and purses in the ensuing pages a sample may be seen of the instructions which on the subject of evidence it might be of use for the legislator to furnish to serve as a light to guide the footsteps of the judge the more plainly true it may happen to them to be the less extraordinary they will appear and the less free from all pretension to be taken for anything beyond the obvious dictates of simple common sense in the case of a body of instructions—supposing a code of that description to be inserted in the aggregate body of the laws—one comfortable reflection presents itself viz that by this part no addition need nor therefore ought to be made to that part which in the shape of an inevitable load is imposed upon the memory of individuals the subject the private citizen as such has no need to load himself with it it belongs not either to the catalogue of his duties or to the catalogue of his rights the person whose judgment it is calculated to assist is the judge and no one but the judge the person for whose assistance in the way of instruction it is designed is the judge to the individual it is of no use but in the event of his having the misfortune to become a suitor nor then but in the event of his observing on the other side some witness or witnesses whose testimony he observes or suspects to be exposed to the action of some interest—some sinister interest against the seductive influence of which it concerns him that the judge should be sufficiently upon his guard §   instructions to the judge not given under existing systems and why under existing systems when a lot of testimony exposed on any particular score to suspicion is brought forward the grand or rather only object of consideration is whether or no it shall be admitted if admitted—what degree of credit shall be attached to it i e what circumstances there are in the situation of the witness by which the degree of confidence that might otherwise be reposed in his testimony may be diminished is a topic scarce ever so much as glanced at it is accordingly only for the purpose of serving as a ground of exclusion that any circumstance in the character of a cause of comparative untrustworthiness is ever brought to view if in the character of a legal ground for exclusion the circumstance is sustained it is then pronounced an objection—a good objection—to the competency of the testifier if in that character it be repelled it is then said to be not good as an objection to the competency of the witness but as an objection that goes to his credit and in that character if it be a jurycause to be considered by the jury here then and without any sort of instruction or assistance from the official judge—the jury by the light of common sense are supposed to be natural competent and perfect judges of the degree of credence proper to attach to any the most suspicious evidence against which the door of the witnessbox is     not peremptorily shut—while as to the question whether it shall be heard or no it is at the same time taken for granted that they are radically incapable of forming any tolerable judgment even with the help of all that official wisdom to which where the question is concerning the interpretation to be put upon an article of law whether jurisprudential that is imaginary or statutory that is real law they are expected to pay the most implicit deference the question thus referred to the jury one might here suppose might be an occasion for the advocates on both sides to display their eloquence on one side in exaggerating—on the other in depreciating the force of the mendacitypromoting interest or other supposed cause of untrustworthiness whatever it may be in fact an allusion of this sort cannot but now and then be made but as for any argument at large—any regular debate it may be questioned whether one instance of any such argument be to be met with anywhere the reason one reason at least seems not difficult to divine besides the universal absurdity so inconsistent are the exclusionary rules that while interests purely nominal plainly incapable of exciting in the breast of any human being any the smallest particle of interest—of exercising in it any the smallest particle of influence are received as grounds for absolute exclusion—a dose of interest compounded of the strongest ingredients that human nature furnishes is not received in that character the consequence is that against calculation comparison ratiocination the door is shut by a kind of instinct ground thus laid out is as unfit a field for rational argument as a crowded china or glass shop would be for a fencing or a boxing match by the same considerations it is rendered pretty obvious how it has happened that for the guidance of the jury little or nothing in the way of instruction can rationally be expected from a judge instruction to a jury from an english judge not a proposition—no not a syllable could he utter on any part of the whole subject without running full butt against some one or other of his rules—without proclaiming the absurdity and mischievousness either of some exclusionary rule or of some exception taken out of it well therefore may he leave this exercise of the judicial faculty to the jury—to anybody who will exercise it or profess to exercise it feeling as he cannot but feel his utter inability to afford to them any the smallest assistance without exposing to merited contempt the system of doctrine to which he is tied down—doctrines for which neither defence nor apology can be found by any human being and of which in his situation it would not be decorous to speak the truth on the score of interest for example to what use could it be for a judge to set about weighing grounds of objection when in so many instances a party is admitted to testify in his own behalf in his own cause—on the score of improbity—when a criminal confessedly tainted with improbity in the highest degree is admitted under the impression of a mass of interest of which one ingredient is itself the strongest that human nature can be urged by thus it is that by the learned judges feeling themselves completely unequal and radically incompetent to the task it is abandoned altogether to that class of men—of ephemeral judges—whom on pretence of their inability to understand those books which made or not made promulgated or not promulgated every man is punished for not understanding they are so forward on all other occasions to lead like infants in a string frequently to pull them about and speak for them as if they were puppets from such a source it may now be imagined whether it be in the nature of things that any discourse capable of bearing the name or calculated to answer the purpose of instructions should ever have come whether from the bench in bits and scraps brought out pro re natâ like the rules of their phantasmagoric system of law to serve the purpose that happens to be in hand or from the study in the form of a treatise from a learned author of whatsoever class whether it be a briefless advocate or a superannuated judge incapable of finding a source anywhere in jurisprudential law—should such a body of instructions be looked for with any better prospect of success in statute law but from what sort of person then shall it come—from the attorney—who being paid at so much a sheet exhausts his powers in the efforts made to find surplusage screwing up to its maximum the multitude of the sheets—or from the scantilypensioned draughtsman whose occupation it is while an exhausted treasury is gaping for sustenance to draw taxbills against time and who never having opened his eyes to anything better looks up to surplusage to the works of the attorney as the only models for his works from whom can any such information be looked for but from one by whom the field has been surveyed and surveyed in all bearings with views directed to the ends of justice but under the feegathering system in what corner of any inn of court or chancery can any such person be looked for with any expectation of finding him to what ends in any of those receptacles of sham–learning can mens views have ever been directed     but to the ends of existing judicature the very opposites of the ends of justice §   object and character of the following instructions of the ensuing body of instructions the object will be to point out to the notice of the judge the several circumstances which by the influence they exert on the will of the witness or the indications they afford of his disposition and character moral and intellectual present themselves as having the effect of demonstrating the trustworthiness of his evidence—the probability of its being at once correct and complete—of its conforming itself throughout the whole course of it to the line of truth—or else diminishing this probability on the part of the testimony and thence diminishing the degree of the probative or persuasive force with which it is fit that it should act on the mind of the judge antecedently to the present stage of the work this topic never presented itself for consideration why because from the first to the last the proposition maintained has been that be the degree of trustworthiness ever so small ever so low it can in no case form a rational ground for the exclusion of the evidence but supposing this granted then and not till then comes the question what degree of persuasive force to attribute to it as to a great part perhaps by much the greatest they will be found so obvious to the most uninformed mind that in the character of information nothing could be more superfluous and even impertinent but in the way of memento the faculty of recurring to them may not be the less useful and commodious of a dozen considerations immediately following one another it may happen that there is not a single one that would not to the most uncultivated understanding be an obvious one but it may happen that for want of a simultaneous view some one of them may be out of mind and for want of that one the decision the judicial operation may fail of being so correct as it might and ought to have been if in the instance of the merely curious reader there be anything in them capable of affording to his understanding the slightest degree of instruction or exciting in his mind the smallest spark of interest it must be the continually repeated contradiction and disproof they give to the rules which govern the existing practice for in this quarter of the field of law not to speak of so many others the art of the english lawyer not to speak of other lawyers has two branches the art of knowing that which has no existence and the art of not knowing what is known to everybody else throughout the whole course of these instructions the english reader and more particularly the english lawyer would be apt to expect and thence to be more or less disappointed at not meeting with a number of technical terms which in the part here in question of the field of law are in present use had they been found capable of answering the purpose of correct information there is not one of them that would not have all along been employed but in this as in other branches of science it is not in the nature of terms of extensive import—of generic terms where they are the result of erroneous views of the subject to be capable of serving for the enunciation of truth of the classes among which transgressions productive of real mischief have been distributed in another work ten or a dozen characteristic properties have been enumerated as respectively belonging in common to the offences aggregated to each respective class—such and such properties to all offences against other individuals such and such to offences or supposed offences against a mans self such and such to offences striking not against any assignable individuals but undistinguishably against all the individuals of which the public is composed but of the classes of offences and other acts and objects as made up by the technical denominations employed by the technical system it is a property and the only property they have in common to have no natural property in common—to have nothing in common but the artificial arrangements made under that system in relation to those objects take for example the words crime misdemeanor felony præmunire tort larceny arson c c the omission was indispensable throughout the whole course of the work the purpose of it being to deliver useful truth and nothing else—terms which could not be employed without disseminating error pernicious error were incapable of being rendered subservient to the purpose just as a mixture composed of arsenic and sugar would be incapable of being made into syrup as a vehicle for any useful medicine but from this omission no sort of privation or inconvenience in any shape will accrue to anybody—at any rate to the nonlawyer—the words which in the room of these technical ones are employed—these natural expressions though they belong not to the language coined by lawyers belong not the less in fact and by rather a better title to the english language the words thus carefully because necessarily excluded belong all of them to a sort of cant or slang the     opprobrium of the body of the language a sort of slang never used but to a bad purpose—incapable of being ever applied to any good one by the omission of this lawyers jargon the reader the nonlawyer at least is no more left at a loss than he is by the omission of that other sort of flash language called the thieves cant or slang the language in use among unlicensed depredators the judge for whose use these instructions are designed is a judge whose views the source of corruption being supposed to have been previously dried up are directed not to the established ends of judicature but to their opposites the ends of justice and to such new views the common language of englishmen will be found as congenial as the established lawyers slang will be found inapplicable chapter ii of interest in general considered as a ground of untrustworthiness in testimony whatsoever be the general disposition and character of the proposed witness the trustworthiness of his testimony is liable to be affected by the interests of all kinds to the action of which at the time of delivering such his testimony he happens to stand exposed between the ideas respectively denoted by the words interest motive hope fear good evil pleasure and pain the connexion is inseparable without motive there is no interest without hope or fear there is no motive without good or evil there is no hope or fear† without pleasure or pain there is no good or evil to the several sorts of interest therefore correspond so many sorts or modifications of motives hopes and fears good and evil pleasure and pain the interests the influence of which is strongest and most likely to be exerted upon testimony are those which arise out of the following classes of pains and pleasures—   pleasures      the pleasures of taste     the pleasures of the sexual appetite     the pleasures of wealth     the pleasures of power     the pleasures of reputation     the pleasures of case     the pleasures of novelty or gratified curiosity     the pleasures of the religious sanction     the pleasures of sympathy    0 the pleasures of antipathy   pains      the pains of death     severe bodily torments     the pains of poverty     the pains of disgrace     the pains of labour     the pains of the religious sanction     the pains of sympathy     the pains of antipathy in regard to pleasures and pains besides those which are to be found in the above list a variety of others are exemplified in experience but in whatsoever number and variety those which are not inserted in it may be to be found they will it is supposed be found to come all of them under this description viz that the pleasures are such as to be at the command of whosoever possesses the taste or relish on which their existence depends and by that means are incapable of exerting an influence on testimony the pains such that the avoidance of them depends not upon testimony if in the case of a pleasure it be of such a nature as to be on some occasions at a mans command—on other occasions not at a mans command without his being in possession of some object serving as the instrument of that pleasure and the possession of such instrument is not to be obtained without money but is to be obtained by money—the pleasure in this latter case comes under the head of the pleasure of possession with relation to the matter of wealth—and becomes pregnant with one of the interests capable of acting upon testimony viz pecuniary interest thus as was the case with the earliest astronomers if a man having a taste for astronomy can content himself with the pleasure of contemplating the celestial objects on a clear night so far the pleasure he enjoys belongs to the class of those which are not pregnant with an interest capable of operating upon testimony but if to enable him to     reap this pleasure he requires an instrument such as a telescope the property or use of which is not to be obtained by him but for money—in that case his pleasure is pregnant with a sort of interest which is either the same with pecuniary interest or equally capable of exerting an influence on his testimony so again if it requires him as the study of astronomy by a clear night without an instrument would do to be at liberty—and for want of money to purchase his liberty he is confined to a chamber lighted only from within so again if having a relish for the pleasures derived from the ideas of the sublime and beautiful as presented by natural objects such as the sun the moon mountains and valleys seas and rivers the objects themselves are not sufficient for him without the assistance of macphersons ossian or thomsons seasons or burke on the sublime and beautiful—and the books are not to be had without money nor the money without testimony so again in regard to pains for example the pains attendant on this or that disease or indisposition if truly or falsely they are understood to be out of the reach of cure they too like the pleasures are incapable of giving birth to any of those interests by which an influence is occasionally exerted on testimony but if being understood to be within the reach of cure the administration of the cure is as in general it will be necessarily attended with expense then they come within the description of those pains which by the interest with which they are pregnant are capable of exerting an influence upon testimony without wine for example or without seabathing relief it is understood is not to be had by means of wine or of seabathing it is to be had but the wine or the seabathing is not to be had without money nor the money without testimony thus much for illustration and for removal of objections but in the cases here exemplified it is sufficiently evident that though at a first view it may appear that by the pleasures or pains in question an influence is exerted upon testimony and that on that score they ought to have been comprehended in the list yet upon a closer examination it appears that the interest by which the testimony is acted upon in those cases is neither more nor less than pecuniary interest and that the force of it is proportioned to the pecuniary value of the several instruments in question—the instruments by which the pleasure is expected to be procured or the pain removed the degrees of which the scale of testimonial trustworthiness is susceptible can rarely be anything better—anything more precise than merely relative absolute the nature of the subject does not in general allow them to be in some instances as will be seen presently and only in some instances you can say that whatever be the trustworthiness of the testimony in this first case it is less in that other case—still less in that third case but how much less is what you cannot say in either case language furnishes you not with the means it is not with trustworthiness in psychology as with temperature in physics in which you can say not only it was cooler yesterday at noon than today at the same hour but by observation taken each day on the thermometer you can express the difference by numbering in each case the degrees the only state of things in which the force of an interest whether in the character of a mendacitypromoting or in that of a mendacityrestraining interest is susceptible of measurement is that in which the correspondent pleasures or pains have for their efficient cause an object susceptible of mensuration out of all the species of interest it is only in two that this case is verified viz pecuniary interest and the aversion to labour in the case of pecuniary interest for example everybody sees that upon a given person proximity and probability being in both cases the same the operative force of a sum of £ 0 will be practically speaking though not in mathematical strictness double that of £ 0 so in the case of aversion to labour the operative force of a course of labour for two hours will be practically speaking double that of a course of labour of the same sort for one hour and mathematically speaking something more the irksomeness of labour depending so much more upon the species than upon the quantity as measured by time and of labour the same in species as well as quantity the degree of irksomeness being so widely different to different individuals in such sort that a quantity of labour which to one man is highly irksome shall to another be not merely indifferent but highly agreeable—quantity of labour forms but an imperfect and incompetent subject of mensuration there remains therefore money as the only efficient cause of interest and pecuniary interest as the only interest the force of which in the character of a mendacityrestraining or mendacitypromoting interest or motive is commodiously measurable yet this measuring rule once obtained—by reference to this by means of the principle of commercial or commutative exchange cases will happen in which the force of any other species of interest may by accident become susceptible of mensuration     thus suppose two political situations affording honour or power both or either without profit—considering each by itself it may be difficult to form any sort of estimation of the degree of force with which in the character of mendacityrestraining or promoting interests they may respectively operate upon the mind of a given person but suppose them to have been each of them the objects of purchase and sale—the one having been bought and sold for £ 000 the other for £ 000—in this case the force of the interest constituted by them respectively is as susceptible of mensuration as that of an interest constituted by money for an injury done or supposed to be done the party injured prosecutes the supposed injurer he knows beforehand that such is the course of practice he will not even in the event of his succeeding in the prosecution receive satisfaction in any pecuniary shape he understands on the other hand that the amount of the expense on his side is not likely to be less than £ 0 he prosecutes notwithstanding and delivers his testimony the interest by which he has been engaged to embark in this prosecution is the interest created by that modification of the pleasure of antipathy called the pleasure of revenge here then not indeed the exact force of that interest but the minimum of it is given and expressed in money it is certain that it acts upon him with a force at least equal to £ 0—that is to the apprehension of losing £ 0 since he pays £ 0 for the purchase of a chance of it with how much greater a force does not appear since it does not appear how much more he would have spent in prosecuting rather than not obtain the pleasure of the revenge there are five species of interest to the action of all or most of which a witness is generally exposed all concurring in exercising on his testimony a tutelary—a mendacityandfalsityrestraining influence an influence such that the stronger it is the greater is his trustworthiness acting consequently in the character of so many sanctions contributing all of them to bind him to the observance of the laws of truth they are   the fear of labour or love of ease produced by the difficulty of composing for the occasion and on the spot a statement which being more or less false must to answer any purpose that can be answered by falsehood wear the appearance of being true corresponding sanction the physical sanction viz the selfregarding branch   the fear of shame viz of the shame and consequent contempt or illwill which mankind in general are apt to entertain towards one who on any such important occasion is supposed to have willingly departed from the line of truth corresponding sanction the moral or popular sanction   the fear of punishment—legal punishment viz suffering under the name of punishment in general expressly attached by the power of the law to every departure at least when wilfully made on any such occasion from the line of truth sanction the political sanction   the fear of supernatural punishment—of the punishment to be expected in case of every such transgression at the hands of almighty power sanction the religious sanction   regret at the thoughts of the evil of which at the charge of this or that individual or assemblage of individuals the witness himself not included the transgression in question may be considered as more or less likely to be productive sanction the sympathetic sanction another branch of the physical sanction the social branch† in the instance of sympathy the direction in which it acts is far from being so uniformly and steadily on the tutelary or mendacityrestraining side as that of any of the four preceding sanctions in a cause of a purely criminal and penal nature presenting a defendant thereby exposed to punishment and no individual specially injured on the other side and the witness satisfied of his guilt—in this case the action of this interest supposing all the other tutelary and mendacityrestraining interests out of the question would be solely on the mendacitypromoting side in a suit between one individual and another punishment out of the question and nothing in dispute but money or moneys worth claimed by one and refused to be given up by the other love of justice as well as all partial regard out of the question this interest could have no place on either side remains as the only case in which this interest regularly joins its force to that of the other masses of interest above mentioned as constituting the four regularly acting mendacityrestraining sanctions the case where the suit being purely penal the defendant was not guilty i e does not present himself as being so to the mind of the person whose testimony is considered of the several sorts of interest mentioned in the table there is not one that is not capable of acting on a mans testimony in a sinister direction that is in the character of a mendacitypromoting interest nor is there one to which it may not by accident happen to act in the opposite direction that is in the character of a mendacityrestraining   0 interest an occasional casual mendacityrestraining interest acting in conjunction with the standing tutelary or mendacityrestraining motives above mentioned nor is there consequently a sort of witness to whose testimony in almost any sort of cause it may not happen to be exposed to the action of any number of casual interests on either side or on both sides all other circumstances being the same—the greater the affliction of the party suffering by the testimony will be apt to appear in the eyes of the witness—and thence unless in as far as any difference can be seen to have place the greater it is in reality i e in the eyes of the judge—the greater the improbability of the testimony being mendacious   one reason is that the greater the suffering of the party against whom the testimony operates the greater is the force with which on a person whose individual character is unknown one of the five mendacityrestraining sanctions—viz the force of sympathy—may be expected to act thus in a criminal case the punishment being capital or in any other way ultrapecuniary—it is less probable that by a pecuniary interest of a given magnitude or by the interest of revenge a man should be induced to aim at producing the conviction of an innocent defendant by false testimony than if the affliction to the defendant were confined to a mere pecuniary loss or any other punishment not beyond pecuniary   another reason is to be found in that love of justice which at least in a civilized state of society may be considered as having more or less hold on every human breast the criminal fact being by the supposition false and by the witness in question known to be so—the punishment supposing the infliction of it produced by the testimony will by the supposition be unmerited unjust were it not for this love of justice—the punishment about to be produced by the testimony in case of its being mendacious being the same—the disinclination to give in to the mendacity would be the same whether in point of fact the charge were true or false and the punishment accordingly merited or unmerited but of a disposition contrary to such indifference the prevalence seems to be indicated by general experience to exert an influence on testimony—an interest be it what it may acting in which of the two opposite directions it may must exist the idea of it as existing must at any rate be present to the mind at the time of delivering the testimony if at that time a man does not stand exposed to the action of any interest urging in a sinister direction it matters not to what interest acting in that direction he may have stood exposed at any former period his testimony will not be a less correct or complete expression of the recollections presented by his memory at that time but should that have happened which is very apt to happen and which in almost all instances will have happened—viz that antecedently to the judicial statement which a man makes on the judicial occasion under the authority of the judge he has held discourse relative to the fact in question whether in writing or vivâ voce in the presence of any other person or persons—in this case he has an interest in not delivering on any judicial occasion any such testimony as shall be irreconcilable with the antecedent discourse this interest is at any rate the interest of his reputation the motive for perseverance the fear of shame and to this must be added in many cases the fear of punishment viz of punishment which the falsehood may be a means of drawing down upon him in case of a prosecution as for perjury supported by the testimony of the persons in whose presence it happened to him to deliver on that former extrajudicial occasion a statement with which his present judicial testimony is irreconcilable†     to the action of this interest a man stands exposed whether the antecedent extrajudicial statement was true or false if false here then are two of the standing tutelary and mendacityrestraining interests—fear of shame and fear of punishment—acting by accident one or both of them in the direction and character of mendacitypromoting motives not that in this case they act in general either of them with their whole force on the sinister side for here the testimony dictated by the fear of shame with or without the fear of punishment is by the supposition false and mendacious it being false the discovery of its falsity will in a greater or less degree be probable and should such discovery eventually take place then comes the shame and the punishment on that side though it is only where present at the time that an interest of any kind acting in a sinister mendacitypromoting direction can exercise any influence—produce any falsity in the testimony yet neither should the influence of any interest by which it may have happened to the testimony to have been acted upon at any antecedent period be in every case disregarded supposing the witness not tied down by any antecedent extrajudicial statement as above there is no interest prompting him to represent the matter in any other light than that in which it presents itself to his recollection at the time but the influence of interest is not confined to the operation of delivering the testimony nor to the point of time at which that operation is performed at the time when the fact in question took place it may have influenced perverted and partialized the perceptions presented by it—the sort of cognizance taken of it at any succeeding point of time it may have influenced in like manner the recollection of it the picture retained of it in the mind for the will is on all occasions liable to be influenced by interest attention is in great measure at the command of the will and by a partial direction given to the faculty of attention conception and recollection are both capable of being rendered imperfect and partial to one side on looking over the list of interests and motives this or that one will be apt to present itself as being likely upon an average to act with greater force than this or that other but there is no species of interest the action of which has not by the testimony of experience been proved to be occasionally susceptible of every or almost every degree of force from the lowest to the highest in particular there is none the action of which is not susceptible of a degree of force equal at least to that of pecuniary interest created by the greatest sum of money that has ever been depending upon a mans evidence a consequence is that from the mere observation of the species of the interest to which the action of a mans testimony is exposed no just inference can be formed respecting the degree another consequence is that neither on the number of interests and motives acting on the same side can any such inference be grounded for suppose half a dozen motives acting on one side and on the other no more than one in the instance of each of the half dozen interests the degree of force may be so low and at the same time that of the single interest so high that the single one may preponderate this state of things is actually exemplified in the case of perjury for lucre in the character of a seducing a mendacitypromoting motive the force of pecuniary interest preponderates over that of all the standing tutelary and mendacityrestraining motives—love of ease fear of shame fear of punishment fear of god sympathy for the injured two three four or all five of them as the case may be if from the action of five interests of as many different species on one side while there is but one that acts on the opposite side the inference of the preponderancy of the five over the one is not conclusive—much less can the opposite inference be so—the preponderancy of the one over the five on this subject though no just inference fit for the guidance of judicial conduct can be deduced from numbers yet if it were necessary to frame such an inference the one nearest to truth would be that which should pronounce the chance in favour of the preponderancy of the five to be as   to       as the conformity or disconformity of a mans testimony to the line of truth will in relation to each distinguishable fact depend upon the clear amount of the aggregate force of interest acting upon it in relation to that fact—and that amount will depend upon the difference between the sums of the forces on both sides—it is equally the business of the judge in order to enable himself to form a right judgment concerning the credence due to the testimony to bring to light all those interests to confine his consideration to any one of them would be as effectual a means as he could employ were it his desire to be deceived the testimony of every man being at all times exposed to the action of the tutelary the mendacityrestraining interests some or all of them—while his being exposed to the action of any interest acting in a sinister direction—acting in the character of a mendacitypromoting interest is but matter of accident—it follows that in the case of any given witness antecedently to or abstraction made of his particular situation and circumstances truth is in every part of his testimony more probable than falsehood the only interest he has acts on this supposition on the side of truth on this supposition the absence of mendacity and even of bias is on his part certain the truth of his testimony would also be equally certain were it not for the infirmities to which in the character of a witness the intellectual part of every mans frame is liable—viz   original misconception or nonperception   subsequent oblivion or misrecollection   misexpression so many different facts as there are that it falls in a mans way to speak of in the delivery of his testimony to the action of so many different groups of interests may it happen to his testimony to be exposed a consequence is that the testimony of the same man may be true in some parts false and mendacious in others where a mans testimony is not exposed to the action of any interest acting in a sinister direction he will have either no wish at all in relation to the event of the cause or if he has any wish it will be on the side of truth and justice if at the same time that it stands exposed to the mendacityrestraining force of the tutelary interests it is exposed to the force of any interest or group of interests acting in a sinister direction his wishes will be on that side and his testimony if true will pro tanto have run counter to the current of his wishes if at the same time it is exposed to the force of any particular occasional interest acting on the same side with that of the standing tutelary ones there will then be interest against interest and his wishes will be on the one side or the other according to the comparative force of the contending masses of casual interest when the testimony of a man is delivered in a cause in which he is a party concerned in interest—in respect of every fact which to his eyes presents itself as of a nature to exercise an influence on the event of the cause his testimony is exposed to the action of interest in a sinister direction and by whatever part of his testimony if any a fact is asserted the tendency of which is to contribute anything towards causing the suit to terminate to his disadvantage that part of his testimony runs counter to the current of his wishes as often as this is the case i e that a fact possessing such a tendency is disclosed by his testimony there is in regard to every such fact so asserted by him a certainty that the disclosure of it has not been brought about by the action of any sinister interest and therefore that if not true it is at any rate not believed by him to be false and that the falsity if there be any is the result not of any sinister interest acting on the will but of some infirmity as above the seat of which is in the intellectual branch of his frame in so far therefore as the testimony a man gives is of a nature to operate to his disadvantage it presents a stronger reason for its being regarded as true than can be presented by testimony to the same effect by any other person as far as a mans testimony makes against himself it produces naturally on the mind of the judge a stronger persuasion of its truth than can be produced by the testimony of any extraneous witness to gain credence for a fact which true or false has been believed by the witness to be true—instances have sometimes happened where by his testimony he has deposed to facts of the falsity of which he himself was conscious at the time hence another consideration helping to     show the weakness of the inference that because in one part of his testimony a man has been false even to mendacity therefore in all the other parts of his testimony he has also been false the erroneousness of the rule false in one thing therefore in everything or once false and always false without being mendacious it may happen to a mans testimony to be false and that too even in consequence of the action of interest this is the case of bias by the force of bias understand the force of any interest acting on his testimony in a sinister direction and in such manner as to produce on the part of such his testimony a departure from the line of truth but a departure such as he is not conscious of falsehoods produced by bias are such and such alone of the falsity of which he by whom the false testimony is delivered is not conscious at the time it is not every sort of falsehood that a man is capable of uttering or at least apt to utter without being conscious of the sorts of falsehoods into which a man is most apt to be led are the following viz   negative falsehoods falsehoods consisting in the denial of some fact or circumstance which in reality took place a mans attention is in a great degree at his command which is as much as to say under the direction of his wishes what on any account he finds a pleasure—an unmixed pleasure in attending to he attends to of course what it gives him pain to attend to understand a clear balance on the side of pain he withdraws his attention from unless the pain produced by the perception be so great as to divest him of the command he possesses over his attention in slighter cases   falsehoods in degree or in other words falsehoods of exaggeration falsehoods respecting degree—viz in number weight or measure of the exact degree he has no recollection of the correctness of which he is himself persuaded if he has the falsity is mendacity not the pure result of bias he is fearful of departing from the truth to the prejudice of that side to which his wishes are attached by this fear he is driven into an error on the opposite side—an error to the prejudice of the opposite side suppose the falsity consists in representing the degree greater than it is under the apprehension of representing it as less than the reality he has represented it as being greater the considerations which pleaded in favour of increase being conformable to the bent of his wishes being agreeable to him being sources of pleasure the force of his attention was directed upon them since it went to increase that pleasure on the other side pain being the consequence and accompaniment of the attention the attention as naturally turned aside from it chapter iii of pecuniary interest considered as a ground of untrustworthiness in testimony in estimating the force of a pecuniary interest in its action upon the testimony of a man whose character in respect of probity is not taken into consideration two main points are to be considered—   the value of the respective interests in themselves   the pecuniary circumstances of the person in estimating the value of a pecuniary interest four points are to be considered—   the magnitude of the sum by which it is represented   the value of it in respect of time i e according as it is in possession or not in possession   if not in possession the value of it in respect of certainty according as the interest is vested or the possession depending for its commencement upon contingencies   the duration of it in respect of which in so far as the interest is represented by a sum of money perpetuity unless anything be specified to the contrary is supposed in whatsoever shape the property creative     of the interest happens to be—where for the purpose of comparison with another interest any correct estimate is to be formed of it—it must if not already existing in the shape of a sum of money be reduced to that shape the value and consequently the mendacitypromoting force of a pecuniary interest the money not being in hand is less and less in proportion as the time at which it is to be in hand is more and more distant so the time at which if at all it is to come in hand being given in proportion as the event of its coming in hand is more or less uncertain i e in the proportion between the number representative of the chances against its coming in hand and the number representative of the chances in favour of its coming in hand in regard to uncertainty a distinction must be noted between the case where the event depends merely upon physical causes not depending in ordinary cases upon the will of man such as the death of titius before that of sempronius and the case where it depends wholly or partly upon moral causes such as the will of titius or sempronius in the former case the interest will in general have a rateable value and the force of it may be rated at the sum which if sold it would as supposed produce in the other case it cannot generally speaking have any rateable value and yet the force of it when acting upon testimony may be little different from that which it would act with were the receipt of the sum regarded as not subject to uncertainty suppose a son the only child of his father the father a widower and beyond the age at which it is usual for men to marry or if married to beget children the estate of the father at his own disposal not assured to the son by law of the disposition of the father in respect of amity towards the son nothing known therefore amity to be presumed at market the interest of the son in the property in possession of the father he not joining in the sale would not be saleable yet suppose the title of the father to the whole estate to be in dispute and the son examined as a witness the force with which the mendacitypromoting interest created by the value of the estate acted upon his bosom would not be in this case materially less than what it would be had the estate been assured to him by law—viz to be received by him after and upon his fathers decease in like manner even setting aside whatever interest might in this case be constituted by the tie of sympathy the force with which their respective interests in the estate acted on their respective bosoms would not in the bosom of the son he diminished by a sum so great as the sum representative of the value of the estate for and during the fathers life inasmuch as during the life of the father the son is naturally a sharer in the advantages attached to the fathers property notwithstanding the legal dependency of the quantum of that share upon the fathers pleasure in a rough way and even in a way sufficiently adapted to divers other purposes the state of a mans circumstances may be expressed by the difference between the saleable value of his property in hand and the sum of the debts including pecuniary obligations of all sorts to the discharge of which he stands bound but for the purpose of estimating the seductive force with which a given mass of pecuniary interest may be considered as acting on a mans testimony several other circumstances will require to be taken into account viz—   the state of his pecuniary circumstances in respect of present exigency or the proportion between present need and present means and this whether the sum in question be needful for the purpose of procuring greater profit or of saving him from greater loss remember to this purpose the story of esau who under the pressure of hunger sold his birthright for a mess of pottage   proportion between his exigencies in respect of domestic relations and his pecuniary means according as the effect of such relations is to charge him with pecuniary obligations or to afford him pecuniary support whether the proposed witness be of the one sex or the other be unmarried or married be childless or have children and in what number and whether arrived or not arrived at a state of selfmaintenance whether they be respectively of that sex which has fewest wants and most resources or of that which has most wants and fewest resources with what other relations if any in any of the lines of natural relationship descending ascending or collateral the witness has any connexion contributing as above to augment the sum of his resources on one hand or that of his exigencies on the other   proportion between his pecuniary means viz the clear amount of them after addition of the amount of domestic supplies and deduction of the amount of domestic charges as above between his pecuniary means thus explained and his exigencies if any in respect of political station in life since of two persons with the same quantum of clear pecuniary means—one low in rank may be in a state of affluence—another high in rank in a state of indigence   habitual rate of expense is not in this respect altogether without its influence two men in pecuniary circumstances in every respect equal—the one habitually spending his whole income the other but the half of his—a     sum to a given amount whether coming in in the shape of extraordinary gain or going out in the shape of extraordinary loss will be apt to find the testimony of the nonsaving man more sensible to its influence than than that of the saving man for the guidance of the judges mind in the formation of his estimate of the trustworthiness of the deponents testimony it will in most cases not be worth while for him to subject either the deponent or himself not to speak of extraneous witnesses to the vexation attached to a chain of investigation thus particular and intricate but there are cases in which it may and since it will often happen that of the above particulars a number more or less considerable will come to light in the course of the cause as it were of themselves or without any trouble worth regarding—on this account it seems desirable that the influence of them should be habitually present to the mind of the judge the sum in question—and a mans sensibility to pecuniary induence in so far as it can be collected from circumstances of an external nature as above—being both given—the influence of the same sum will be greater—much greater in the case of its going out of hand in the shape of antecedently unexpected loss than in the case of its coming into hand in the shape of antecedently unexpected gain value of a mans property today say £ 000 sum at stake upon his testimony £ 00 let this sum be taken from him tomorrow—the amount of his property today is twice as great as what it will be tomorrow but let this same sum be given to him tomorrow—the value of his property tomorrow will not be twice as great as it is today but suppose that it even were twice as great the matter of wealth is of no value but in proportion to its influence in respect of happiness multiply the sum of a mans property by   by  0 by  00 by  000 there is not the smallest reason for supposing that the sum of his happiness is increased in any such proportion or in any one approaching to it multiply his property by a thousand it may still be a matter of doubt whether by that vast addition you add as much to his happiness as you take away from it by dividing his property by   by taking from him but the half of it in many instances there will be a difficulty in deciding in the case of receipt of money whether it be to be placed to the account of gain or of exemption from loss and in like manner in case of disbursement whether to the account of loss or of nonreceipt of gain of this difficulty when it occurs it concerns the judge to be aware but there are many instances in which it has no place chapter iv of interest derived from social connexions in general gain or loss may be expected either from the compulsory operation of law or from the uncoerced conduct of individuals the value of the sum at stake being given and the degrees of proximity and certainty respectively attached to the receipt or loss of it being given—whether it be from the dispensations of law that the assurance of acquisition or loss is derived is a question the answer to which makes it is evident no difference in the value of the interest nor thence in the force with which it is likely to act upon testimony in the character of a mendacitypromoting or mendacityrestraining motive if in respect of the value of the interests created and the force with which they respectively act upon testimony acquisition and loss when considered as resulting from the dispensations of law are in general superior to acquisition or loss to the same amount when expected from causes with which law does not interfere—this superiority is far from being constant or universal of the operations of law the effect can never be so prompt as the effect of operations in which the law has no concern is in many instances and how necessary soever the coercive and protective force of law may in general be to the giving to mens possessions a degree of certainty not derivable from any other source—yet in many instances acquisition or loss looked to from this or that source will appear to a particular individual still more certain as well as prompt than any acquisition or loss to the same amount that could have been expected by him from the hand of law for years together a journeyman has been employed by the same master at a guinea and a half aweek from any other master he would not expect to get above one guinea aweek it is in the power of the master any saturday evening in the year to break off all connexion with him on paying him the guinea and a half for his weeks work says the master to the journeyman on friday next you are to appear in such or such a court if on that occasion you do not give testimony to such or such an effect the wages you receive the next day will be the last wages you ever receive from me who does not see that the force with which a threat to this effect acts on the testimony will be greater than if in the event of his giving a testimony opposite to that required of him as above he were to incur a legal debt to the amount of twentysix guineas a years extra wages he not being destitute of the means of paying it     vary the case by substituting for employer and journeyman customer and dealer both of these in the condition of masters the result in respect of the action of the interest on the testimony of the witness will not be materially different let the event on which the supposed debt of twentysix guineas attaches upon the journeyman be this—viz that of the masters gaining the cause here then is an apparent interest appearing to act upon the witness in such manner as to incite him to testify against his master though it were at the expense of truth while yet in fact he is incited to testify in favour of his master by an opposite interest which though perhaps not apparent is much stronger than the apparent one ties of this sort are alike obvious and numerous in point of force—even supposing the interest created in each instance to be a mere pecuniary interest unfortified by any mixture of sympathy—it is no more susceptible of any determinate limits than the interest constituted by a liquidated sum payable on the spot if then to the exclusion of these less conspicuous but not less powerful ties the judge were to keep his eye fixed on the interest constituted by a liquidated pecuniary sum he would be in a way to be continually deceived if in the cases where it is thus as it were latent and unconspicuous the single force of pecuniary interest is capable of rising to a level with any to which a conspicuous interest of the same kind is usually wont to rise—much more is it where it happens to it to be corroborated by the force of sympathy in this situation in the ordinary state of things are to be found the several descriptions of persons who stand connected with others by the ties of natural relationship—   the child with reference to the father or mother or both   any person junior in age by whom expectations are entertained from the bounty of a relation senior in age whether in the simple ascending line as grandfather or grandmother or in the double or collateral line as uncle or aunt in any degree or their descendants in any degrees exclusive of the complex interest composed of a mixture of pecuniary interest and natural sympathy is the interest which has place where the one of the parties is subject to the direction and government of the other the case in which this sort of interest is capable of existing in its purest state unmixed with any of the other interests that are so naturally connected with it is that which in the bosom of the ward is created by his dependence on the guardian pecuniary interest howsoever accidentally combinable with it belongs not to the case and as to sympathy if it be a natural accompaniment neither is antipathy an unnatural one at any rate if it be supposed that upon an average there is a balance on the side of sympathy it cannot be supposed that this balance can in its amount approach near to that which has place in the more ordinary case where the relationships of guardian and parent are combined in the same person now the interest created by dependence on natural domestic power—of what is it composed of the fear of pains of many kinds added to the hope of pleasures of most kinds the interest capable of being created in the bosom of the domestic subordinate by his dependence on his correlative superordinate is so obvious as scarcely to require mention though it were only in the way of memento the interest capable of being created by the same relationship in the bosom of the superior—this interest howsoever obvious is somewhat less obvious than the interest created in the correlative and opposite case in general and throughout the circle of domestic relationships the social interest—the interest of sympathy is apt to exist in greater force in the bosom of the superordinate than in the bosom of the subordinate—in the bosom of the parent than in the bosom of the child and so on through the string of more and more distant relationships which are as it were the images fainter and fainter the oftener they are transmitted or reflected of the relationship betwixt parent and child of this disparity the cause is to be found in the pleasure of power peculiar to the parent and in which the child though the source of it has no share if in this or that instance the balance be reversed the cause is to be looked for partly in the superior sensibility of youth partly in the idiosyncratic temperament of the individual but besides this social interest the relationship of the superior to the subordinate is susceptible of giving lodgment to an interest of the selfregarding kind which must not be overlooked in the case of parent and child the superior stands bound by a variety of ties to make provision for the sustenance of the subordinate but the more of his sustenance the child draws from sources other than the pecuniary funds of the parent the     less is the quantity by which it is necessary he should diminish the amount of these funds as often therefore as money is at stake in a suit to which the child is party and the parent a witness—the interest to the action of which the testimony of the witness is exposed adds to the universallyoperative social interest an interest strictly pecuniary an interest of the selfregarding kind and so in regard to all persons standing in this respect in the place of parents allowance being made for the comparative faintness of the obligation legal or moral in their respective cases an interest exerting its influence on testimony is alike capable of being created by the hope of good and by the fear of evil on many occasions the object being given hope and fear looking to that object run into one another and are undistinguishable for when a good of any kind has been habitual in a degree sufficient to keep up expectation of its continuance it is difficult to say to which of the two denominations hope or fear the expectation entertained in relation to it ought to be referred in preference—to the hope of retaining or to the fear of losing it in a more particular degree the observation holds true in regard to that particular species of good which is composed of or has for its efficient cause the matter of wealth money moneys worth and whatever may be to be had by means of money here and there perhaps a mass of interest may be found consisting of the fear of evil without any hope of good—a mass of interest having no connexion in any way with the matter of wealth suppose two persons in office military or unmilitary the one to some purposes under the direction of the other from the favour of the superior the inferior is not in the habit of deriving nor in the way to derive money or moneys worth on the part of the inferior therefore the fear of evil if it exists exists in a state of relative purity unmixed with the hope of good suppose then what is generally the case that without committing himself in any way i e without subjecting himself in any degree to legal punishment or even to appearance at least to any certain and decided portion of shame it is in the power of the superior to inflict habitual vexation on the other the force of this vexation is the force with which the will of the superior is capable in an influential way of acting on the conduct of the inferior on any such occasion as that of delivering testimony as well as on any other let the degree of vexation thus producible be such that whereas the official emolument of the inferior is equal to £ 00 a year—to rid himself of this vexation he would be content to render under another superior the same official service for £ 0 ayear less on this supposition the nonpecuniary interest by which the testimony of the inferior may be acted upon in any direction proper or sinister is equal to a pecuniary interest constituted by the eventual assurance of a loss he having the means of sustaining it equal to the present value of an annuity of £ 0 a year for his life at twelve years purchase say £  0 in the case of these several relationships comparison being made between sympathy and antipathy—sympathy will naturally be regarded as the sort of affection predominant on an average the balance of such affections as are not of a selfregarding nature will naturally be looked for on that side and as adding its force to whatever may happen to be exerted by the pecuniary interest and the other selfregarding ones but it would be a gross oversight and a copious source of deception to the judge if to the purpose of judging of evidence or to any other purpose he were to be altogether unaware of the casual predominance of the dissocial affection of antipathy even between the nearest relations on a variety of occasions which force themselves upon his view he beholds the marks and fruits of their antipathy in the suits to which they are the contending parties and well may he conceive that the cases in which the antipathy thus manifests itself form but a part and that a small part of those in which it exists and that in a degree capable of exercising on testimony a sinister influence the inference therefore which is to be grounded on the several relations domestic and political is—a general presumption of mutual sympathy—stronger or weaker according to the nature and degree of the relationship—but on every occasion liable to be rebutted by special evidence chapter v of interest derived from sexual connexions i the superiority of the interest which the relation of husband and wife is capable of creating when compared with the interest capable of attaching itself to any of the others is too obvious and too clear of dispute to need bringing to view by any special observations the only particulars to which on the subject of this relation it can ever happen to need bringing to view are the cases forming so many exceptions to the general rule the cases in which the interest commonly attached to this relation and acting on testimony in a correspondent direction and with a correspondent degree of force may happen to act with an inferior degree of force though in     that same direction or even in a direction plainly opposite the general rule is too obvious to admit the possibility of the judges regarding it in any case with a degree of attention inferior to that which is its due on this occasion as on others one great use of a body of instructions from the legislator to the judge is the preventing him from seeking in the cover afforded by general rules a cloak for imbecility or indolence or negligence or indifference or partiality or corruption of a still grosser nature—in the present instance for affecting to see an influencing interest where there is none or to see such interest where there is an opposite one for presuming the bias of the witness to be on one side when the facts in the cause if he chose to look at them would show it to be acting on the opposite side a suit or cause criminal or civil the husband plaintiff or defendant on his side or on the opposite side the testimony of his wife is called in if nothing else appears in the cause than that she is his wife—if of the terms on which in respect of amity or the contrary they live no special indications present themselves—nothing but the existence of the matrimonial relation—the ordinary degree of affection must and will of course be understood to subsist but this presumption ought to be understood as capable for this purpose to be rebutted at any time by the proof of special facts indicative of the contrary such as separation whether by consent or by authority of law elopement on the part of the wife habitual and open adulterous cohabitation on the part of the wife in a house separate from that of the husband but neither should these indications howsoever strong the presumption which they afford be regarded as conclusive evidence of the absence of all interest separation will not take away the pecuniary interest which the wife has in the gain or loss that may happen to her husband unless her maintenance is fixed has been so for a length of time and all intercourse between them has ceased nor even then altogether since pecuniary loss on the part of the husband would in some cases disable him wholly or in part from affording such maintenance notwithstanding separation elopement or adulterous cohabitation still subsisting the common interest may have regained its original force if from other incidents there appears reason to believe that a reconciliation has already taken place or is likely to take place the interest and its influence on the testimony depending not on the outward and factitious bond or symbol of connexion a token given at some distant point of time—but upon the affections prevalent in the bosom of the witness at the very time of the utterance of her testimony—whatever indications of a contrary interest happen at that time to present themselves present the same demand for the judges attention as any other evidence by which the trustworthiness of testimony may be affected on this occasion however it concerns the judge to keep his attention open to two circumstances   one is that—where the importance of the cause in its own nature or in the eyes of the party and witness is such as to create an interest capable of supporting them under the trouble of the imposture—appearances of dissension and even enmity between the husband and the wife may be put on for the purpose of rebutting the presumption of conjugal partiality and thence gaining for her testimony a degree of credit beyond what properly belongs to it   another is that whatsoever illhumour or antipathy may be really prevalent at the time the pecuniary interest a selfregarding interest an interest in a considerable degree inseparable from the legal obligations attached to the connexion remains on the other side to oppose its force to that of the dissocial interest so that unless the case be such that the disadvantage that would fall on the husband in consequence of the loss of his cause would have no material effect on his purse—her testimony will not by any such disagreement be divested of all bias in favour of his side of the cause unless as is sometimes the case between adversaries e g in all acts of aggression so open as to expose the aggressor to inevitable punishment her antipathy for her husband has for the moment become stronger than her regard for herself the estimation in which a woman is held is apt to be more or less disadvantageously affected when after her having cohabited with a man in the character of his wife a discovery is made that there was no marriage or that for some cause or other the marriage was void in general therefore were no other interest at stake than the interest of her reputation—in a cause in which the fact or validity of the marriage were in question the testimony of the wife if examined on that side would be drawn by a strong bias to the affirmative side yet cases are not wanting in which the bias would be still more incontestably on the other side for example where the wife is prosecuted for bigamy if she can induce a persuasion that the supposed former marriage never took place in fact or was not legal she thereby exempts herself from whatever punishment is attached to that offence in adultery on the part of the wife concealment is commonly an object with both     delinquents and so far as it is preserved reputation remains unaffected but open adultery is likewise not without example nor is the case without example in which for the purpose of divorce proofs of the transgression have been purposely furnished by the wife in a cause in which the husband is a party concealed adultery on the part of the wife cannot with reason be regarded as a circumstance diminishing in any considerable degree much less destroying the complex and powerful interest by which the testimony of the wife is drawn towards the husbands side the unity of pecuniary interest and of that sort of reputation which is attached to condition in life remains unimpaired with illwill in any degree the transgression has on her part though a most natural not a necessary connexion either in the character of cause or in the character of effect friendship may remain unchanged the only thing certain is the existence of a man in whose society she has reaped a sensual gratification which by reason of absence or debility or indifference or estranged appetite or inferiority in personal accomplishments she has failed of experiencing in the arms of the man to whom she is joined by law for rebutting the presumption of partiality created by the legal connexion—a partiality in general little inferior in strength to that which either being alone would feel for his or her own cause—the judge will naturally carry to account whatsoever counterindications happen in any case to present themselves but it is seldom that the utility of such lights with reference to truth and security against deception and consequent misdecision will be important enough to outweigh the vexation expense and delay—more particularly the vexation—that would naturally be inseparable from an inquiry carried on for that special purpose cases however warranting and prescribing such inquiry are not altogether out of the natural course of things suppose a homicide and the husband under prosecution for the murder in the ordinary state of things and to judge on the ground of general presumptions the testimony of the wife should be little less partial to the husbands side than his own would be but cases have happened in which a wife by herself or in conspiracy with others has been concerned in the murder of her husband and the case may be that bearing towards her husband a degree of illwill strong enough to have determined her to the enterprise of ridding herself of him by such flagitious means her husband being innocent of the crime and known by her to be so her design is to employ her testimony to the purpose of procuring him to be convicted in this case the prevention of the tremendous calamity of judicial homicide may depend on a scrutiny into the particulars of the habitual intercourse between the husband and the wife ii for the particular purpose here in question—for the purpose of judging of the influence of social connexion upon testimony—it will not always be easy to say whether in the case of the female testifying in a cause in which the male is a party the action exerted on the testimony by the interest resulting from the connexion is likely to be most powerful in the case of the wife or in the case of the concubine in the case of the wife the bond of connexion excepting in the extraordinary case of divorce is perpetual in the case of the concubine it may be dissolved at any time at the pleasure of either of the parties but in the case of the concubine the proof of sympathy borne to her by the male is more conclusive than in the case of the lawful wife for if no such affection existed the probability is that he would not maintain her in that character whereas in the case of the wife though aversion had taken the place of amity she would not be the less his wife on the other hand again the point in question here is not the affection of the male as towards the female but the affection of the female as towards the male but of the affection on the part of the female towards the male the existence of the sexual connexion is comparatively but a remote article of evidence without affection on the part of the male the connexion would not continue but it may continue without any affection on the part of the female since her means and even prospects of subsistence may depend upon it it may be that from the first the sentiment never had existed perhaps having originally existed it has become extinct perhaps it has not only become extinct but given place to the opposite sentiment antipathy let the cause in which the male is a party be of the number of those in which money is at stake let it be considered in this particular case what differences are presented between the situation of the wife and the situation of the concubine in the ordinary state of things the interest   0 of the wife in this case is identified with the interest of the husband sharing together and in the company of one another the common property though in proportions in some degree dependent on the pleasure of the stronger party the gain of the husband is the gain of the wife the loss of the husband the loss of the wife in the case of the concubine the identity wants much of holding good since the connexion may be dissolved at any time but whether there be gain or loss the wife will be still the wife in case of gain her share in the additional mass will not be apt in her expectation to differ from the share she had been accustomed to occupy in the original mass and so mutatis mutandis in the case of loss her share will be in her expectation naturally in the same proportion on the other hand in the case of the concubine the gain if to a certain degree considerable may in her expectation be liable to excite his thirst for pleasure and send him in search of more agreeable connexions either in the same way or in the way of marriage but moreover in case of loss the loss if to a certain degree considerable may render the pecuniary burthen too heavy to be borne by one who has it in his power to rid himself of it at any time one case there is in which it is but natural that the interest of the concubine should act with much more force on her testimony than the interest of the wife on hers this is where though the marriage has not been dissolved to the purpose of giving room for another marriage the wife lives separately from her husband and at a fixed allowance in this case be the gain of the husband what it may the expectation of sharing in it is not likely to have place in the bosom of the wife whereas in the bosom of the concubine unless where the gain appears considerable enough to excite new projects an expectation of a share in the concern will come of course as to loss—in the bosom of the concubine the prospect of it will excite a double apprehension—the apprehension of seeing her share diminished and the apprehension of experiencing a total dissolution of the connexion from which it should have flowed but to any such loss the separated wife may be comparatively indifferent unless among the effects of it be that of trenching upon her separate maintenance two obvious circumstances there are by the force of which the condition of a concubine is gradually led towards a coincidence with the condition of the wife one is the birth of children especially when by their continuance in life their existence adds every day to the force of the bands by which their parents were united in the first instance the other is the duration of the connexion between the parents themselves where the importance of the cause is such as to warrant the inquiry the judge will perceive that the force with which an interest of this nature is capable of acting upon testimony has at least as good a claim to be taken into the account as that of any interest of a nature merely pecuniary expressible by a definite sum liable to be gained or lost by the testimony according as the result of the cause is in favour of the one party or the other from the addition of any other interest or interests operating in the same direction be their force what it may pecuniary interest cannot but receive additional strength and efficacy and if in the case of a pecuniary interest derived from this or any other of the social relations the quantum is not so apt as in the case of a simple pecuniary interest to be susceptible of liquidation—of being expressed by a determinate sum—the force with which it is apt to act on testimony is scarcely on that account the less considerable of a sum not liquidated by any arithmetical process the dimensions are left to be adjusted by the imagination and in a case of this sort the imagination is not less apt to err on the side of increase than on the side of diminution the relation of concubine to keeper is not recognised by the laws or it would not be what it is it would be changed into that of wife to husband in some countries it has been—in any country it is capable of being taken for a ground of punishment that which the legislator is disposed to punish—that which he would wish to prevent—that which he would prevent if it were in his power and if the mischief of the coercion necessary to prevention would not outweigh     the mischief of the obnoxious practice—cannot be regarded with satisfaction by the legislator nor ought in general to be so by the judge but in his displeasure how strong soever it be neither the one nor the other will find any sufficient warrant for withdrawing their attention from the object by which it is called forth from the object or from the effects good or bad which flow from it on all sides where the existence of such a connexion is taken for a ground of punishment it might be a severe task upon the sympathy of the judge were it out of his power to form his opinion relative to the existence of such a connexion for the purpose of judging of its influence upon testimony without proceeding to apply such his opinion to the same fact considered in the light of an act of delinquency and thereupon to apply punishment in consequence fortunately no such collateral conclusion need be formed to warrant the application of pure punishment—of a suffering which produces not on the part of any other individual any enjoyment to counterbalance it—stronger and more cogent proof is requisite than in the case in which that which passes out of the hand of one man in the shape of loss passes into the hand of another man in the shape of gain insomuch that by the transference though something in the way of happiness yet not everything is lost upon the whole for the purpose of punishment neither community of abode nor domination of the female by the male nor both together ought to be accepted as sufficient proof in the character of circumstantial evidence but for the purpose of judging of the influence of domestic relation upon evidence such intercourse may well serve for sufficient proof subject to the effect of any counterevidence deducible from other sources in the case of concubinage the common subsistence is for a variety of obvious reasons most apt to have for its source the property of the male hence in the relation between keeper and concubine the station of keeper is in the ordinary course of language as in the ordinary course of practice referred to the male sex—that of concubine to the female instances however in which the parts have been reversed are not without example and to the judge as to the legislator nothing that can ever happen to call for his attention ought to be strange to a case thus deviating out of the ordinary course of things it seems scarcely necessary that any detailed instruction should be adapted in what respects this converse case agrees with the ordinary case will be easily pointed out by analogy in what respects they differ may with little more difficulty be discovered by the light of contrast iii it remains to consider the simple case of the relation between two lovers the passion of love is a passion of the force of which on other occasions it cannot well happen to the judge not to be aware it would be a sad oversight if on an occasion of such importance as the one here in question its influence were to be overlooked without any aid from pecuniary interest the interest created by this passion is capable of rising beyond any height to which pecuniary interest particularly in a state to act on testimony has ever been known to arise but in the state of things in which love aims at marriage pecuniary interest is capable of adding its whole force in the case of the male the impression made by the personal charms of the female may have risen to any degree of strength there are no limits to the quantum of the property in possession or expectancy in which he may be entertaining expectations of possessing a husbands share and the right to which may be dependent on his evidence his own may amount to anything or nothing nor are there any assignable limits to the load of debt under the pressure of which it may happen to him to labour change the sexes what difference there may be will be scarcely worth noting for this purpose the power which by marriage the female acquires over the property of the male is not in general so great as the power which by the same contract the male acquires over the property of the female in this respect the force with which the interest created by the relation in question is capable of acting on the testimony of the female may be considered as suffering some diminution in comparison with the opposite case though a diminution so precarious as on the present occasion to have scarcely any claim to notice on the other hand as property is apt to fall in larger masses into the lap of the female than into that of the male at the same time that the male is less restrained than the female in his choice elevation by this ladder has been more apt in the instance of the female sex than in the instance of the male to have risen to extraordinary heights from the very lowest origin females have been raised by marriage even to the throne men though they have been raised to a station equally high have never by that same ladder been raised from a station equally low chapter vi of interest derived from situation with respect to the cause or suit in every cause each party except in so far as it may happen to him to be a mere trustee     and not connected by any tie of sympathy with any party having a selfregarding interest in the cause each party has of course in virtue of his being a party some sort of interest in the cause and supposing him heard or examined in the character of a witness the direction in which this interest acts in so far as it acts with any sensible degree of force will be in the mendacitypromoting line but independently of legal forms such as that which requires the concurrence of trustees who have no selfregarding interest and perhaps no interest of sympathy in the cause it will frequently happen that the interest which a man derives from his situation in the character of party in the cause—be it on the plaintiffs side be it on the defendants side—will be practically imperceptible this casual minuteness is however confined in a manner to the class of cases which exhibit a multitude of parties on the same side for if a man stands alone the fact of his subjecting himself to the vexation and expense incident to litigation affords effectual proof that the interest derived from his station in the cause possesses a magnitude sufficient to exert a real influence in general the interest which the proposed witness thus possesses in virtue of his station in the cause will be the only interest except that of the standing tutelary interests to the action of which his testimony will on either side stand exposed but as it may happen to the testimony of any man in the station of extraneous witness so may it to that of any man in the station of plaintiff or defendant to stand exposed to the action of any number of casual interests on either side or on both sides and these each of them in any degree of force on any occasion it may consequently happen that the force of this standing mendacitypromoting interest shall be counterbalanced and overbalanced by casual interests acting on the other side—that is in conjunction with the standing tutelary ones and to any such casually operating interest it may happen to apply to the whole of the partywitnesss testimony or to any part or parts of it less than the whole that is to say one or more of the entire assemblage of facts comprised in it out of this state of things several anomalies will be apt now and then to arise of the possibility of all which it becomes the judge to be advised the interest which a party be he defendant be he plaintiff has in the cause will not of itself be sufficient to restrain him from giving false testimony to the prejudice of that interest if there be any interest to a greater amount that acts upon him on the opposite side there is no defendant who all other interests apart would not yield to an unjust demand of £ 0 and even confess the justice of it if by so doing he were assured of gaining £ 0 there is no plaintiff who all other interests apart would not desist from a just claim to the same amount and even confess the injustice of it for the same recompense but so far from being absolutely certain and uniformly efficient is even the united force of all the tutelary mendacityrestraining interests that instances might be found in which the slightest casual interest of the pecuniary kind for example acting in a mendacitypromoting direction has been seen to overcome their united force the proposition therefore which was true reservation made of the influence of those tutelary interests may still be given for true even without any such reservation of the several species and degrees of interest thus attached to the partys station in the cause there is scarce any one to which by accident it may not happen to find itself opposed by a stronger interest acting in a mendacitypromoting direction and overpowering it feeble as interests of the social class generally are in comparison with those of the selfregarding class there is not of the selfregarding class any interest so high and strong as not to be liable to be opposed by an interest of the social class capable of overpowering it instances have been known in which delinquents have endured the very extremity of torture rather than disclose their coadjutors in england till comparatively of late years has existed a practice in virtue of which if a defendant in a capital prosecution on being called upon to say in general terms guilty or not guilty forebore to answer he was tortured to the very death but on condition of his submitting to this infliction his property which in the event of his conviction in the ordinary way would have been taken from his natural representatives by the king to his own use was suffered to take its ordinary course instances it is said have not been wanting in which men have thus submitted to death preceded by the extremity of corporal sufferance rather than expose the objects of their affection to that loss in this case no falsehood was uttered nothing at all being uttered nor was falsehood in any shape conducive or necessary to the purpose but inasmuch as an interest of any degree of slightness will sometimes be sufficient of itself to overpower the united force of the standing tutelary motives the supposition has nothing improbable in it that for the same purpose in addition to the corporal agony falsehood would not have been grudged in the case where men have suffered themselves to be tortured to death rather than give up their companions in delinquency     falsehood must in general have borne a part for in all such cases the defendant has in course been plied with questions and an answer denying his having had any such companions will have been a much more natural result than a confession of his having had associates accompanied with a refusal to disclose them even the tutelary interest created by religion the religious sanction—notwithstanding the uniformity with which it acts in opposition to mendacity on all ordinary occasions—may such have been its anomalies be regarded without any extravagant stretch of supposition as capable of driving a man into this transgression instead of saving him from it in denmark it is said the country was infested by a set of religionists in whose conceptions there was no road to everlasting happiness so sure as the scaffold nor to the scaffold any road on that occasion so eligible as that of murder especially if some child within the age of innocence were taken for the subject of that crime if in that case instead of a bloodstained hand a mendacitystained tongue had been chosen as the more eligible instrument the aberration from the line of reason and utility would hardly have been more wide the cases above brought to view are all of them out of the ordinary course of things so much so that there is none of them of which the existence ought to be presumed or the supposition of it acted upon unless the probability of the case be indicated by some special circumstance in the ordinary state of things therefore the following are the rules that may serve for expressing the comparative trustworthiness of selfregarding evidence—   so far as it makes against himself a mans own evidence is the best evidence more so than that of an extraneous witness for in this case such part of his testimony as has this tendency that is to say so much of it as is understood by him to have this tendency cannot for anything that appears have found any sinister interest to give birth to it on the other hand to prevent the utterance of it had it been otherwise than true there was the united force of the several tutelary sanctions strengthened by the accession of the casual interest in question whatever it be that is at stake upon the event of the cause selfpreservation against death if capital pecuniary interest if pecuniary and noncriminal and so forth   so far as a mans testimony makes in favour of himself it is inferior in trustworthiness to that of an extraneous witness not known to have an interest depending on the credence given to or withholden from the facts asserted in such his testimony the following cases however present themselves as so many exceptions to these rules—   if the interest which the extraneous witness has at stake be of more value than that which the party has by whom the selfregarding testimony is delivered   if the interest being in both cases equal in value the party by whom the selfserving or selfdisserving testimony is delivered be in point of reputation upon a level superior to the ordinary level the reputation of the selfserving or selfdisserving extraneous witness being on the ordinary level as is the case where it happens to be perfectly unknown to the judge   if the reputation of the party being at the ordinary level the appropriate reputation of the extraneous witness is decidedly below it as where it has already happened to him to be convicted of testimonial mendacity denominated in most cases perjury the sum at stake and all other circumstances as above mentioned being equal in both cases—the force of the interest will in general be greater upon a party testifying in the character of a witness than upon an extraneous witness and this on several accounts—   in the instance of the party—the suit on which the money depends being actually on foot and thus far in advance—the money if lost will in general be sooner parted with if gained be sooner received—than in the instance of the extraneous witness but if in this respect it so happens that there is no difference then this reason has no place in the account if the difference is on the other side then of course the reason operates on the other side   of a state of litigation a degree of irritation is a natural and almost a necessary accompaniment by the influence of this irritation the party is already acted upon the extraneous witness not yet this is as much as to say that the testimony of the party stands exposed to the action of two sinister interests to but one of which that of the extraneous witness is exposed if then so it happens that the illwill borne by the extraneous witness towards his antagonist is more intense than that borne by the party to his this reason fails   to the pecuniary loss necessarily resulting from the loss of the cause—the loss resulting from the obligation of reimbursing to the winning party his share of the costs of suit is a natural though not an inseparable appendage in the instance of the party this ulterior loss is already in immediate contemplation in the instance of the extraneous witness not so certainly because in the instance of the extraneous witness it may happen that no suit being as yet commenced none will be commenced for that the demand     will either not be made or will be acceded to without suit but this reason also is liable to fail viz in the opposite case on this account the sum at stake and in that respect the strength of the temptation being the same the improbability of mendacity will be less on the part of a party on either side of the cause if there be no extraneous witness on that same side to that same fact than on the part of an extraneous witness if it be a fact that is not supposed to have come under the partys cognizance the reason is that in the case of the party deposing in his own favour there is in case of mendacity but one person to be reconciled to the wickedness and that himself without need of confession to any one else whereas in the case of the extraneous witness there is a probability that the suit would not have been instituted or defended as the case may be without a concert between the party and the extraneous witness supposed to be mendacious which concert supposes on the part of each partaker in the conspiracy a confession made of his wickedness to the other and besides the comparative improbability of it such double wickedness affords additional chances of detection in the situation of party delivering his own testimony on his own behalf it depends upon any man to originate the opportunity of employing to a purpose chosen by himself mendacious evidence viz by instituting the unjust demand or hazarding the unjust defence and then delivering his own testimony in support of it in the situation of extraneous witness neither the demand is instituted nor the defence determined upon by the individual whose testimony is in question without the previous act of another person viz a plaintiff or defendant the advantage derivable to the interested testimony cannot be reaped in the case of a design to raise money by groundless demands to be supported by mendacious evidence a demand to be made by a plaintiff in the character of an informer i e to gain a reward offered by the law payable in the event of a delinquents being convicted of an offence presents a more natural and generally practicable mode of carrying into execution by abuse of law a plan of depredation to an unlimited amount than a demand of money as due on account of any of the ordinary transactions between individual and individual since a transaction of that sort can seldom have taken place without some special relation between the parties—an incident not necessary in the other case as between plaintiff and defendant to judge from the mere consideration of their respective stations in the cause and nothing else in a cause where money is at stake the probability of mendacity will be greater on the part of the defendant than on the part of the plaintiff the reason is that in the station of the defendant the sum being in both cases equal the mendacitypromoting interest is constituted by the fear of loss in the case of the plaintiff by hope of gain to the same amount and sum for sum as already observed the sufferance from loss is greater than the enjoyment from gain but this proposition does not take place except upon the supposition that the case is such that the defendant has already been established in the habit of regarding the money as his own the plaintiff not suppose the strength of the persuasion in this respect equal on both sides the seductive force of the interest will in this respect be equal on both sides suppose the persuasion stronger on the plaintiffs side the strength of the mendacitypromoting interest will be greater on the plaintiffs side without pretence of title conscious of his having none rapax has contrived to get possession of an article of property belonging to humilis confiding in his supposed inability to take upon himself or to sustain throughout the burthen of litigation circumstances intervening to disappoint the speculation humilis seeks his remedy notwithstanding in this state of things though at the commencement of the suit the subjectmatter was in possession of rapax defendant yet though he lose the cause his condition will be not that of a man who has sustained a loss but that of a man who has miscarried in his pursuit of a gain while that of humilis in the event of his failing in his demand will be not merely that of a man who has miscarried in the pursuit of a gain but that of a man who has been struck by an unexpected loss†     chapter vii of improbity considered as a cause of untrustworthiness in testimony on the present occasion the object is to determine with what degree of assurance expectations of mendacious testimony in the cause in hand can with propriety be grounded on moral improbity in its several shapes and in particular in the shape of testimonial mendacity as manifested on some former occasion or occasions though all men are not liars at least on occasions so important as those of judicial testification yet in that situation all men are almost continually exposed to the temptation of becoming so supposing it certain that at the time in which the witness is delivering his testimony he is not exposed to the action of any mendacitypromoting interest—it is equally certain that improbity in whatsoever shape or degree his disposition be stained by it cannot exert any sinister influence on his testimony that mendacity—wilful and intentional mendacity—is no more to be apprehended from him than from the most virtuous of mankind and that in respect of trustworthiness between the one and the other the only difference is that in consequence of the habitual influence of the tutelary sanctions the virtuous man will apply himself to the giving to his testimony that completeness as well as correctness of which it is susceptible with a degree of solicitous attention which in the case of the profligate man will find a substitute in indifference but it is seldom that any such certainty either presents itself or can by any scrutiny be acquired one case there is in which the opposite certainty presents itself that is where the person whose testimony is in question is a party in the cause which conspicuous interest is however by accident liable as before observed to be counterbalanced and even outweighed by other and stronger latent interests acting on the other side another case is where though not a party he has a known and manifest interest in the event of the cause in all cases whether he have or have not any manifest interest in it he is liable to be exposed as well in the mendacitypromoting as in the mendacityrestraining direction to the action of latent interests of any nature and in any number suppose the point ascertained that the individual in question at present an extraneous witness cannot be under the action of any sinister interest unless the impulse has the suborning solicitations of the party for its source—in such case if the party be regarded as incapable of seeking to exert any such sinister influence the probity of the party operates on that supposition as a security and that an effectual one against the improbity of the witness by this circumstance in so far as it has place the probability of mendacity is it is evident diminished but what is equally evident is that it is not altogether done away from past improbity established by any manifest and notorious inquiry—from past improbity though to indicate the disposition there be no more than a single act—mankind are apt enough to predict and infer with sufficient assurance the manifestation of the like disposition on any individual occasion that presents itself if on this head instruction be needful to the judge it is not so much for the purpose of pointing out to him the inference as for the purpose of putting him upon his guard against the propensity to allow it to take a stronger hold on the mind than upon an attentive consideration it would be found entitled to possess of the testimony of this or that person on whose part improbity in the shape of mendacity or even in other shapes is supposed to be notorious it has been a common expression to say it is entitled to no credit whatsoever—or no regard whatsoever ought to be paid to it applied to judicial testimony the impropriety of any such proposition will on a more attentive consideration be found it should seem undeniable and this not only because falsehood known falsehood is frequently a key as well as a guide to truth but because everything depending upon interest a man of the most depraved character of whom it could be ascertained that he was not under the action of any sinister interest would with more safety be depended upon than an average man deposing under the action of any interest the magnitude of which could reference being had to his situation be pronounced considerable in a general point of view and denoted by the concisest expression that can be found for it the degree of probity habitually manifested in the disposition of a human being will be directly and that of improbity inversely as the force habitually exercised upon it by the permanent tutelary interests and motives so often spoken of in comparison with     the force habitually exercised upon it by the seductive interests and motives as it is only through the medium of the habitual frame of mind that any indication can be drawn from past acts relative to the present frame of mind or disposition of the witness and thence relative to the probability of a departure on the part of his testimony from the line of truth—it concerns the judge to look in the first instance to the habitual frame of mind and in that view alone to have regard to any individual act one practical use of this caution is to preserve him from deducing too strong a persuasion from some single act as established by some conspicuous proof and not deducing a persuasion sufficiently strong from habit i e repeated acts as established or indicated by proofs or tokens less conspicuous by a judicial conviction of theft for example improbity on the part of the convict viz the degree of improbity necessary to the commission of such a crime is established by proof of the most conspicuous kind but however conspicuous the proof no stronger presumption is afforded of a frame of mind habitually disposed to the commission of that crime than what is capable of being afforded by one single act on the other hand suppose it established in the mind of the judge to a degree of probability sufficient for this purpose that to another witness furfur it had twice happened to have been detected in a theft to about the same amount as that of which the first thief fur was convicted but that through the lenity of the party injured or some other accident conviction had in both instances been escaped in the case of furfur it is evident that though evidenced by proof less conspicuous the ground for suspicion is decidedly stronger than in the case of fur from proofs of so conspicuous a nature if exclusively attended to the conclusion liable to be drawn would be more apt perhaps to afford fallacious lights than true and useful ones furfur is a depredator by profession depredation in one shape or other has been his habitual source of subsistence he has had no other fur has been convicted of a single act of depredation once committed whatsoever indication of future testimonial mendacity may be to be collected from past delinquency in the line of depredation is evidently many times as strong in the case of furfur but in the judicial memorials of the respective prosecutions—unless what in england has never yet happened the difference in this respect have been brought to view—both documents and assuredly that which exhibits the case of furfur will to the purpose have been incomplete and thence liable to be fallacious superior magnitude of the punishment in the one of two cases of depredation as compared to the other is another indication which by being conspicuous is but the more liable to be fallacious proper or improper upon the whole it is natural and frequent for depredation in whatever shape to be made punishable upon a scale rising in some proportion with the value of the article which has been the subjectmatter of the offence with a view to one of the ends of punishment viz prevention the difference has this obvious use—viz its tendency to lead the delinquent to the desire of the less mischievous of two offences in preference to the more mischievous but if in this case any such inference be drawn as that because the depredation to the greater amount is punished with the greater punishment therefore as between fur magnus who has been punished with the greater punishment and petty fur who has been punished with the lesser punishment the probability of testimonial mendacity on the occasion in hand is greater in the instance of fur magnus than in the instance of petty fur the conclusion would be more likely to be crioneous than just for the greater the sum stolen the stronger the temptation and because a mans probity has sunk under the stronger temptation it follows not that it would have sunk under the weaker with regard to the probability of testimonial mendacity on the given occasion as indeed with regard to improbity in most other shapes indications much more conclusive may in many instances be drawn from factitious consequences foreign to the nature of the transgression than from the nature of the transgression itself even if known in all its circumstances maculatus at the time of his only offence not a professional depredator has in virtue of his punishment in the choice of which reformation was not so much as aimed at been confined for years together in the company of a promiscuous and uninspected herd of professional depredators furfur convicted of a theft to the like amount has during the same space of time been confined in a state of constant occupation either in solitude or under an unremitted course of inspection in assorted company whatever be the indication deducible from depredation of the probability of improbity in a shape so different as that of testimonial mendacity—it seems evident that in the case of the ever solitary or constantly inspected convict the strength of the indication can never be nearly     equal to what it is in the case of the convict kept for the same length of time in a state of corruptive pupilage no anomaly of which moral conduct is susceptible ought to be altogether strange to the conception of the judge presenting itself in a specific shape temptation has been known to overpower the force of the improbityrestraining motives in a mind on which presenting itself in the general shape of money though to appearance in much greater force it would have made no impression those who for any purpose for a negotiation of any kind unlawful or lawful have to deal with gross and uncultivated minds have frequent occasion to observe that by money presented in the specific shape of liquor a much greater effect may frequently be produced than by the same quantity of money presented in its own genuine shape in a higher sphere many a man whom a mass of uncounted money to a hundred times the value would have found temptationproof has felt his probity sink under the temptation presented in some specific shape peculiarly adapted to his taste and fancy some choice and not readily obtainable production of art or nature—a gem a manuscript a tuliproot or a cockleshell standing in a witnessbox a much more beautiful and choicer gem parchment root or shell would have been repulsed with horror if presenting itself as the price of a deliberate departure from the line of truth yet in a book presenting a general list of convicts or even in the memorial made of the conviction of this particular individual it might happen that the case and character of this man should remain undistinguishable from the case and character of the professional malefactor accustomed from infancy to behold in the habit of depredation the only source of his subsistence whatsoever be the degree of improbity indicated by the past act or habit—with reference to the testimony in hand the indication afforded by it of probable testimonial mendacity will naturally act with a particular degree of strength where on the past occasion the shape in which it showed itself was that same shape viz that of an act or habit of testimonial mendacity the reason is that in this case it serves as an indication not merely of improbity a weak and vicious state of the moral part of the mans frame but such a state of the intellectual part as hath disposed him to employ and according to his own conception at least qualified him for employing this particular sort of instrument mendacity for the compassing of his sinister and immoral ends to be able to frame a false story capable not only of passing muster in the first instance but upon occasion standing whatever scrutiny is in a way to be applied to it by means of counterinterrogation and counterevidence requires a sort of intellectual firmness and vigour the degree of which—howsoever it may happen to be employed in the service of the sinister interests—has no connexion with their comparative strength and influence by setting fire to a crowded fleet of ships or by drawing up a sluice and so laying a whole town or province under water a man may produce an abundantly greater quantity of mischief than has ever been produced by an act of testimonial mendacity but a man who on a former occasion has thus employed fire or water as an instrument of mischief will not be so apt on a second occasion to employ a mendacious tongue for a purpose of the like nature as one who for the like purpose has already made choice of the same living instrument where on the former occasion testimonial mendacity was the shape in which the improbity manifested itself—indications respecting the probability of testimonial mendacity in the cause in hand may be deduced from the consideration to which of the several modifications of which testimonial mendacity is susceptible the mendacity belonged in that instance these modifications in so far as they belong to the present purpose will turn upon the degree of improbity manifested by the mendacity in the former instance and thence either upon the strength or weakness of the influence of the standing tutelary sanctions—the improbityandmendacityrestraining interests or upon the strength of the temptation which that influence had to contend with and by which it was overcome the distinctions of which testimony is susceptible considered with reference to the person whose interest is affected by it and the manner in which it is affected have been already brought to view veracious or mendacious those distinctions are alike applicable to it testimony selfregarding or extraregarding in both cases servitive or disservitive if disservitive criminative or simply onerative if servitive exculpative exonerative or locupletative here follow certain indications afforded concerning the probability of testimonial mendacity in the case in hand from the consideration of the nature of the mendacity in the former instance—   where in the former instance the object of the mendacity was to save another person from punishment no evil being thereby done to any other individual or none more than equal to the good done to the party favoured by it—the probability of mendacity in the case in hand as deducible from such former mendacity seems scarcely to be so great as where in the first instance the mans object had been to save himself from punishment to the same amount the reason is that in the one case a proof     is given of an extraordinary degree of force on the part of the principle of humanity the interest of sympathy which proof is not given in the other case but this indication is not afforded except on the supposition of the entire absence of every interest of the selfregarding kind a matter of fact which will not often have place nor when it has place be very easily ascertained   where in the former instance the object of the mendacity was to save a mans self from evil of any kind whether under the name of pure punishment or satisfaction to another for injury—the greater the evil the less the probability it affords of mendacity in the case in hand or conversely the less the evil the greater the probability of mendacity in the case in hand the reason is that because a mendacitypromoting interest of a given magnitude had the effect of overpowering the mendacityrestraining force of the tutelary sanctions it follows not that a mendacitypromoting interest of less magnitude would have been productive of the same effect every one sees that though to save his life or to save himself from a pecuniary punishment or from a pecuniary obligation on the score of satisfaction to the amount of £ 00 being the whole amount of his property he fell into this transgression—it follows not that he would have fallen into the same transgression to save himself from the obligation of paying £  being but one hundredth part of the whole amount of his property   where in the former instance the object of the mendacity was to save another person from merited punishment—the probability of mendacity in the case in hand as deduced from such former mendacity seems not so great as where in the former instance the object was to consign another person to unmerited punishment the reason is that in the one case indication is given of the prevalence of the interest of sympathy or principle of humanity one of the standing tutelary sanctions to an extraordinary degree whereas in the other case an indication is given of an extraordinary degree of insensibility to the force of that sanction as well as of most or all of the other tutelary sanctions   where in the former case the object of the mendacity was to obtain for a mans self an undue gain—the probability of mendacity in the case in hand as deduced from such former mendacity seems still greater than where in the former case the object was merely to subject another person to unmerited punishment the reason is that the interest of illwill the seductive interest by which the mendacity was produced in the one case especially where the correspondent passion has risen to so high a pitch in respect of duration as well as intensity—has but a casual existence and cannot be produced but by some comparatively rare occurrence or state of things a mans probity may therefore on a particular occasion be overpowered by it and yet far from being seduced it may never happen to him to be so much as solicited by the same sinister interest to give in to the like evil course at any other period of his life whereas pecuniary interest not requiring any such special incident or special object for the creation of it is created and kept alive at all times by the matter of wealth in all its shapes and is therefore particular purposes being alike laid out of both cases and the sum constitutive of the interest being supposed to be the same in both cases as likely to have place and be prevalent in the one case as in the other nb—in this case much it is evident will depend upon the circumstances of the case in hand for if in the case in hand all selfregarding as well as social interest on the part of the testifier is clearly out of the question as may be the case for example where the testifier is prosecutor and the only effect capable of resulting from conviction is punishment the prevalence of illwill in the former case may afford a stronger indication—a greater probability of the prevalence of the like passion in the case in hand than would even have been afforded by the prevalence of pecuniary interest in the former case but in the case of pecuniary interest so much depends upon the sum and its proportion to a mans habitual expense and present exigencies that every comparison which has this interest for one of its terms is liable as every one must perceive to great uncertainties   where in the former case the object of the mendacity was to save or obtain a gain—the probability of mendacity in the case in hand as deduced from such former mendacity seems to be greater than if in the former case the testifiers object had been to save himself from a loss to the same amount the reason is as already observed that the influence of a given sum on the wellbeing of the individual when considered as passing out of his hands in the shape of loss is greater than that of the same sum when coming into his hands in the shape of gain and therefore that the force of the interest is in the same proportion greater in the one case than in the other and it follows not that because the force of the mendacityrestraining interests has been overcome by a given force therefore it will by any less force but as to the point whether with reference to a given individual the sum in question if coming into his hands is to be considered as     passing into them in the shape of gain and so gained or only as passing into them in the shape of security against loss and so simply not lost or on the other hand if going out of his hands is to be considered as going out in the shape of loss or as simply not staying in in the shape of gain this point though in many instances clear and out of doubt will in many instances be subject to doubt and to doubts absolutely insoluble the matter depends upon the strength of his persuasion and this too taken at a point of time not always easy to be settled if at any given point of time with an equal degree of persuasion two contending parties expect each of them concerning the same sum either that it shall not go out of his hands or that it shall come into his hands—the not coming in in the one case and the going out in the other may in the instance of either of them be alike productive of the sensation of loss on the part of a person in whose breast the existence of improbity in a very high degree is notorious either from proof made on a past occasion or from the light in which he appears in the cause in hand—there are several circumstances each of which may in aid of the standing mendacityrestraining sanctions contribute to lessen the probability of mendacious testimony in that case—these are—   extraordinary difficulty real and thence apparent of carrying through in the particular circumstances of the cause in hand and of the part taken by him in that cause—of carrying through a scheme of mendacity with safety and success   in a case in which an effect of the mendacity if successful will be the bringing down upon the head of any particular individual—naturally the defendant—a burthen of affliction particularly severe such for instance as unmerited capital punishment—the extraordinary severity and afflictiveness of such burthen to the joint influence of these causes on minds on which the influence of the three other tutelary sanctions the political the moral and the religious especially the two latter cannot but have been at its lowest pitch may it should seem be ascribed in great measure at least the comparative unfrequency of criminative perjury and the innoxiousness as far as can be judged and utility of the judicial practice by which under the highest temptation that can be offered the testimony of known malefactors of the most profligate description is every day admitted as the principal and sometimes even as the sole ground for convicting men of the highest crimes and thence subjecting them to the most rigorous punishment afforded by the law that the social principle of sympathy bears some part in the production of the effect there seems no reason to doubt but that the part it bears is in comparison with that of the other the selfregarding principle much the least considerable is rendered but too manifest by very conclusive indications in some countries standing funds of reward have been established by law for the purpose of engaging men to pursue to conviction offences of this or that particularly obnoxious description such as depredation in the various shapes in which—though the mischief of the first order the loss actually produced is confined to assignable individuals—by far the greater part of the mischief—viz the danger and alarm—diffuses itself over an indefinite space in the circle of the community at large influenced by these rewards instances have been known in which men have formed themselves into confederacies for the purpose of reaping the rewards in question at the expense of the ruin of a set of victims to whom in one sense the word innocent would not be misapplied to entitle themselves to the receipt of the reward to the payment of which conviction was the previous condition it was necessary that evidence of the offence evidence constituting a sufficient ground for the conviction should have been delivered to give birth to this evidence what did they they gave birth to the offence itself an offence—an individual offence—of the description in question was to be produced that a body of evidence effectual to the purpose might be sure to be delivered on such occasion an innocent man—a man till then innocent—was to be seduced into the commission of the offence the offence being really committed by him care was at the same time taken that the circumstances in which it was committed should be such as to leave no deficiency in the necessary mass of evidence†   0 to what cause is this characteristic part of the contrivance to be referred not in any respect to sympathy for the suffering to which the victim was consigned after having been thus drawn into guilt was not inferior to the suffering to which he would have been consigned had he been left in possession of his innocence there remained therefore this one cause viz a view of the advantage which in respect of its comparative chance of obtaining credence under the security afforded against deception by the faculty of vivâ voce crossexamination a true story is so sure to possess over a false one for by the delivery of a true story no other faculty is called into exercise but the memory—a faculty in respect of which to any such purpose as that here in question no deficiency can exist in the mind of any man for the delivery of a false story adequate to the production of the same effect the exercise and the successful exercise of two other faculties each of which must be possessed in an extraordinary degree of perfection—viz invention and judgment—is indispensable the grand instrument the touchstone by which falsehood is detected is inconsistency in the delivery of a true and correct narrative inconsistencies are impossible for of any two or any number of real facts to say that any one can be inconsistent with any other is a contradiction in terms falsehoods to escape detection must to appearance be equally clear of inconsistency of inconsistency as well with respect to each other as with respect to all known and indisputable truths but to invent a number though it were but a small number of falsehoods which shall not only at the moment but on all future occasions stand clear of every such inconsistency is in general especially under the check of crossexamination a task of extreme difficulty and by the force of that check the number of such facts which a man shall be called upon to invent—to invent at the moment on pain of seeing the expected fruit of his labours gone and punishment ready to fall upon his head instead of it is without limit and in the exercise thus given to it the faculty of invention must at every step be accompanied and supported by the faculty of judgment and that at a pitch of perfection such as the strongest mind can never feel itself assured of rising to where as in the sort of case in question the perceptions obtained were at the time associated with such an idea of their importance as was sufficient to command a force of attention sufficient to fix them in the memory—and the first depth of the impression has not been defaced in any considerable degree by the hand of time—the images presented by the memory are at all times the same no danger of inconsistency between the account given of a fact at one time and the account given of the same fact at another time but the images of which the picture given of a false fact is composed—these images having no real standard by which they     can be adjusted no real archetype by which they can be fixed will be at every moment liable to be changed and as often as a change though it be in any the minutest particular takes place so often is an imminent danger of inconsistency and thence of detection produced along with it let it not here be forgotten that for these always dangerous though perhaps necessary remuneratory arrangements the demand is produced in no inconsiderable degree by the exclusionary system viz by that branch of it which on the score of vexation if for any reason at all forbids the application of judicial questions to any such purpose as that of extracting evidence of guilt from the lips of malefactors and moreover that among the effects of it is that of making it mens interest to nurse less mischievous malefactors capable of yielding but small rewards till they have ripened into malefactors of a more mischievous description yielding larger rewards by this means while mischief is weeded out with one hand it is sown with another but this part of the mischief seems referable rather to the gradation established between the quantum of reward in one case and that in another than to the application of remuneratory arrangements in aid of penal ones chapter viii of the comparative mischief in the event of misdecision to the prejudice of the plaintiffs or of the defendants side the abovementioned particulars such of them as the nature of each case has happened to present having been taken into consideration and the trustworthiness of the witness or witnesses on one or both sides remaining in doubt and with it the decision proper to be grounded upon the evidence—a consideration to which it may be of use that the mind of the judge should not be wholly inattentive is the difference if any in point of mischief that may be incident to the decision viz according as it happens to have for its sole or principal ground the testimony of an extraneous witness or that of a party and of the parties that of a defendant or that of a plaintiff for if as between right decision and misdecision the scales of probability appear to hang upon a level his choice will naturally fall on that side on which if to the prejudice of that side misdecision should ensue the quantity of the mischief resulting from it will be at the lowest pitch i mischief of plaintiffs mendacious selfserving testimony compared with that of defendants ditto in general in a case where money is at stake the quantum of mischief liable to result from an erroneous decision pronounced in favour of the plaintiffs side and grounded on the mendacious testimony of the plaintiff is greater than what is apt to result from an erroneous decision pronounced in a case where the same quantity of money is at stake upon the ground of the mendacious testimony of the defendant the reason is that in the station of plaintiff it rests with every man to multiply suits at pleasure to harass with suits any persons and any number of persons at pleasure if then by his own testimony alone he has obtained a judgment against this or that one person that testimony being generally understood to be mendacious—in such case this one groundless demand having succeeded with him there is a danger lest he should extend his enterprises to another and then to another and so on without limit this might be the case for example if in the character of an informer a man were to take upon himself to raise money by his own mendacious testimony instituting or causing to be instituted against a person altogether innocent a charge of having committed some offence to which a pecuniary penalty payable in the whole or in part to the informer or witness stands annexed and supporting the charge by his own testimony that testimony the defendant being innocent of course mendacious but though on the supposition that any such practice as that of making a trade of giving groundless informations supported by false testimony were habitual the danger indicated and the alarm produced by a given sum raised in this way by a given number of suits would be greater than the danger indicated and the alarm produced by the same sum raised by evidence equally false in the same number of suits of all other kinds taken together yet it follows not that in any given suit taken by itself and independently of any such habitual practice the existence of which is supposed for mere illustration to have been ascertained mendacity in this case is at all more probable than under the action of a pecuniary interest of equal value it would be in any other sort of suit whether on the plaintiffs or on the defendants side an informer is one who at the invitation of the law lends his hand to the administration of justice it follows not that because a man is ready for a certain price to give true     evidence he is ready to give false evidence for the same price it follows not any more than that because a man is ready in the capacity of a judge for a certain salary to engage to administer justice and do his part towards the due execution of the laws he is ready for the same salary to engage to practise depredation under the name of justice it follows not any more than that because for a given price a man is ready to engage to contribute to the defence of his country against the invasion of a foreign enemy therefore for the same price he is ready to engage to contribute to the destruction of his country in the service of the enemy it follows not that because by swearing truly he expects to gain £ 0 therefore he will depose falsely for that purpose nor that because at the expense of the same sum expended in costs of prosecution he seeks the pleasure of revenge at the expense of any person who no matter on what account has become the object of his ill will—therefore to gain the end of the prosecution he will in the character of witness for the prosecutor deliver mendacious criminative evidence in various ages and countries mischief in vast quantity has been operated by men in the character of informers but the testimony by which in these instances it has been operated—the testimony which has served as the instrument of the mischief has been not mendacious but veracious testimony the fault has lain not in the informers but in the laws england in the time of henry vii afforded a remarkable example—probably the most remarkable that is to be found in the history of any age or nation—of mischief flowing in prodigious masses from this source but in so far as it was the cause of terror and a fit object of blame the mischief was the sole work of the legislator laws were sown that forfeitures might be reaped ii mischief of partys mendacious testimony compared with that of extraneous witnesss ditto in general the quantity of mischief apt to result from misdecision in favour of either side when grounded on mendacious testimony on the part of an extraneous witness is not so great as when grounded on the mendacious testimony of either party testifying in his own favour the reason is that it depends not on an extraneous witness to originate the suit in the course of which his testimony is delivered it lies not therefore in his power as in that of a plaintiff to multiply suits at pleasure and if gain were to be made by unjust demands supported by mendacious testimony to multiply at pleasure occasions of employing testimony as an instrument of legal depredation to originate causes of suit—and thence in a remote way though not to a certainty to originate suits themselves—is competent to any man and thence to a man who when the suit takes place occupies the station of defendant to originate a suit immediately and without needing the concurrence or antecedent agency of any other individual belongs also to any individual which individual as soon as the suit is instituted assumes thereby the character and occupies the station of plaintiff but to originate any sort of suit either remotely as in the character of future contingent defendant or immediately as in the character of actual plaintiff is the exclusive character of a party and is incompatible with the station of extraneous witness iii mischief of partys selfdisserving compared with that of his selfserving mendacious testimony in the case where it happens to a mans testimony to be mendacious to his own prejudice and not to the prejudice of any one else—in such case if a decision conformable to it be grounded on it which decision thereby comes under the description of misdecision the mischief of such misdecision does not stand upon so high a footing as that of a misdecision to the same effect produced by any of the ordinary causes the reason is that the mischief of the second order—the danger and alarm—in comparison with which the mischief of the first order is much inferior in importance amounts to nothing in this case a man as often as without being guilty he chooses to confess himself guilty will suffer accordingly let this be understood but what in this case is the amount of the danger—for how few are there who will be disposed to make any such choice—and if there were ever so many more where is the great harm done nemo audiatur perire volens says the maxim of romangallic law but on the other hand comes the maxim volenti non fit injuria why refuse to hear him whose wish it is to perish if in the judgment of the person most competent he will not be injured by it so again as to the alarm for by the supposition the choice is the mans own if force be employed the case quadrates not with the present case and who is there in whose breast any pain of apprehension can be infused by the idea of an evil to which he cannot be exposed but by his own free choice but though in this extraordinary sort of case the mischief of misdecision is not so great as in ordinary cases still neither is the case altogether free from mischief for by     the manifest opposition of the case to the ordinary course of human conduct—men at large observing a man convicted on his own selfcriminative testimony—on his own confessorial evidence which afterwards is by accident discovered or suspected not to have been true will be led to suppose or suspect it to be the result of secret subornation subornation acting possibly by holding out hope of reward—more naturally by holding out fear of undue punishment or of injury in some other shape hence one reason why confession in general terms should never be received to the exclusion of complete as well as correct testimony from the same source to the end that in case of incorrectness or incompleteness intentional or not intentional such selfregarding and selfcriminative testimony may from the approved sources counterevidence and counterinterrogation performed at any rate by the judge take its chance of being rendered correct and complete as if instead of being selfregarding it had been so much extraneous testimony chapter ix ulterior safeguards against the inconveniencies which may present themselves as liable to arise from the abolition of the exclusionary rules panic terrors genuine and counterfeit are among the lifeguards of abuse from reform be it what it may fears are professed by sharpsighted hypocrites—fears are felt and entertained by their weaksighted dupes knavery presents the phantasmagoric magnifying glass and it is through this medium that danger is viewed by the eye of imbecility anything which in the case of the reforms here proposed may contribute to allay the accompanying apprehension is deserving of notice the safeguards here in view may be ranked in the first place under two heads—  safeguards against deception and consequent misdecision   safeguards against vexation in so far as unnecessary and unprofitable under either head may again be distinguised—  such as exist or would take place of themselves but may notwithstanding be pointed out to good purpose as being liable to be overlooked   such as though not at present in existence nor of a nature to take place of themselves might as it seems be established to good purpose and may therefore be considered as eventually waiting to be established under the head of existing safeguards the following may be worth noticing— one ground of alarm may be the danger of mendacity and consequent deception and misdecision from the giving an unlimited admission to the testimony of the plaintiff by way of antispasmodic against the terrors from this source it may be proper on this occasion to bring to mind once more the testimony of experience certifying that in so many cases where by the reason of the most cogent interests the mendacitypromoting force has been at its highest pitch no symptoms of mischief from this source have ever been discernible habitual and professional depredators delivering their testimony against accomplices under the temptation offered by impunity instead of capital punishment with the addition of pecuniary rewards to an amount far beyond what are usually offered to individuals at large these are rewards earnible by truth as well as by falsehood but rewards equally offered and not earnible but by mendacity are the rewards by which servants in trade who have goods to deliver from traders their masters to customers are invited to steal the goods and then by their testimony charge the customer with the receipt of them—the customer whose true testimony cannot be opposed to their mendacious evidence lawyer the defendant will stand exposed to whatever danger is attached to the admission of the testimony of the plaintiff nonlawyer good but while from the admission given to him the plaintiff derives the faculty of delivering false testimony to the prejudice of the defendant—so by the admission given to the testimony of the defendant does the defendant derive the faculty of defending himself for which by the supposition the simple truth is sufficient truth opposing herself to the plaintiff truth giving her support to the defendant—plaintiff and defendant being in other respects on equal terms—in favour of which side lie the odds lawyer but a case that in reality will frequently happen is that the matter of fact notwithstanding the consequences of it with relation to the interests of the defendant has not fallen under his cognizance if the defendant having been wounded it be by your hand that the wound has been inflicted it can scarcely happen but that the fact must have fallen within your knowledge but if it has been by the teeth of a dog of yours or by the horns of a bull of yours this may as well have happened you being at a hundred miles distance as in your presence the plaintiff being predisposed to lie and having his choice of lies his care will be that in the scene he feigns you the defendant shall not be one of the actors nonlawyer doubtless this will be his best policy just as under your own established and therefore faultless system were the tradesmans servant to steal the goods and     then swear he had delivered them to the customer it would be better policy to suppose them delivered at his house out of his presence than in his presence although the testimony of the customer to whose loss the theft and the perjury are committed would not be admitted to contest it but the door being by the supposition as completely open to the testimony of the defendant as to that of the plaintiff and the fact on which the plaintiff grounds his claim being by the supposition a fact altogether false—the case will be that the defendant if he contests the claim believes the fact to be false under whatever sanction therefore call it oath call it what else you will the plaintiff affirms contrary to truth his persuasion of the existence of the fact the defendant will of course affirm his persuasion of the nonexistence of it here then it must be confessed we have a danger of deception as we have in all cases in which testimony is admitted but the plaintiffs story being by the supposition an utter falsehood has everything to fear from scrutiny from counterinterrogation from whatever counterevidence can be afforded by circumstances while the assertion of the defendant being true can find nothing to oppose it from either of these sources now observe how the matter stands under your system innumerable are the instances in which the fact constitutive of a right on the part of titius being true would be testified and put beyond doubt by the testimony of titius if titius being plaintiff his testimony were admitted in perhaps the greater number of these instances the fact being as well known to the defendant as to the plaintiff and the defendant not being disposed to be at the expense of perjury to save paying what in justice he ought to pay he would do one of two things if the fact had fallen within his cognizance he would confess it if the fact had not fallen under his cognizance yet hearing it sworn to by the plaintiff and not looking upon the plaintiff as a man who would perjure himself he would not upon his oath declare his disbelief of the statement sworn to on the other side now what does your system in this case to the evildoer it insures success and triumph without peril of perjury or expense of litigation to the innocent and injured it ensures loss without hope of safety—injury without the possibility of selfdefence lawyer well and what then he should have been wiser it should have been his care to have provided himself with legal evidence nonlawyer his care yes but can it be a secret to you that in many cases such provision would be impossible that in others the precaution would be resented as an insult and the transaction itself the contract or whatever it be out of which the right arises be by that means rendered impossible and suppose him like duke and no duke never to travel without a train of witnesses at his heels have you any secret you could supply him with to enable him to keep them alive at pleasure he should have provided himself with legal evidence do you and yours from the lowest to the highest of you know what legal evidence is would you let him know if you did did you ever with your own goodwill do anything towards letting men know what on this subject or on any other the law—the law which you every day compose on pretence of declaring it—is have you ever ceased to do whatever was in your power to prevent all such knowledge from being attainable—to keep all such knowledge out of their reach the system which the suitor supposes to be established—the system on the confidence of which he acts is the system declared to him by domestic experience right reason and common sense this system he sees pursued even by you and yours in some cases deceived by your indefatigable selfeulogiums he concludes it to be pursued in all cases your exceptions extensive and numerous as they are how should he divine them to give himself the least chance for it it would be necessary for him at the outset to begin with discarding his ordinary guides common honesty and common sense here may be the place to observe once more that the utmost danger which can be apprehended from the treest admission of selfserving testimony on both sides is inferior far inferior to that which under the technical system has place in every days practice in all cases from the most lightly to the most heavily penal personal injuries acts of depredation acts of malicious destruction where an injury by which an individual is the immediate sufferer is treated on the footing of a crime—the testimony of the party injured testifying under the influence of an interest in the strictest sense pecuniary viz that constituted by costs—and always under the smart of the injury be it what it may is admitted under the name of evidence and under the sort of sanction reserved for those declarations which are received under the name and on the footing of evidence—the sanction of an oath fortified by the eventual punishment attached to the breach of it while on the other side the defendants though under the name of the defence the party if present which in slightly penal causes it is not necessary that he should be cannot be prevented from saying what he thinks fit—yet what he does say not being corroborated by the sanction of an oath     nor being subjectable to counterinterrogation is not received under the name nor on the footing of evidence what is to the present purpose is this question—if no mischief is experienced from the partial admission of selfserving testimony the admission of it on the plaintiffs side—on that side on which as hath been seen it is most dangerous—can any greater danger be reasonably apprehended from the impartial admission of it from the unreserved admission of it on both sides the above observations on the safeguards which already exist may suffice to dispel all vague fears that great prejudice to justice would result from the abolition of the exclusionary rule an ulterior safeguard which is not but which might be and ought to be established is the registration of evidence by the registration of evidence i do not mean the committing of the evidence to writing in terminis but merely the making a memorandum of the species and nature of the evidence under apposite heads the immediate use is to show on the occasion the strength of each article of evidence to indicate the strength of it as far as the denomination to which it belongs and under which it is entered may be conducive to that purpose the ulterior use is to put a mark of distinction upon every cause in which on the side in favour of which the decision was pronounced the mass of evidence was in point of strength in any respect below the ordinary standard the ultimate use is to indicate not indeed the exact quantity of the mischief for when there is none none can be indicated but the maximum of the mischief which in the way of misdecision under any head of infirmity or suspicion can have owed its birth to the abolition of the exclusionary rule—  judgment for the plaintiff evidence for the plaintiff none but the plaintiffs testimony evidence for the defendant none but the defendants testimony   judgment for the defendant state of the evidence the same   judgment again for the plaintiff evidence of the plaintiff delivered by him or not delivered the fact the collative or say investitive fact by which the right in question was conferred on him not having fallen within his cognizance nor any other fact serving for proof of it in the way of circumstantial evidence extraneous witness matthew martyr his testimony exposed to suspicion by interest derived from relationship—he being husband son father brother partner servant master to the plaintiff or by specific pecuniary interest in such or such a way or by improbity as evidenced by his having been convicted of such or such an offence ulterior details might in this place be regarded as superfluous and premature what is above will serve for an indication of the ends to which the proposed arrangement is directed to frame an apposite system of bookkeeping whereby for each cause the labour of registration could be reduced within the compass of a few words would be a consequential task and not a difficult one i speak of the system of registration as exhibiting the maximum of mischief from deception and consequent misdecision having infirmity of evidence for its cause i say the maximum it being understood that supposing in every cause the decision given in favour of that side of the cause on which the evidence was thus defective to have been erroneous the greatest number of causes in which this error—error from this source—could have taken place is thus brought to view but so it may be that in no one of all those instances was the decision erroneous still in this case the word maximum is not less apposite than if the decision was erroneous in all those instances on the present occasion in speaking of infirm and suspectable evidence those causes alone of inferiority need be thought of that have been brought directly to view in the course and for the purpose of the present work in a system of registration in so far as adapted to the end here in question the several other causes of infirmity would be equally entitled to a place the heads being expressed by apposite denominations—the operation of making on the occasion of such cause the several entries under those several heads would present little difficulty mercantile bookkeeping an art which under the existing system of nomenclature is clouded and perplexed by obscure and unexplained fictions presents much more     lawyer what more records and have we not records enough already and is there not enough in them and is there to be nothing said about john doe and richard roe and do you mean to confound the distinction between courts of record and courts not of record nonlawyer to make answer to your questions the matter of your records may be divided into three portions—  sheer lies   impertinent and useless truths   instructive truths the instructive truths—that is heads for the reception of these—it is our wish to preserve though it would require a microscopic eye to spy them out and if they were of iron so much the better because in that case a magnet would save time and scrutiny of the sheer lies and impertinent truths i agree with you that there is enough already and therefore it is we propose that no further additions shall be made to that part of the stock if your relish for the dish remainafter the odor lucri has evaporated you know where there is enough for it courts of record—courts not of record a precious distinction truly a precious end it aims at—and a precious use has been made of it know you then of that judge whose operations will be likely to be better secured against error designed and undesigned—against needless delay expense and vexation by the assurance that they will be buried in oblivion can there be so much as a pretence for omitting to perpetuate the memory of everything that passes except the verbiage of advocates and parties unless it be the little importance of the cause compared with the delay expense and vexation attached to the registration of it and do you not know that the use aimed at by the distinction and by the consequences grounded on it were to secure the judges that invented it against the competition of judges below them and on one side of them and that among the civil courts not of record the equity courts—the courts which reject as beneath their dignity all causes of less than £ 0 value—are at the head of the list so much as to the safeguards against misdecision for the avoidance of unnecessary vexation an important maxim remains to be brought to view i suppose the ends of justice substituted to the ends of judicature i suppose hypocrisy unmasked i suppose honest eyes opened imbecility in honest guidance i suppose the door thrown wide open not only to all willing testimony but to all lights that are to be elicited from interrogatories administered to unwilling testimony to unwilling testimony whatsoever be the now terrible the now tremendous fruits of it lights collected without reserve from unwilling witnesses although the result should be the diminishing the multitude of misdeeds of all kinds and diminishing if english lawyers and their dupes endure to see it diminished the barbarity as well as imbecility of their penal code in throwing open the door to selfcriminative evidence one exception though but a temporary and thence a limited and continually expiring one would require to be made     no admission of such evidence against offences anterior to the promulgation of the law the reform should not be retrospective the reason is almost too obvious to bear mentioning transgressions already committed are beyond the reach of prevention punishment would be misery in waste not that because the case were called a criminal one there would be anything gained to general utility by extending the provision to the exclusion of satisfaction on the score of injury viz where the author of the injury cannot be a loser but the sufferer by it must be and to the same amount a gainer but under the existing technical system such is the structure of the established forms that if the examination of the defendant remained forbidden to the one purpose it would remain alike forbidden to the other to the abuse here in question no correction would could or ought to be administered but in the way of statute law to render the correction retrospective would include in it an operation of ex post facto law legislators shrink with uniform horror from the idea of such injustice jurisprudential law from first to last was formed by it not a step can she take on any fresh ground—not a fresh step can she take in any direction that is not stained by injustice of this description chapter x recapitulation against the following errors it concerns the judge to be upon his guard—   the supposing that there is any man of whose testimony it is certain that it will throughout be true true to the purpose of warranting the judge to treat it as conclusive i e exclusive of all counterevidence   the supposing that there is any man of whose testimony it is certain that it will throughout be untrue viz to the purpose of warranting the judge in refusing to hear it not that the certainty of its being throughout untrue would induce anything like a certainty of its being throughout uninstructive   the supposing that there exists any one sort of interest which on the occasion in question can be sure so to overpower the force of the standing tutelary interests as to render untruth on the part of the testimony certain in any part much less in the whole  —or any number of interests acting in a mendacitypromoting direction   the supposing that because as to this or that fact the testimony in question is incontestably false and even mendacious—that therefore there is a certainty of its being false as to this or that other fact much more as to all the other facts   the supposing that where there are divers interests to the action of which the testimony is exposed on either side there is any one of them that ought to be neglected as if destitute of force   the supposing that where there are divers interests acting on the same side the aggregate force with which they act is to be learnt by counting them without regard to the separate force of each the above propositions are the general result of this work the anatomical view shall we say above given of the human mind—does it quadrate with the truth no person by whom this work can ever be taken in hand—no person male or female high or low rich or poor but is competent to judge but if it be what must we say of the picture given of it in the books of jurisprudence of the picture of it as referred to and wrought from on every jurisprudential bench judging of it from those books and those benches is this branch of practical science if science it is to be called in any better state than the science of anatomy when the circulation of the blood was unknown and nerves and tendons were confounded under one name or than chemical science when the great plowden no less profound in chemistry than in jurisprudence gave in the pedigree of the metals certifying them to be the issue in tail lawfully begotten by stephen sulphur upon the body of mary mercury by way of contrast to the above proposed mementos and that the reader in whose understanding there is any predilection for reason or in whose heart there is any concern for the welfare of mankind might take his choice—it had been in my intention to subjoin a view of those documents to which english judges are at present in the habit of resorting for their guidance and which in addition to or in explanation of the particular decision the supposed purport of which has been preserved by chance the advocates on each side are wont to present them with in that view these documents would range themselves naturally into two classes—  considerations purely technical i e having no reference to anything that will bear the name of reason   fragmenta rationalia considerations containing in them more or less of the matter of reason fragments they cannot but be called inasmuch as containing almost without exception no reason but on one side nor of that anything better than a loose and broken hint they can never in any instance be considered as amounting to an entire reason but only to a quantity of rough matter by the help of which with due management a reason might be made of this research what it may be asked would be the use     illustration—illustration merely amusement and nothing more or if anything beyond amusement this—that the portentous worthlessness and depravity of the technical system and of that sort of trash which among lawyers goes by the name of science may be placed in yet another point of view that of the mountain of their nonsense the relative as well as absolute magnitude may be measured by the molehill dimensions of such part of their productions as without abuse of language may be capable of passing under the name of sense to engage in any such research in the hope of any instruction which in any other point of view could afford payment for the labour would be to scrutinize the contents of the first great dunghill that presented itself for the possible pearls or diamonds that might be to be found in it it would at the best be like the reading over and studying the bibliotheca of alchemy in the expectation of meeting with instruction applicable to the advancement of modern chemistry in the course of a twelvemonth it is not impossible but here and there a result might be found presenting a fact of which no modern chemist is apprized but in less than a thousandth part of the time thus spent in the purlieus of folly and imposture facts of more use and importance might be brought to certainty and for the first time by following the track already opened by genuine and unpolluted science to subjoin a view of these lawyers reasons technical and semirational to the present work had as already observed been my intention but considering the bulk to which the present publication has already swelled the completion of what may be found to say on this topic must be postponed as for specimens they have been already seen technical considerations in the chapter on restoratives and elsewhere fragmenta rationalia in some of the reasons for the exclusion of selfdisserving evidence in the reasons for excluding the testimony of a wife against her husband in the use made of the words necessity course of trade† c conclusion we are now arrived at the conclusion of this work a few leading considerations have been pressing upon our minds throughout the whole course of it at present i speak particularly to englishmen the application to other countries will not be difficult   so far as evidence is concerned and the limitation need not he anxiously insisted on the existing system of procedure has been framed not in pursuit of the ends of justice but in pursuit of private sinister ends—in direct hostility to the public ends it is time that a new system be framed really directed to the attainment of the ends of justice   the models the standards the exemplifications of the proposed improved system—nay of a perfect system are not objects of a utopian theory—they are within every mans observation and experience—within the range of every mans view—within the circle of every private mans family   to find these models of perfection an englishman has no need to go out of his own country for invention there is little work—for importation scarce any english practice needs no improvement but from its own stores consistency—consistency is the one thing needful preserve consistency and perfection is accomplished   no new powers no tamperings with the constitution no revolutions in power no new authorities much less any foreign aid are necessary all that is necessary and this is necessary is that the laws made for the purpose should be made by the lawful legislator—not by a power subordinate to that of the legislator taking advantage of his negligence usurping his authority legislating with inadequate means in pursuit of sinister ends on false pretences   nothing more is required than the extending in all causes and cases to rich and poor without distinction that relief which in certain causes and cases and in certain districts has been afforded to the poor torn by the appointed guardians and friends of the people from the rapacity or abandoned by the negligence of their natural enemies   it requires indeed the establishment of local judicatures but even this is not innovation not that even innovation where necessary should ever be declined—not innovation but restoration and extension restoration—of powers once in existence before they were swallowed up by the framers of the existing system of abuse under favour of their own resistless power working by their own frauds covered by their own disguises in pursuit of their own sinister ends extension—the restoring though with some increase of amplitude to one half of the island the fountains of justice so happily retained by the other† an aphorism not unfrequently quoted and seldom without approbation is that of machiavel in which the taking the constitution of the country to pieces for the purpose of bringing it back to its first principles is spoken of as a wise and desirable course in     the character of a general principle extending to all states and to every branch of the constitution of every state it is founded on vulgar prejudice and leads to mischief it supposes a constitution formed all at once a supposition scarce anywhere realized it supposes experience worth nothing and herein lies the great and mischievous absurdity it supposes men in the savage state endued with perfect wisdom but growing less and less wise as experience accumulates and progress is made in the track of civilization it supposes that to make the british constitution better than it is we ought to bring it back to what it was in the time of william iii or charles i or edward i or john or william the conqueror or alfred or egbert or vortigern or cassibelaunus in whose reign it would still have exhibited a picture of degeneracy if compared with the primeval golden constitution of new holland or new zealand in the case at present on the carpet the supposed wisdom of the maxim may find an apparent confirmation by doing away the work of five or six hundred years and throwing back the system of procedure as to the most fundamental parts into the state in which it was at the time of edward i and much earlier a mountain of abuse might be removed and even a near approach to perfection made why because in principle there is but one mode of searching out the truth and bating the corruptions introduced by superstition or fraud or folly under the mask of science this mode in so far as truth has been searched out and brought to light is and ever has been and ever will be the same in all times and in all places—in all cottages and in all palaces—in every family and in every court of justice be the dispute what it may—see everything that is to be seen hear everybody who is likely to know anything about the matter hear everybody but most attentively of all and first of all those who are likely to know most about it—the parties under the first normans as under the saxons the parties were always present in court whoever else was present each was allowed to appear for his own benefit

on the belgic code the code recently promulgated for the kingdom of the netherlands forms in many respects so far as regards the law of evidence an advantageous contrast with most european systems of jurisprudence its superiority is most decided in the department of preappointed evidence particularly under the head of contracts formalities being as it is fit they should be prescribed but not peremptorily so a contract although informally drawn up may yet if signed by the parties be received in evidence there is also a system of registration for written contracts it is an article of this code that oral evidence is not admissible to prove the existence or to disprove or add to or alter the contents of a written contract in form but to this exclusionary rule there are two curious exceptions one in favour of the poor—the other in favour of the mercantile classes if the property dependent on the contract do not exceed the value of one hundred florins or if the transaction which gave rise to the contract be a commercial transaction oral evidence may be heard these exceptions render the code more wise and just but much less consistent in the department of testimonial evidence the only absolute exclusions are those of the husband or wife of a party to the cause and all relatives of a party in the direct line but the relatives and connexions of a party in any collateral line as well as those of the husband or wife of a party to the fourth degree are said to be reproché in the dutch version of the code gewraakt as are also the presumptive heir or servant of a party all persons directly or indirectly interested pecuniarily in the cause and all persons who have been convicted of robbery theft or swindling or who have suffered any afflictive or infamizing punishment it is probable though not clearly apparent on the face of the code that the words reproché and gewraakt refer to the old rule of the roman law by which the evidence of two witnesses is conclusive evidence plena probatio in certain cases and the meaning of these phrases probably is that a witness belonging to any of the classes above enumerated shall not be considered a witness to that purpose—viz the purpose of forming a plena probatio in conjunction with one other witness if this be the meaning of the apparently exclusionary rule it tends pro tanto to diminish the mischievousness of the monstrous principle of law to which it constitutes an exception it seems that the parties themselves cannot be heard in evidence under this code with this exception however that a party may be required to admit or deny his own signature and several other exceptions closely resembling the juramentum expurgatorium and the juramentum suppletorium of the roman law which have already been explained among the bad rules of roman law which are adopted in this code is that which constitutes the evidence of a single witness insufficient to form the ground of a decision the place of a second witness may however in many instances be supplied by a written document which is in such cases termed a commencement de preuve par écrit a rule deserving of imitation in this code is that which permits children under fifteen years of age to give their testimony without oath their title to credence evidently does not depend upon their capacity to understand the nature of a religious ceremony but upon their power of giving a clear consistent and probable narrative of what they have seen or heard on the whole this new code—so far at least as regards the department of evidence—may be pronounced though still far from perfect considerably better than either the english system or the other continental modifications of the roman law—editor  0  stereotyped and printed by stevenson and co thistle street edinburgh  just so is it in the case of a chain of causality a chain of causes and effects indeed every chain of causality is a chain of evidence every effect is evidentiary of its causes every cause is evidence—is evidentiary—of its effects † this is alike true in the case of hearsay evidence of which hereafter as in that of the evidence of an immediate witness only that in the case of hearsay evidence the fact the existence of which is asserted by the so deposing witness is—not the fact sought not the ultimate principal fact—but only a fact supposed to be connected with it the fact of his having heard or otherwise perceived a fact evidentiary with relation to it viz a statement given by some other person in relation to such principal fact here are two or more articles of evidence combined together the one judicially exhibited the other extrajudicially but both of them belong alike to the head of direct evidence ‡ if the forbidden act be of the negative cast it comes to the same thing only—instead of the existence of the intention in question—the psychological fact in question the psychological fact necessary to the composition of the crime consists in the nonexistence of it  see berkeleys essay towards a new theory of vision  considered in respect of its source all evidence flows either from persons or from things—all evidentiary facts as well as all principal facts are afforded either by persons or by things considered in its nature all psychological evidence cannot come under any other denomination than that of personal evidence the description of real evidence—of physical facts whether considered as principal or as evidentiary—is not alike narrow persons being composed of matter as well as spirit having their physical properties as well as their psychological properties belong in virtue and to the extent of their physical properties to the class of things hence real physical evidence may flow alike from a personal as from a real source personal evidence cannot flow from any but a personal source  vide infra chap xvi §   † in speaking of evidentiary facts as having the effect of probabilizing the correspondent principal facts some notice cannot but be taken of the opposite effect disprobabilization but owing to the structure of language in virtue of which by so simple an expedient as the addition of a short particle a particle expressive of negation the same expression may throughout be employed to designate facts and other objects of a directly opposite nature—there will be little need for considering the probative force the disprobative force it will here be to be held in this latter point of view to probabilize any given fact will be the same thing as to disprobabilize its opposite to probabilize delinquency will be to disprobabilize innocence to probabilize innocence will be to disprobabilize guilt but according as in either instance in the instance either of the principal fact or the evidentiary fact the fact to the designation of which the expression in question is applied is of the positive cast or the negative cast expressive of motion or not such a word as the word probabilize or such a one as the word disprobabilize will be the most directly and properly adapted to the nature of the case  on contemplating the field of circumstantial evidence an observation that will naturally present itself is that it is to the penal branch of law that the topics apply much more than to the nonpenal branch the reason is that for the most part they consist in certain modifications of human conduct on the part of the supposed agent and that those modifications have their origin in one common circumstance—consciousness of delinquency or rather to use an expression at once more correct as well as more extensive apprehension of punishment i say more correct for though apprehension of punishment may without danger of error be regarded as a necessary consequence of consciousness of delinquency that consciousness cannot without danger of error be regarded as a circumstance necessarily precedent to apprehension of punishment—a proposition in itself obvious enough but which is at the same time but too apt to be overlooked and which will therefore be on several occasions exemplified as we advance not but that in a case not penal these symptoms of alarm will most of them be found not altogether inapplicable inasmuch as the loss of the cause whatever he the nature of the cause and on whichsoever of the two opposite sides of the cause it takes place the defendants or the plaintiffs is in its nature a result of an unpleasant kind and as such is the natural object of an apprehension similar howsoever far from equal in degree to that which has the fear of punishment for its cause when by the vision of the terrific hand of law the emotion of fear is generated in the human breast what is the specine source and cause of that emotion not the word penal not the difference between that and nonpenal not the name of punishment but the quantum of mischief or inconvenience apprehended as about to flow from this terrific source under whatsoever name the infliction may stand designated in some of the highest degrees of the scale the distinction between penal cases and cases not penal is substantial and effective what then are those highest degrees all those in which with relation to the individual in question and his idiosyncratical sensibility the quantum of affliction would be superior to the utmost that could result from the total loss of all his property—property in expectancy included or not included as the case may be of the scale of legal suffering there is accordingly a certain part which is the peculiar production of the penal branch of law it is the portion above delineated below the mark at which that superior part of the scale ends is the common domain of both branches for a cause which imports no stain on reputation i am adjudged to pay five shillings what matters it to me whether the cause is called a penal or a nonpenal one—whether it be under the name of a penalty or of damages or by loss of a matter in dispute to that amount within the compass of the ground which as above belongs in common to both branches penal and nonpenal of the law whatever distinctions have been made whether on the occasion of the rules of evidence or on any other occasion are thus evidently groundless and—so far as they are employed and relied on in practice—confusion and error confusion in conception error in practice are the necessary consequences the decisions of the legislator—of the friend of mankind holding the sceptre of legislation—are grounded on human feelings regardless of everything else the decisions of the man of law regardless of human feelings taking the habits and interests and language of his profession for the standard of right and wrong are grounded on words and phrases from the above considerations many of the facts which will in the sequel be brought to view in the character of facts evidentiary of delinquency with their respective trains of infirmative facts may be seen to apply not to penal cases alone but moreover to nonpenal cases and in both sorts of cases not to the station of defendant only but moreover to that of demandant at least in so far as a demandant has any personal suffering to apprehend from the

subject of circumstantial evidence under a system of penal procedure distinguished beyond all others for its favourableness to the defendant instances it thence appears have been but too abundant in which innocence has sunk under the weight of fallacious real evidence in any of these instances suppose the defendant thus pressed endeavouring to remove the pressure—you have so many instances of forgery and that innocent forgery of real evidence in the instances where the undue and irreparable punishment took place the fault let it be observed lay not so much if at all in the system of procedure as in the substantive branch in the making use of a species of punishment which were it only because the mischief of it is irreparable would be unfit for use † example—story of joseph and

if the endeavour be a serious one—an endeavour to cause an innocent person to suffer ultimately as for a delinquency of which to the knowledge of the forger he is not guilty—the act directed by this intention and accompanied by this consciousness constitutes a substantive offence and the presumption of delinquency afforded by the forgery is by the supposition not fallacious  boehmer §   cap    †

seen admit—he would on the contrary deny the existence of the inculpative fact in question true the preparation or attempt was not a preparation or attempt to produce exactly the same result that in consequence is understood to have taken place but it was however a preparation an attempt to do something and a preparation or attempt of which the mischief in question has been the result a man is

preparation thus made would not be the less likely or the less fit to be considered in the light of an evidentary circumstance probabilizing the intention of producing the mischievous result that actually took place ‡ see donnellans case crime—murder poisoning by water distilled from laurel leaves criminative fact—preparation for distilling infirmative supposition—it might have been for water

the state of things here supposed applies to the present purpose what on the supposition that the consummation of the act of delinquency is sufficiently proved by the help of ulterior evidence may be

in saying that the punishment allowed to be inflicted ought to be at least equally great because in resolving the mischief of the offence into its component elements viz into the mischief of the first order viz that which falls on the individual specially injured and his immediate connexions—and the mischief of the second order viz the alarm and the danger extending to the community it will be found that the aggregate mischief and thence the demand for punishment is not in this anomalous and extraordinary case inferior to what it is in the ordinary case see dumont and introduction c ut

that which is not as distinguished from that which is extracted by interrogation spontaneous is here as in the book on extraction employed as synonymous with uninterrogated  the word confession is apt to suggest the idea of a voluntary acknowledgment made by the defendant of his having committed the offence with which he is charged the confession however may be either voluntary or involuntary and it may have for its subject not the offence itself but some fact or facts evidentiary of it the fact which is the subjectmatter of the confessorial evidence may be either a fact of the number of the principal facts by which taken together the complex fact of the defendants criminality is composed or it may belong to any one of those classes of evidentiary facts which have been or will hereafter be brought to view in the character of so many species or modifications of circumstantial evidence—preparations attempts declarations of intention threats physical and involuntary symptoms of fear betrayed by the confessionalist upon an occasion specified the care taken by him to conceal the obnoxious event the criminal act—or his person while engaged in it to keep out of the way all persons whose presence might have been dangerous in the character of percipient witnesses of it the language held by him before the act and after it in the view of quieting suspicion or preventing it from coming into existence the exertions employed by him upon a variety of objects of the class of things in the view of preventing them from assuming appearances capable of testifying against him in the character of real evidence the exertions employed by him in the view of giving to any of those objects delusive appearances tending to bring to view the obnoxious event as being the work of mere accident or of some other agent the labour employed by him upon the apprehended witnesses whose observations in the characteror percipient witnesses he could not prevent from coming into existence the exertions made by him to keep them out of the way by direct threats or promises by deceitful representations or by downright force—or in the event of their appearance to suppress the facts indicative of his guilt or even substitute to them pretended facts indicative of his innocence the exertions made by him for the purpose of operating in the like manner upon persons who had begun or were expected by him to act against him in the character of prosecutors the exertions made by him for withdrawing his person and property out of the reach of justice and in the meantime for concealing himself the motives by which he was stimulated to the commission of the offence the length of time during which these motives had been operating on his mind and the turn which this disposition of mind had on different occasions given to his conduct the language which it had occurred to him to hold to different persons on different occasions whose questions or observations he had to encounter in relation to the principal facts of the offence or any other facts whose connexion with it might to his apprehension be discovered or suspected the silence he ventured or was forced to maintain on some occasions the false or evasive answers it occurred to him to give on other occasions with the selfcontradictions which on some of those occasions he fell into in consequence the memoranda he had made of some of the facts connected in one way or other with the criminal enterprise the letters he had written to or received from associates and his alarm under the apprehension that some of these documents had fallen into the adversarys hands his fears under the apprehension that among his consultations with his confederates there were some that might have been overheard by persons through the evidence of whose discourse they would not fail to be conveyed to the notice of the adversary his fears that among his associates there were some who either already had been or soon would be unfaithful to their trust not only so but a fact that in itself has no perceptible connexion with any criminative fact may by accident operate to the prejudice of the defendant and in that respect the discourse by which the existence of that fact has been stated by him may operate against him in the character of confessorial evidence an extraneous witness speaking to a supposed confessorial discourse supposed to have been held in his presence by the confessionalist mentions a variety of facts as having on that occasion been stated by the confessionalist—facts of the existence of which but for such confessorial discourse such reporting witness could not have been apprised a number of facts—suppose transactions of the confessionalist himself connected or not connected with the criminal enterprise—are thus reported as having on the occasion in question been reported to the witness by the confessionalist the existence of these several facts is put out of doubt by other witnesses coming forward and deposing in the character of percipient witnesses as to such facts as in the character of evidentiary facts point directly at the defendants criminality—the report made of them by the confessionalist to the reporting witness assumes directly and obviously the character of confessorial evidence but even those which have no such operation serve to confirm the veracity of the statement by which the reporting witness reports the tenor or the purport of the alreadydescribed portion of the defendants confessorial evidence moreover in the same proportion in which it tends to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the evidence of the reporting witness—of the whole body of it taken together—in that same proportion it evidently operates in prejudice of the defendants cause it therefore comes as incontestably as the other branch though not so obviously under the character of confessorial evidence in the trial of john the painter the incendiary who in      burnt the ropehouse at portsmouth the conviction was grounded principally on the defendants confessorial evidence as reported by an extraneous witness baldwin and of the evidence given by other witnesses a great part consisted in confirmatory statements of other facts in themselves immaterial but stated by the defendant in the confessorial narrative given by him to that reporting witness yet on this occasion the advocate for the prosecution boasted much and not without reason of the probative force—of the conclusiveness of his evidence  confessorial evidence when not plenary per se—in itself—may yet be so by relation it is so by relation when it refers to some other discourse in which whatever is wanting to make it plenary is contained thus when in the form of english law at the opening of the trial the question is put to the defendant how say you guilty or not guilty—if the answer be guilty the confession is plenary by relation for it refers to the full description of the offence as contained in the instrument of accusation called the indictment  in the case of john the painter who anno      was hanged for setting fire to a public storehouse at portsmouth under the notion of rendering service to the american states on the occasion of the war which terminated in their independence the principal part of the evidence was of this complexion so in the case of crossfield who was tried on a charge of being concerned in a plot for the assassination of his late majesty by means of an airgun  there is a wellknown though not very well authenticated anecdote of rabelais in which it is narrated that being anxious to visit paris and not being possessed of sufficient funds to gratify his wish he forged a plot against the life of the king the queen and the duke of orleans and provided selfinculpative testimony against himself sufficiently strong to occasion his being sent to paris at the expense of the government—ed  a story current enough but of which the source cannot be distinctly recollected may serve as an exemplification of the field of enterprise in this line which has been laid open by nature too well seconded as will be seen by the blundering hand of english law to unprincipled speculators a man wishes to secure to himself in the way of marriage a hand of which by direct and honourable means he has no sufficient hope his object is by destroying the reputation of his intended victim to deprive her of all hopes that do not centre in himself he takes the requisite measures he bribes servants he provides himself with the requisite equipment in the costume of a happy lover he shows himself to observers casual or posted through the window of her bedchamber as galatea showed herself—et fugit ad latebras et se cupit ante videria the outline thus delineated the particular object and the details of the plan will as already hinted admit of considerable diversification to the value of the prize obtainable at the price in question there are evidently no determinate limits and this whether pecuniary profit to the amount of which there is also no limit be or be not taken into the account as to the price in the way of punishment few if any are the existing systems of legislation that have with any sufficient degree of consistency and uniformity raised it to a pitch too high to find bidders for seduction under english law at least which in everything that concerns marriage indicates for its author some old woman in her dotage for seduction the maximum would be but a fleabite punishment as for capital violence the charge being of the adventurers own framing he will know better than to subject himself to to any bosom in which either love or money has infused the spirit of enterprise the chancellor who fancies himself or pretends to fancy himself the guardian of female orphans—who fancies or pretends to fancy his authority the bar to illassorted marriages the protector against deception or imprudence is but a laughingstock ever ready to punish he is ever impotent to prevent powerful to do mischief he is impotent to do good that good always excepted of which his professional brethren are the sharers and which consists in distributing among them in due form of practice a portion of the orphans substance a this act is said to have been perpetrated by the earl of stair and to have occurred in edinburgh—ed  that a certain degree of particularity in these respects is desirable—desirable for the reason above given—has been sufficiently observed by the founders of this part of the english law they therefore required that in the instrument of accusation it should be observed and so serious were they in the requisition as to determine that where the requisition to that effect is not complied with the defendant guilty or not guilty shall be acquitted that causes will often happen in which though delinquency may be capable of being established and by abundantly sufficient evidence that same degree of particularity cannot possibly be exhibited—was another observation which true as it is yet at the time of establishing that requisition they failed to make compliance with the requisition was impossible but the impossibility of complying with it was no bar to the establishment of it the requisition had not been long enforced before the impossibility of complying with it consistently with the conviction of the guilty was discovered a remedy was accordingly applied what was that remedy—converting a court of penal justice into a school of necessary falsehood—a school in which the scholars were not merely taught and invited but by main force compelled to defile themselves with that vice no falsehood no justice a day must be specified but it need not be the true onea a day must be specified but that the fact happened on that day is not necessary to be proved another any other will do as well you must say you know the day and say what that day is you must so know it when you know it you must say you know it when you know nothing of the matter but provided you utter this falsehood you shall not be prejudiced by it from falsehood nothing—it is from truth alone that you have anything to fear speak falsely you are safe speak truth you lose your cause this is but one instance out of a multitude in which by aiming at a degree of precision beyond what the nature of the case admits of they lost the benefit of such degree of precision as the subject does admit of they lost precision altogether they threw away precision and embraced falsehood in the room of it a kelyng  0   inst     r v aylett   t

particular object on the carpet shall serve to express and make known the state of his mind but interrogation—interrogation in mood and figure—is not the only mode of communication is not the only form of discourse by which an effect of that description is capable of being accomplished when two other persons being present titius hears being at the same time known to hear one of them in discourse with the other speak of him titius as having done such or such an act in relation to which it concerns him in point of interest to be thought to have done it or not to have done it—to have engaged for example in a plan of delinquency in this or that shape or delinquency out of the question to have made a promise—a deliberate promise—intended to be binding to such or such an effect—if it be material to him not to be believed to have done that which he is so stated to have done he feels himself of course called upon to contradict the assertion—called upon with a force neither greater nor less than if an interrogatory to the same effect had been addressed to him on a former occasion that of suggestive interrogation we have seen interrogation involving in it a proposition of the assertive kind book iii extraction chapter iii here we see an assertion standing in the place and performing the function of an interrogatory so variable and interchangeable are the different forms of language it is not however to any such oblique and uncertain modes of signifying will that the mouth of authority—judicial authority—will naturally or even consistently have recourse accordingly where in the character of a security a judicial security for correctness and completeness in a mass of evidence interrogation was brought to view no mention of any such oblique mode of interrogation as is here denoted by the term quasiinterrogation was there made in a sort of cases the description of which in general terms may not be easy but which are little exposed to misconception in any individual instance silence is to a proverbial degree recognised to be equivalent to consent or assent to consent if the effect of the quasiinterrogation be to call for an expression of will to assent if it be to call for an expression of the state of the intellectual faculty to produce on the part of the person in question a call for a declaration of the state of the will or of the understanding as the case may be—a call no less imperious than that which would have been produced by interrogation—it is not necessary that the quasiinterrogative discourses should have been directly addressed to him or that on the part of the quasiinterrogator there should have existed so much as a desire to obtain an answer express or virtual from the person thus indirectly interrogated what is material to him is to be believed or not to be believed to have done or to be doing or to be about to do what by the discourses in question it is supposed and assumed that he has done is doing or is about to do whether on the part of the author of that discourse there exists any desire to be informed in relation to such his supposed conduct past present or future may to him be a matter of indifference the interest which he has in being believed so to have done or not to have done—the call made upon him accordingly in point of interest to declare yes or no—is not varied by any such difference  what one man says of another in his absence is not evidence against that other whether he be his accomplice or not but if a criminal makes a confession and implicates another party as an accomplice who is present at the time then the confession is evidence against the accomplice because he has an opportunity of denying the truth of the statement as far as he is concerned or of explaining it however in cases of conspiracy any act done or statement made by one of the conspirators in pursuance of their common object is evidence against all the conspirators whether present or not   russ   0   phil evid

physical symptoms with which theemotion of fear has been known to be accompanied and of which it may be considered as productive may be thus enumerated but amongst them are some which seem indicative of a degree of emotion so high as to be seldom if ever produced by the fear of an evil so distant and so far from being certain as the evil of a punishment which for its infliction depends on the hand of law in some of these instances the individual is purely passive no voluntary action no exertion of the will being necessary nor in some of the instances so much as competent to the production of

the power of the will to give birth to it in other instances though the production of it is not altogether out of the power of the will and is accordingly effected without the existence of the emotion in theatrical imitations it either takes place without the action of the will or becomes the cause of the action of the will before it becomes the effect of it of these symptoms several will be seen

exprovinciation will be the greater the greater the obstruction offered by it to the power of justice whether by means of local distance or by means of independency of jurisdiction of the mode and degree of the obstruction thus capable of being opposed the diversifications are infinite particularly in modern times since it has been a fashion among the powers of europe to comprise each of them within its grasp the most distant parts of the globe the obstruction opposed by independency of jurisdiction being a psychological cause is removable the obstruction opposed by local distance a physical cause is inexorable accordingly though in general the obstruction opposed by expatriation will be greater than by exprovinciation yet in some instances that which is opposed by exprovinciation will be the greater in the instance of some offences forgery in particular in which public credit all over the globe beholds an enemy the great european states britain not excepted have surrendered each to the justice of the other its supposed delinquents in so far as this disposition prevails the obstruction given to the course of justice by expatriation—for example from london to calais or even to paris—may not be so great as that opposed by exprovinciation from london to the orkneys or though it were no further than to edinburgh not to speak of the west or east indies person and property are not the only objects on which for the purpose of securing effective justiciability the law has it in its power to take hold over and above these corporeal objects there remain two incorporeal ones viz reputation and condition in life by means of which the feelings of individuals are exposed to be wrought upon by the force of the law as well as by that of lawless injury but person and property are the only objects which it is ever in the power of an individual in case of delinquency on his part to withdraw out of the power of the law in spite of his utmost efforts reputation and condition in life continue subject to it even in regard to property the extent of the power which it depends on the individual to exercise over it in spite of the law or without its assistance is subject to very extensive limitations to immoveables it does not extend nor even to money or moveables in any case where his power depending upon the consent of other persons that consent is withholden or refused hence the influence in some cases irresistible in others no more than ideal of the judgment of outlawrya by which amongst other penal consequences the defendant stands

relatively principal fact immediately indicated were they respectively present to the senses of the judge—as are in case of oral interrogation the physical modifications of passive deportment which constitute the pathological evidence of that emotion and the modifications of selfdisserving testimony extractible by interrogation—they would occupy the same station in the chain of suppositions but scarcely being in any instance so present they cannot come to his cognizance but through the lips or pen of some deposing witness by which means a fifth link is added to the evidentiary chain as in case of any other inculpative fact considered as having been extrajudicially observed in this case fear and avoidance of justiciability may though not synonymous be employed indiscriminately to represent the link in question in the chain of suppositions it is only in so far as it is indicative of fear fear of evil as about to be suffered from the hand of law that avoidance of justiciability can operate as a criminative circumstance and to weaken the inference thus drawn no other infirmatives seem applicable than what have been already brought to view as serving to weaken the probative force of fear itself considered in the light of a criminative circumstance † under the penal procedure of the roman law or to speak more accurately of the system which before the revolution existed in france the probative force of the inculpative circumstances of this class should accordingly it should seem be less than under the english for the purpose of computing the average duration of a penal suit the collection of trials entitled causes celibres thirty volumes in closelyprinted   mo was examined it was not in every instance that the duration of the suit could be ascertained in the instance of those in which it was capable of being ascertained the average duration turned out to be near six years in these it is true the intricacy of the cause was above the ordinary pitch but under english procedure it would be difficult perhaps impossible to find a penal cause on the occasion of which down to detinitive judgment the provisional imprisonment had lasted a fourth part of that time in penal cases the procedure of the roman school does not admit of discharge on bail with near so much facility as the english in england in a case not bailable the criminative force of the circumstance in question may be calculated and with some degree of precision from geographical data in the class of causes most highly penal in london and middlesex justice is administered in about fortyeight days out of the three hundred and sixtyfive in the other counties with the exception of the four northern ones in about four out of the three hundred and sixtyfive and in these northern ones in about two out of the three hundred and sixtyfivea a supposed duellist for example who has killed his man is in a state of expatriation latency or even latitancy in london and middlesex the criminative force of any one of these symptoms of fear the possible chance of being let out upon bail by the court of kings bench being laid out of the case as not capable of being brought into calculation will be a little less than four times as great as in any other of the southern counties a little less than eight times as great as in any one of those four northern counties a some improvement has taken place in this matter since the above was written the central criminal court which has jurisdiction over london middlesex and part of surrey kent and essex sits twelve times ayear each session lasting on an average for about seven or eight days the four northern counties are now placed in the same situation as the other counties—that is they are all visited twice ayear by the judges for the purpose of trying the class of causes referred to by the author as well as civil actions—ed  how acutely sensible must a celebrated french lawyer have been to the defects of the system of procedure established in his country when he said—je fuirais si lon maccusait davoir roh les cloches de notre dame in such a state of things it is evident the infirmative force of the counterprobability which we have termed contemplation of judicial vexation notwithstanding innocence is so strong as entirely to destroy the probative force of the circumstance of latitancy considered as evidentiary of delinquency  unfortunately under english law no such suppositions are realized a system of sham notices being among the devices whereby the ends of judicature are pursued under the pretence of pursuing the ends of justice on this as on so many other occasions the inquiries which common sense would dictate and common honesty pursue legal policy forbids without any expense of thought from latency latitancy is inferred and from latitancy delinquency and though not absolutely without other evidence yet without any evidence of the nature of which it is possible for the supposed delinquent to be apprized if a bill of indictment after evidence heard thereon is found true by a grand jury sworn to secrecy a writ called a capias issues thereupon and in consequence of

well as to disposition and character laying out of the case the general distinction between high and low inferences of an inculpative nature seem to have been deduced from the consideration of this or that particular station or occupation by english law thus on the ground of supposed hardheartedness butchersa have been considered as being in capital cases at least excluded from the capacity of serving as jurymen and judging on this principle—supposing an act of homicide or offence attended with bloodshed committed and as between two men the one a butcher the other not the question which was the man hanging in suspense—the answer would if consistent be the butcher it seems questionable however whether upon consulting the annals of criminality this presumption would be found to have any ground in fact against soldiers and sailors it might be supported perhaps with a closer appearance of reason not to speak of surgeons and even in these instances it seems questionable whether numbers being taken into the account the presumption would receive any support from experience in a case where literally speaking blood is supposed to have been shed the presumption would with better colour of reason plead for the fixing upon the butcher in preference to the nonbutcher for the delinquent than for the exclusion of the butcher from the faculty of officiating in the character of the occasional sort of judge called a juryman it seems altogether impossible to find a reason why in a capital case more than in any other a butcher should be more disposed than another man to do injustice altogether easy to find a reason why a lawyer should lord chancellor jefferies and judge page of hanging memory were not butchers a there is no legal objection to butchers serving on juries in capital cases in england nor do the authorities afford reason to presume that there ever was any in point of fact butchers do serve in such cases it is remarkable that the vulgar error on this subject extends to scotland where it is held as traditionary law that butchers cannot serve not being excepted by the qualification act however they are in the same situation as other citizens it is usual for the court probably for the purpose of obviating popular complaint to excuse them for nonattendance—ed  the money having according to the evidence on that side been delivered by being carried by the same person at thirteen different times a certain distance within six hours—could not within that time have been carried to that distance  but for a practical purpose such as that of judicial decision the nature of the case seems to afford a particular mode of expression an account of which has been already seen in a chapter in the introductory part of the work see vol vi p      a number of facts each of which taken by itself proves nothing or next to nothing but the probative force of which when alltaken together amounts to something considerable constitute what is called in common language a chain of circumstantial evidence in this instance however the word chain is used in a different sense from that in which it has already been and will hereafter be employed in this work where the phrase chain of evidence or any phrase of analogous import has been made use of in the present work it has always been intended to designate a series of facts each of them standing in the relation of an evidentiary fact with respect to that which stands next to it in the series if a be evidentiary of b b of c and c of d then a b c and d constitute in this sense of the word a chain of evidence such combinations or series of evidentiary facts have already been brought to view under the name of concatenated facts—facts constituting a chain of evidence viz combinations of psychological facts thus connected in a chain other chains of the like nature will hereafter be necessarily brought to view chains of oral evidence in the form of hearsay evidence chains of written evidence in the form of transcriptural evidence the more mouths a narrative has passed through the less trustworthy it is universally undestood to be the more copies have been taken the one from the other of a written original the less trustworthy the last of them is understood to be to none of these instances has the metaphor the necessary metaphor of a chain been applied as yet in jurisprudential language nor yet is the figure of speech or the term by any means unusual in jurisprudential language it is on the contrary in every days use but the occasion on which and on which alone it is in use is so widely different that the practical consequences drawn from the use of it are directly opposite on the occasions above brought to view the greater the number of links there are in the chain the weaker it is on the occasions ordinarily in view the greater the number of links there are in it the stronger it is on the new occasions on which i have here found it necessary to employ the metaphor the use made of it is more conformable than on the already customary occasions to the nature of its material archetype take an iron chain the more links you add to it the weaker you will make it not the stronger and by adding link to link you will at last make it break by its own weight if then it be our wish to avoid confusion and selfcontradiction we must by some means or other contrive to express the distinction between the two opposite kinds of evidentiary chains styling the one for example the selfinfirmative chain we may style the other the selfcorroborative exemplifications of the selfcorroborative chain of evidence are in a form more or less distinct in the mind of almost every man and require only to be fixed by words in the course of his progress to and from the scene of action lawful or unlawful a man is seen by different persons at different places the respective testimonies of these several persons each of them declaring the facts present to his senses constitute together what has been usually and hitherto exclusively understood by a chain of evidence this is what i call the selfcorroborative chain let it be a question for example whether on a particular day titius went from london to portsmouth and le it be out of doubt that on that day at six in the morning he was seen on horseback at one of these places to wit london and that by one witness it is proved that at six oclock in the afternoon he was seen at portsmouth it is evident that the greater the number of intermediate places i can prove him to have been at at correspondent hours the stronger the persuasion i shall produce in the mind of the judge of the existence of the principal fact in question viz that of titiuss having gone that day from london to portsmouth the journey in question will thus be proved upon him by a chain of evidence composed of as many links say six as between those two places there are stages at which he was seen by so many different persons double the number of the stages and thence of the witnesses instead of six call them twelve you double the strength of the stream of evidence in another case instead of my six witnesses each of whom saw titius at a different stage in the road between london and portsmouth my evidence consists of the alleged testimony of six alleged witnesses of whom the first as i allege saw titius at the time in question at portsmouth he having said as much to the second who said as much to the third and so on to the sixth being the witness i produce in court to prove the existence of titius at portsmouth at that time it is manifest enough that the testimony of each of these witnesses loses more or less of its strength by their being disposed in a chain thus constituted and that the chain if it consisted of the testimonies of twelve such witnesses instead of six would instead of being twice as strong be twice or perhaps more than twice as weak as before in conclusion the distinction between the selfinfirmative chain and the selfcorroborative chain of evidence appears to be this in the former case—so many witnesses so many intervening mediums interposed between the source of evidence and the faculties of the judge and the fact so evidenced being but one and the same fact and the source from whence the evidence issues being but one source the testimonies of all these witnesses put together compose but one article of evidence on the contrary in the case of the selfcorroborative chain so many distinct evidentiary facts so many distinct sources of evidence  vide supra vol vi p     no     this judge was lord chiefjustice hale who laid down this dictum in consequence of two cases one is mentioned in cokes p c cap  0  and the other happened in hales remembrance in staffordshire the first case is thus stated—an uncle who had the bringing up of his niece to whom he was heiratlaw and while he was correcting her for some offence she was heard to say good uncle do not kill me after which time the child could not be found whereupon the uncle was committed upon suspicion of murder and admonished by the justices of assize to find out the child by the next assizes against which time he could not find her but brought another child as like her in person and years as he could find and apparelled her like the true child but on examination she was found not to be the true child upon these presumptions he was found guilty and executed but the truth was the child being beaten ran away and was received by a stranger and afterwards when she came of age to have her land came and demanded it and was directly proved to be the true child the second case is as follows where a was long missing and upon strong presumptions b was supposed to have murdered him and to have consumed him to asbes in an oven that he should not be found whereupon b was indicted of murder and convicted and executed and within one year after a returned being indeed sent beyond sea by b against his will   hale   0 although it is the general rule of law that the body must be found it is not acted upon without qualification see rex v hindmarsh   leach    —ed † the evidence so anxiously looked out for by this worthy judge was of the sort which the romanists have in view by the term corpus delicti—the body of the offence—in so far as they have anything determinate in view the body of the offence meaning the fact of the offence evidence of the fact of the offence—evidence of that sort by which the fact of the offence may be indicated without affording any indication of the person of the offender in the case of real evidence the indication thus afforded is frequently though not constantly and necessarily thus confined in the case of testimonial evidence the most natural case is that the fact of the offence and the person of the offender should be comprised in the same narrative that in addition to direct testimonial evidence circumstantial and more particularly real evidence is highly desirable and ought accordingly to be looked out for especially in case of homicide is evident enough but a rule requiring it as indispensably necessary in all cases would besides the unreasonableness of it be inconsistent with the necessary practice in regard to a large division of crimes it is of the nature of all verbal offences—offences committed by mere words—not to be productive of any real evidence ‡ co litt   b ∥ see vol vi p      here would come in one use of a table of circumstantial evidence on the supposition of criminality criminative circumstances of the

journal of the session preface xxvii—ed  extract from the printed pamphlet on circumstantial evidence occasioned by donnellans case— we hear this observation everywhere echoed circumstantial evidence is the best for circumstances cannot lie but if we would give ourselves the trouble to bestow a little consideration upon the subject i think we shall be convinced that circumstantial evidence is not the best and that circumstances can lie there are circumstances which cannot lie where the conclusion or inference is necessary and unavoidable but where the conclusion or inference is contingent circumstances may lie that is we may draw an erroneous conclusion from the given facts the learned matthæus clearly describes this distinction—argumentum porrò necessarium vel contingens est

adolescentibus spatietur sola per sylvas in the first case one fact is a certain demonstration of the other but in the second the circumstances must frequently lie when they charge with murder a person stained with blood or atalanta from such companions and conduct with a want of chastity but he proceeds to observe—contingentia verò quanquam singula fidem non faciant plura tamen conjuncta

executed an innocent man every one of these circumstances must be proved by positive witnesses who may be either wicked or mistaken but even if they are pure and correct the conclusion we draw from the facts disclosed may be erroneous so that in circumstantial evidence there must of necessity be more chances for error than in positive evidence if any number of witnesses should swear they saw the prisoner draw a reeking sword from the side of a dead man we have not the same degree of certainty that he either murdered or killed him as if the same witnesses had sworn they had seen him run it through his body it affords a violent presumption but still it might have been the friendly act of an innocent man who had accidentally passed that way after the murder was committed or even if it was the prisoners own sword it might have been snatched from his side and plunged into the body of the deceased by some one who had escaped or the deceased might have borrowed it and have fallen upon it himself all human testimony is nothing more than a high probability and it is true that circumstantial evidence in one case may produce a higher degree of it or more nearly approach to certainty than direct and positive evidence in another that both positive and circumstantial evidence may fail will appear from the following cases the first is in the chronicle of the gentlemans magazine for oct

sworn to be committed the lad was on his trial at the bar where he then stood for another robbery in which he was likewise unfortunate enough to be mistaken for the person who committed it on which he

lately broken which bludgeon the prisoner carried in his hand when he was apprehended though this account of the two pieces of the ballad and two pieces of the bludgeon must be proved by positive testimony yet the court and jury are as competent judges of the fitness and correspondence of the parts as the witnesses cui adsunt testimonia rerum quid opus est verbis these were certainly strong corroborations of other circumstances but if they had stood alone they would have deserved little consideration for if the ballad and the bludgeon had been thrown away by the murderers they were objects likely to draw the attention of an innocent man who would naturally have put one in his pocket and have earned the other in his hand  in putting together the scattered papers from which this work was compiled considerable difficulty was felt in assigning its proper place to what mr bentham had written on the subject of improbability and impossibility had it been in the power of the editor to select that arrangement which appeared to him best suited to the nature of the subject he would have placed so much of the present chapter as is merely explanatory of the nature of improbability and impossibility in the first book entitled theoretic grounds and so much of it as relates to the probative force of improbability and impossibility considered as articles of circumstantial evidence in the present book it appeared to him however on perusing the manuscript that the mode in which mr bentham had treated the subject did not admit of any such separation of it into two parts as he had at first contemplated the only question therefore which remained was whether to place the chapter under the head of theoretic grounds or under that of circumstantial evidence and on consideration he has thought it better to postpone the more general and explanatory matter to the present book than to separate this one species of circumstantial evidence from the rest—editor  while the opposite and corresponding attributives probability and improbability have thus been applied to the supposed matter of fact—another pair of opposite and similarly corresponding attributives viz credible and incredible have been applied not only to the fact but to the witnesses—not only to the supposed matter of fact itself but to the persons by whose testimony the existence of it has been asserted in the structure of these two epithets an undeniable impropriety is observable by the termination ible in latin ibile and ibilis potentiality and its opposite are the only qualities which on other occasions are denoted on this occasion instead of that of potentiality and its opposite the import which they are employed to convey is that of propriety or fitness impropriety or unfitness as to potentiality or say capacity—no imaginable matter of fact how unfit soever to be credited but what is credible—no matter of fact that is incredible no supposed matter of fact more unfit to be credited than many a one which is actually and by immense multitudes firmly credited and as to witnesses there never has been nor ever can be any one not in a state of absolute insanity who has not been not only credited but properly and fully credited in connexion with but rather in opposition to than in conjunction with credibility and incredibility—lawyers in speaking of a proposed witness employ the attributives competency and incompetency speaking of the witness as being competent or incompetent of these words the use is to form a sort of disguise for the question whether the person produced in the character of a witness shall be admitted as such or excluded for the same individual of whom they will not say that in that character he is incredible shall be excluded by them under the notion of his being incompetent by the ambiguity in which they either found the epithets competent and incompetent involved or contrived to involve them these epithets become not ill fitted for their purposes incompetent on every given occasion was by each man deemed synonymous to incredible or to inadmissible according to the purpose which he had to serve if to inadmissible it was on this ground viz that being by the supposition unfit to be believed and in that sense incredible it would by consequence be useless and dangerous to give him admittance since in that case it might happen to him to be in the other sense so far from being incredible as to be actually credited all this while in the words trustworthy and untrustworthy the language possessed a pair of appellatives by which if employed instead of the words credible and incredible on the one hand competent and incompetent on the other the purposes of common sense and common honesty would have been fully answered in trustworthiness and untrustworthiness there is no such impropriety as that which in the instance of credibility and incredibility has just been brought to view and in regard to admission had the word trustworthiness been employed an idea that might have presented itself to an unsophisticated mind was that it was a quality the existence or nonexistence of which was a point rather to be tried afterwards by means of admission than to be determined without trial for the purpose of forming a pretence for nonadmission but by the same qualities by which these terms were in so superior a degree adapted to the purposes of truth and justice they were rendered unfit for the purposes of lawyers in the word untrustworthy they would have found but one sense in the word incompetent they had the good fortune to find or the dexterity to make two senses one of which served as a pretence or a sort of reason for the other assuming the man to be unfit to be credited if heard they assumed as if it were the same thing rather than a consequence of the other that he was unfit to be heard to the profession the occasion was in its day an occasion of great interest and is to this day had in general remembrance in which the two words credible and competent as applied to witnesses served as cestuses to lord mansfield and lord camden who might be termed the cribb and molyneux of westminster hall but for the undissembled rancour by which the warfare of the psychological was distinguished from that of the physical combatants in regard to trustworthiness how the matter stands in universal experience has been already stated every man is in general habituated to the language of truth and on every occasion disposed to employ it but on every occasion liable to be induced by particular interest acting in a sinister direction to substitute to it the language of falsehood but according to the theory of these habitual and licensed utterers of falsehood mankind are divided into two parcels one of these never using any other language than that of falsehood nor ever failing of causing it to be accepted as if it were the language of truth  this may be illustrated by the following passage from locke—all propositions wherein two abstract terms are affirmed one of another are barely about the signification of sounds for since no abstract idea can be the same with any other but itself when its abstract name is affirmed of any other term it can signify no more but this that it may or ought to be called by that name or that these two names signify the same idea thus should any one say that parsimony is frugality that gratitude is justice—that this or that action is or is not temperance—however specious these and the like propositions may at first sight seem yet when we come to press them and examine nicely what they contain we shall find that it all amounts to nothing but the signification of those terms—essay concerning human understanding book iv ch viii §   —editor † these propositions even such an one as the last viz that two right lines cannot inclose a space are but verbal contradictions the terms straight line and space and inclose are all general terms and to affirm them one of another is merely to say that they are of this or that meaning it is merely to say that the meaning we ascribe to the term space or rather to the term inclosure of space is inconsistent with the meaning we ascribe to the term two straight lines when we pass from names to things and take two straight rods in our hands we have the evidence of our senses that they cannot inclose a space if they touch at one part they diverge from one another at every other part if they touch at more than one part they coincide and then are equivalent to one straight line what we mean by an inclosure is such a line or continuance of lines that a body departing from any one point can pass on without turning back till it come to that point again without having met in its progress any place where the line was interrupted any place where there was not a portion of line an inclosure is a line or conjunction of lines which beginning at one point is continued till it comes to that point again two straight lines are lines which departing from one point never meet but continually diverge what is affirmed then is that lines which do meet in the manner thus described and lines which in that manner do not meet are not the same lines the question then either is about the physical fact—the rods to which the evidence of sense and experience is applicable or it is about the meaning of general terms—editor  in the uncertainty thus confessed there is nothing that applies with any peculiar force to this medification of circumstantial evidence in the case of affirmative evidence i e where the object of the evidence in question is to establish the existence instead of the nonexistence of the fact to which it applies if we were to look for a mark by which to distinguish on each occasion such lots as may with confidence be given for conclusive our endeavours would be equally unavailing if where the object is to frame a description of the cases in which the nonexistence of one fact may without danger of error and by rules not exposed to contestation be deduced from the existence of another the cases in which the existence of one may be deduced with equal assurance and success from the existence of another fact will not be found to stand upon ground in any degree more satisfactory evidence is the ground we have for the truth of the propositions of which we are least assured evidence and nothing better is the ground we have for those facts of the existence or nonexistence of which we take upon us to speak with the greatest confidence what there is of reality in the ideas expressed by such words as impossibility necessity certainty is as already observed not any property in the things in the facts themselves but only the degree of persuasion by which the opinions we entertain in relation to those facts is accompanied he who by the use of any of these expressions of confidence should think to attach any additional strength to the grounds of persuasion or any additional security for universality of assent would be the man to answer the question put in scripture—which of you all by taking thought can add a cubit to his stature  so unfortunate is this great genius in his choice of this proposition by which in his conception such great things may be done that even in the character of a proposition concerning the words in question it is far from being uniformly true if by a report true or false i injure you in your reputation is there no injustice in that case is it unconformable to the usage of language to say i thereby do you an injustice yet what property of yours is concerned in it or affected by it will it be said the property you have in your reputation in this sense the use of the word property is manifestly improper and figurative property is a thing that can be transferred is reputation transferable truth being generally desirable—demonstration being a means of coming at it with the greatest certainty—moral science being a department of knowledge in which the importance of truth is at the highest pitch—locke wished to find and thought he had found moral truths to be a subject for demonstration all moral truths he thought were capable of being demonstrated by a chain of logical or rather dialectical propositions of which this proposition constituted the first link moral truths a subject for logical demonstration as well might he have predicated the same thing of medical truths as little could be done by this wonderworking proposition for moral science as for medical the one as well as the other is founded on facts—on facts made known by observation experience and experiment in both cases these facts are human feelings in the case of medical science the feelings more particularly of the body in the case of moral science more particularly the feelings of the mind of moral science the only true and useful foundations are propositions enunciative not like that of locke of the import of words but of facts viz of the existence of human feelings pains or pleasures as the effects of this or that disposition of law or of this or that state of human affairs calling for a correspondent disposition and exercise of the power of the law of these under the name of axioms of mental pathology a specimen nor that a scanty one has been given in another place see dumont traités de législation and above vol i p  0   in ordinary language the phrase would be disconformity to some one or more of the laws of nature the expression law of nature is figurative metaphorical it is a metaphor taken from the use given to the same word law in the case of a political law it is to that source consequently that we must resort for an explanation of it when a political law the expression of an act of human will is issued that law emanating from recognised authority and backed with the usual sanctions—a correspondent degree of conformity in human actions—in the conduct of such individuals as are subject to the law—is the customary and manifest consequence and human actions being events a law—a political law—is thus a cause of conformity among events in regard to events of a physical nature the grand and constant object of curiosity and inquiry is that which respects the cause and on a subject so interesting when men cannot come at facts rather than have nothing they are eager to catch at and content themselves with words between this and that group of facts a certain conformity is observed what is the cause of that conformity becomes then the question cause of the conformity—none at all the conformity is itself nothing it is nothing but a word expressive of the state our minds are put into by the contemplation of those facts there are the facts they do exist but the conformity as taken for a fact distinct from the facts themselves has no existence like so many other truths this being no more than a confession of ignorance—and that invincible ignorance—is not satisfactory to the human mind nothing but words being on this occasion to be had—words the counterfeit representatives of facts—them men are determined to have rather than have nothing the conformity being like every other fact real or supposed susceptible of the denomination of an effect this proves the existence of a cause what name then shall be given to that cause what name—what word—for when men have got words they have got that with which on this as on so many other occasions they are content to pay themselves what cause—a law of nature here are events these events are conformable to one another here we have conformity amongst events but for that sort of thing which is a cause of conformity among events we have a known name already it is a law the sort of events the conformity among which this term hath been hitherto employed to designate are human actions the sort of events of which we are now looking out for the cause are not human actions but natural events law in this sense must therefore have something to distinguish it from law in that sense in that sense it is termed law simply without an adjunct to distinguish this from that let us give the word law an adjunct and say law of nature if it were fully understood that a law of nature signifies not an occult cause of conformity among facts but merely the conformity itself the phrase might be employed in this sense without danger of confusion  it will be attempted to be shown in a subsequent note that even what mr bentham calls impossibilities in toto are in reality nothing more than facts in a high degree improbable—editor  gravity the species of attraction common to all perceptible matter constitutes as it were the general law of nature attractions inferior in force or limited in extent—attraction of cohesion of magnetism of electricity of galvanism with the multitudinous system of chemical attractions—constitute as it were so many exceptions to that general law of nature the relation of a prodigy will if false be traceable into the relation the allegation of a violation of some one or more of the known laws of nature in most if not all the relations of this kind that have been current so gross has been the deceit that the law or among the laws stated as having been violated i e superseded on that occasion by some being distinct from and paramount to the universe has been the general the universal law—the law of gravity itself the other particular laws not having been in any degree known at any period when relations of this sort obtained general credit among the superior and most enlightened classes instances of any pretended violation of these more particular laws are scarce discernible an instance of a needle of pure iron of a certain weight disobeying the magnet or of a needle of pure gold of a certain weighta obeying it would be in not less palpable repugnance to a known law of nature than the assent of an insulated and naked man into the region of the sky would be but while the magnet or its characteristic properties remained unknown false stories about magnets could not be broached a i say of a certain weight for of late a notion has been advanced and for aught i can say to the contrary proved that most if not all bodies may be seen to pay obedience to the magnet when reduced to a certain minute quantity  it may perhaps be doubted whether until our knowledge shall have attained a perfection far beyond what it has attained or is ever likely to attain such an attribute as impossibility in toto can in the sense in which mr bentham uses the words be predicated of any conceivable phenomenon whatever mr bentham has given a list whether complete or incomplete is of no consequence for the present purpose of the various forces by which gravitation is known to be under certain circumstances counteracted and assuming this list to be complete he proceeds to infer that any motion which being in a direction opposite to that of the attraction of gravitation should not be referable to any one of those particular causes of motion may be pronounced impossible and for practical purposes no doubt it may but if metaphysical accuracy be sought for i doubt whether even in this case the impossibility in question be anything more than a very high degree of improbability for  st suppose the catalogue of all the known forces which may operate to the production of motion or as mr bentham calls them the primum mobiles to be at present complete does it follow that it will always remain so is it possible to set limits to the discoveries which mankind are capable of making in the physical sciences are we justified in affirming that we are acquainted with all the moving forces which exist in nature before the discovery for instance of galvanism it will be allowed we should not have been justified in making any such assertion in what respect are circumstances changed since that time except that we are now acquainted with one force more than we were before by what infallible mark are we to determine when we have come to the knowledge of all the properties of matter mr bentham himself acknowledges that the discovery of new moving forces is not impossible but the discovery of new forces adequate to the production of such an effect as that of raising a heavy body from the floor to the ceiling of a room without any perceptible cause he does consider impossible because says he had any force adequate to the production of such an effect been in existence it must have been observed long agoa no doubt the improbability of the existence of any such force increases in proportion to the magnitude of the effect but it may be permitted to doubt whether it ever becomes an impossibility had our grandfathers been told that there existed a force in nature which was capable of setting gold silver and almost all the other metals on fire and causing them to burn with a bright blue green or purple flame—of converting the earths into bright metallic substances by the extrication of a particular kind of air c c—they surely might have said with fully as much justice as we can at present that if any cause had existed in nature adequate to the production of such remarkable effects they could not have tailed to have been aware of it before  dly suppose it certain that all the great moving forces to one or more of which all the phenomena of the universe must be referable were known to us—we should not to any practical purpose be farther advanced than before we might indeed in a general way be assured of the impossibility of every phenomenon not referable to some one or more of these forces as its cause but that any given alleged phenomenon is in this predicament is more than we could possibly be assured of—until we knew not only all the moving forces which exist but all the possible varieties of the operation of all those forces and all the forms and shapes under which it is possible for them to manifest themselves—until in short we knew all which it is possible to know of the universe how can i be sure that a given phenomenon which has no perceptible cause is not the effect of electricity unless i knew what all the effects of electricity are and so of all the other laws of nature as however it is very improbable that we ever shall know all the laws of nature in all their different combinations and manifestations and as moreover it is difficult to see how even if we did know them all we could ever be certain that we did so it seems that we never can pronounce with perfect certainty of any conceivable event that it is impossible see even mr bentham himself infra section   ad finem although however it could not be pronounced of the story told by mr bentham that the event which it relates is impossible thus much may with safety be pronounced that if it did happen it was not produced by witchcraft i can conceive the existence of sufficient evidence to convince me of the occurrence of the event improbable though it be—i cannot conceive the existence of any evidence which could convince me that witchcraft was the cause of it the reason is this suppose the fact proved the question remains—is it referable to witchcraft or to some natural cause—of extraordinary events produced by natural causes many have come within my experience of events produced by witchcraft none whatever that extraordinary events from natural causes have frequently occurred there is abundant evidence while there cannot in the nature of things be any evidence that any event has ever been occasioned by witchcraft there may be evidence that a particular event has uniformly followed the will of a particular person supposed to be a witch but that the supposed witch brought about the given effect not by availing herself of the laws of nature but through the agency of an evil spirit counteracting those laws—this can never be more than an inference it is not in the nature of things that any person should have personal knowledge to that effect unless he has that perfect acquaintance with all the laws of nature which alone can enable him to affirm with certainty that the given effect did not arise from any of those laws what alleged witch or magician was ever suspected of producing more extraordinary effects than are daily produced by natural means in our own times by jugglers omniscience alone if witchcraft were possible could enable any one not in the secret to distinguish it from jugglery it is no wonder then that no evidence can prove witchcraft since there never can be any evidence of it good or bad trustworthy or the reverse all the evidence that has ever been adduced of witchcraft is—testimony in the first place to an extraordinary event and in the next place to somebodys opinion that this event was supernatural but to nothing else whatever—editor a in this instance mr bentham really breaks down the distinction between his impossibility in toto and impossibility in degree causes may exist says he which are not yet known to us adequate to the production of some effect but not adequate to the production of so great an effect if so however this impossible fact is impossible in degree only and not in toto  fol     see his essay on miracles  in the edition of boswells johnson published in      i    in illustration of the circumstance of

whether the effect of the conflict on the firstdelivered evidence be infirmative only or altogether destructive—supposing always that any degree of probative force belongs to either of the opposite

of the opposite part of the earths surface—and one would be apt to say that instead of improbability there was impossibility † this being one of the chapters which was written twice over by mr bentham the last time without reference to the first—the story of the king of siam is told twice over at full length as however it is brought to view for two very different purposes—viz the first time to illustrate the principle that the credibility of a fact relatively to a particular individual depends upon his acquaintance with the course of nature and the second time to exemplify the effect of improbability as an article of circumstantial evidence and as moreover the illustrations which accompany the story in the two places in which it is introduced are different—it has not been thought advisable to strike it out in either place—editor  that it might very well have happened to it not to be removed is made evident by the instance already mentioned of the medical man who pronounced the

print of a scene in which on the occasion of a public trial the ghost of a murdered person appeared in court to give evidence against the murderer from such an appearance no danger could ever be to be apprehended for truth and justice but the mischief would be if the reported testimony of the ghost of a murdered man should be received in evidence and gain credit as his reported testimony said to be given dum in vitâ does in actual practice—there have been several instances in which witnesses have detailed evidence in courts of justice which they have alleged to be mere repetitions of the narratives of apparitions sir walter scott printed for the bannatyne club a remarkable record of such a trial under the title trial of duncan terig alias clerk and alexander bane macdonald for the murder of arthur davis sergeant in general guises regiment of foot june ad m dcc liv sergeant davis who had charge of a party for enforcing the disarming act in one of the wildest districts of the highlands had been murdered in a solitary spot where his body was concealed at the trial a highlander gave a distinct narrative of the appearance of the sergeants ghost which gave a very lucid account of the murder and described the spot where the body was concealed a woman to whom this witness was servant confirmed his testimony all efforts to discover the real source or motive of this extraordinary representation by crossexamination or otherwise seem to have been baffled with much acuteness but it was impossible to avoid one circumstance which was dwelt upon as an incongruity viz that the ghost of the english sergeant who had known no gaelic in his lifetime was obliged to use that language to be intelligible to the witness though the other parts of the evidence were distinctly against the accused the suspicion of the jury seems to have been roused by this transaction and an acquittal was found—in a case which happened in the highlands so lately as september      evidence of a similar description was given with this difference that it passed through the medium of a dream a pedlar had been murdered and his pack concealed an individual took the officers of justice to a spot where he said a voice had told him in a dream in gaelic that the pack would be found and it was there discovered accordingly suspicion was naturally roused against the witness but all attempts to discover the real ground of his knowledge were baffled the accused was found guilty and executed—in a weekly periodical called the opera glass for  d february      there is an unauthenticated account of a trial in the state of maryland of the year      or      in which it would appear that a witness in a civil case was examined as to communications which he said he had received from a ghost the question regarded a testament and the ghost in question was that of the testator it had this peculiarity that it wore a skyblue coat the ghost had much communication with the witness on other matters

employed in influencing the discourse employed in relation to persuasion—the discourse employed in giving expression to persuasion or the pretence of it—they are thereby employed in the promotion or the subornation of mendacity for if truth if veracity be all that is desired reward and punishment hope and fear are alike useless it is only by giving birth to falsehood—to wilful falsehood to mendacity—that they are capable of producing any effect if the persuasion which a man is about to declare will be on the side desired whether reward be given to him in that event or no—whether punishment will be given to him in the event of his declaring it on the opposite side or no—neither reward nor punishment can be of any use the only supposition on which they can be of any use is that if left free to declare his persuasion he would declare it on the side opposite to that which is desired thus it is that whether hope or fear expectation of reward or punishment are employed in influencing persuasion itself or discourse purporting to be the expression of it they are employed in depraving the constitution of the human mind if in influencing persuasion itself then it is to the intellectual part of the mental frame that the poison is applied—if in influencing discourse purporting to be the expression of persuasion then to the moral part but in general the poison operates upon both parts together to be habitually occupied in the utterance of wilful falsehood is a painful thought to be thus occupied for lucre is a reflection that renders the thought still more painful to rid himself of it as far as possible a man strives with might and main to believe what he stands engaged to say that he believes he keeps his attention nailed to the considerations that operate in favour of that side he turns it aside with horror from all considerations that operate in favour of the opposite side thus it is that the principle by which merit and reward are attached to belief blame and punishment to unbelief is irreconcilably hostile not only to wisdom but to virtue folly vice and misery are the fruits of which in proportion to its prevalence it is productive  in the field of theology all history joins in proving it the attachment manifested by men to an opinion and in particular by men in power is strenuous and inflexible in the direct proportion of its absurdity the effect is the result of the conjoint influence of a variety of causes   with the zealous and sincere the more palpably and flagrantly absurd the proposition—the greater the reluctance on the part of a mans understanding to the adoption of it—the greater and more powerful the effort necessary to overcome that reluctance—the greater is the difficulty and thence the apparent merit of the sacrifice if the sacrifice of the body is an oblation acceptable to the more than canine appetite of a malevolent and jealous deity—the sacrifice of the nobler part the mind the understanding itself must be a still more grateful sacrifice   insincere or even sincere the greater the absurdity of the proposition the greater the impossibility of obtaining in favour of it that complete and imperturbable serenity of mind which accompanies the conviction impressed upon the mind by real and familiar truths the greater consequently the irritation produced by that presumptive evidence of the falsity of the proposition the amount of which is swelled by every instance of disbelief on the part of other minds every such instance of dissent constitutes a sort of circumstantial presumptive evidence of the erroneousness of the proposition thus adhered to every such piece of evidence forms an obstacle to the formation entertainment or continuance of the persuasion which a man has it so much at heart to entertain if sincere or if insincere to appear to entertain without prejudice to his reputation for sincerity in the circle in which the moves   sincere or insincere the more palpable the absurdity

reward and punishment on the one hand between opinion and declaration of opinion on the other between reward and the belief or expression of belief of a wonderful fact—between punishment and the disbelief or expression of disbelief—has in the case of supernatural facts been urged by some as a circumstance operating in proof of the fact and which ought to have its influence in producing on our parts a persuasion of the truth of the fact on our observing it to be reported as true by others in other words the wonderfulness of a fact being given its credibility will be increased by the circumstance of its having been announced as contributing to constitute the foundation of a religious system i e of a system of commands sanctioned by threats and promises represented as emanating from an invisible supernatural being as above increased why increased for this reason because it is the nature of this circumstance to provoke scrutiny and to operate as an advertisement to sceptics and disbelievers to come forward and inquire into the fact and contest the truth of it if adequate means and motives for the performance of such scrutiny were at hand—yes but if not what becomes of the security—the security for trustworthiness thus supposed to be afforded in the case of a future fact yes let it present itself as being of the wonderful cast and let it be employed as an engine of power in the manner above mentioned as an instrument for the support of this or that system of religion new or old—no doubt but the use thus made of it will have the effect of causing it to be more closely examined into than if no such use had been made of it but in the case of a past fact—what becomes of its tendency to promote scrutiny is it part of the supposition that it was actually subjected to such scrutiny applied to past facts all supposition about tendencies is superseded if it was subjected to scrutiny—in a word to judicial examination produce the minutes of the examination this done the question whether it be likely any such examination should have taken place would obviously be frivolous if on the contrary it does not appear that any such scrutiny was performed any such examination taken then again the argument from tendencies assumes what is contrary to fact to judge of the force of this argument take note of the securities for trustworthiness in evidence as herein brought to view all of them exemplified in the practice of english judicature take on the other hand the book whatever it be in which the system of alleged supernatural precepts threats and promises is exhibited together with the wonderful facts referred to as proofs of its authenticity observe which if any of those securities have been applied or are represented as having been applied to the establishment of these several facts take the koran for example with the several wonderful facts therein reported whose testimony have you in proof of them that of the writer whosoever he were mahomet his composer or his scribe but say mahomet on the occasion of this or that fact he speaks of it as taking place in the presence of hundreds and hundreds of eyewitnesses—persons none of them likely either to have been themselves deceived or to have harboured a wish to deceive others instead of hundreds put thousands what do you get by the multiplication what testimony have you even now but mahomets and who at this time of day shall crossexamine mahomet instead of mahomet both hero and historian suppose mahomet only the hero and the historian somebody else who having been a hero to nobody is himself unknown instead of one such historian suppose half a dozen sometimes agreeing sometimes disagreeing a wonderful fact reported by one omitted as not being true—or not being worth reporting omitted or reported differently by another not one of these histories in print till ages after the deaths of all supposed eyewitnesses not one of them known so much as to have been communicated in manuscript or so much as written till after the deaths of all possible counterwitnesses not one of them known to have passed for ages into the hands of any other readers than what were predetermined not to institute a scrutiny into the truth of any of the wonders and suppose the desire of subjecting the facts to the test of a judicial examination ever so strong and general among

fact may be improbable in itself—that is improbable because incompatible with the ordinary course of nature or it may be improbable because incompatible in a greater or less degree with some other fact which has been established by independent evidence for instance in the case of delinquency with the character of the supposed delinquent what is said in this section on psychological improbability is equally applicable to both theset species of it several of the modifications of the latter species have been treated of at considerable length in the former part of the present book—editor ‡ this has appeared to the editor to be the most proper place for the present dissertation which clearly belongs to the head of psychological improbability though apparently not inended by

rare occasion happen to it to be—but of what in its ordinary condition it is and what even in the extraordinary case of fraud it purports to be for in case of fraud if known to be directed to the object to which in that case it really is directed viz that of operating in the character of evidence the object of it would be by such knowledge frustrated  a more natural as well as concise mode of designation would have been to say the writer or the author but what may have happened is that he whose discourse it is was not the writer of it as in the case of dictation or transcription and by the word author the conception is apt to be exclusively directed to a long and studied discourse whereas the roughest and minutest scraps are capable of being produced in this character and in practice

enter more fully both into the subject of ex parte preappointed evidence and into that of adscititious evidence it does not appear however that he carried this intention into effect—editor  here ends all that mr bentham had written on the subject of adsctitious evidence with the exception of some loose memoranda what follows was chiefly made up from these memoranda by the editor  the testimony given by the deposing witness may if false be false in toto or false pro parte it is false in toto if so it were that to any such effect as that deposed to no such extrajudicial statement was made by any person the whole being purely the invention of such deposing witness if as to any part a statement to any such effect as that deposed to was at the time and place deposed to made by any person in the character of a percipient witness though not the very person deposed to in that character—even in this case it may be too much to consider the testimony as false in toto in point of effect the difference between one person and another in the character of an extrajudicially narrating witness may be altogether immaterial or according to the character and situation of the two persons may be material to any the highest degree person of the supposed percipient or other supposed extrajudicially narrating witness—time of the supposed extrajudicial narration or statement—place in which it was made—in respect of any or all these several circumstances the deposition may be determinate or in any degree indeterminate more or less indeterminate not only in respect of time and place but even as between person and person er gr whether it was one out of two determinate persons some one out of three or more and so on in regard to degrees of persuasion as to the question which of them it was or the person may have been altogether unknown and indeterminate  chap x of this book † a supposable case of mendacity and even of fraud is this—mendax in support of a claim of his own comes forward in the character of a deposing witness supporting it by hearsay evidence which hearsay evidence consists in deposing that in his hearing on an extrajudicial occasion umbra spoke of herself as having at a time mentioned by her seen in the character of a percipient witness a certain fact which had it really happened it would have fallen in her way and in her way alone to have so witnessed assisted for instance in the character of a mid wife at the birth of titius here we have an article of hearsay evidence which though by the supposition false is of essential use to its fabricator rendering to the plan of falsehood a service which perhaps could not have been rendered by any evidence of the nature of ordinary original untransmitted evidence but this is not among the cases that come within the description of the characteristic fraud as above described wherever the characteristic fraud employed in the shape of hearsay evidence has place the extrajudicial statement though false is really uttered and delivered the case here supposed is a case not of hearsay evidence operating by means of the fraud in question there not having been in fact any extrajudical statement or narration any extrajudicial witness it is a case of false original untransmitted evidence pretending to be but not really being hearsay evidence an article of selfserving evidence to any such effect as the above is obviously of itself a suspicious and weak article of evidence but there is nothing to hinder it from being true and at the same time supported by a body of truly reported circumstantial evidence it would be possible to exclude evidence thus constituted and at the same time without comprehending in the exclusion either selfserving evidence as such or hearsay evidence as such it would be possible but there seems not to be any adequate reason for the doing it  as a general principle of english law hearsay evidence and statements in writing are inadmissible in evidence there are various exceptions to this exclusionary rule for example the testimony given on oath by a deceased witness on a former trial may be proved by a person who heard him give his evidence it has been however laid down that the witness must not be allowed to swear to the effect of what was said but must recollect the very words r v carpenter   show    ennis v donisthorne cornw sum ass      ms—statements made to medical men in answer to questions are received in evidence aveson v lord kinnaird   east        —letters written by the payee of a promissorynote to the maker at the time of the making of the note are admissible in evidence kent v lowen   campb       0—declarations of the deceased in cases of homicide after the mortal blow has been given are received in evidence   east p c c   s     woodcocks case   leach  0 —ed  in this particular however what ought not to escape observation is that the meaning of words spoken on an extrajudicial occasion in the way of statement or narration concerning a fact to which it may happen to form the subject of an article of evidence is not more liable to be misconceived than the meaning of any set of words to which it happens to be considered as constituting the matter of an offence words for instance in respect of which the utterer is charged with defamation or words by means of which the utterer is considered as having instigated to or by instruction assisted any other person in the commission of that or any other offence whatever  in its original import the term memoriter is not more properly applicable to this modification of transmitted evidence than to hearsay evidence since the subject of recollection or pretended recollection may as well be a supposed oral as a supposed written discourse but in the language of classical education the term memoriter is already in use to designate the sort of exercise which consists in getting by heart committing to memory a portion of a book—a portion of a poem for example even in the age of original latinity memoriter habita oratio says cicero academ quest iv   to express a speech composed and got by heart  a witness would be allowed to refresh his memory by looking at such a letter although the letter itself would not be allowed to be given in evidence as proposed by the author below—ed † or to speak more correctly instead of the day of the examination we should rather put the day on which the recollection of the witness came to be pointed to the subject by the information that his testimony in the judicial form would be called for  a mass of evidence of this description may be considered as constituting either one complex lot of evidence or two simple ones emanating from the same source whether it be to be spoken of under the one denomination or the other is manifestly a mere question of words  add to these lithography which when this work was written had scarcely been applied to the multiplication of copies of a written document—editor † why so   because in the natural state of things the printer having no particular interest in any legal use to which it may happen to the document to be applied occupies in this respect a station analogous to an official one by a printer i mean a person exercising his function in the ordinary way of trade not to speak of a printer employed in the printing of laws or other legal documents by authority of government   because the printer is in every instance either actually known or capable of being known as the workman of his own works his livelihood depends upon the reputation of them in point of correctness and the correctness or incorrectness of them is subjected to the eyes of a number of witnesses and judges greater beyond comparison than usually has place in the case of any transcript performed by hand superior as this mechanical mode of imitation is in the character of a security against incorrectness it is at the same time deficient in the character of a security against spuriousness—but in this character nothing is more easy than to put it upon a level with the manual script or transcript whatever mark of authentication signature of the name for instance serves for impressing the character of authenticity upon the whole tenor of a sheet of manuscript will serve in a degree not inferior for impressing the like character upon a sheet of letterpress will serve and in a degree considerably superior on an instrument written in manuscript interpolations and other alterations are introducible but too easily especially if performed by the same hand in the case of letterpress any such alterations are as yet perhaps without example and might at any rate be made impracticable  see book vii authentication  the rule of law relating to transcripts is thus laid down by phillips—examined copies and the parol evidence of witnesses are the ordinary and regular proof of the contents of lost writings but when a written paper has been traced into the possession of one of the parties to the suit who does not produce it after receiving a notice something less than an examined copy may reasonably be admitted as sufficient at least to oblige the party to give better evidence by producing the paper itself if he finds the secondary evidence incorrect i phil evid p       0 in the case of pritt v fairclough   camph  0  an entry by a deceased clerk in a letterbook was admitted as evidence of the contents of a letter the receipt of which was acknowledged by the defendant but which letter was not produced at the trial when required this case was remarkable for the following dictum laid down by lord ellenborough—the rules of evidence must expand according to the exigencies of society it is much to be lamented that the judges as a body have not courage enough to act upon this dictum and sweep away these exclusionary rules which are in such direct opposition to the exigencies of society—in other words to the ends of justice—ed  book ix exclusion  english procedure with the most perfect complacency licenses injustice in this shape to a most deplorable extent but of this kind of imperfection the display belongs not to the present subject but to that of procedure and the head of forthcomingness  the justice that is of immediate and intrinsic importance—the justice upon which the sense of security on the part of the public depends is not abstract real justice but apparent justice real justice is no otherwise of importance than in as far as apparent justice as is the case in the ordinary state of things depends upon it the supposition is a strained and odious one nor is it without great exertion and reluctance that the mind of man especially the mind of an ardent lover of justice can bring itself to frame it but for the moment and in the character of a supposition it may be an instructive one better by far that injustice should be really done in all cases so justice be universally thought to be done in the same cases than that justice should be done in all cases at the same time that in half or though it were but a quarter or say a tenth or even a twentieth part of those cases we know not where to draw the line injustice and not justice were with equal universality thought to be done in the former case in respect of the mischief of the second order see dumont and introduction no alarm no sense of insecurity by the supposition in the other case a violent alarm—a strong sense of insecurity and that a universal one but in the case where the information is presented to the judge in the shape of immediate real evidence the public not present—the sort of justice in favour of which the chance is augmented is no more than real abstract justice as above described the justice in favour of which the chance is lessened is apparent justice in the case where the public is present—whether it be in the shape of immediate real evidence or reported real evidence that the information is presented—the probability in favour of apparent justice is at any rate preserved undiminished howsoever in the case of reported evidence the matter may stand in respect of real abstract justice  the above remarks apply not only to the case of hearsay evidence through many media but also to that of transcriptitious evidence through many media or transcripts of transcripts one remark still remains which is peculiar to the latter species by confrontation with and examination by a transcript of any superior degree a transcript of any inferior degree may be raised in the scale of trustworthiness to a degree next below that with which it is so compared thus suppose a transcript of the tenth degree by examination with the original it may be endowed with every security for trustworthiness that can be given to a transcript of the first degree and is thereby raised altogether upon a level with a transcript of that first degree by confrontation with a transcript of the first degree it may in the same way be endowed with every security for trustworthiness that can be given to a transcript of the second degree † will it be said that when two witnesses are thus made necessary they must both of them of course be deposing witnesses if any such position were advanced it would be rejected at any rate by english law in the case of treason to ground conviction there must indeed by statute be two witnesses but by jurisprudence one at least of these two witnesses may be a piece of paper the statutes   ed vi c    and      ed vi c    render two witnesses necessary in a charge of treason the      wil iii c   requires two witnesses to

of the law of scotland the rules above stated apply to that part of the country it is worthy of observation however that by the principles of the criminal law of scotland no man can be convicted of any offence on the testimony of a single witness the rule has very little effect in practice as a case scarcely ever occurs in which more than one individual is not cognizant of some portion of the res gestæ and it is a sufficient compliance with the principle that the narrative of a percipient witness is confirmed by another whose statement may have the slightest possible connexion with the criminative circumstances—ed  clymer v kettler hawk iv     from   burrows      † this is not correctly reported by hawkins who has been followed in the text by the author in referring to burrows

particular to english ones the weight with which it presses seems to be irresistible disbelieve transmitted evidence on the ground of the multitude or the uncertainty of the number of the media through which it purports to have passed you reject history in general and all ecclesiastical history in particular if the facts in support of which evidence of this complexion will naturally be adduced be merely on the ground of their having this and no other sort of evidence for their support to be pronounced incredible much more must all facts brought to view in the character of a basis of religious opinion be incredible the supposed facts brought to view for a judical purpose are all of them of the most ordinary and natural cast and whatever chance they may have of gaining credence depends upon the vulgarity of their complexion their conformity in every respect to what is generally understood to be the ordinary course of nature—e g that john and joan being married at the usual time of life had sons and daughters and having attained a usual age and being possessed of landed property left such or such a son or such and such daughters to succeed to it the facts which are the subjects of the earliest period of every ecclesiastical history are facts more or less deviating from what at present is generally understood to be the ordinary course of nature or they could not be what by the supposition they are facts constituting the subjects of religious faith that jared for example at the age of     years cohabiting with a woman unknown begat for his firstborn a son named enoch and died  00 years afterwards continuing for an unspecified part of that time to beget sons and daughtersa the facts which in the case of the christian religion constitute the subjectmatter and basis of religious faith do not purport to have been established by any judicial examination or consigned in any instance to an official register in the character of preappointed evidence the shape in which they present themselves is uniformly that of transcriptural evidence which after having passed through an uncertain number of oral media fixes itself at a point of time more or less remote from the fact in the shape of a written original of the nature of casually written evidence if on his ground the trustworthiness of an article of transmitted evidence depended in any such considerable degree on its proximity to the source the extraordinary facts which in the mahometan religion constitute the subjectmatter of religious faith would present in this respect a better title to credence than the extraordinary facts which in the christian religion constitute the subjectmatter of religious faith for the koran purports to have had for its author whether in the character of dictator or of actual scribe makes little difference mahomet himself by whom or in whose presence the extraordinary phenomena in question are stated to have been produced whereas the new testament having for divers portions of it divers authors purports not to have had for the author of any portion of it the founder of the religion preached in it—the person by whose power any of those extraordinary facts were produced nor yet in the instance of any portion of it any person in whose presence they are stated to have been produced the purpose in view in these observations will i hope not be misconceived it is not the destroying the credit of history in general or christian history in particular but the destroying any objection that on the ground of english judicial practice might be opposed to the

requires to be authenticated in the east indiesa to this same purpose a discovery that perhaps will one of these days be made is that besides the east indies the surface of the earth includes other

cause elsewhere at other times mr w would promise to take a warrant out for the next attendance as it came in his turn and if he kept his word which seldom happened for he generally chose to forget it he would take it out three or four days later than he agreed to do a warrant—here was every exertion made that could be made to make delay if at this time the practice of taking out three warrants constantly for three different days to procure one attendance had been established would not some notice have been taken of it in fine thus was she played off and amused by these gentlemen it was

though this is a most terrible grievance to a suitor can it be imagined a master will be so infatuated as to discountenance a practice whereon the chief profits of his place depend no surely then what remedy is there left for the party distressed by these iniquitous delays whythey must move the court by their counsel that the master may expedite his report and the parties attend de die in diem and

this one perhaps unpleasant visit at this price he is free what is this compared to an english equity or even commonlaw suit what a fleabite is to a fracture under the technical system the right and the wrong defendant being as yet absolutely undistinguishable the plaintiff finds himself compelled to fix upon one of them in the dark at the end of the suit when the evidence comes to be heard the one thus fixed upon turns out to be the wrong one here then instead of the money supposing it money justly due to him the result is the obligation of paying three four or five score pounds more than a great majority of the people would be respectively able to pay were they to leave themselves houseless naked and penniless in this condition the plaintiff has to seek his remedy against another defendant who if for this time he happens to be the right one may have gone out of reach or become insolvent or the evidence by which if taken in time the obligation might have been proved upon him

nature of the demand according to the judges then who have introduced this practice the declaration is waste paper utterly useless with reference to the purpose for which it is pretended to be meant

deception by his signature think you to make an english lawyer comprehend how it should be possible that appearance when the scene of it is in an english court of justice should mean appearance the adjunct personal will be apt to present itself as capable of conveying the intimation appearance simply—appearance of the defendant in court means indeed it may be said appearance of somebody else in another place but personal appearance—personal appearance of the defendant in court—cannot surely be understood as meaning anything else but the appearance of that person in that place vain

in the disposable time of a single court and therefore of an adequate demand presented for two courts it would be desirable to make a separation of the whole mass of causes into simple and complex causes—allotting the simple causes to the one court the complex ones to the other that a distinction ought to be made between these two classes of causes is proved by other reasons a great majority of the whole number of suits do not require more than a few minutes each to hear and terminate this is matter of experience yet here and there a cause shall arise which to do justice to it may require more than as many days of uninterrupted attendance were no division established between simple and complex causes here might be a hundred sets of suitors with their respective witnesses all kept in a state of torment by one single cause like a brokendown carriage in a procession it might happen to a long cause to produce irreparable damage stopping for days or weeks dozens or scores of causes to each of which upon an average as many minutes might suffice it would however be in some respects better two courts in one district together with separation of complex from simple causes being supposed to be resolved on that one of the two courts should not be confined to simple the other to complex causes but each court occupied with causes of both descriptions dividing its time between them   on this plan you have the benefit of emulation on the other not   confine the simple causes to one court the complex causes to the other the latter seems in danger of getting a bad name the delay inseparably attached to the nature of the cause may come to be charged as matter of blame to the personal account of the judge it is better as between simple causes and complex ones to allot to them

no sort of difference  except the comparatively rare cases of a plea and a demurrer not worth explaining for this purpose  reg brev  equity is in its original signification exactly synonymous to its conjugate equality in a certain description of cases though that comparatively a narrow one the dictates of utility require that in the allotment and distribution made by law of benefits and burthens to or amongst individuals standing in certain relations to each other the proportion of equality should be observed in so far as this state of things has place it is right and proper because it is most for the advantage of the community upon the whole that such an allotment and distribution of the objects in question should be made by the substantive branch of the law in so far as the allotment so made by the substantive branch of the law has been adjusted to this principle justice requires that such allotment and distribution should be conformed to and carried into effect by the adjective branch of the law in other words by the system of procedure to the extent of this description of cases whatever arrangement is conformable as above to equality or say to equity is comformable to justice and as such fit to be carried into effect out of this circle of cases an arrangement which should govern itself by the principle of equality which should make a point of allotting and dividing the object in equal proportions amongst the several coclaimants or corepugnants would not be conformable to justice between the cases in which the adoption of the principle of equality or equity is employed in the administration of justice and the cases in which it is not nor can be employed consistently with the dictates of utility and justice—there is not in the nature of things any such marked distinction as that justice should be of a better sort in the one set of cases than in the other yet somehow or other to the word equity the relation of which to its original synonyme equality has insensibly been almost forgotten a sort of eulogistic sense seems somehow or other to have attached itself exceeding in the degree and measure of eulogy and approbation whatever has attached itself to the words law and justice by equity men have accordingly come to understand a doublerefined sort of law distinct from and superior to the common sort to that sort to which the common and original appellative law continues to be attached between law and equity there seems to be a gradation of rank and whensoever they meet that it belongs to law to yield the pas seems altogether out of dispute how it stands between justice and equity does not seem quite so clear does it ever happen to their pretensions to meet together in the teeth the answer may be yes or no whichever happens to be most convenient but if it be yes so that the two goddesses do not agree so much the worse for justice take her at the best there is in her temper a crabbedness that people in general are not fond of equity is decidedly regarded as the most amiable as to the superior favour attached to the word equity it seems referable altogether to the circumstance of posteriority though to that on more accounts than one   along with the involuntary good so much mischief nor that altogether involuntary had been seen to be done by men in power with the words law and justice in their mouths that the words had been rendered to a certain degree odious and men had been upon the lookout for some sort of system by which the good might be administered if not without any admixture of the evil at least with a less proportion of it   the formidableness of the words law and justice had been constituted in a principal degree by its application to penal cases and more especially to those in which the punishment was most severe and of every such terrific application the word equity stood clear here was prejudice against prejudice the people in proportion as they were oppressed by law were fond of equity in proportion as they were oppressed by judges that is by lawyers they were fond of juries equity according to the shortest and most comprehensive conception that could be given of it was a sort of law in which everything was done without juries what was to be done scylla was on one side—charybdis on the other under juries men found themselves ruined for want of a remedy under equity they found themselves oppressed and plundered still more grievously than under juries by virtue of this new invented remedy the alternative was like that of the wretched patient under ancient medicine to lose his lifes blood for want of a styptic or be broiled by a redhot iron applied to him instead of one they little think that to magnify trial by jury is to condemn equity but lawyers to whom inconsistencies of all kinds are daily bread have contrived to make them easy under these as well as so many other inconsistencies for lawyers fond as they are of juries are still fonder of equity trial by jury is trial by lawyers but trial by equity is trial by lawyers too and with still more work for lawyers to do than in the other case moreover in process of time and by an improvement made in equity itself business was found if not in equity by equity for juries and along with it more business for more lawyers juries alone could give no remedy—equity alone had no tolerable means for

artificial symmetry the other a perfectly plain one which presents each object in the shape as well as colours that really belong to it viewing the scene with a glass of the first sort—the same which blackstone is so busy in putting on every occasion into the hands of his pupils—the object that strikes the eye is the unceasing care and solicitude with which the legislature having from the hands of its ever faithful counsellor the man of law a system originally wanting but little of perfection have watched every occasion to supply it with that little viewed with the plain glass being that through which alone an enlightened lover of mankind would ever bear to view it the objects that strike the eye will be—on the one hand the enormity and multitude of the abuses on the other hand the negligence or ignorance of the legislator and the patience of the people as manifested by the length of time during which each abuse must have been covering and tormenting society with its baleful

empowered to administer an oath to the witnesses—ed  see book ix exclusion † supra chap xii  it is proper to observe here that the praise bestowed by mr bentham upon the existing courts of natural procedure is confined in the strictest sense to the procedure of these courts and by no means extends to the constitution of the courts themselves in many of these courts it is well known that justice is very badly administered what however we may be very certain of is that the cause of this bad administration of justice is not the absence of the technical rules and that if over and above all other sources of badness the practice of these courts were afflicted in addition with the rules of technical procedure they would be not only no better but beyond comparison worse than they are the real and only cause of the badness of the courts of natural procedure in so far as they are had is that which is the cause of the maladministration of so many other departments of the great field of government—defect of responsibility on the part of those persons to whom the administration of them is entrusted causes of such defect of responsibility—   defect of publicity in the case of a justice of peace administering judicature alone or in conjunction with a brother justice at his own house or on his bowlinggreen or wherever he happens to be publicity does not exist in any degree in the case of courts of conscience there is i believe nominal but there can scarcely be said to be effectual publicity since the apparent unimportance of the cause prevents the proceedings in it from being reported in the newspapers and would prevent it even if reported from attracting in general any portion sufficient to operate as a security of public attention   number of judges in many of the courts of conscience the tribunal is composed of a considerable number of officers though any greater number than one or at most two one to officiate when the other is sick or from any other cause unavoidably absent can serve no purpose but that of dividing and in that manner virtually destroying responsibility   defect of appeal in a great variety of cases no appeal lies from the decision of individual justices of peace except to the quartersessions that is to say from the justices individually to the justices collectively how fruitless an appeal of this sort must in general be not to speak of its expense is evident enough what little value it has is mainly owing to the greater effectual publicity attendant on the proceedings of a court of general sessions which are generally reported in the local papers and always excite more or less of interest in the neighbourhood   the judges exempt from punishment or even loss of office in the event of misconduct if the party injured by the decision of a justice of peace is able and willing to go to the expense of a motion for a criminal information in the kings bench or an indictment at nisi prius or an action against the justice for damages and if having done so he can prove to the satisfaction of the judges the existence of what is called malicea on the part of the magistrate by whose unjust decision he has been injured all these things being supposed he may then have some chance of seeing some punishment inflicted upon his oppressor though even then probably a very inadequate one the prevailing doctrine being that the proceedings of an unpaid magistrate ought to be construed liberally and indulgently as otherwise no gentleman will consent to take upon himself the office but without the above preliminaries who ever heard of an english justice of peace who was so much as suspended from the commission on the ground of any misconduct however gross and a country justice must either have very bad luck or play his cards extremely ill if out of every thousand cases of misdecision there be so much as one or two in which all these conditions meet—editor a in an action against a justice according to mr starkie the plaintiff cannot recover more than twopence damages nor any costs unless it be alleged in the declaration that the acts with which the justice is charged were done maliciously and without any reasonable or probable cause—such are the terms of the act to render justices of the peace more safe in the execution of their duty viz    geo iii c    —ed † ruffheads index to the statutes tit general issue  is there so much as a single case in which the necessity of special pleading will be seriously asserted or any specific use whatever found for it if there were any sort of case in which a pretence to that effect would be more plausible than in another it would be the case of that sort of action ejectment by means of which the title to an interest in landed property is tried but from this most important of all claims of property the nuisance of special pleading has been cleared away cleared away and what upon the first mention of it seems unaccountable enough not in the way of legislation but in the way of jurisprudence by lawyers themselves but whatever they have sacrificed in this shape they have made themselves ample amends for by the clouds of fiction and jargon in other shapes by which they have succeeded in rendering this important division of the field of procedure naturally as intelligible as important more completely unintelligible and pregnant with misconception uncertainty and made business than any other † a curious spectacle to any man and an interesting one to him if such a man there be who has the interests of justice sincerely at heart is to observe the diversity of the contrivances which in different ages and countries lawyers have had recourse to the shifts they have sometimes been put to to make business in the time of henry iia and even so late as that of edward i or iib science consisted almost exclusively in nursing for the benefit of a malâ fide defendant lying excuses by which the parties were prevented as long as possible

he has brought them together in the presence of the priest the institutionalist of those days takes his leave of plaintiff and defendant when he has once brought them together in the presence of the

them of course english lawyers adding to the roman mass of special pleading moulded to their own purposes a mass of fiction and jargon of their own growth have worked up a mass of mendacity and nonsense such as the whole army of continental lawyers may look upon with envy and despair the climate of scotland being somehow or other less favourable than that of england to the growth of jargon and in particular of that nonpareil species which is called fiction scotch lawyers notwithstanding their importations from the continent appear judging from some of their books to have been sadly at a loss for materials out of which to spin out the thread of litigation they have made a sort of penelopes web of it doing the work over and over again as long as the patience of suitors could be made to

altogether  the judge being considered as the sort of person on whose shoulders the labour and other vexation attendant on the delivery of evidence rests the situation he may be in admits of an ulterior distinction of great practical importance distinct from the vexation the unbalanced mental suffering which in each individual instance may or may not be the consequence of the labour thus bestowed there is one accompaniment which is altogether inseparable from it—viz the consumption of time—the quantity of time occupied in the bestowing of such labour there are classes of judges to the aggregate quantity of whose time applicable to this purpose there is no natural and absolute limit in this case are all judges but those who judge en dernier resort in this way as in all others whatever quantity of natural business there may be to be done judges in sufficient number may naturally be found for doing it if at the same time that there are not fit persons enough ready to take upon themselves the duty without pecuniary retribution pecuniary retribution cannot be found in sufficient quantity to afford to the number needed an adequate inducement—in such case there exists a

certain limit in this case are in every country the judge or bench of judges to whom it belongs to judge en dernier resort of the fourandtwenty hours in each day there is a certain proportion which bating accidents it may be physically speaking in the power of the judge to bestow upon this or any other species of labour beyond this the application of any additional quantity of time is not merely inconvenient but physically impossible in either of two ways the quantity of time applicable on the part of this court of dernier resort is physically speaking susceptible of extension one is if two or more such supreme courts be instituted each competent to all cases the other is if two or more such supreme courts be instituted one competent to judge en dernier resort in one sort of case another in another sort of case as in the courts subordinate to them but the first sort of arrangement leads directly to contradiction to dissension to civil war to the dissolution of the government the other keeps perpetually alive at least an imminent danger of those same calamities geographical lines of jurisdiction are drawn with ease and precision enough metaphysical logical not without the greatest difficulty as between subordinate and subordinate where there is one superior to decide the difficulty is not felt but as between two coequal courts as above supposed if a difference of opinion or will obtains and neither will yield this case resolves itself into the foregoing one—into the case just described with its ruinous results in the constitutions of most states there is to this purpose no difficulty in whatever hands the supreme authority resides the judicial authority en dernier resort is lodged in effect along with to take the current division the supreme executive and the supreme legislative in the constitutions of most states this supreme authority rests in the hands of a single person a monarch and whatsoever may in other respects be the disadvantage attendant on that

personal time is limited like that of every other man but the quantity of other persons time capable upon occasion of being applied by him to the termination of these or any other disputes is without stint under a mixed constitution the difficulty may be altogether a distressing one delay increasing ad infinitum injustice triumphing impunity certain law trodden under foot power intended to be

or acquitted the    geo iii c  0 was also passed for the purpose of regulating the expenses of prosecutors and witnesses but as none of these acts extended to misdemeanours they were all repealed by the   geo iv c    which grants expenses in all cases of felony and in certain cases of misdemeanour the judges have undoubtedly a discretion and very properly so for it now and then happens that a witness swears falsely keeps back the truth or wilfully prevaricates sometimes a witness has had some participation in the crime of the prisoner as where he has purchased the stolen property of him under suspicious circumstances in all such cases it is usual to disallow the expenses it may be doubted if the case referred to in the edinburgh review ever happened if a witness misconducts himself

the restoration the three great commonlaw courts in westminster hall became so many rival shops like other shops they fought for custom the liberty of the defendant was the bonus they each of them made itself master of and offered as a lure to draw in purchasers it became consequently in the hand of each a weapon with which he fought his rivals it was the kings bench that began in criminal

prosecutor to consign the defendant that is anybody to prison a prison of its own in the first instance that is without evidence the common pleas for which alone of the three courts the cognizance of civil suits had been intended possessed no such right unless in a particular and narrow description of causes the judges of the kings bench formed a scheme for filching custom from their brethren of the common pleas encouragement was given to plaintiffs to bring false accusations against defendants accusations the falsehood of which was completely understood as well by the judges by whom they were received as by the plaintiffs by whom they were delivered on the ground of a false accusation of this sort the defendant as of course went to jail in some cases—was supposed to be in jail in others being thus or being supposed to be in jail he was at any rate in the power of the judges to be dealt with as they pleased being thus in their power they suffered any other demand to be brought against him though it were only of a civil nature in what cases the man was really in their custody and in what not it is impossible for us now to know it was never intended that we should the mass of jargon called in westminster hall by the name of a record was as has been so often observed a mass of jargon in which an indeterminate quantity of truth in great part useless was invariably intermixed with an indeterminate mass of falsehood serving as a screen for whatever injustice it might be deemed profitable and safe to perpetrate when the man was not in jail the bonus employed as above to draw custom into the kings bench shop was not made use of what that shop got for itself was nothing more than the possibility of selling to customers a branch of juridical service of which till then a monopoly had been possessed by the common pleas but in the cases in question the common pleas not being in the practice of sending a man to jail the kings bench in so far as they took upon themselves to send a man to jail in these same cases gave themselves thereby an advantage and through themselves to their customer in which their bretheren on the other side of the hall had as yet no share the success of the king himself in his court at westminster where as all the world knows he is actually and constantly present was prodigious the distress and impoverishment of the king not himself was

grounded on pecuniary interest is very well exposed in the following passage extracted from a review of the traités des preuves judiciaires in the   th number of the edinburgh review— take as an example the case of forgery unless the crime has been committed in the presence of witnesses it can only be proved in the proper sense of the word by the individual whose name is said to have been forged yet that person is the only one whom the law of england prohibits from proving the facta a strange prohibition for which some very strong reason will naturally be sought the reason to be found in the books is this that the party has an interest in pronouncing that paper forged for the enforcement of which he may be sued if it is genuine and this would be true if the event of the criminal inquiry were admitted to affect his interest when the holder proceeds in a civil suit to enforce the supposed obligation but it is also an indisputable rule that the issue of the trial for forgery whether condemnation or discharge is not permitted to have the least effect upon this liability the criminal may be convicted and yet the party whose name appears to the instrument may be fixed with the debt in a civil proceeding or he may be acquitted and yet the genuineness of the handwriting may hereafter be questioned and its falsehood established—how then can the anomaly of this exclusion be explained it seems that legal antiquarians have preserved the tradition of a practice which is said to have prevailed in former times—when a person was convicted of forgery the forged instrument was damned i e delivered up to be destroyed in open court the practice if it ever existed now lives but in the memory of the learned the disabling consequences however survive it to this hour the trial proceeds in the presence of the person whose name is said to have been forged who alone knows the fact and has no motive for misrepresenting it his statement would at once convict the pursuer ou prisoner if guilty or if innocent relieve him from the charge but the law declares him incompetent and he is condemned to sit by a silent spectator hearing the case imperfectly pieced out by the opinions and surmises of other persons on the speculative question whether or not the handwriting is his and this speculation incapable under any circumstances of satisfying a reasonable mind decides upon the life of a fellowcitizen in a system which habitually boasts of requiring always the very best evidence that the nature of the case can admit—editor a the   geo iv c    declares that no person

acknowledged that in many of the cases in which this exception has been allowed it has been from the nature of the case unquestionably certain that the interest at least the pecuniary interest was equal on both sides thus the accepter of a bill of exchange is an admissible witness in an action by indorser against drawer to prove that he had no effects of the drawers in his hands because whichever way the suit may be decided he is equally liable on the other hand there are many cases in which the interest is not really but only nominally the same on both sides thus a pauper is a good witness for either parish in a settlement case why because we are told it is the same thing to him whether he has a settlement in one parish or in another true it may be the same thing but it may also be a very different thing since different parishes give very different allowances to their poor—editor ‡ lord chiefjustice parker rejected the evidence in favour of a hundred of a hundredor who was so

all cases whatsoever immediately after comes the collection of cases thirtyfive in number in nineteen of which the evidence of an interested witness has been adjudged or recognised at common law to be inadmissible including a few in which the door has been opened by special provision in a statute in the other sixteen it has been adjudged or recognised to be admissible in this place therefore the true construction of all is half the cases unconformable to the rule being within two or three as numerous as the cases conformable to it would any one wish to pick out the admissible cases from the

temptation of the same sort of interest had been admitted on a nearer approach this intention has been given up argumentation on the question how the law ought to be is of itself sufficiently voluminous without being encumbered with an additional load of argumentation on the question how the law is or rather ought to be deemed reputed conjectured to be the use of such a table would not have been very considerable in a general view the results of the inquiry on the head of exclusions on the ground of danger of deception are two—  that in no instance ought it to take place but that a general statute ought to be made abolishing it in all cases   that such is the inconsistency of the course of decision under jurisprudential law that unless it be in the particular cases in which notwithstanding interest evidence has been admitted the judge is in every case at perfect liberty to exclude the witness or admit him as he thinks fit that decide as he may he has no blame to apprehend and that between the general principle of stare decisis and the pursuit of the ends of justice in each particular case he has his choice of praise the praise of zeal for the law in the one case the praise of zeal for justice in the other on the other hand the embarrassment attending the construction of such a table would have been enormous suppose it copied with acknowledgment from the existing digests and indexes then comes the question—who are you—what sort of a lawyer are you who put your trust in indexes nor would even this plan have been altogether free from embarrassment and dissertation index would not always agree with index a choice would then be to be made and then would come as candidates for admission the reasons for such choice   suppose the obligation submitted to

regard the ceremony without which the most pernicious exercise of mendacity is not perjury and by means of which the least pernicious is perjury is not the work of the witness but of the legislator in considering therefore the pretence of exclusion on this ground mendacity is the species of improbity to be considered not perjury abolish oaths you would abolish perjury but would the mischief of mendacity be diminished the mendacity here in question is indeed the mendacity of an individual occupying the station of a judicial witness mendacity uttered on the occasion of judicature to this extent considered as a sort of presumptive evidence of future contingent mendacity in danger of being committed on an occasion of this same sort mendacity committed on a judicial occasion in a past instance will it is true afford a presumption stronger than any single act of mendacity taken at large but still it is from mendacity not from perjury—from mendacity whether preconverted or not into perjury—that the mischief has flowed it is to that mischief that the degree of improbity is proportionate if the profanation of the ceremony were alone regarded the indication afforded by it of improbity would be very slight or even evanescent such at least must be the case in a country in which this profanation is not only generally but publicly and notoriously practised and at the same time unattended with the sense of shame by men in elevated stations and in other respects of unblemished characters but in england it has been seen in a former book book ii sevurities chap vi oath that examples of this profanation are thus general even among men distinguished from the common mass by superior probity that that ingredient in the composition of perjury should in any considerable degree operate as an indication of mendacity any more than any other species of improbity is tantamount to a contradiction in terms  where a witness who at the time of the transaction was an uninterested one has since given himself an interest in the cause—as for instance by a wager—english lawyers have decided—and with indisputable justice—that by this act of the witness the party shall not be deprived of the benefit of his testimonya the damage which a man is not allowed to do by an act otherwise so innocent as that of a wager—shall he be allowed to do it by so criminal an act as perjury it is rather curious that while the attesting witness if he has happened to perjure himself since he signed his name would not i suppose be admitted to prove his own signature he is admitted to disprove it a person who has set his name as a subscribing witness to a deed or will is admissible to impeach the execution of the instrumentb although by so doing he confesses himself to have been

identity of the person charged with having done it in default of which they always recommend the jury to acquit—ed † the reason in point of common sense for the exclusion in the case of a particeps criminis is thus strong but the technical reason—the reason to which so much importance is attached on other occasions—failing the reason founded on the probability of mendacity is thrown aside in law it is not criminality that incapacitates but infamy now infamy like most other words which have been borrowed from the language of ordinary life by the language of law has two meanings one meaning when uttered by unlearned—another meaning when by learned lips when a person who is not a lawyer hears of infamy of character he usually supposes that it is the same thing as criminality or at least that when there is no doubt of a mans having committed a crime it does not need the assistance of any such thing as a speech from any such functionary as a judge to render him infamous lawyers however have determined that infamy is the consequence not of the crime nor even of the conviction but of the judgment now as the accomplice who turns what is called kings evidence usually has not been tried he cannot have been convicted nor consequently can judgment have passed against him there is no infamy therefore and consequently no untrustworthinessa let him even have been convicted and on the clearest evidence so judgment have not passed he will speak the truth but so soon as it has passed he is unfit to be believed from that moment he is a liar it might appear nevertheless to common sense that other things being the same it can make very little difference in the probability of a mans telling the truth whether or no certain words have been uttered by a judge—editor a this is an exaggeration the untrustworthiness of the evidence of the accomplice who secures his own pardon by endeavouring to convict his associates is pointed out in the books and acted upon by the judges as has been seen in the note to the preceding page—ed of this edition ‡ the absence of complaint on this ground is the more remarkable and adds the greater force to the argument inasmuch as on other

exclusion put by english law upon selfcriminating testimony of which in its place  one species of evidence evidence of the most useful kind is by this exclusionary rule inexorably shut out the evidence admitted is that of a partaker of the crime who in recompense for such evidence obtains the equivalent of a pardon indeed more than the equivalent of what is granted under that name this man then upon requisition gives information of as many crimes as he has been witness of or at least of as many as being known to be acquainted with he is required to give evidence of but the persons convicted with or without such bought evidence have many of them perhaps most of them their catalogue of crimes of others to which they have been privy and which if required and admitted they might be instrumental in bringing to justice such evidence would not always be given the quality or quantity of inducement necessary to the extraction of it would not always be found it would however sometimes perhaps not unfrequently be found conscience which so often produces from a man the confession of his own crimes would naturally have less difficulty in producing the relation of those of other men

the custom of your own country and the religion you profess that the evidence you shall give between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god if the english judges had thought the matter worth inquiring into they would have found that kissing the book is a practice quite unknown in scotland unless in deference to the peculiar religious scruples of a witness the scottish form does not appear to have any connexion with religious views and it is probable that the scotchmen who objected to the kissing the book were merely obstinate individuals annoyed by finding a deviation from the practice to which they had been accustomed the form of the oath in scotland is—i swear by almighty god and as i shall

forced to content themselves with and to set down as conclusive the very worst sort of evidence viz common report by one statute reputed thievesa haunting the avenues of playhouses and so forth are made punishable so and so if a man can be proved a thief what matters it where he is found if he cannot be proved a thief by other means how is it that his being found in the avenue of a playhouse is to prove him so or so much as contribute anything to the proving him so not to speak of passengers—among all the persons who from the building of a playhouse to the burning of it ever entered into a playhouse has there ever been a single person who was not found in one of the avenues to the playhouse a reputed thief reputed such by whom by the thieftakers a reputed thief is a man who is believed to be such by some person who is or professes to be acquainted with his habits of life who is that person an accomplice no for in this case he would be able to speak to some individual transaction in the course of which the reputed thief acted as one in a word and in experience it is never other than a thieftaker but the thieftaker—by what means is it that he has come to form concerning the man in question an opinion pronouncing him a thief by the word thief though not in all cases and necessarily yet obviously in the present case a habitual thief a man who is so by habit is implied to constitute a habit requires a multitude of acts by any one single act is he capable of being proved to have been a thief in so much as a single instance if so there is no need of any such law what cannot you prove so much as a single act then how is it you can prove the habit cannot you prove so much as an act then how is it you can prove so many as though it were no more than two such acts curious enough must be the sort of testimony on which a man is convicted under this law into the composition of it no individual act can enter opinion the opinion of the thieftaker is everything there can be of it i know him to be such i know him to be generally looked upon as such of this sort is all there can be of it against erroneous or mendacious testimony the grand security is crossexamination crossexamination by which if the individual facts charged are false true ones by their inconsistency with which they are disproved may be brought out against them in no other criminal case would the depriving the defendant of the faculty of crossexamination be deemed endurable in this case by the very nature of the evidence that is of the only fact deposed to the faculty of crossexamination stands excluded when in a case of this sort a man says i believe this man to be a thief should the case be that he entertains no such belief by what evidence can his falsehood be made appear—do you know of any one instance in which the man acted as a thief this is the only sort of question which in the view of discrediting the declaration of opinion could be asked and this by the supposition is one that cannot be asked not that to the account of the exclusionary system alone is to be placed the offence committed against justice by the law that has last been brought to view it is the effort of necessity struggling under the load of debilitatives by which under judgemade law to that deplorable degree of which the printed accounts are witnesses the arm of penal justice is enfeebled capital punishment by which humane men are deterred from testifying against crimes more than dishonest men from committing them—this together with the principle of nullification by which on the ground of pretended errors discovered by feefed brethren the power of pardon is given by judges to lawyers and their clerks—these together with other causes of debility the enumeration of which belongs not to this purpose cannot but be admitted for their share but independently of these concurrent causes the single virtue of the exclusion put upon selfinculpative evidence suffices to account for a large proportion of that mass of unpunished delinquency by the contemplation of which the legislature was drawn into a measure so outrageously repugnant to justice as that which has just been

of lord kenyon in a former note in this you have a specimen and that a fail one of the degree of certainty reasonableness and consistency that pervade the whole of the system of jurisprudential law of the degree of dependency fit to be placed on the opinions the dicta the statements delivered by the most eminent among the official professors of it of the regard due to those panegyries which its professors of all ranks and classes never cease to anoint it with and from which the opinions entertained of it by students and even lawyers are imbibed bad as this branch of the law is in itself its badness constitutes not by any means the whole of its mischievousness an additional mischief is that where as here the proposition possesses a certain degree of extent there is no trusting with any tolerable degree of safety to the accounts delivered of it as it is i e as it is said to be though delivered from the most trustworthy of the hands employed in the dispensation of it lawyer oh but the case of a suit in which one of them alone is party being the case in hand the proposition is to be understood as being confined in its extent to the ground occupied by that case nonlawyer be pleased to look at the words they expressly exclude all limits of the testimony of either against the other the admission cannot take place in any case lawyer nay but there may have been a want of correctness in this part of the report by the judge the requisite exception was made by the reporter it is omitted to be stated nonlawyer possible indeed just possible but not probable had the rule stood by itself without the reason then indeed you might with somewhat better grace have assumed the liberty of imagining clauses to limit the extent of it but along with the rule the reason is actually brought to view and the reason is such as admits not of any the smallest defalcation to be made from that unlimited extent what is the danger of future implacable dissension greater from their being respectively admitted to testify one against the other in a prosecution brought by one against the other than in a civil suit brought against one of them by a stranger or by one of them against a stranger  in the case however of one of the most cruel of all injuries a wife is deprived of this remedy in the case of a prosecution for bigamy the evidence of the first wife has been deemed inadmissible on the ground that she is the only lawful wife if the fact can be proved without the testimony of the wife no inconvenience ensues unless it be a quantity of unnecessary vexation and expense—vexation to the stranger who is compelled to take a journey perhaps to give his testimony expense to the prosecutor or say the prosecutrix who has to detray the expense of the witnesss charges but what in that case is the inconvenience saved an inconvenience scarce worth saving in the fact of the celebration—the celebration of the original and valid marriage—in this taken by itself there is nothing the disclosure of which can of itself have the effect of criminating the husband nothing of which either on that or any other account the statement can naturally be supposed to be attended with any particular uneasiness to the wife by the supposition the fact will be proved by other testimony if hers be not called in to prove it what material difference can it make to her whether it be by her testimony or that of anybody else by declaring herself the lawful wife she does not in any degree sacrifice his character on the contrary she supports it it is not by the first marriage that the disgrace and ruin is thrown upon the guilty husband it is by the second on the other hand suppose the celebration incapable of being proved by any other evidence suppose the case such that for the proving of the celebration no other evidence can be obtained here the operation of giving the evidence might be attended with a sensation more or less painful to the injured wife but on the other hand what is the consequence if it be rejected an inquiry of the most cruel kind that can be sustined remains without satisfaction of any kind the crime a very heavy one remains unpunished the criminal triumphs in his guilt in the cases that gave rise to the decision the inducement for calling in the injured wife was probably the wish to save the vexation and expense that would have attended the procurement of other evidence had the objection been foreseen—had this ground of exclusion been known to be preestablished such other evidence would have been resorted to and that of the wife not employed but the evidence being deemed inadmissible the result was not that the fact was proved by other unexceptionable evidence but that the fact could not be proved at all and in consequence that the crime was seen to go unpunished for in a criminal cause if the determination be in the first instance in favour of the guilty defendant no omissions can be supplied no false steps rectified the example of guilt triumphing in impunity is the price that under the reign of common law must be paid for every point that comes to be established on this side technical law is never consistent even in its badness on a prosecution for bigamy the first husband or wife is not admissible to prove the fact of the former marriage but after a long period of uncertainty it has been settled as late as the year      that in any collateral suit or proceeding between third persons the rule is quite different a person may therefore be incidentally charged with bigamy by the testimony of the first wife or husband and with the effect of punishment viz in the shape of loss of character—a punishment not the less real for being inflicted by other hands than those of the executioners of the law—editor  advice to judges—when you have a reason to give for a rule or supposed rule of jurisprudential law copy mr justice buller let policy be your word keep to generals keep to the generalissima among generals behold the consequence the fatal consequence of descending into particulars of talking of implacable dissension between man and wife you commit yourselves you give a handle to nonlawyers they are thus enabled to look into your reasons and to see whether there be any truth in them no never more suffer yourselves to fall into any such snare keep to policy and such other arguments as in the region of the clouds are of equal altitude or if that be difficult of nearly equal altitude with it keep to policy you are omnipotent with the word policy in your mouths the law is what you please to

examinations papers upon papers while to make the law by declaring it costs you but a word you speak the word the law is made and everything is as it should be  on the other hand what must not pass unnoticed is that supposing the probability of mischief from this quarter were really preponderant the mischief would in this case be more frequently realized than in the other why because to gain an undue advantage by the partys single testimony requires no more than the operation of that one person whereas to gain the same advantage by the false testimony of an extraneous witness requires the cooperation of two persons—the party and the extraneous witness his accomplice each of them conscious of guilt—each of them liable to be betrayed by the unfaithfulness or imprudence of the other † the edinburgh review in an article which has been several times referred to makes a long attack upon the french method of interrogating persons under a charge with a view to the extraction of their selfcriminative testimony—it is not necessary to enter particularly into the objections advanced by the reviewer against this practice they may all be summed up in two propositions neither of which seems very likely to be disputed—  that an innocent man may very possibly be unable to furnish all at once those explanations which are necessary to make his innocence appear and   that such inability on the part of a prisoner not being conclusive evidence of his guilt it would be very wrong to treat it as if it were so the reviewer does not state whether his objection extends to the examination of the prisoner on the occasion of the definitive trial but we may presume that it does not since his arguments do not apply to that case by that time the prisoner may reasonably be supposed to be prepared with all such explanations as the circumstances will admit of and if he is not i fear it will go hard with him whether the insufficient explanations which he does give are given through his advocate only or partly from the lips of his advocate and partly from his own but even against the preliminary interrogation of the prisoner as soon as possible after his apprehension the objections it is evident are altogether inconclusive that nonresponsion and evasive responsion are strong articles of circumstantial evidence against a prisoner is what will hardly be denied—that by an inconsiderate judge more than the due weight may be attached to themis a casualty to which they are liable in common with all other sorts of circumstantial evidence but not more liable than an other sorts were the possibility of deception a sufficient ground for putting an exclusion upon evidence can it be necessary to say that no evidence would be admitted at all but the exclusionists never seem to consider that if deception may arise from evidence it is still more likely to arise from the want of evidence after all the reviewer when he comes to his practical conclusion explains away the whole effect of his previous arguments and ends by prescribing a middle course which leaves the party to judge and act for himself if he is blessed with selfcommand and is in possession of the means of at once refuting his pursuers why should his vindication be delayed but as he may be incompetent to do so or unprovided with the necessary proofs let him be calmly told by the magistrate that no unfair inference will be drawn from his reserving his defence for a more convenient season that something of this sort should be told him is obviously proper to which i will add that no promise could be more safely given than a promise not to draw any unfair inferences though it may be doubted how far such an assurance would quiet the alarms of an innocent prisoner until he should be informed what inferences the magistrate would consider unfair the proper thing to tell him would be that if from the unexpectedness of the accusation he felt his faculties to be in too bewildered a state to qualify him for making a clear statement of the truth and of this the magistrate would be in some measure able to judge or if any sufficient reason rendered him unable or averse to give the necessary explanations without delay he would be at liberty to say as little or as much as he pleased but that if when the trial should come on and he should come to be finally examined the explanations afforded by him should appear to be such as might with equal facility and propriety have been given on the spot—his having refrained from giving them at that time would be considered as strong

allowed to give evidence for him which in the opinion of phillipps seems to be the same thing the reason given by lord holt for admitting in evidence the oath of the defendants wife to prove the felony committed is as follows for otherwise one that should be robbed would be under an intolerable mischief if he prosecuted for such robbery and the party should be acquitted the prosecutor would be liable to an action for a malicious prosecution without the possibility of making a good defence though the cause of prosecution were ever so pregnant—the reason is a good one but admit its

pleasure but to pain or pleasure in general considered as apt to flow from so many distinguishable sources  this love of justice commonplace moralists and even a certain class of philosophers would be likely to call an original principle of human nature experience proves the contrary by any attentive observer of the progress of the human mind in early youth the gradual growth of it may be traced among the almost innumerable associations by which this love of justice is nourished and fostered that one to which it probably owes the greatest part of its strength arises from a conviction which cannot fail to impress itself upon the mind of every human being possessed of an ordinary share of intellect—the conviction that if other persons in general were habitually and universally to disregard the rules of justice in their conduct towards him his destruction would be the speedy consequence and that by every single instance of disregard to those rules on the part of any one himself included the probability of future violations of the same nature is more or less increased—editor † of the influence above spoken of in the text the case of elizabeth canning anno      reported in the state trials affords a memorable example out of the knowledge of her friends she had been absent from home for about a month upon some love errand on her return being pressed by interrogations she fabricated a story of her having been carried off for the purpose of violation to a house of illfame a few miles from her abode in london from whence after being kept without food for weeks in a manner almost miraculous she at length made her escape unviolated the story exciting public attention two women were apprehended and tried for their lives as for having robbed her in that house and one of them convicted the story being a compound of improbabilities the convict was respited and in the interval counterevidence of the alibi kind presenting itself in abundance she was prosecuted for perjury and after a trial of the unexampled duration of fourteen days convicted on evidence which—though at that time it divided the bench at the old bailey composed chiefly of aldermena into nearly equal parts—leaves at this time of day not the smallest doubt she was in consequence transported to america for seven years in this instance by the force of one of the tutelary interests—fear of shame—the wretched woman was driven we see into an enterprise of murder against the lives of two innocent persons as by the same impulse so many unhappy women are every day drawn into a transgression which by a blind abuse of power is devoted to the same murderous punishment because by an abuse of language called by the same name a this absurd custom of putting aldermen in the commission was continued by the      will iv c    as most of these gentlemen are engaged in trade they are frequently absent attending to their own affairs and then the public business is effectually stopped for unless there are two commissioners present in each of the two courts all the proceedings would be void the rule is to have a real judge who does the business with an alderman sitting by his side reading the newspaper—ed  to apply this to religion in perhaps all religions there have been sham miracles performed and false accounts of miracles never performed but from a mans having joined in the performance of a sham miracle or fabricated an account of a miracle known by himself never to have been performed we are not to conclude that in each instance he has disbelieved the existence of miracles of earlier date said to have been wrought under the same religion these miracles says he to himself are true but at the present conjuncture they do not produce that general conviction which it were so much to be wished they did let us aid the efficacy of truth by a pious and useful falsehood by whomsoever else such policy may be condemned it can never with any consistency be condemned by any of those lawyers who on such an infinite variety of occasions and without any assignable specific use have given invention currency or support to so many pernicious falsehoods  if the slight sketch in the way of instruction here given be of use with reference to the present purposes so will it for the purpose of divers other operations performable on the field of judicature as for example—   liquidation of the quantum of punishment when in part or in whole pecuniary   liquidation of the quantum which in the name of satisfaction for loss with or without injury a plaintiff ought to receive   liquidation of the quantum which on the same score a defendant ought to be compelled to pay for on this ground the views of the judge will be incomplete and partial if where the importance of the cause warrants it and the difference of circumstances is considerable the circumstances on both sides be not taken into the account   adjustment of the pecuniary burthen proper to be

constant deception has been time out of mind the lot of english judges but the mischief falling exclusively upon the party in the right while the advantage of it is shared between the party in the wrong and the firm in which the judges are the acting partners no deception it has been seen was ever submitted to with a more unruffled acquiesence  among the lacedæmonians and romans though adultery was no more dispunishable than horsestealing a man would lend his wife to a friend as he would his horse to whatsoever degree illaudable the custom does not the less prove the rashness of any opinion that should regard adultery on the part of the wife as a proof of the extinction of that partiality by which in a cause in which the husband is party her testimony will naturally be drawn towards the husbands side in france before the revolution the effect even of notorious adultery in diminishing that partiality was as nothing—editor  of this latter circumstance such is the force that under the laws of some countries cohabitation without further proof unless it be the acquiescence of the man in the assumption of his name by the woman is regarded as possessing to that purpose whatsoever force has been given by law to the prescribed solemnities—this may be said to be the case in scotland where parties are held as married if they have lived habit and repute as man and wife that is if they have allowed themselves to be treated by society as man and wife without taking measures to show that they wish their connexion to be held in another light were it proved however that the passing for husband and wife was in pursuance of a design concocted beforehand by the parties to serve a separate purpose—say to save the womans reputation—marriage would not be held to have taken place it has to be observed that the cohabitation does not of itself constitute marriage—it is merely held as a proof of its existence—of the parties having consented to be married—ed  it is completely so by english law  supra p     † in the above case by the supposition rapax is the wrongdoer humilis the party injured and conscious of his being so a particular supposition naturally included in that general one

need of such criminal assistance—yet not by the supposition standing in need of it the epithet mendacitypromoting may appear unsuitable to the case but this particular case though naturally is not

that the cause though altogether just may stand in need of an apposite falsehood for the support of it whether such support will be given to it or no depends upon the disposition of humilis upon the proportion between the force with which the mendacityrestraining interests the tutelary sanctions and the force with which his interest in the cause is acting on his mind at that same time and to have

out that they had been seduced by the confederates four men macdaniel berry egan and sulivan after having been in consequence of a special verdict acquitted on an indictment charging them as accessaries to the robbery were tried and convicted on an indictment in which for the designation of the offence the unmeaning appellation of conspiracy was employeda one of them egan being in pursuance of his sentence put into the pillory was murdered by the populace upon the spot another berry died of his wounds whether any real mischief other than the alarmwas done by this confederacy seems after all a matter of doubt in the only case the particulars of which are known the two victims though engaged by a sort of treachery in the commission of the individual offence of which in consequence they were convicted had in pursuance of their own schemes been habitual depredators though for anything that appears in a line somewhat inferior in criminality viz simple theft instead of robbery accompanied with force this being the supposed case the effect of the terror inspired by such practice would be purely salutary rather than otherwise tending to the destruction of confidence among malefactors and thereby to the destruction of that small and destructive portion of society whose destruction is the preservation of the innocent part the malefactors were two of them murdered

subservient to the purpose of illustration— a curious stratagem in the trade of thiefcatching was played off on tuesday at broad noon in the sequestered walk which leads from the end of the canal at

shortly afterward the former fell completely into the trap by embracing what he no doubt conceived to be the fortunate opportunity of helping himself to the sleepers watch who suffered him without interruption to bear off his prize for a dozen yards and then jumping up raised the hue and cry of stop thief which was instantly repeated by his companion and the sweep seized with the watch in his possession they insisted on taking him immediately to bow street and prosecuting him for the robbery but a reputable and resolute gentleman who lives at knightsbridge and who saw the whole transaction interfered and told the captors that if they took the prisoner before a magistrate to prosecute him capitally for the offence into which they had entrapped him he should certainly accompany them and give evidence of their conspiracy upon which they very quietly surrendered their prisoner and marched off—times  st august   0  a state trials x        fosters reports p      0  in this case however the mischief produced in the shape of danger and alarm to the community at large will be apt to be less where the demand had for its ground a claim of indemnification viz on the score of a loss

of causes of all sorts—it calls upon the judge in each instance in which that standard quantity has been exceeded to point out by apposite entries under apposite heads in his view of the matter the cause by which such excess has been necessitated or at any rate produced of the established system of mercantile bookkeeping the object in view is to enable the individual whose transactions it is employed to record to ascertain at any time the balance as between the amount of assets and debts due with the amount of profit or loss from each source for the purpose of raising to its maximum the aggregate of the one and reducing to its minimum the aggregate of the other not to speak of other subordinate objects foreign to the present purpose of a rational and honest system of judicial bookkeeping not to speak here of the uses to individuals in the character of suitors or of the uses to the judge the uses to the legislator would be to enable him to reduce to its minimum the aggregate amount of misdecision and failure of justice on the one hand—of judicial delay expense and vexation on the other and this by indicating in each instance in so far as it is susceptible of indication the maximum and if possible the actual amount of each individual mischief produced on each occasion with the cause so far as it may be discernible of the actually existing system of
