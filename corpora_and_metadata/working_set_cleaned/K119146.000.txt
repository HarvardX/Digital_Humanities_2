letters to particular friends  by william shenstone esquire from the year      to       dublin printed for h saunders w sleater d chamberlain j potts j williams and w colles booksellers mdcclxx  preface though the character of mr shenstone is too well known and his reputation as a writer too firmly established to require any further commendation yet it may perhaps be expected that some apology should be made for this volume of his works containing familiar letters to some of his most intimate friends  to these who may think such an apology requisite it might be sufficient to say that the reception which the former volumes have met with affords the strongest reason to believe that an addition to them would be very acceptable to the public and that the authors talent in epistolary writing appears not to have been inferior to that which distinguishes his other compositions  but it may be objected that whatever their merit may be letters not intended for the public ought not to be published and that an act of this kind is a violation of private friendship  this objection it must be confessed carries with it such an air of delicacy that the persons here concerned are very willing to give it all due attention at the same time they cannot but observe that it will not hold in all cases and therefore must unavoidably be subject to some limitations  that these limitations must vary as the circumstances of cases happen to vary  and that not to make proper allowances for such circumstances is highly unreasonable  injurious to many who have deserved well of the public by this very conduct and detrimental to the interests of literature it might perhaps be difficult and is by no means necessary to enumerate these several limitations it will be sufficient in this place to say that where neither the reputation of the writer nor that of any other person is injured there the force of the objection evidently ceases and it is not only believed on the most mature deliberation that this is the case in the present instance but moreover that the there are positive good reasons in its favor respecting as well the writers character in this species of composition as the satisfaction and entertainment of the reader  the encouragement which has been usually given to works of this nature might seem to make these observations unnecessary but it was not thought sufficient barely to shelter this publication under the sanction of such an authority as it is well known that the wantonness of curiosity has sometimes encouraged design by no means justifiable  and it is as readily acknowledged that the following letters are deficient in many particulars requisite to excite that curiosity being neither written on popular subjects nor addressed to persons of rank and eminence in the world they will not fail however to afford an agreeable entertainment to such as can relish an animated display of the various efforts of a fine imagination for a length of years whether amusing itself with rural embellishments or occupied in other pleasures of learned retirement and a warm disinterested friendship such are the subjects of the following letters and if any person should still retain a doubt concerning the propriety of perpetuating them in this manner he shall be finally referred to the writers own authority who in a letter dated october         thus expresses himself  i confess to you that i am considerably mortified by mr w  s conduct in regard to those letters meaning his own letters to that gentlemans brother and rather than they should have been so unnecessarily destroyed would have given more money than it is allowable for me to mention with decency i look upon my letters as some of my chefdaeuvres and could i be supposed to have the smallest pretensions to propriety of style or sentiment i should imagine it must appear principally in my letters to his brother and one or two more friends i consider them as the records of a friendship that will be always dear to me and as the history of my mind for these twenty years past when it is considered how seldom so valuable a collection of real correspondence is to be met with and how difficult it is to supply the want of it by a fictitious one it cannot be doubted that the public will be pleased to see the loss here complained of so well repaired and to be furnished with such genuine examples of the authors style and sentiments together with an authentic history of his mind for so long a space of time  to conclude the talents of this author on whatever subject they were exercised were so uncommon and the fame of his little ferme ornee under the conduct of a taste entirely original was become so considerable that every specimen of the one and every anecdote relative to the improvement of the other seemed too interesting to be buried in oblivion at least they were thought so by those to whom the greater part of this collection is addressed  persons indeed confessedly partial to the writers talents and interested in his commendations but at the same time persons neither so regardless of their friends reputation nor their own as to have hazarded either without the strongest persuasion that their partiality had not imposed upon their judgment and that it was no indecent ostentation in them by this public act to testify that they esteemed it not only a peculiar felicity in their fortunes but likewise some degree of credit to have enjoyed the pleasures of such a friendship throughout so considerable a period of human life

song and the authors sentiments on musical composition      dear sir as my head is considerably more confused than usual by reason of a bad cold i shall aim no higher in this letter than at bare recitative reserving all my airs for a season when my mind is more in tune such i hope will be the time which you set apart to attend the chief musician at birmingham i thoroughly design to lend an ear to his performance on condition he will not refuse one to a proposal i intend to make of having one day or other a merry strain at the leasows but if you have any penchant to see the face of your humble servant at birmingham your most effectual way will be to inform him when these solemn nuptials betwixt tweedledum and tweedledee are to be consummated i will certes not be absent at the throwing of the stocking any more than parson evans in shakespeare would be absence at the grace i have sent a song not that i am sure i have not sent it before but that if you can see any joke that it contains the forementioned gentleman may be asked to translate it into music when i use this expression you will peradventure look upon it as my opinion that in musical compositions sound ought as much to answer sense as one language does another insomuch that such and such thoughts ought to bring into our heads such and such sounds and vice versa but in case there is no sense and no thought the more languages a sentence is translated into the more it is exposed and in case it be the misfortune of my little piece to have neither i beg that mr marriett may not inform any body what it signifies in music as a farther proof of the confused state of my intellects you see almost at the end of my letter my thanks for the packet etc which ought to have been placed in the very front of it in order to express in some degree the sense i have of your favors i long to see you and am dear sir  your most obedient and faithful servant w shenstone  song when bright ophelia treads the green in all the pride of dress and mien averse to freedom mirth and play the lofty rival of the day methinks to my enchanted eye the lilies droop the roses die but when disdaining art the fair assumes a soft engaging air mild as the opening morn of may and as the feathered warblers gay the scene improves wherever she goes more sweetly smile the pink and rose o lovely maid propitious hear nor think thy damon insincere pity my wild delusive flame for though the flowers are still the same to me they languish or improve and plainly tell me that i love ii to the same in the manner of pamela      well and so i sat me down in my room and was reading pamela  one might furnish this book with several pretty decorations thought i to myself and then i began to design cuts for it in particular places for instance one where pamela is forced to fall upon her knees in the arbor a second where she is in bed and mrs jewkes holds one hand and mr b the other a third where pamela sits sewing in the summer house etc so i just sketched them out and sent my little hints such as they were to mr r  n as soon as i had sealed my letter in comes mrs arnold his housekeeper of whom very respectful mention is made in the course of this correspondence  well mrs arnold says i this mr jago never comes  what can one do i am as dull as a beetle for want of company sir says she the hen  what makes you out of breath says i mrs arnold what is the matter  why sir says she the hen i set last sabbathdaywasthreeweeks has just hatched and has brought out all her eggs to good  that is brave indeed says i ay that it is says she so be andt please g  d an how that they liven therell be a glorious parcel of em shall i bring em up for you to see says she no thank ye mrs arnold says i but arent ye in some apprehensions from the kite mrs arnold  no sir says she i hope there is no danger i takes pretty good care of em i dont question your care says i for youre seldom without a duck or a chicken about you  poor pretty creters says she look here master this has gotten a speck of black upon her tail  ay i thought you wernt without one about you says i i dont think says i mrs arnold but your soul was designed for a hen originally why and if i had been a hen says she i believe i should have done as much for my chickens as yonder great blackandwhite hen does though i say it that should not say it says she ay that you would thought i well but now when jago comes have you got ever a chicken that is fit to kill no says she i doubt there is neeraone well says i mrs arnold you and your chicken may go down i am going to write a letter so i sat down and wrote thus far scrattle scrattle goes the pen  why how now says i  whats the matter with the pen so i thought i would make an end of my letter because my pen went scratle scrattle well i warrant i shall have little plea sure when mr jago comes for i never fixed my heart upon any thing in my life but some misfortune happened to balance my pleasure  after all thought i it must be some very ill accident that outweighs the pleasure i shall take in seeing him  w shenstone leasows july    iii to a friend too ceremoniously declining to purchase a horse for him      sir i cannot avoid imagining the first part of your letter was mere raillery i am sure it gave me a good deal of pleasure for i can bear very well to hear my foibles exposed though not my faults and on that account must needs make grateful mention of it i acknowledge the oddness of the letter which occasioned it and could not expect that such an illformed application could have produced an answer so very oratorical in the first place you lay open the subject or indeed what you call the offices in which i am pleased to employ you in the next you allege your own inability to enter upon matters of such great concernment that this is rhetorical nay pure rhetoric i gather from the exordiums of all the declamations that i ever heard in my life it is moreover not uncommon with declaimers to give some reasons why they should not absolutely decline the subject though they are sensible of their insufficiency otherwise they might be expected to sit down and hold their tongues and this is what you have done by saying that you are unwilling to dissent from the world in regard to the subjects you are engaged in that you therefore chose to steer a middle course by that means avoiding the imputation of presumption on the one hand and indifference on the other when this is done you enter gravely upon the subject and to give it a greater perspicuity divide it into two parts the first part happens to be concerning the purchase of an horse on this occasion you inform me that i am in a good country for horses and secondly that i have a number of acquaintance round about me who are very well skilled in the nature of them now each of these informations seems at first sight to mean no more than what i have better opportunities of knowing than the person who informs me and on this account to err in point of superfluity but upon second thoughts they have this force to speak like a grammarian namely that i am entirely negligent of my own affairs and secondly that i care not whom i give trouble to if i can but avoid it myself so that the sentences have really a beauty when one searches beneath their superficies after you have said this and more which includes all that can be said upon the subject you descend to the second division in relation to which i am too grateful to be otherwise than serius in my acknowledgments  i had not expatiated thus far but to show that i am not insensible of a sneer nor should i expatiate any farther but to prove that i am equally sensible of a favor  i desire you would believe that i absolutely assent to your critique that some of your sentiments were my own before i communicated the verses and others as soon as you had favored me with the discovery of them that i would per praesentes return my thanks for them which you might justly have claimed whether i had approved them or not one exception to this approbation my modesty bids me mention on account of your too great partiality in my favor my gratitude you are entitled to without exception or limitation  it will perhaps gratify your curiosity to know that mr g has a copy of verses in the last magazine entitled the little cur there are several strokes that are picturesque and humorous i believe it was done in haste the motto is exquisite and much more properly applied by mr g than the emperor adrian in my opinion notwithstanding all that pope says tell me your judgment of mr l  ns in the same paper the epigram to one who refused to walk in the park etc is a good one  i have waved sending the verses to mr somervile at present because i hope to see you soon either at the leasows or at birmingham i cannot tell whether i shall have time to enclose in this letter my ballad if i do consider it only as some words that i choose to make use of to some notes of which i am more than ordinarily fond the tune come and listen to my ditty etc the words sounded upon a true history of queen elizabeth who looking from a castle wherein she was a prisoner and seeing a country milkmaid singing expressed great envy at the girls condition and dissatisfaction with regard to her own  it is as much designed for my own singing in private i mean as ever was a bottle of cherrybrandy for an old womans drinking now i think of it i really believe that i every day approach nearer and nearer to the capacity the way the insignificancy of an old woman mrs arnold has certainly by her charms her incantations and her conversations together contributed a good deal to this transformation pray come over if you can and try to reinstate me in my right mind in proportion to the soundness of which i shall be more and more  your friend and servant w s  iv to the same from town      dear sir i return you my thanks most heartily for the poetical resentment which you have shown against my censurers the riddlemasters i have sent mr somerviles verses and yours to cave though i am ashamed to own i neglected it so long that i fear he will have no room for them this month if you can extirpate false wit in a manner you will do no small service to the true you do no small honor to it whether you extirpate the other or not  you have heard of the motion have heard probably all that i can tell you of it that it was illconcerted that it has done the opposition great disservice that the king is now confirmed in the opinion of sir roberts honesty that the younger mr pitts speech was the most admired on the opposite side and sir r  ts on the court side that they did not leave the house till five in the morning that sir r  t and p  y are so violent that the sp  r is continually calling them to order finally that the affair has occasioned this print which i address to your curiosity merely though the lines upon the bishop are humourous enough  now i mention curiosity do you take notice of the many quaint contrivances made use of to catch peoples ntural inquisitiveness in the pamphlets viz are these things so  yes they are  what then  the devil of a story  hoy boys  up go we  and a thousand others what do you think must be my expense who love to pry into every thing of this kind why truly one shilling my company goes to georges coffeehouse where for that small subscription i read all pamphlets under a threeshilling dimensions and indeed any larger ones would not be fit for coffeehouse perusal  lord dudley lent me two sermons given him at the house of lords which i read last night in the first there are a great many deep animadversions delivered in a style that is tolerable in the other there is as great a want of common english as there is plenty of common observations have you seen the sermons on the martyrdom and on the fast day if you read either send for the first you will find me degenerate from a gentle bard into a snarling critic if my poem does not please you will say i am no very candid one at present but let its fate be what it will i shall lay no small stress upon the opinion of some that have approved it as it is at present in keeping it discovers no uncommon impudence and runs no very great risque but who can answer for it when it has the gracelessness to come upon the town  ora pro nobis must soon be my motto it virtues and faults will then be incapable of addition or diminution and the pious assistance of friends must  but i am no roman catholic  the intrinsic merit of a book when it is printed as well as the past life and conversation of a man that is departed must damn or give it immortality  i mean to a certain degree  i scrible what comes uppermost and desire you would do the same  yours w s  v to a friend from london describing his temper and manner of living there from mr wintles perfumer near temple bar etc  th feb    0 dear sir i am now with regard to the town pretty much in the same state in which i expect to be always with regard to the world sometimes exclaiming and railing against it sometimes giving it a good word and even admiring it a sunshiny day a tavernsupper after a play well acted and now and then an invigorating breath of air in the mall never fail of producing a cheerful effect i dont know whether i gave you any account of quins acting falstaff in my former letter i really imagined that i saw you littering on one side me shaking your sides and sometimes scarce containing yourself you will pardon the attitude in which i placed you since at was what seemed natural at that circumstance of time comus i have once been at for the sake of the songs though i detest it in any light but as a dramatic piece the taking of it seems a prodigy yet indeed suchaone as was pretty tolerably accounted for by a gentleman who sat by me in the boxes this learned sage being asked how he liked the play made answer he could not tell  pretty well he thought  or indeed as well as any other play  he always took it that people only came there to see and to be seen  for as for what was said he owned he never understood any thing of the matter i told him i thought a great many of its admirers were in his case if they would but own it  on the other hand it is amazing to consider to what an universality of learning people make pretensions here there is not a drawer a chair or hackney coachman but is politician poet and judge of polite literature chimneysweepers damn the convention and blackshoeboys cry up the genius of shakespeare the danger of writing verse is a very good thing if you have not read it i would recommend it to you as poetical but now i talk of learning i must not omit an interview which i accidentally had the other night in company with lord d  and one mr c  we were taken to sup at a private house where i found a person whom i had never seen before the man behaved exceeding modestly and well till growing a little merry over a bottle and being a little countenanced by the subject we were upon he pulls out of his pocket about half a dozen ballads and distributes them amongst the company i not finding at first they were of his own composition read one over and finding it a dull piece of stuff contented myself with observing that it was exceedingly well printed but to see the mans face on this occasion would make you pity the circumstance of an author as long as you live his jollity ceased as a flame would do should you pour water upon it and i believe for about five minutes he spoke not a syllable at length recovering himself he began to talk about his countryseat about houghton hall and soon after desired a health imagining as i found afterward that lord d  would have given sir roberts but he did not naming sir t  l  mine which followed was that of mr l  now who do you think this should be but honest ralph freeman at least the writer of the paper so subscribed your fathers old friend and intimate sir roberts right hand a person that lives elegantly drives six of the best horses in town and plays on st johns organ you know mr l  is not only sir roberts greatest enemy but the gazetteers proper antagonist we were invited to see him very civilly and indeed the man behaved with the utmost good humor without arrogance or any attempts at wit which probably would not have been very successful ask your father what he would say to me if i should join in the cause with his old friend and take a good annuity under sir robert which i believe i might have and little encouragement god knows have i met with on the other side of the question i say i believe i might have because i know a certain person gives pensions of three pound a week to porters and the most illiterate stupid fellows you can imagine to talk in his behalf at alehouses where they fit so long a time and are as regularly relieved as one centry relieves another at least tell him that i expect in his answer to my letter which i shall not allow him to assign to you he write something to confirm me in my integrity and to make me prefer him and you and honesty to lace brocade and the smiles of the ladies et veneri and cunis and plumis sardanapali but i hope to keep my hercules in view whether in print or manuscript and though i am as fond of pleasure as most people yet i shall observe the rule positam sic tangere noli  i desire i may hear from you next post i have a line or two which i intend for the sons of utter darkness as you call them next magazine i would send them to you for your advice but cannot readily find them i like every thing in mr somerviles but the running of the last line i think to insert them should be glad to have a line or two of yours that one may make a bold attack i look on it as fun without the least emotion i assure you  i am dear sir your faithful scribbling slave w shenstone  vi to the same at bath on his publishing his poem of the judgment of hercules from mr wintles april  0    0 my good friend i heartily thank you for the service your letter did me and a considerable service no doubt it is to raise the spirits of a person so habitually dispirited as i have been for some time for this and all former favors as the sullen fellow says in shakespeare i thank you i am not of many words but i thank you  i beg you would cease to apologize for your letters in the first place it will lay me under a necessity of doing so and in the next place you may be assured that no friendly letter of yours will ever be otherwise than infinitely agreeable to me  i sent a letter to mr marriett at bath to be left with you at your former place of residence you will be so kind as to give it to him  if i wish for a large fortune it is rather for the sake of my friends than myself or to compromise the matter with those moralists who argue for the universality of selfinterest it is to gratify myself in the company and in the gratifications of my friends  dr ratcliff has sent me a letter which gives me much satisfaction in respect of my poem notwithstanding he cannot forbear adding that he expects to hear since my pen has so well adorned the fable that my conduct will with equal propriety and elegance illustrate the moral however the simple approbation of a sincere man affects one more than plinys panegyric could do from a more courtly one  there are several errors of the press which neither sagacity nor vigilance itself i now see can prevent and which i beg you to correct with your pen in a copy which i must get you to present to c  l  together with the enclosed letter please to be at the expense of having it stitched in purple paper and gilt at the edges and i will repay you  i was loitering yesterday in the coffeeroom when two persons came in welldressed and called for my poem read a page or two and commended the four lines upon mr l  extremely loved by that prince etc repeated them forty times and in the end got them by heart mentioned them to a third person who said he knew of no virtue that the prince was fired with and then endeavored to mimic the princes way of talking but says he i will show the four best lines in the poem and then proceeded to it was youths perplexing stage etc which are flat enough god knows  but to my first heroes one of them reads when great alcides to a grove retired ay ay you know mr l  did retire he was in the secession read on you will find he mentions delia anon dont you remember mr l  wrote a song upon delia but proceed  you will find he is going to give a description of two ladies of different characters that were in love with mr l  one was here he named two names which i have forgot upon my word it is fine i believe it is popes  but how comes pope to praise himself there loved by that bard etc no doubt however it was written by mr pope or mr d   my critics proceeded to the reading of the last simile immediately without the lines preceding it and agreeing that it was a very good thing called out for the economy of love so you see laudant illa sed ista legunt is the case a person cannot be supposed vain from the approbation of such critics or else i would not have inserted such a commendatory paragraph i never enquire how my poem takes and am afraid to do so  however i find some do allow it to be mallets  i am impatient till i hear from you i shall be here till this day fortnight afterward at the leasows  i must add this ne studio nostri pecces but at the same time also  o defend against your judgment your most faithful friend   w s these opposite petitions delineate my state of mind it is well for me that i have you at bath    vii to mr jago on the death of his father leasows aug       0 dear mr jago i find some difficulty in writing to you on this melancholy occasion no one can be more unfit to attempt to lessen your grief than myself because no one has a deeper sense of the cause of your affliction though i would by no means be numbered by you amongst the common herd of your acquaintance that tell you they are sorry yet it were impertinent in me to mention a mere friends concern to a person interested by so many more tender regards beside i should be glad to alleviate your sorrow and such fort of condolence tends but little to promote that end i do not choose to flatter you neither could i more especially at this time but though i could perhaps find enough to say to persons of less sense than you i know of nothing but what your own reason must have suggested concern indeed may have suspended the power of that faculty and upon that pretense i have a few things that i would suggest to you after all it is time alone that can and will cure all afflictions but such as are the consequence of vice and yours i am sure proceeds from a contrary principle  i heard accidentally of this sorrowful event and accompanied you to london with the umost concern i wished it was in my power to mitigate your griefs by sharing them as i have often found it in yours to augment my pleasures by so doing  all that i can recommend to you is not to confine your eye to any single event in life but to take in your whole circumstances before you repine  when you reflect that you have lost one of the best of men in a father you ought to comfort yourself that you had such a father to whom i cannot forbear applying these lines from milton  since to part go heavenly guest ethereal messenger sent by whose sovereign goodness we adore gentle to me and affable has been thy condescension and shall be honored ever with gratefulst memory  end of book viii par lost  i would have you by all means come over hither as soon as you can  i will endeavor to render the time you spend here as satisfactory as it is in my power and i hope you will ever look upon me as your hearty friend through all the vissitudes of life  pray give my humble service to mrs jago and your brother  i am with the utmost affection yours sincerely w shenstone  viii to mr reynolds leasows    0 dear sir wonderful were the dangers and difficulties through which i went the night i left you at barels which i looked upon as ordained by fate for the temporal punishment of obstinacy it was very kind and in character for you to endeavor to deter me from the ways of darkness but having a sort of penchant for needless difficulties i have an undoubted right to indulge myself in them so long as i do not insist upon any ones pity it is true these ought not to exceed a certain degree they should be lenia tormenta and i must own the labors i underwent that night did not come within the bounds which my imagination had prescribed i cannot forbear mentioning one imminent danger  i rode along a considerable piece of water covered so close with trees that it was as probable i might have pursued the channel which was dangerous as my way out of it or to put my case in a more poetical light having by night intruded upon an amor betwixt a woodnymph and a rivergod i owed my escape to fortune who conveyed me from the vengeance which they might have taken i put up finally at a little alehouse about ten oclock and lay all night awake counting the cords which supported me which i could more safely swear to than to either bed or blanket for farther particulars see my epistle to the pastor fido of lapworth  mr graves says he should be glad to show you any civilities in his power upon his own acquaintance and will serve you as far as his vote goes upon my recommendation but is afraid without the concurrence of some more considerable friends your chance will be but small this year etc if the former part of this news gives you any pleasure i assure you it gives me no less to communicate it and this pleasure proceeds from a principle which would induce me to serve you myself if it should ever be in my power  i saw mr lyttleton last week he is a candidate for the county of worcester together with lord deerhurst i hope mr somervile will do him the honor to appear as his friend which he must at least think second to that of succeeding  i hear you are commenced chaplain since i saw you i wish you joy of it the chaplains title is infinitely more agreeable than his office and i hope the scarf which is expressive of it will be no diminutive thing no fourpennyhalfpenny piece of ribboning but that it will high over the neck its rustling folds display disdain all usual bounds extend its sway usurp the head and push the wig away   i hope it will prove ominous that my first letter is a congratulatory one and if i were to have opportunities of sending all such it would entirely quadrate with the sincere wishes of  your faithful humble servant w shenstone i beg my compliments to mr somervile mrs knight and your family  leasows aug    0   ix to the same from mr wintles perfumer at the kings arms by temple bar fleet street    0 sir i am heartily obliged to mr somervile that he will make use of any means to serve me more especially that he will take the trouble of consulting which may be most effectual to that end and i desire you would represent these sentiments to him in the most expressive manner  i have since i arrived here which was last saturday night heard low sing and seen cibber act the laureat spoke an epilogue made upon and i suppose by himself in which he does not only make a bare confession but an ostentation of all his follies of such says he whoever demands a bill of fare may look into my life  he will find em there or some such lines i cannot accurately recollect them i do not wonder he pleased extremely but to a considering man there is something strangely disagreeable to hear a scandalous life recommended by one of his age and as much satisfaction shown in the review of it as if it had been a perfect galaxy of virtues an athenian audience would have shown their different sentiments on this occasion but i am acting the part of jeremy collier and indeed in some degree of an hypocrite for i confess i was highly pleased with him myself i have nothing to add but a fine close if i had it as i have not you must be content with the vulgar one that i am  yours sincerely w shenstone  x to the same dear sir i thank you for the favor of your last letter particularly your readiness in transmitting to me any thing of mr somerviles it so fell out that mr outing delivered to me the verses and i had the pleasure of reading them about a moment before he gave me your epistle  the town expected something of importance namely a motion for a committee of enquiry into late measures would be moved for to day if any thing of this nature has been carried on i will add an account of it before i close my letter in the mean time it is i believe very credible that lord orford has a continued influence over the king and that the duke of argyle is sufficiently disgusted to have talked of the resignation of his posts again  an odd story enough the following and i believe true somebody that had just learnt that hor w s gentlemans name was jackson writes a letter to mr floyer keeper of the tower intimating his masters desire to speak with him floyer dresses the next morning and waits upon h  e comes into his room  sir says horace i really dont know you   sir my name is floyer   ay by g  d that may be i dont know you for all that   sir says he i am keeper of the tower   g  d damn your blood says h  e produce your warrant  damn you produce your warrant or by g  d i will kick ye down stairs    frighted at these threats the gentleman retired and in his way home had leisure to consider the joke that was put upon him and more particularly turned upon the person to whom he was sent  if you direct a line to mr shuckburghs bookseller in fleet street it will arrive agreeable to  your humble servant w shenstone march tuesday night my compliments to your patron    xi to the same    0 sir your last letter gave me a good deal of uneasiness in rgard to mr somerviles indisposition i hope if he is better you will omit no opportunity of gratifying me with the news of it i shall be glad to employ you and mr jago in my little rivulet before winter comes when one must bid adieu to rural beauties those charming scenes which the poets in order to render them more complete have furnished with ladies must be stripped of all their ornaments those incomparable nymphs the dryads and the nereids which have been my constant companions this short summer will vanish to more pleasing climes and i must be left to seek my assistance in real beauties instead of imaginary ones in short i am thinking to live part of this winter in worcester or some other town i was at a concert there a very full one lately i observed dr mackenzie talking to mr lyttleton and i hope on that account he is in his interest otherwise mr somervile would do mr lyttleton great service by engaging him  mr lyttleton took occasion to mention to me the obligation he lay under to mr somervile for his letter as well as his other designs in his favor  that he had long received great pleasure from that gentlemans pen and wished for the honor of his acquaintance i told him i believed the satisfaction would be mutual or to that purpose he added that the chase was an extremely beautiful poem the best by far ever written on the subject but now the fiddles squeaked the harpsichord jingled and the performers began to feel the divine enthusiasm the god of music invaded them as he did the sibyll of old deus ecce deus cui talia fanti ante fores subito non vultus non color unus non comptae mansere comae sed pectus anhelum et rabie fera corda tument majorque videri nec mortale sonans   i am sir with all due compliments to mr somervile  yours sincerely w shenstone  xii to mr jago from london with observations on the stage etc jan         sir you see i am extremely expeditious in answering your letter the reason of which is a very powerful one namely the information which i received last night that it would be agreeable to you i should do so please therefore to set aside the sum of eighteen pence or thereabouts for letters which you will receive whilst i am in london and to make it seem the less profusely squandered consider it amongst any other casual expenses which you carelessly submit to merely to gratify your curiosity  i went the other night with the greatest expectations to see the merry wives of windsor performed at covent garden it is impossible to express how much every thing fell below my ideas but i have considered since and i find that my expectations were really more unjust than their manner of acting persons in order to act well should have something of the authors fire as well as a polite education and what makes this the clearer to me is that you hear ten plays well read by gentlemen in company to one that you find well performed upon the stage  nothing can be more ignorant or affected than the scornful airs which some people give themselves at a country play because forsooth they have seen plays in town the truth is the chief advantage of plays in town lies entirely in the scenery you seldom observe a set of strollers without one or two actors who are quite equal to their parts and i really know of no good one at either of the two theaters royal except cibber who rarely acts and mrs olive i will add one more in compliance with my own taste merely and that is mr neal a fellow who by playing the fool has gained my particular esteem  after the play we had an entertainment  falsely so called it was that of orpheus and eurydice the most unmusical thing i ever heard and which lasted i believe three hours with some intermixtures of harlequin both so dull and yet heard with patience that i was amazed astonished confounded but really a man of sense ought not to be so because they were not calculated for him  i want you here extremely  pray come up for a week i suppose you will not so i will not argue superfluously however write soon and believe that your letters are the most agreeable things in the world to sir  yours most faithfully w s  xiii to the same      dear sir as i have no sort of library in town i find several minutes upon my hands for which if i employ them in scribbling to my friends they are but slenderly obliged to me i hope no friend of mine will ever be induced by my example to do any thing but avoid it i believe no one breathing can say with more truth video meliora etc it is not from a spirit of jealousy that i would advise my acquaintance to seek happiness in the regular path of a fixed life but though i very highly approve of it and envy it my particular turn of mind would be as little satisfied with it as it is like to be a different one yet however i complain i must own i have a good deal reconciled myself to this mixture of gratification and disappointment which must be my lot till the last totally prevails  yet after all to tell you the truth i am not pleased with being advised to retire i was saying the other day to mr outing that i had been ambitious more than i was at present and that i grew less so every day upon this he chimed in with me and approved my despondency saying that he also had been ambitious but found it would not do do you think i liked him much for this  no  i wheeled about and said i did not think with him for i should always find myself whetted by disappointments and more violent in proportion to the intricacy of the game i spent a night with him and mr meredith and with him and mr dean in the latter party he had laid his hand upon his sword six times and threatened to put a dozen men to death one of which was broughton the prizefighter  mr whistlers company seldom relieves me on an evening and i go to plays but seldom because i intend no more to give countenance to the pit  i have got a belt which distinguishes me as much as a garter  it captivates the eyes of all beholders and binds their understanding in golden bandage  i heard a pedant punning upon the word  and a wag whispering that i was related to beltishazzar in short i may say from the dragon of wantley no girdle nor belt ever excelled it it frightens the men in a minute no maiden yet ever beheld it but wished herself tied to me in it   the dunciad is doubtless mr popes dotage  slat in the whole and including with severable tolerable lines a number of weak obscure and even punning ones what is now read by the whole world and the whole worlds wife is mr herveys letter to sir t hanmer i own my taste is gratified in it as well as that unluckiness natural to every one though people say i think idly he is mad for this long letter i shall expect two soon after you have received it adieu  did you see a poem called woman in miniature written with spirit but incorrect the people that were carrying lord orford in effigy to behead him on tower hill came into the box where he was accidentally at georges to beg money of him amongst others  xiv to mr  on his taking orders in the church leasows june        dear sir i write to you out of the abundant inclination i have to hear from you imagining that as you gave me a direction you might possibly expect to receive a previous letter from me i want to be informed of the impressions you receive from your new circumstances the chief aversion which some people have to orders is what i fancy you will remove in such as you converse with i take it to be owing partly to dress and partly to the avowed profession of religion a young clergyman that has distinguished his genius by a composition or two of a polite nature and is capable of dressing himself and his religion in a different manner from the generality of his profession that is without formality is certainly a genteel character i speak this not with any sly design to advise but to intimate that i think you very capable of shining in a darkcolored coat  you must consider me yet as a man of the world and endeavoring to elicit that pleasure from gaiety which my reason tells me i shall never find  it is impossible to express how stupid i have been ever since i came home insomuch that i cannot write a common letter without six repetitions this is the third time i have begun yours and you see what stuff it is made up of i must even hasten to matter of fact which is the comfortable resource of dull people  though even as to that i have nothing to communicate but i would be glad to know whether you are under a necessity of residing on weekdays and if not why i may not expect you a day or two at the leasows very soon  did you make any enquiry concerning the number of my poems sold at oxford or did you hear any thing concerning it that concerns me to hear  will s  for that is his true name is the excess of simplicity and goodnature he seems to have all the industry imaginable to divert and amuse people without any ambitious ends to serve or almost any concern whether he has so much as a laugh allowed to his stories any farther than as a laugh is an indication that people are delighted this joined with his turn of thought renders him quite agreeable i wish it were in my power to conciliate acquaintance with half his case  pray do not delay writing to me adieu  w shenstone  xv to mr graves on similar taste and manners the leasows sept         dear sir i was very agreeably entertained by your last letter as indeed i am by every one of yours it were affectation to except a paragraph or two on account of partiality where to say the truth the partiality itself pleases one  this i am very positive of that to have a friend of your temper and taste will always give me pleasure whether i please the world or no but to please ever so much without some such friendship would in all probability signify but little i shall therefore value any means that tend to confirm my opinion of your esteem for me preferably to any that show me i am merely deserving of it after all though a very limited number of friends may be sufficient an idle person should have a large acquaintance and i believe i have the least of any one that ever rambled about so much as i have done i do not know how it is but i absolutely despair of ever being introduced into the world it may be objected by some but you will not object it that i may be acquainted with a sufficient number of people that are my equals if i will they may be my equals and superiors whom they mean for aught i care but their conversation gives me no more pleasure than the canking of a goose or the quacking of a duck in affluent circumstances rather less indeed of the two because the idea of the sat goose flatters ones appetite but the human goose is neither fit to be heard nor eaten i wish indeed to be shown into good company but if i can at all distinguish the nature of my inclinations it is more in hopes of meeting with a refined conversation than any thing else i do not at all insist that my genius is better than that of my vociferous neighbors if it be different it is a sufficient reason why i should seek such companions as suit it and whether they are found in high or low life is little to the purpose but you will perhaps discern the operations of vanity in all my endeavors i will not disagree with you provided you will allow amusement an equal share in them it is the vanity to be intimate with men of distinguished sense not of distinguished fortune and this is a vanity which you should not disapprove because it will bind me a lasting friend to you and your family  i have been over at shiffnall and in order to make myself agreeable rode a hunting with mr pit i confess i was somewhat diverted and my horse was so much an enthusiast as to be very near running headlong into a deep water i believe if i were to turn sportsman i should soon break my neck for fear the huntsman should despise me  i will certainly endeavor to see you at birmingham but beg you would write me a long letter in the mean time and contrive if you can to make it look like a packet as your last did for the sight thereof is exceedingly comfortable  though my wishes will not suffer me to believe that your eyes are in the danger you represent yet supposing them to be only very weak i would recommend some musical instrument that is most agreeable to you i have often looked upon music as my dernier resort if i should ever discard the world and turn eremite entirely consider what other amusement can make an equal impression in old age  i have filled my paper not without difficulty through the barrenness of my brain and situation my heart ever slows with the most warm streams of gratitude and affection for you adieu  w shenstone  xvi to a friend expressing his dissatisfaction at the manner of life in which he is engaged      dear sir i wonder i have not heard from you lately  of you indeed i have from mr w  if you could come over probably i might go back with you for a day or two for my horse i think gets rather better and may with indulgence perform such a journey i want to advise with you about several matters  to have your opinion about a building that i have built and about a journey which i design to bath and about numberless things which as they are numberless cannot be comprehended in this paper i am  your most affectionate friend w shenstone now i am come home from a visit  every little uneasiness is sufficient to introduce my whole train of melancholy considerations and to make me utterly dissatisfied with the life i now lead and the life which i foresee i shall lead i am angry and envious and dejected and frantic and disregard all present things just as becomes a madman to do i am infinitely pleased though it is a gloomy joy with the application of dr swifts complaint that he is forced to die in a rage like a poisoned rat in a hole my soul is no more suited to the figure i make than a cable rope to a cambrick needle  i cannot bear to see the advantages alienated which i think i could deserve and relish so much more than those that have them  nothing can give me patience but the soothing sympathy of a friend and that will only turn my rage into simple melancholy  i believe soon i shall bear to see nobody i do hate all hereabouts already except one or two i will have my dinner brought upon my table in my absence and the plates fetched away in my absence and nobody shall see me for i can never bear to appear in the same stupid mediocrity for years together and gain no ground as mr g  complained to me and i think you too both unjustly i am no character  i have in my temper some rakishness but it is checked by want of spirits some solidity but it is softened by vanity some esteem of learning but it is broke in upon by laziness imagination and want of memory etc  i could reckon up twenty things throughout my whole circumstances wherein i am thus tantalized your fancy will present them  not that all i say here will signify to you i am only under a fit of dissatisfaction and to grumble does me good  only excuse me that i cure myself at your expense adieu    xvii to the same      dear sir you must give me leave to complain of your last letter three parts of which is filled with mere apology i thought we had some time agreed for our mutual emolument to lay aside ceremonies of this species till i was made poetlaureat and you bishop of winchester  why bishop of winchester for gods sake why  because  he is prelate of the garter  an order in all kinds of ceremony so greatly abounding  here am i still trifling away my time my money and i think my health which i fancy greatly inferior to what it it would be in the country truth is i do make shift to vary my days a little here and calling to mind the many irksome hours the stupid identity of which i have been so often sick in the country i conclude that i am less unhappy than i shall find myself at home  however next month i hope to see the leasows with an appetite  walks in the park are now delightfully pleasant the company stays in the mall till ten every night  mrs olive mrs woffington barbarini and mr garrick happy man are gone over to ireland to act there for two months  mr outing the last time i saw him told me how dr mackenzie cured him of ever fighting with scrubs i was just going says he to kick a fellow down stairs when the doctor cries out mr outing hear our scotch proverb before you proceed any farther  he that wrestles with a t  d whether he get or lose the victory is sure to be b  t i had great difficulty continued he to contain myself till he had finished his story but i found it so pat that it saved the fellows neck i wish i could cure him as easily of these quixotical narrations  i know no soul in town that has any taste which occasions me the spleen frequently i remember w  and i were observing that no creatures though ever so loathsome as toads serpents adders etc would be half so hated as ourselves if we were to give vent to our spleen and censure affections so bluntly as some people do i would not venture this hint if i did not believe you experience the same for my part people contradict me in things i have studied and am certain of and i keep silence even from good words  bons mots though it is pain and grief to me i must give up my knowledge to pretense or vent it with diffidence to fools or there is no peace these these are justifiable motives to wish for some degree of same that blind people may not bully a man that has his eyesight into their opinion that green is red etc deference from fools is no inviduous ambition i dare own to you that i have this and i will contend that i have no more haughty one  this subject i could expatiate upon with pleasure but i stop a tasteless fellow has spoiled my mallwalk tonight and occasioned you some trouble in these dull observations  i am  yours affectionately w shenstone  xviii to mr  from the leasows the leasows june   th      dear sir if a friend of yours who lived in the farthest part of china were to send you a pinch of snuff wrapped up in a sheet of writingpaper i conceive the snuff would improve in value as it traveled and gratify your curiosity extremely by the time it reached your fingers ends  very true  you will say  why then that very consideration was my inducement to write to you at this time and that sort of progressional value is what you are to place upon my letter for be assured i am not ignorant how much this my letter does resemble a pinch of snuff in point of significancy and that both the one and the other are what you may as well do without  my letter is as follows  you must know in rainy weather i always soothe my melancholy with the remembrance of distant friends only you cannot easily conceive the high value i place upon their good qualities at such a time so that at this very instant i am impatient to see you tomorrow if the sun shines bright i shall only wish for your company as for a very great good if you are unemployed when you leave bath i should think you might stay some time with me this summer refined sense is what one is apt to value ones self upon but really unless one has a refined soul or two to converse with it is an inconvenience i have ruined my happiness by conversing with you and a few more friends as falstaff says to hal company witty company has been the ruin of me before i knew that pleasure i was as contented as could be in my solitude and now the absence of entertainment is a positive pain to me london has amused me a while with diversions but now they are past and i have neither any one about me that has the least delicatesse or that i can inspire with the ambition of having any  w  w  comes in a dirty shirt and an old coat without a stock to pay me a visit he pulled out a pair of scissars and giving them an intricate turn over his two thumbs said that he could do that and i could make a poem some for one thing some for another hic nigri succos loliginis haec est aerugo mera it was splenetic weather too  the man is cursed who writes verses and lives in the country  if his celestial part inspires him to converse with juno his terestrial one necessitates him to to stoop to his landlady so that he is in as disagreeable a situation as if one person were to pull him upwards by the head and another downwards by the tail  do you never find any thing of this  i mean that your pride and your social qualities torture you with their different attractions indeed one would always give way to the last but that few are familiarityproof few but whom it teaches to despise one albeit i am conscious of the bad influence of freedom myself yet whilst it tends to discover wit humor and sense it only renders me more and more  your most obedient friend and servant w shenstone  xix to the same with an invitation to accompany him to town the leasows nov         dear sir the reason why i write to you so suddenly is that i have a proposal to make to you if you could contrive to be in london for about a month from the end of december i imagine you would spend it agreeably enough along with me mr outing and mr whistler according to my calculations we should be a vely happy party at a play coffeehouse or tavern  do not let your supercilious friends come in upon you with then prudential maxims  consider you are now of the proper age for pleasure and have not above four or five whimsical years left you have not struck one bold stroke yet that i know of saddle your mule and let us be jogging to the great city i will be answerable for amusement  let me have the pleasure of seeing you in the pit in a laughter as cordial and singular as your friendship come  let us go forth into the operahouse let us hear how the cunuchfolk sing turn your eyes upon the lilies and roses diamonds and rubies the belindas and the sylvias of gay life think upon mrs olives inexpressible comicalness not to mention hippesleys jokeabounding physiognomy think i say now for the time comes when you shall say i have no pleasure in them  i am conscious of much merit in bringing about the interview betwixt mr l  and mr s  but merit as sir john falstaff says is not regarded in these costermonger days  pray now do not write me word that your business will not allow you ten minutes in a fortnight to write to me an excuse fit for none but a cobbler who has ten children dependent upon a waxen thread adieu  w s  xx to the same on occasion of printing the schoolmistress      dear sir i trust you do not pay double postage for my levity in enclosing these decorations if i find you do i will not send you the thatchdhouse and the birchtree with the sun setting and gilding the scene  i expect a cargo of franks and then for the beautiful picture of lady gainsborough and the deformed portrait of my old schooldame sarah lloyd whose house is to be seen as thou travellest toward the native home of thy faithful servant  but she sleeps with her fathers and is buried with her fathers and  thomas her son reigns in her stead  i have the first sheet to correct upon the table i have laid aside the thoughts of same a good deal in this unpromising scheme and fix them upon the landscape which is engraving the red letter which i purpose and the fruit piece which you see being the most seemly ornaments of the first sixpenny pamphlet that was ever so highly honored i shall incur the same reflection with ogilby of having nothing good but my decorations  i have been walking in the mall tonight  the duke was there and was highly delighted with two dogs and stared at me more enormously than ever duke did before i do not know for what reason unless for the same which made him admire the other puppydogs because they were large ones  i expect that in your neighborhood and in warwickshire there should be about twenty of my poems sold i print it myself i am not yet satisfied about mottoes that printed is this o qua sol habitabiles illustrat oras maxim principum it must be short on account of the plate i do not know but i may adhere to a very insignificant one en erit ergo ille dies mihi cum liceat tua dicere facta   i am pleased with myndes engravings and i can speak without affectation that fame is not equally in my thoughts  one caution i gave mr w  and it is what i would give to all my friends with whom i wish my intimacy may continue so much as i wish it may with you though i could bear the disregard of the town i could not bear to see my friends alter their opinion which they say they have of what i write though millions contradict them it is an obstinacy which i can boast of and they that have more sense may surely insist on the liberty of judging for themselves if you should faulter i should say you did not deserve your capacity to judge for yourself write soon  you never are at a fault  tantummodo incepto opus est caetera res expediet adieu  w s  xxi to the same from town on the death of mr somervile etc      my good friend our old friend somervile is dead i did not imagine i could have been so sorry as i find myself on this occasion sublatum quaerimus i can now excuse all his foibles impute them to age and to distress of circumstances the last of these considerations wrings my very soul to think on for a man of high spirit conscious of having at least in one production generally pleased the world to be plagued and threatened by wretches that are low in every sense to be forced to drink himself into pains of the body in order to get rid of the pains of the mind is a misery which i can well conceive because i may without vanity esteem myself his equal in point of economy and consequently ought to have an eye on his misfortunes as you kindly hinted to me at twelve oclock at the feathers i should retrench  i will but you shall not see me  i will not let you know that i took your hint in good part i will do it at solitary times as i may and yet there will be some difficulty in it for whatever the world might esteem in poor somervile i really find upon critical enquiry that i loved him for nothing so much as his floccinaucinihilipili fication of money  mr a  was honorably acquitted lord a  who was present and behaved very insolently they say was hissed out of court they proved his application to the carpenters son to get him to swear against mr a  though the boy was proved to have said in several companies  before he had been kept at lord a  s house that he was sure the thing was accidental finally it is believed he will recover the title of a  ea  the apprehension of the whores and the suffocation of four in the roundhouse by the stupidity of the keeper engrosses the talk of the town the said house is rebuilding every day for the mob on sunday night demolished it and redemolished every night the duke of m  gh j  s  his brother lord c  g  were taken into the roundhouse and confined from eleven at night till eleven next day i am not positive of the duke of m  gh the others are certain and that a large number of people of the first fashion went from the roundhouse to de veils to give in informations of their usage the justice himself seems greatly scared the prosecution will be carried on with violence so as probably to hang the keeper and there is an end  lord baths coachman got drunk and tumbled from his box and he was forced to borrow lord orfords wits say that it was but gratitude for my lord orfords coachman to drive my lord bath as my lord bath himself had driven my lord orford thus they  i have ten million of things to tell you though they all amount to no more than that i wish to please you and that i am  your sincere friend and humble servant i am pleased that i can say i knew mr somervile which i am to thank you for    xxii to mr graves on benevolence and friendship the leasows jan          dear mr graves i cannot forbear immediately writing to you the pleasure your last letter gave me puts it out of my power to restrain the overflowings of my benevolence i can easily conceive that upon some extraordinary instances of friendship my heart might be si sort attendri that i could not bear any restraint upon my ability to show my gratitude it is an observation i made upon reading to days paper which contains an account of c khevenhullers success in favor of the queen of hungary to think what sublime affection must influence that poor unfortunate queen should a faithful and zealous general revenge her upon her enemies and restore her ruined affairs  had a person shown an esteem and affection for me joined with any elegance or without any elegance in the expression of it i should have been in acute pain till i had given some sign of my willingness to serve him  from all this i conclude that i have more humanity than some others  probably enough i shall never meet with a larger share of happiness than i feel at present if not i am thoroughly convinced my pain is greatly superior to my pleasure that pleasure is not absolutely dependent on the mind i know from this that i have enjoyed happier scenes in the company of some friends than i can possibly at present  but alas all the time you and i shall enjoy together abstracted from the rest of our lives and lumped will not perhaps amount to a solid year and a half how small a proportion  people will say to one that talks thus would you die to set the case upon a right footing they must take away the hopes of greater happiness in this life the fears of greater misery hereafter together with the bodily pain of dying and address me in a disposition betwixt mirth and melancholy and i could easily resolve them  i do not know how i am launched out so far into this complaint it is perhaps a strain of constitutional whining the effect of the wind  did it come from the winds to the winds will i deliver it tradam protervis in mare creticum portare ventis    i will be as happy as my fortune will permit and make others so pone me pigris ubi nulla campis arbor aestiva recreatur aura   i will be so the joke is that the description which you gave of that country was that you had few trees about you so that i should trick fortune if she should grant my petition implicitly but in earnest i intend to come and stay a day or two with you next summer  mr whistler is at mr goslings bookseller at the mitre and crown in fleet street and enquired much after you in his last letter to me he writes to me but i believe his affection for one weighs less with him while the town is in the other scale though he is very obliging i do not know whether i do right when i say i believe we three that is in solitary circumstances have an equal idea of and affection for each other i say supposing each to be alone or in the country which is nearly the same for scenes alter minds as much as the air influences bodies for instance when mr whistler is in town i suppose we love him better than he does us and when we are in town i suppose the same may be said in regard to him  the true burlesque of spenser whose characteristic is simplicity seems to consist in a simple representation of such things as one laughs to see or to observe ones self rather than in any monstrous contrast between the thoughts and words i cannot help thinking that my added stanzas have more of his manner than what you saw before which you are not a judge of till you have read him  w s  xxiii to the same with some observations on spencer leasows the day before christmas dear sir though your last letter seemed to put my correspondence upon an ostentatious footing namely an inclination to be witty yet i assure you it was not any punctilious consideration of that kind that has kept me so long silent indeed with some people one would stand upon the nicest punctilios for though ceremony be altogether lighter than vanity itself yet it surely weighs as much as the acquaintance of the undeserving but this is trifling because it can have no reference to a person for whom i have the greatest affection  in regard to my oxford affairs you did all i could expect i have wrote since to mr m  who either for your sake or mine will i dare say settle them to my satisfaction  i wish your journey and headache would have permitted you to have been a little more particular concerning the seat of the muses but i suppose nothing material distinguished your fortnight  mr whistler has relapsed at whitchurch but purposed when i last heard from him to go to london before this time i do not entirely understand his schemes but should have been sincerely glad of his company with me this winter and he says he is not fond of london  for my part i designed to go thither the next month but the fever which is chiefly violent in towns discourages me  some time ago i read spensers fairy queen and when i had finished thought it a proper time to make some additions and corrections in my trifling imitation of him the schoolmistress his subject is certainly bad and his action inexpressibly confused but there are some particulars in him that charm one those which afford the greatest scope for a ludicrous imitation are his simplicity and obsolete phrase and yet these are what give one a very singular pleasure in the perusal the burlesque which they occasion is of quite a different kind to that of philipss shilling cottons travestie hudibras or swifts works but i need not tell you this i enclose a copy for your amusement and opinion which if franks are plentiful you may return and save me the tedious trouble of writing it over again the other paper was bona fide written to divert my thoughts from pain for the same reason that i smoaked actions equally reputable  mr somerviles poem upon hawking called field sports i suppose is out by this time it was sent to mr lyttleton to be read to the prince to whom it was inscribed it seems he is fond of hawking  i have often thought those to be the most enviable people whom one least envies  i believe married men are the happiest that are but i cannot say i envy them because they lose all their merit in the eyes of other ladies  i beg sincerely that you would write in a weeks time at furthest that i may receive your letter here if i should go from home this winter i will never use any thing by way of conclusion but your old roman  farewell w shenstone  xxiv to the same with a continuation of the same subject june      dear mr graves i am glad the stay you make in herefordshire amuses you even though it puts you upon preferring the place you reside at to my own place of residence i do not know whether it be from the prejudice of being born at the leasows or from any real beauty in the situation but i would wish no other would some one by an addition of two hundred pounds a year put it in my power to exhibit my own designs it is what i can now do in no other method than on paper i live in such an unoeconomical manner that i must not indulge myself in the plantation of a tree for the future i have glutted myself with the extremity of solitude and must adapt my expenses more to sociable life it is on this account that it seems more prudent for me to buy a chair while i am in town than to carry down twelve guineas for the model of the tomb of virgil an urn and a scheme or two more of like nature  i long to have my picture distantly approaching to a profile the best manner i can think of to express myself drawn by davison i have seen your sisters and think the face well done in every respect  but am greatly indignant with other things of a less fixed nature the cap though a good cap enough has a vile effect the formality of stays etc not agreeable  i do not know if you saw the picture of a scotch girl there at full length miss graves has the advantage of here is or any picture there in her person but certainly this girls hair is inexpressibly charming there is the genteelest negligence in it i ever saw in any picture  what follows but that i wish your sister would give orders to pull off her cap and have hair after the manner of this picture  to speak abruptly as it is i disapprove it were it altered i should like it beyond any i ever saw  i am glad you are reading spenser though his plan is detestable and his invention less wonderful than most people imagine who do not much consider the obviousness of allegory yet i think a person of your disposition must take great delight in his simplicity his goodnature etc did you observe a stanza that begins a canto somewhere naught is there under heavens wide hollowness that breeds etc   when i bought him first i read a page or two of the fairy queen and cared not to proceed after that popes alley made me consider him ludicrously and in that light i think one may read him with pleasure i am now as ch  mley with  from trifling and laughing at him really in love with him i think even the meter pretty though i shall never use it in earnest and that the last alexandrine has an extreme majesty  does not this line strike you i do not justly remember what canto it is in brave thoughts and noble deeds did evermore inspire perhaps it is my fancy only that is enchanted with the running of it adieu  w s  xxv to the same on the publication of the schoolmistress dear mr graves i depended a good deal on an immediate answer from you and am greatly fearful you never received a packet of little things which i sent you to oxford enclosed in a frank though if arrived at all it must have arrived several days before you left it i beseech you to send me a line upon the receipt of these which will free me from much perplexity though it is doubtful whether i can defer my schemes so as to make your criticisms of service i would have you send them notwithstanding  i cannot help considering myself as a sportsman though god knows how poor a one in every sense and the company as my game they fly up for a little time and then settle again my cue is to discharge my piece when i observe a number together this week they are straggling round about their pasture the town the next they will flock into it with violent appetites and then discharge my little piece amongst them  i assure you i shall be very easy about the acquisition of any same by this thing all i much wish is to lose none and indeed i have so little to lose that this consideration scarcely affects me  i dare say it must be very incorrect for i have added eight or ten stanzas within this fortnight but inaccuracy is more excusable in ludicrous poetry than in any other if it strikes any it must be merely people of taste for people of wit without taste which comprehends the larger part of the critical tribe will unavoidably despise it i have been at some pains to secure myself from a philipss misfortune of mere childishness little charm of placid mien etc i have added a ludicrous index purely to show fools that i am in jest  and my motto o qua sol habitabiles illustrat oras maxim principum is calculated for the same purpose you cannot conceive how large the number is of those that mistake burlesque for the very foolishness it exposes which observation i made once at the rehearsal at tom thumb at chrononhotonthologos all which are pieces of elegant humor i have some mind to pursue this caution further and advertise it the schoolmistress etc a very childish performance every body knows  novorum more but if a person seriously calls this or rather burlesque a childish or low species of poetry he says wrong for the most regular and formal poetry may be called trifling folly and weakness in comparison of what is written with a more manly spirit in ridicule of it  i have been plagued to death about the ill execution of my designs  nothing is certain in london but expense which i can ill bear believe me till death  yours sincerely and particularly w shenstone  xxvi to the same with a humourous description of his conduct in regard to form and equipage the leasows nov      dear sir presuming you may be at tissington by this time i write to solicit a description of the several adventures accidents and phenomenon that have amused you in your travels and will equally affect me as they relate to you above all things be particular in regard to your calculations respecting mickleton i would have certainly met you there as you desired me there is no company i am fonder of than yours and your sisters and no place at which i have spent more agreeable hours than mickleton but your brother has lost one of his recommendations in my eye that is his irregularity of housekeeping he has several left which are sufficient to preserve my utmost esteem but that was a jewel indeed i love to go where there is nothing much more in form than myself i have no objection to visit young unsettled people with a mountebanks inconsistency in my equipage but where a considerable family keeps up its forms as marriage requires i should not care to appear with an hired horse and a sancho for my valet the case is i could live in a way genteel enough and uniformly so but then i must forego megrims whims toys and so forth now though it gives me pain sometimes not to appear of a piece yet that infrequent pain is not a balance for the substantial happiness which i find in an urn a seal a snuff box an engraving or a bust ambition too as it puts me upon wishing to make a figure makes me very indifferent as to making a common everydaygentlemanly figure and saves me from appearing solicitous about the res mediocriter splendidae by raising my imagination higher i pour out my vanity to you in cataracts but i hope you will rather consider it as a mark of my confidence and consequently my sincere esteem and affection for i take it the former seldom subsists without the latter and as to what i said about my love of flattery i hope you will not construe it as any hint neither if i am right would you be so ungenerous as not to comply with me i sincerely think that flattery amongst foes is absolutely desirable amongst ones common acquaintance a behavior rather inclining to it but amongst friends its consequences are of too dangerous a nature  i am so unhappy in my wintery unvisited state that i can almost say with dido taedet coeli convexa tueri i am miserable to think that i have not thought enough to amuse me i walk a day together and have no idea but what comes in at my eyes i long for some subject about the size of philipss cider to settle heartily about something that i could enrich by episodes drawn from the english history stonehenge has some of the advantages i like but seems a dead lifeless title if you chance to think of a subject which you do not choose to adorn yourself send it me to write upon  i shall be vastly desirous to see you here in spring and am in hopes whistler will stay a month with me i have sent an imperious letter about his dilatory correspondence he mentioned you in his last letter was going to oxford thence to london where if he stays till february i may see him i hope you will write the very next post you cannot oblige me or please me more than by so doing if you think i deserve to be pleased or am worth obliging adieu  w s  xxvii to the same from town with a specimen of plays and politics from mr shuckburghs bookseller in fleet street your brothers lodgings about      dear mr graves i have just been spending my evening at a coffeehouse and notwithstanding the confused effect of liquor am sitting down to write to a person of the clearest head i know the truth is i write to please myself which i can do no other way so effectually upon which account you are not obliged to me for the advances i make in correspondence extraordinary things will be expected from my situation but extraordinary things ought never to be expected from me i keep no political company nor desire any as i believe you know if you enquire after the stage  i have not seen garrick but more fortunately for you your brother has me nothing has so much transported as young cibbers exhibition of parolles in shakespeares  all is well that ends well the character is admirably written by the author and i fancy i can discover a great number of hints which it has afforded to congreve in his bluff i am apt to think a person after he is twelve years old laughs annually less and less less heartily however which is much the same i think cibber elicited from me as sincere a laugh as i can ever recollect nothing sure can be comparable to his representation of parolles in his bullycharacter except the figure he makes as a shabby gentleman in his first dress he is tawdry as you may imagine in the last he wears a rusty black coat a black stock a black wig with a ramillie a pair of black gloves and a face  which causes five minutes laughter  instead of politics i have transcribed these epigrams from the evening post  though i hate transcribing the choice to sir robert  when opposition against power prevailed when artful eloquence and bribery failed timely you quit the ship you could not steer disdain the commons and ascend a peer conscious that you deserve to bleed or swing you choose the axe as nobler than the string the opposition with huge anteus as alcides strove the son of neptune one and one of jove often as he threw the giant on the ground his strength redoubled by the fall he found the unweildy monster sprung of mother earth from her had vigor as from her he would birth enraged the hero a new method tries high lifts in air and as he mounts he dies   i think the last a good thought the first not a bad one and what i have had in my head a thousand times i saw mr fitzherbert at nandos but chose not to reconnoitre him there though to ask after you i purpose waiting on him at his lodgings for the same end pray write soon to me i wish i could say more to deserve it from you  i would fain deviate from the common road in every letter i send you but am so very uniformly your friend that i cannot vary my manner of expressing how much i am so which is all my letters aim at adieu  w shenstone  xxviii to the same with various schemes of composition feb      dear mr graves you say it is no way unpleasing to you to receive my letters if you say the thing that is not the fault like others produces its own punishment  you are now my only correspondent i do not know what reason whistler has for not caring to write unless he thinks that we ought not to trouble ourselves about one another but bend our whole endeavors to mend our fortunes though i do not know his imaginations i was afraid after what i had said concerning sameness in my last that you would interpret it to your own disadvantage but was too lazy to write my letter again trusting that i could deny the extent of my complaint to any one besides myself in some future letter there is as much variety in your genius as fortune can introduce into your circumstances  some time next week do i purpose to set out for london the reasons for my going at all do barely preponderate i cannot conscientiously print any thing i have two or three little matters in hand none that i am greatly fond of much less that are at all mature one is what you have seen though in its mortal state flattery or the fatal exotic  so very quotidian and copious a subject that i dislike it entirely another elegies in hammonds meter but upon real and natural subjects this i have objections to a third an essay on reserve the subject genteel i think but scarce ten lines finished a fourth an essay in blank verse on economy with advice to poets on that head concluding with a ludicrous description of a poets apartment i think it were better to annex that poem thus to prevent its clashing like an earthen pot against philipss silver vase though his humor lies chiefly in the language my favorite scheme is a poem in blank verse upon rural elegance including cascades temples grottos hermitages greenhouses which introduces my favorite episode of the spanish lady you will wonder how but i think well to close the first book the next running upon planting etc will end with a vista terminated by an old abbey which introduces an episode concerning the effects of romish power interdicts etc in imitation of lucretiuss plague of athens taken from thucydides virgils murrain and ovids pestilence etc the two episodes in great forwardness  but alas i do not like formal didactic poetry and shall never be able to finish aught but the episodes i doubt unless i allow myself to treat the rest in my own manner transiently  as camilla skimmed over the wheatstubble  i have altered this ballad you see i doubt not to your mind but send your criticisms and i will be all obedience from london i will send you mine on your more important poem your critique will be important upon my silly affair mine silly i am afraid upon your momentous one  but you do not think it momentous as you ought direct to nandos i am  your most sincere and affectionate friend and humble servant w s i question whether i should be more unhappy in any mere mechanical employment for instance making nails which seems to deal as much in repetition as any trade than i am in great part of my time when my head is unfit for study  my neighbor is gone to london and has left me a legacy of franks so i shall be able to return your poem etc at least by parcels i strenuously purpose to be there or to set out next week but as i am here at present i think you ought to pay some deference to the vis inertiae at least to the centripetal force of matter and direct to the leasows one more letter with your opinion concerning the various readings in the trifle i enclose writing the first post that you well can  once more adieu  feb           xxix to the same      dear mr graves dr swift would not have scrupled to print your parody with his name to it why should you without your name i had a violent inclination to print it in a large folio four leaves price fourpence but i dare not do it for fear you should think it of evil importance with regard to the clergy you excel me infinitely in a way in which i take most pleasure odd picturesque description send me word whether i shall print it or no  and that right soon  i have lingered in town till now and did not receive your letter till this morning  i do not know whether i shall send you with this letter a little thing which i wrote in an afternoon and with proper demands of being concealed as the author sold for two guineas  next time i am in town i will get money like a haberdasher i will amuse myself with finding out the peoples weak side and so furnish them with suitable nonsense  i would have you do the same  make your wit bear your charges indeed as to the little parody you send it would fix your reputation with men of sense as much as greatly more than the whole tedious character of parson adams i read it half a year ago the week after i came to town but made mr shuckburgh take it again imagining it altogether a very mean performance  i liked a tenth part pretty well but as dryden says of horace unjustly he shows his teeth without laughing the greater part is unnatural and unhumourous it has some advocates but i observe those not such as i ever esteemed tasters finally what makes you endeavor to like it  my printer was preparing his bill for the schoolmistress when i stopped him short with a hint to go to dodsley who has not yet reckoned with me for hercules let the dead bury their dead dr youngs complaint is the best thing that has come out this season these twenty years pope says except mine for so thinks every author who does think proper to say so poor popes history in cibbers letter and the print of him upon the mount of love the coarsest is most humorous must surely mortify him your sister does me great honor to think my hint any thing but i am quite zealous in my approbation of that scotch ladys hair i will ever aim at oddness for the future it is cheaper to follow taste than fashion and whoever he be that devotes himself to taste will be odd of course  you send me the verses on lord hay they were hacked about town three months ago and i saw them the town is certainly the scene for a man of curiosity  i do not purpose to be long away but i must think of retrenching  i have ten thousand things to tell you but i have not room such people as we should meet as regularly to compare notes as tradesmen do to settle accounts but oftener there is no good comes of long reckonings  i shall forget half  i think it should be four days in a fortnight  it would not do  it would make one mindful of and consequently more uneasy on account of absence every one gets posts preferments but myself  nothing but my ambition can set me on a footing with them and make me easy come then lordly pride etc the devil thought with me in milton all is not lost the unconquerable will and study never to submit or yield   i have been in new companies but i see no reason to contradict my assertion that i find none i like equally with you adieu  w shenstone  xxx to mr jago from london      dear friend i shall send you but a very few lines being so much indisposed with a cold that i can scarce tell how to connect a sentence i am just got into lodgings at a goldsmiths  a dangerous situation you will say for me actum est ilicet periisti not so  for of late i have not so violent a taste for toys as i have had and i can look even on snuffboxes oculo irretorto  london is really dangerous at this time the pickpockets formerly content with mere filching make no scruple to knock people down with bludgeons in fleet street and the strand and that at no later hour than eight oclock at night but in the piazzas covent garden they come in large bodies armed with couteaus and attack whole parties so that the danger of coming out of the play houses is of some weight in the opposite scale when i am disposed to go to them oftener than i ought  there is a poem of this season called the pleasures of imagination worth your reading but it is an expensive quarto if it comes out in a less size i will bring it home with me mr pope as mr outing who has been with lord bolingbroke informs me is at the point of death  my lord carteret said yesterday in the house that the french and spaniards had actually said they would attempt a second invasion  there is a new play acted at drury lane mahomet translated from the french of voltaire but i have no great opinion of the subject or the original author as a poet and my diffidence is rather improved by the testimony of those who have seen it  i lodge between the two coffeehouses georges and nandos so that i partake of the expensiveness of both as heretofore i have no acquaintance in town and but slender inducement to stay and yet probably i shall loiter here for a month  t  h  was knighted against his will and had a demand made upon him for an hundred pounds before he could get out of st jamess so soon are felt the inconveniencics of grandeur  he came out of the court in a violent rage g  d jack what do think  i am knighted  the devil of a knight efaith  i believe he was sincere in his disgust for there had been two bargemasters knighted in his neighborhood some time before  i saw coming up lady fanes grotto which they say cost her five thousand pounds about three times as much as her house is worth it is a very beautiful disposition of the finest collection of shells i ever saw  mr powiss woods which are finer  mean time if i had three hundred pounds to lay out about the leasows i could bring my ambition to peaceable terms i am dear sir with all affection yours and mrs jagos  w shenstone write soon it is this moment reported that pope is dead    xxxi to the same      dear sir i long heartily to talk over affairs with you tete a tete but am an utter enemy to the fatigue of transcribing what might pass well enough in conversation  i shall say nothing more concerning my departure from l  than that it was necessary and therefore excusable  i have been since with a gentleman upon the borders of wales bishops castle from whence i made a digression one day beyond offas dyke saw mountains which converted all that i had seen into molehills and houses which changed the leasows into hampton court where they talk of a glazed window as a piece of magnificence and where their highest idea of his majesty is that he can ride in such a coach as squire jones or squire pryces the woman of the inn at one plce said glass in windows was very genteel that it was but she could not afford such finery  you agree with the rest of the married world in a propensity to mke proselytes this inclination in some people gives one a kind of dread of the matter they are illnatured and can only wish one in their own state because they are unhappy like persons that have the plague who they say are ever desirous to propagate the infection i make a contrary conclusion when you commend marriage as you seem to do when you wish miss  may reconcile me to more than the name of wife i know not what you have heard of my amor probably more than i can thoroughly confirm to you and what if i should say to you that marriage was not once the subject of our conversation   nec conjugis unquam praetendi taedas aut haec in fdera veni do not you think every thing in nature strangely improved since you were married from the teatable to the warmingpan  i want to see mrs jagos handwriting that i may judge of her temper but she must write something in my praise pray see you to it in your next letter  i could parodize my lord carterets letter from dettingen if i had it by me mrs arnold thanks be praised has this day gained a very considerable victory the scold lasted two hours mrs s  e was posted in the hall and mrs arnold upon the staircase which superiority of ground was of no small service to her in the engagement the fire lasted the whole space without intermission at the close of which the enemy was routed and mrs arnold kept the field  did you hear the song to the tune of the cuckoo  the baron stood behind a tree in woeful plight for naught heard he but cannon cannon etc o word of fear unpleasing to a german ear the notes that fall upon the word cannon express the sound with its echo admirably  i send you my pastoral elegy or ballad if you think that name more proper on condition that you return it with ample remarks in your next letter i say return it because i have no other copy and am too indolent to take one adieu  w s  xxxii to mr graves describing his situation and state of health etc the leasows dear mr graves tomorrow morning i set out for cheltenham to make trial of the waters there i shall perhaps add to this letter at several stages and conclude it at the place to which i am going so that like those springs you may perhaps find it impregnated with the nature of all those places through which it passes perhaps quite the contrary   if i mistake not the man is an encourager of works of taste etc though i am going to instance this oddly he was a hearty stickler for my poem upon hercules at bath as d jago sent me word perhaps it was complaisance to mr lyttleton with whom charles etc he is intimate if as i said before i do not mistake the person i flatter myself i do not and i hope that we two shall ever find the same persons or the same kind of persons our friends and also our enemies  if i get over this ill habit of body depend upon it i will have a reverend care of my health as sir john falstaff advises the chief justice i solve all the tempests that disturb my constitution into wind it plagues me first in the shape of a bad appetite then indigestion then lowness of spirits and a flux of pale water and at night by watchings restlessness twitchings of my nerves or a sleep more distracted than the most active state of watchfulness but i think purging lessens all these symptoms and i trust my scheme that i am entering upon is right  i was on monday at hagley to wait on mr lyttleton who was gone to sir john astleys to see his grand edifice  as to mrs lyttleton if her affability is not artificial i mean if it does not owe its original as it ought to do its management to art i cannot conceive a person more amiable  but sense and elegance cannot be seigned to exhibit them is to have them  how is my song set miss carrington procured it that favor but i have never seen a copy nor knew of its being to be printed howard has set another of mine which i received last post but my harpsichord is out of order and i have found no one yet to explain the hieroglyphics which convey it you may probably find it in some future number of the british orpheus by the side of a stream etc  i am in as good spirits this instant as ever i was in my life only mens turbidum laetatur my head is a little confused but i often think seriously that i ought to have the most ardent and practical gratitude as the methodists choose to express themselves for the advantages that i have which though not eminently shining are such to speak the truth as suit my particular humor and consequently deserve all kind of acknowledgment if a poet should address himself to god almighty with the most earnest thanks for his goodness in allotting him an estate that was overrun with shrubs thickets and coppices variegated with barren rocks and precipices or floated three parts in four with lakes and marches rather than such an equal and fertile spot as the sons of men delight in to my apprehension he would be guilty of no absurdity  but of this i have composed a kind of prayer and intend to write a little speculation on the subject this kind of gratitude i assuredly ought to have and have for my health if one reflects a countryfellows stock of it would be unfit for solitude would dispose one rather to bodily feats and what falstaff calls in poins gambol faculties than mental contemplations and would give one that kind of pain which springs from impatience my constitution was given me originally good and with regard to it now as g barnwell says what am i  what i have made myself or to speak with milton him after all disputes forced i absolve all my evasions vain and reasonings though through mazes only lead but to my own conviction first and last on me me only as the source and spring of all corruption all the blame lights due though this is but vulgarly expressed in milton neither  jago has been here this last week and i drove him to dudley castle which i long to show you i never saw it since i was the size of my pen before it has great romantic beauty though perhaps derbyshire may render it of small note in your eye  one is tempted to address the k  as harry the eighth does his wife mutatis mutandis go thy ways george whoever he be that shall assert he has a bolder king let him in naught be trusted for saying false in that    i have a mind to write an ode in praise of him and in rivalship of cibber  mine should be of the ballad style and familiarity as expressing the sentiments of a person returning from a dislike to a thorough approbation of him which seems at present the sense of the nation  but herein i am not in earnest   my pen has run on a whole page at random it amuses me to encourage it and so i will try to get a frank  i am this moment arrived at cheltenham after an expensive and fatiguing journey i called yesterday at micklington saw the portico and snapped up a bit of mutton at your brothers drank a dish of tea with miss s  and in opposition to the strongest remonstrances persisted in an endeavor to reach cheltenham after five oclock the consequence was that about ten i found myself traveling back again toward stowe and had undoubtedly wandered all night in the dark had i not been fortunately met by a waggoners servant who brought me back to the worst inn but one i ever lay at being his masters  here i am which is all i shall say in this letter  adieu w s  xxxiii to mr jago on the same the leasows saturday july the  th      dear mr jago it is not a contrived apology or an excuse which i am going to offer for the disappointments i have given you i have actually been so much out of order ever since i wrote to you nay ever since i formed a design of a sunday expedition to l  that it never has been in my power to execute my intentions my vertigo has not yet taken away my senses god knows how soon it may do but my nerves are in such a condition that i can scarce get a wink of even disordered rest for whole nights together may you never know the misery of such involuntary vigils i ride every day almost to fatigue which only tends to make my want of sleep more sensible and not in the least to remove it i have spirits all day good ones though my head is dizzy and i never enterprise any study of greater subtlety than a newspaper i cannot say the journey to l  would be at all formidable to me for i ride about fifteen miles as i compute it every day before dinner but the nights from home would be insupportable to me i have fatigued mrs arnolds assiduity to the injury of her health by occasioning her to sit in my room anights light my candle put it out again make me perspiratory wheys and slops and am amused by the most silly animadversions she is capable of making i never knew her usefulness till now but i now prefer her to all of her station if i get over this disorder concerning which i have bad apprehensions you may depend upon seeing me the first sunday i dare venture forth i hope you continue mending the benefit of riding is only not universal and would cure me too could i but make one previous advance toward health have you tried cold bathing perhaps it may not suit your case i wish i had not dropped it i take my fluctuation of nerves to be caused as that of the sea is by wind which i am continually pumping up and yet find it still renewed when i am just sinking to sleep a sudden twitch of my nerves calls me back again  to watchfulness and vexation i consider myself as in the state of the philosopher who held a bullet betwixt his finger and thumb which whenever he was about to nod was ordered so as to fall into a large brass pan and wake him  that he might pursue his lucubrations  i will mention one circumstance regarding the weakness of my nerves  and not my spirits for i told you those were tolerable  the least noise that is even the falling of a fireshovel upon the floor if it happen unexpectedly shocks my whole frame and i actually believe that a gun fired behind my back unawares amidst the stillness of the night would go near to kill me with its noise  i am just going to bed and dare not be any more attentive as i hope to close my eyes for a minute so fare you well  it is now six oclock in the morning and i have had about five hours middling sleep which encourages me greatly so i will hope to be able to see you next sunday sevennight  what think you of the battle are not you so much in love with our king that you could find in your heart to serve him in any profitable post he might assign you  capt l  is wounded in the thigh  when i ride in my chair round my neighborhood i am as much stared and wondered at as a giant would be that should walk through pall mall my vehicle is at least as uncommon hereabouts as a blazing comet my chief pleasure lies in finding out a thousand roads and delightful little haunts near home which i never dreamt of egregious solitudes and most incomparable byelanes where i can as effectually lose myself within a mile of home as if i were benighted in the deserts of arabia adieu  xxxiv to mr graves written in hayharvest july        dear mr graves i did not part from you without a great deal of melancholy to think of the short duration of those interviews which are the objects of ones continual wishes has been a reflection that has plagued me of old i am sure i returned home with it then more aggravated as i foresaw myself returning to the same series of melancholy hours from which you had a while relieved me and which i had particularly suffered under all this last spring i wish to god you might happen to be settled not far from me a daysjourney distance however i mean an easy one but the odds are infinitely against me i must only rely for my happiness on the hopes of a neverceasing correspondence  soon after you were gone i received my packet the history of worcestershire is mere stuff t  i am so fond of that i believe i shall have his part of the collection bound over again neatly and separately but sure hammond has no right to the least inventive merit as the prefacewriter would insinuate i do not think there is a single thought of any eninence that is not literally translated i am astonished he could not content himself with being so little an original  mr lyttleton and his lady are at hagley a malignant caterpillar has demolished the beauty of all our large oaks mine are secured by their littleness but i guess the park suffers a large wood near me being a mere winterpiece for nakedness  at present i give myself up to riding and thoughtlessness being resolved to make trial of their efficacy toward a tolerable degree of health and spirits i wish i had you for my director i should proceed with great confidence of success though i am brought very low by two or three fits of a fever since i saw you had i written to you in the midst of my dispirited condition as i was going you would have had a more tender and unaffected letter than i can write at another time what i think perhaps at all times but what sickness can alone elicit from a temper fearful of whining  surely the nunc formosissimus annus is to be limited to hayharvest i could give my reasons but you will imagine them to be the activity of country people in a pleasing employment the full verdure of the summer the prime of pinks woodbines jasmines etc i am old very old for few things give me so much mechanical pleasure as lolling on a bank in the very heat of the sun when the old come forth to play on a sunshine holiday  and yet it is as much as i can do to keep mrs arnold from going to neighboring houses in her smock in despite of decency and my known disapprobation  i find myself more of a patriot than i ever thought i was upon reading the account of the battle i found a very sensible pleasure or as the methodists term it perceived my heart enlarged etc the map you sent me is a pretty kind of toy but does not enough particularize the scenes of the war etc which was the end i had in view when i sent for it  o dura messorum ilia about half the appetite digestion strength spirits etc of a mower would make me the happiest of mortals i would be understood literally and precisely  adieu w s  xxxv to the same after the disappointment of a visit      dear sir i am tempted to begin my letter as memmius does his harangue multa medehortantur a vobis ni studium virtutis vestrae omnia exsuperet you contrive interviews of about a minutes duration and you make appointments in order to disappoint one and yet at the same time that your proceedings are thus vexatious force one to bear testimony to the inestimable value of your friendship i do insist upon it that you ought to compound for the disappointment you have caused me by a little letter every post you stay in town i shall now scarce see you till next summer or spring at soonest and then i may probably take occasion to visit you under pretense of seeing derbyshire truth is your prints have given me some curiosity to see the original places i am grateful for your intentions with regard to giving me part of them and impertinent in desiring you to convey them to me as soon as you can well spare them let me know if they are sold separately at the print shops i think to recommend them to my new acquaintance mr lyttleton brown i like the humor of the ballad you mention but am more obliged for your partial opinion of me the notes that fall upon the word cannon cannon are admirably expressive of the sound i dare say i mean jointly with its echo and so i suppose you will think if you ever attended to the towerguns i find i cannot afford to go to bath previously to my londonjourney though i look upon it as a proper method to make my residence in town more agreeable i shall probably be there about the first of december or before if i can accelerate my friend whistlers journey the pen i write with is the most disagreeable of pens but i have little else to say only this  that our good friend jack dolman is dead at aldridge his fathers benefice  i beg if you have leisure you would enclose me in a frank the following songs with the notes stella and flavia gentle jessy sylvia will thou waste thy prime and any other that is new i should be glad of that number of the british orpheus which has my song in it if it does not cost above sixpence make my compliments to your brother and sister and believe me in the common forms but in no common degree  dear mr gravess most affectionate friend and servant w shenstone the leasows nov  th      do write out the whole ballad of the baron stood behind a tree    xxxvi to the same on the receipt of a present of prints the leasows dec         dear sir you may reasonably have expected a letter before now either as an acknowledgment for your genteel present or at least by way of information that i had received it the prints have given me a pleasure which however considerable would soon have languished if i had bought them at a shop but which is now built upon the esteem i have for the giver and cannot have a more durable foundation  as for the rest i am most pleased with the view of matlock and shall have no peace of mind till i have seen the original i have been gilding the frames and wishing all the while for your company  i will alter the ballad according to your advice dividing it into three parts and adding a stanza or two to the shortest some time or other i have had no opportunity of trying the tunes arnos vale has pretty words and recommends itself to ones imagination by the probability that it was written on a real occasion the similitude of rhimes in the close inexcusable for all that has been the subject of my letter hitherto as the country people say i can but thank you and i do very sincerely though as to the songs i will repay you  i have your poem by me which i have read often with the greatest pleasure i have many observations to make and only defer the communication till i know whether you have a copy at tissington to turn to i think the most polite and suitable title to it would run  the villa a poem containing a sketch of the present taste in rural embellishments written in    0 your preface has a pretty thought toward the close otherwise is on no account to be admitted pardon my freedom but i think there is no manner of occasion for a preface and those strokes which i know to be real modesty in you the world will undoubtedly impute to affectation  if you give me encouragement i will be very minute in my criticisms allowing you to reject ten to one that you admit of  whistler is gone to bristol and has bilked me  i said he is gone but i believe he is only upon going  i linger at home in hopes of gleaning up a little health and through a dread of being ill in a place where i can be less attended on  i can continually find out something in my preceding diet that i think disorders me so that i am constantly in hopes of growing well  but perhaps i never shall optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi prima fugit subeunt morbi    when i was a schoolboy i never knew there was any such thing as perspiration and now half my time is taken up in considering the immediate connection betwixt that and health and endeavoring to promote it  mr lyttelton has built a kind of alcove in his park inscribed seeds contemplationis near his hermitage under the aforesaid inscription is omnia vanitas  the sides ornamented with sheeps bones jaws sculls etc festoon wise in a nitch over it an owl  as to schemes i have none with regard to the world women or books and i hate and have deferred writing to you for some days for that reason i am sick of exhibiting so much sameness  i am constantly poring over some classic which i consider as one of idlenesss better shapes but i am impatient to be doing something that may tend to better my situation in some respect or other it is encouragement can alone inspire one multa and praeclare minantem vivere nec recte nec suaviter  expresses the whole of me thus my epistles persevere in the plaintive style and i question whether the sight of them does not ere now give you the vapors i have an old aunt that visits me sometimes whose conversation is the perfect counterpart of them she shall fetch a longwinded sigh with dr young for a wager though i see his suspiria are not yet finished he has relapsed into night the fifth i take his case to be wind in a great measure and would advise him to take rhubarb in powder with a little nutmeg grated amongst it as i do  dear mr g  write down to me and believe me to be invariably  your most sincere and obliged friend etc w shenstone  xxxvii to the same with observations on hypocrisy etc      dear sir you must know my last letter to you was written before i received yours from tissington and i should take shame upon myself for not answering it were i not furnished with this excuse  that i waited for a frank for you  there are but few things i have to say to you and such as are not worth transcribing yet as our distance from one another requires it i will scrawl them over as negligently as i can to let you see i lay no stress upon them a good excuse for laziness you will say and lazy enough i am god knows i believe any one who knows me thoroughly will think that there never was so great an inconsistence as there is betwixt my words in my poem and my actions  this is what the world calls hypocrisy and is determined to look upon with peculiar aversion but i think the hypocrite is a halfgood character a man certainly considering the force of precedent deserves some praise who keeps up appearances and is no doubt as much to be commended for talking better than he acts as he is to be blamed for acting worse than he talks so much for casuistry i would seem you must know to have some meritorious views in talking virtuously but who does not know that every one who writes poetry looks directly with his face toward praise and whatever else his eye takes in is viewed obliquely praise as i said to foibleconfessing w  is the desired the noted and the adequate reward of poetry in which sort he that rewards me heaven reward him as sir john falstaff says  there is something very vain in repeating my own sayings but i could not conscientiously use a joke to you which i had used in another letter without owning it  in short it is necessary to have some earthly aim in view the next world whether it be in reality near or far off is always seen at a distance all that the generality of young people can do is to act consistently with their expectations there  now though fame etc be obviously enough in the eye of reason dissatisfactory yet it is proper enough to suffer ones self to be deluded with the hopes of it that is it is proper to cherish some worldly hopes that one may avoid impatience spleen and one sort of despair i mean that of having no hopes here because one sees nothing here that deserves them if i were in your case i would make all the efforts i was able toward being a bishop that should be my earthly aim not but i would act with so much indifference as to bear all disappointment unconcernedly  as i dare say you will  there is but one passion that i put upon an equally sprightly footing with ambition and that is love which as it regularly tends to matrimony requires certain favors from fortune and circumstance to render it proper to indulge in  by this time you think me crazed  as it often happens to me to doubt seriously whether i am not but if it be the mentis gratissimus error i do not mind you are very obliging to endeavor to continue my madness and vanity  i should be as glad to see mr graves your brother as any one i know i live in a manner wherein he would find many things to exercise his good nature  pamela would have made one good volume i wonder the author who has some nice natural strokes should not have sense enough to see that  i beg you will collect all the hints etc of your own or others that you think may tend to the improvement of my poem against winter that you would mention any flat lines etc  write me word some time ere you come over but write to me immediately i am  yours faithfully w shenstone once more adieu    xxxviii to a friend with a parody the leasows march         dear sir you are upon very good terms with me and have been all along i guessed the causes of your silence and have been sincerely sorry for them not however that i did not believe you were more happy than any one in the world who is neither a lover nor a poet though not able to turn himself for moneybags  i am really going to london and am about the purchase of an elegant pair of pistols from birmingham i indulge myself in this expense because they shall serve in two capacities one while to garnish my chair another while my horse and some time next week you will probably see your old friend on horseback armed at all points and as very a knight to all appearance as any body   well they say the owl was a quakers daughter  one knows what one is but one does not know what one shall be ophelia in hamlet but i digress if i just call to see you god forbid that i should be burdensome to you i will send my horses to h  and lodge there or somewhere but i am perfectly impatient to unbosom my soul to you and to see mrs jago whom i should have mentioned first  wednesday or tuesday indeed seems he most likely day  though i am not sure nor do you confine yourself  poor mariett i too am emaciated but i hope by means of some warm weather to acquire plus dembonpoint i design to call upon him and keep him in countenance  my ballad in the midst of your hurry must appear as ridiculous as cinna the poet does when he swears nothing but death shall restrain him from addressing brutus and cassius and that the night before the battle with two doggrel verses  and those the worst i have ever read and that makes the simile the more just it is now a good deal metamorposed your parody is prodigiously droll the first line delights me i think i could furnish mrs k  with as good mottoes and as cheap though i say it as any body but alas  did i send you the following parody or no before i believe not le viola  when first philander first i came where avon rolls his winding stream the nymphs  how brisk the swains  how gay to see asteria queen of may  the parsons round her praises sung the steeples with her praises rung  i thought  no sight that ever was seen could match the sight of barels green but now since old eugenio died  the chief of poets and the pride  now meaner bards in vain aspire to raise their voice to tune their lyre their lovely season now is over thy notes florelio please no more  no more asterias smiles are seen  adieu  the sweets of barels green  it is a kind of extempore so excuse it  you have seen the song of arnos vale  i am taking part of my farm upon my hands to see if i can succeed as a farmer  but i am afraid i am under the sentence and behold whatsoever he takes in hand it shall not prosper  my good friend i sincerely confide that however we may be separated no time shall extenuate our mutual friendship i am  your zealous unserviceable friend w shenstone  xxxix to mr graves on social happiness about      dear mr graves there is not a syllable you tell me concerning yourself in your last letter but what applied to me is most literally true i am sensible of the daily progress i make toward in significancy and it will not be many years before you see me arrived at the ne plus ultra i believe it is absolutely impossible for me to acquire a considerable degree of knowledge though i can understand things well enough at the time i read them i remember a preacher at st marys i think it was mr e  made a notable distinction betwixt apprehension and comprehension if there be a real difference probably it may find a place in the explication of my genius i envy you a good general insight into the writings of the learned i must aim at nothing higher than a well concealed ignorance  i was thinking upon reading your letter when it was that you and mr whistler and i went out of the road of happiness it certainly was where we first deviated from the turnpike road of life  wives children alliances visits etc are necessary objects of our social passions and whether or no we can through particular circumstances be happy with i think it plain enough that it is not possible to be happy without them all attachments to inanimate beauties to curiosities and ornaments satiate us presently  the fanciful tribe has the disadvantage to be naturally prone to err in the choice of lasting pleasures and when our passions have habitually wandered it is too difficult to reduce them into their proper channels when this is the case nothing but the change or variety of amusements stands any chance to make us easy and it is not long ere the whole species is exhausted  i agree with you entirely in the necessity of a sociable life in order to be happy i do not think it much a paradox that any company is better than none i think it obvious enough as to the present hour and as to any future influence solitude has exceeding savage effects on our dispositions  i have wrote out my elegy i lay no manner of stress but upon the piety of it  would it not be a good kind of motto applied to a person you know that might be taken from what is said of ophelia in hamlet i tell thee faithless priest a ministering angel shall ophelia be when thou art howling   i have amused myself often with this species of writing since you saw me partly to divert my present impatience and partly as it will be a picture of most that passes in my mind a portrait which friends may value  i should be glad of your profile if you have objections i drop my request  i should be heartily glad if you would come and live with me for any space of time that you could find convenient  but i will depend on your coming over with mr whistler in the spring i may possibly take a jaunt toward you ere long the road would furnish me out some visits and by the time i reached you perhaps afford me a kind of climax of happiness if i do not i shall perhaps be a little time at bath i do not speak of this last as a scheme from which i entertain great expectations of pleasure it is long since i have considered myself as undone the world will not perhaps consider me in that light entirely till i have married my maid adieu  xl to the same with observations on the rebellion and its probable consequences the leasows nov         dear mr graves my life for aught i see will pass away just as it has done without introducing sufficient improvement into my circumstances to give a cheerful cast to my correspondence in one respect in regard to my inviolable friendship for you i hope you will hear with some satisfaction that i continue still the same and this kind of idenity i think i could promise you though every circumstance in my fortune every particle of my body were changed and others ever so heterogeneous substituted in their place after this it would be no compliment to say that the pretended heir to these kingdoms could not alter it were he to subvert the british constitution which must out of all doubt be the consequence of his success the rebellion you may guess is the subject of all conversation every individual nailer here takes in a newspaper a more pregnant one by far than any of the london ones and talks as familiarly of kings and princes as ever master shallow did of john gaunt indeed it is no bad thing that they do so for i cannot conceive that the people want so much to be convinced by sermons of the absurdities of popery as they do by newspapers that it may possibly prevail the reasons and arguments too in favor of the present government are so strong and obvious that even i and every country squire and every country clerk and sam shaw the tailor seem to be as much masters of them as the bishops themselves i must not say we could express them so politely  i like seckers the best of any sermon on this occasion he gives his audience a view of such evil consequences from a change as no man of sense can possibly doubt of when fairly stated and i own i cannot see one single good it could produce in compensation for its inevitable and abundant mischiefs  i have read dr sherlocks sermon on this occasion and i have read mr warburtons and at your request i will read his legation  i have often thoughts of a jaunt as far as your country this winter some kind of pilgrimage i must make to avoid a lethargy  public places i want to visit a little to peep at and renew my ideas of the worlds vanity but either bath or london would steep me so far in poverty that i should not probably emerge before the middle of next summer i have spent this last summer agreeably enough with some of my young relations mr dolmans children  they have an excellent taste for their years  i have been upon several jaunts with the son to ditchfield worcester mr fletchers etc amusing him what i could under the loss of his father miss w  f  asked very earnestly after you two of the sisters have been with me at the leasows and upon several parties of pleasure in my chair  broom is disposed of  i do not understand upon what inducement  after all i am miserable  conscious to myself that i am too little selfish that i ought now or never to aim at some addition to my fortune and that i make large advances toward the common catastrophe of better poets poverty  i never can attend enough to some twelvepenny matter on which a great deal depends  my amor so far as i indulge it gives me some pleasure and no pain in the world  i have read spenser once again and i have added full as much more to my schoolmistress in regard to number of lines something in point of matter or manner rather which does not displease me i would be glad if mr  were upon your request to give his opinion of particulars for two reasons as you say he has some taste for this kind of writing and as he is my enemy and would therefore find out its deficiencies  i have a reason of a most whimsical kind why i would wish you to preserve this letter pray write soon and believe me most affectionately  your friend and humble servant w shenstone  xli to the same with remarks on the execution and behavior of the lords kilmarnock and balmerino      ineunte anno dear mr graves i believe it is impossible for me to disagree with you on any other score than the scanty pittances you allot me of your company and if i have disclosed any symptoms of resentment on that account you will perhaps overlook them out of regard to the motive from which they proceeded  i thank you for your perusal of that trivial poem if i were going to print it i should give way to your remarks implicitly and would not dare to do otherwise but so long as i keep it in manuscript you will pardon my silly prejudices if i choose to read and show it with the addition of most of my new stanzas i own i have a fondness for several imagining them to be more in spensers way yet more independent on the antique phrase than any part of the poem and on that account i cannot yet prevail on myself to banish them entirely but were i to print i should with some reluctance give way to your sentiments which i know are just namely that they render the work too diffuse and flimsy and seem rather excrescences than essential parts of it  but of these things i say no more now i purpose staying a month with mr whistler in december if it suits him and then i hope i shall have a great deal of your company let me hear something in your next of your domestic affairs i beg you would not make any grand decision without giving me some previous information i esteem this as due to the friendship i have so long professed for you and from the friendship you have so long professed for me  i look upon the death of the two lords as equally decent upon their respective principles lord kilmarnock i suppose joined the rebels through a view of bettering his circumstances conscious to himself that he was guilty of a crime the moment he did so this is agreeable to his speech before the lords and to that melancholy which he discovered upon the scaffold death aggravated by guilt would sit heavier upon him than upon the other even supposing him to have had the same resolution balmerinos life was quite unie and his death equal to the character he aimed at we are to observe that he meant to suffer as a friend to the stuarts a soldier and a scotsman the first he manifested when he came out of the tower by his reply of god save king j  s the second by his dress and numberless ostentations of intrepidity the last by his played nightcap did you hear the story of his sending a message to lord kilmarnock that he had been practicing how to lie upon the block and had found out the easiest way of receiving the blow was to bite his tongue hard or even if he bit it off it was no matter they should have no farther use for it his behavior seems to have wanted coolness or else to equal that of adrian cato sir t more etc or any of those heroes who had spirit enough to make an ostentation of their unconcern i had from the printed accounts of their behavior an idea of their persons exactly consormable to the description i read afterward in your paper  but enough  you send me sterling matters of fact and i return you tinsel observations  i thank you for accenting cromertie and balmerino i learnt culloden from you before  i have had little company since i saw you  one day indeed i was surprised by a visit from mr thomson author of the seasons  mr lyttelton introduced him  i have not room to tell you all that passed  they praised my place extravagantly  proposed alterations etc thomson was very facetious and very complaisant invited me to his house at richmond there were many things said worth telling but not writing to you  this has been a summer that i have spent more socially than any one these three years i expect a good deal more company this week the next and the week after  lady luxborough talks of coming and i believe will  the visit would bring my little walks into repute  when will the time come that i shall enjoy your company here a month uninterrupted dear sir  yours most faithfully w shenstone  xlii to the same with a new theory of political principles dear mr graves i have lately received a letter from mr whistler which conveys your compliments to me and by so doing prompts me to acknowledge the receipt of your last kind letter i observe you adhere strictly to the apostolical precept of being swift to hear slow to speak the latter part of which i would fain conclude you understand too literally  your neighbor i see is not a little embarrassed with his mills at whitchurch i have long had an eye upon his advertisement in the london evening post and been not a little scandalized thereat what has the name of a poet to do with the publication of lands and tenements or the idea of harmony with the noise of a watermill yet has he extracted music from the subject and mirth from his misfortunes having sent me a ballad upon the miller written with much ease and some drollery  as to the light in which you place your present fortunes i can only say that you have not that situation i could wish you for your own sake for so far as i am concerned in your elevation i can assure you very faithfully that no circumstances in the world could more endear you to my affection or recommend you to my respect than the present my affection you will easily observe from the very nature of affection in general would stand no chance to be increased by your promotion and as for respect if i knew the degree you desired i would acquit myself of it to your satisfaction now and were you settled at lambeth i should expect that you would require no more from me upon that account at least in private so that so far as either deference or friendship is concerned you are an archbishop to me to all intents and purposes  as to figure in the world it depends much i know upon advancement and yet even here you will be ever sure of that kind of weight which ingenuity gives discernable to the smaller indeed but undoubtedly the more valuable part of the world  but this is improper as it is philosophy and as it is advice neither of which is it suitable for me to suggest to you  alcinoo poma etc as to the long series of my lamentations i will not now enter upon the reasonableness of them it is a subject to tell you the truth on which you cannot reply without some danger of hurting me  as for politics you will blame this letter for dwelling so much upon the subject of yours but as for politics i think poets are tories by nature supposing them to be by nature poets  the love of an individual person or family that has worn a crown for many successions is an inclination greatly adapted to the fanciful tribe on the other hand mathematicians abstractreasoners of no manner of attachment to persons at least to the visible part of them but prodigiously devoted to the ideas of virtue liberty and so forth are generally whigs it happens agreeably enough to this maxim that the whigs are friends to that wise plodding unpoetical people the dutch  the tories on the other hand are taken mightily with that shewy ostentatious nation the french foxhunters that reside amongst the beauties of nature and bid defiance to art in short that have intellects of a poetical turn are frequently tories citizens merchants etc that scarce see what nature is and consequently have no pretensions to a poetical taste are i think generally argumentative and whiggish  but perhaps i carry this too far  something there is in it however you will see not that i would apply what i here say to particular revolutions etc i would only advance something general and speculative nor would i approve or condemn by this any one set of people now existing nor would i have you pretend to fish out my party from any thing i have said for i am of none  the letter i sent you last was occasional and when i see you i will tell you the occasion i absolutely agree with you in every tittle of your political observations  i am glad i do for i know the poisonous nature of party and though we are neither violent yet i should fear it my schemes are doubtful at present but my face is set toward bath  i am confident of the service those waters would do me  i hope you will exhilarate me with a letter soon  i would fain have furnished out a letter to amuse you after so long a silence but i find myself unable even as unable as i am to express the regard with which i am  yours w shenstone the leasows april        xliii continuation of the same the leasows may         dear mr graves though i feel an irresistible propensity to write to you this very post yet i cannot say that i am able to advance any thing tending either to your own or my satisfaction  what is worst of all is i cannot fix the time of seeing you with so much precision as i would always endeavor where my pleasure is so much concerned  i will tell you the whole affair  i have for a long season proposed to drink the bath waters this spring and did think of setting out in a weeks time when i received your letter purposing to stay there a month and from thence take a circuit which should indulge me in a sight of you mr whistler and some few others in my way home the latter part of this scheme though far the more agreeable to me was rather doubtful and precarious depending as you express it on the state of my finances after a months continuance at bath which i considered and do consider as a very probable means of bettering my constitution  now i covet to see you so much that i would bring nothing but health in competition  what i wish is that you could with convenience either hasten or delay your journey that you might find me before mine or after my return though i should infinitely and for many reasons prefer the former i long to talk with you particularly now i have much to say in regard to our friends amor to which you alluded in your last i request it as a favor of you that you would conjure him by the friendship i have ever borne him and by any esteem which he has ever professed for me that he would do nothing very material in the affair till i have talked it over and given him my faithful sentiments quod censet amiculus  i am not willing the balance should turn entirely on the whig side i would give it a greater equilibrium if the following suggestion might effect it tories i said have great and sometimes partial affections for the person of a king  we will suppose that kings are alternately good and bad their loyalty to the good one is commendable their partiality to the bad one not to be vindicated whigs have no passion no gratitude toward to the good prince there they are wrong they are severe upon the bad one in which they are justifiable i wish i had not begun these wholesale distinctions this miserable specimen of my politics i protest against all epistolary disputes i am now embarrassed in one on much such another score which fills up all my letter for i love the last word like a scold or a child  i thank you for your little anecdotes from time to time you may depend upon it that i have never heard any thing before for i never do hear any thing  i am one very thankful letter in debt to your neighbor whistler i have at present nothing but the propensity of a good correspondent but i will write soon in the mean time if you see him ask him if he goes to bath or bristol this season  i beg you would write to me directly when you can come and how i may regulate my motions so as to be best assured of seeing you  pray do not neglect a post i am  yours most entirely w s  xliv to the same on the mixture of pleasure and pain the leasows june the last      dear mr graves it is now i believe near half a year since i had the favor of a letter from you when i wrote last i discovered a more than ordinary solicitude for one immediate answer it puzzles me to account for your unusual silence otherwise than upon supposition of some offense you have taken and it puzzles me as much to guess by what behavior of mine i have been so unhappy as to give you that offense  i am vain enough to imagine that the little merit i have deserves somewhat more regard than i have met with from the world be that as it will the disappointment i must undergo by any appearance of neglect from the friends i value would more effectually dispirit me than any other whatsoever  i have published my design of visiting you and mr whistler in oxfordshire to all the world a thousand incidents have hitherto interfered with it which i will not now recount but when i look back upon the regular succession of them it looks as if destiny had some hand in detaining me the most vigorous of my hopes dwell upon seeing you next winter though i am not a little indulgent to those that tell me i may see you long before  i have brought my place here to greater perfection than it has ever yet appeared in and with the mob it is in some vogue nevertheless i do not know that i ever relished it less in my life than i have done this summer bad health bad spirits no company to my mind and no correspondences are enough to blast the sweetest shades and to poison the purest fountains some of these misfortunes i can impute to my own misconduct and it embitters them the two last i can less account for having at all times done all i was able to recommend myself to my friends behaving at the same time with courtesy to the rest of the world the fact is not true otherwise i might resolve it into this that i alone am idle and all the world is busy  i fancy you will imagine i lay too much stress upon mr thomsons visit when i mention the following inscription upon a seat in virgils grove celebmo poetae quae tibi quae tali reddam pro carmine dona nam neque me tantum venientis the verse whispers here sibilus austri nec percussa juvant fluctu tam litora nec quae saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles virg i want your opinion of it and whether it were not better thus  thomson but you will discover at first glance an impropriety in both  now i am upon inscriptions i send you one from a coin dug up very near me a few weeks ago round the head imp  v avg ger dac mon the reverse s p q r optimo principi cos vi within which is an human figure sitting with one hand reclined upon a wand the other as i take it holding forth an olive i have given my opinion it is one of trajans and my virtuoso character will rest upon the truth of it it is a silver coin but very obscure  there appears a large mass of ruins rough stone very strongly cemented where they found it  if you were here it might amuse you  heaviness may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning  i have so settled a notion of the proportionate mixture of pleasure and pain in this life that i expect one to succeed the other as naturally as day and night i own this is owing to the soul as much as to outward incidents sorrow prepares it for mirth and vice versa  the durations of both differ last summer i spent agreeably this quite otherwise today i have been quite melancholy i expect happiness tomorrow from either an aptitude of mind or some incident sufficient to overcome its inaptitude  perhaps that incident may be a letter from you i wish it may and am most truly  yours w s i had a coin of vespasian given me to day and i begin a collection if you have any duplicates you will please to oblige me  i want to correct my elegies by your assistance  i will begin no more    xlv to the same with thoughts on advice the leasows sept         dear mr graves i am under some apprehension that you dread the sight of a letter from me as it seems to lay claim to the compliment of an answer i will therefore write you one that shall wave its privilege at least till such time as your leisure encourages or your present dissipation does not forbid you to send one  i dare now no longer expatiate upon the affair you have in hand it is enough for me if you will excuse the freedom i have taken i have often known delay produce good effects in some cases which even sagacity itself could not surmount and if i thought i did not go too far would presume to recommend it now you know i have very little of the temper of an alderman i almost hate the idea of wealthiness as much as the word it seems to me to carry a notion of fullness stagnation and insignificancy it is this disposition of mine that can alone give any weight to the advice i send you as it proves me not to give it through any partiality to fortune as to what remains you are i hope assured of the value i must ever have for you in any circumstances and the regard i shall always show for any that belongs to you i cannot like you less or more  i now drop into other matters bergen i see is taken at lost pray what are the sentiments of your political companions i dined some time ago with mr lyttelton and mr pit who both agreed it was worth twenty thousand men to the french which is a light in which i never used to consider it any little intimation that you please to confer upon me enables me to seem wise in this country for a month particularly if i take care to adjust my face accordingly as i was returning last sunday from church whom should i meet in my way but that sweetsouled bard mr james thomson in a chaise drawn by two horses lengthways  i welcomed him into the country and asked him to accompany mr lyttelton to the leasows who had offered me a visit which he promised to do so i am in daily expectations of them and all the world this week i fancy they will lavish all their praises upon nature reserving none for poor art and me but if i ever live and am able to perfect my schemes i shall not despair of pleasing the sew i first began with the few friends prejudiced in my favor and then fico por los malignatores censures will not affect me for i am armed so strong in vanity that they will pass by me as the idle wind which i regard not i think it pretty near equal in a country place whether you gain the small number of tasters or the large crowd of the vulgar the latter are more frequently met with and gape stupent and stare much more but one would choose to please a few friends of taste before mob or gentry the great vulgar or the small because therein one gratifies both ones social passions and ones pride that is ones selflove above all things i would wish to please you and if i have a wish that projects or is prominent beyond the rest it is to see you placed to your satisfaction near me but fortune must vary from her usual treatment before she favors me so far  and yet there was a time when one might probably have prevailed on her i knew not what to do  the affair was so intricately circumstanced  your surprising silence after the hint i gave  mr d  offering to serve any friend of mine nay pressing me to use the opportunity  his other relations his guardians teizing him with sure symptoms of a rupture in case of a refusal on their side  mr p  soliciting me if the place were sold which it could not legally be friendship propriety impartiality selfinterest which i little regarded endeavoring to distract me i think i never spent so disagreeable an halfyear since i was born to close the whole i could not foresee the event which is almost foretold in your last letter and i knew i could not serve you but i must render it a necessary one in short when can tell you the whole affair at leisure you will own it to be of such a nature that i must be ever in susence concerning my behavior and of course shall never reflect on it with pleasure believe me with the truest affection  yours w shenstone  xlvi to a friend from the leasows      dear sir it is not much above two hours since i received your obliging letter and i am already set down to answer it  to speak the truth i had almost given you over i imagined you had taken umbrage at some expression or circumstance in my epistle and were determined to make me sensible you did so by your silence i hope this error of mine will serve to establish one rule on both sides  it is what ought i am sure always to take place where people wish a perpetuity of friendship i mean never upon circumstances of disrespect to admit of circumstantial evidence  i am very grave so you may depend on the sincerity of all i shall say i saw several beauties in your former elegy but though it was formosa it did not appear to me ipsa forma i like this that you have now sent very much it has a simplicity which your last a little wanted and has thought enough i begin to be seldom pleased with the compositions of others or my own but i could be really fond of this with a sew alterations that i could propose  but you must know at the same time that these are such as no one would approve beside myself  i know it however there are some seeming faults in it  i have been greatly mortified in my correspondents of late  i even said in my haste all friends are faithless  g after a months expectation which he had confirmed to me of seeing him here let me know about a fortnight since that i had more leisure than him and since it did not suit his convenience to come i ought to take the opportunity of visiting him and seeing derbyshire while he continues in it  w  has not wrote to me these six weeks  outing has been moreover dumb for the same space of time and i purpose in my heart to behave with some distance toward both for this neglect see my rule of circumstantial evidence  it is a pity you cannot spare a day or two to come and see me my wood grows excessively pleasant and its pleasantness vexes me because nobody will come that can taste it  your health according to your description is much the same with mine but from the gaiety of your style and designs i collect that it is greatly better  i have an alcove six elegies a seat two epitaphs one upon myself three ballads four songs and a serpentine river to show you when you come will the compositions come safe to you if i send my book which contains the only copies of several things which i could not remember if they were lost  but i will not send them if my horse gets well i may essay a visit for two days and bring them with me that i may make comments while you read them as beseems a genuine author to do  i am raising a greenhouse from the excrescences of lord dudleys but i do not find that vient lappetit en mangeant that i grow fonder of my collection proportionable as it increases  i should think myself fortunate enough at present if like you i could only find that i had been mentioned for a vacant post but i have withdrawn all my views from courtpreferment and fixed them on finding a pot of money which i determine to be the far more probable scheme  i have little health and frequent mortification so that no one need envy me and yet i believe there are that do are any enviable but such as are unambitious i never shall be able to reckon myself of that tribe which have engrossed all happiness to themselves and left the rest of the world nothing but hopes and possessions yet i do not much feel the pains of ambition while i am conversing with ingenious friends of my own level but in other company it hurts me let me advise you now i think of it to dread the company of silly people outoftheway people and in one word what men of genius call the vulgar you run ten times the risque of being mortified voluntarily or unknowingly amongst the latter of these to what you do amongst men of sense and politeness be they ever so malicious  but my paper is filled  do write soon  xlvii to the same it is somewhere about the  0th of sept      and i write from the leasows dear sir i think i have lived to out correspond almost all my correspondents whether you are the last that is to be subdued i will not say the rest are so fatigued that they are not able to atchieve a line apprized of this and being by nature disposed to have mercy on the vanquished parcere subjectis i seldom write a syllable more than is requisite to further some scheme or ascertain some interview the latter of these being the purpose of this mine epistle i am in great hopes i shall be at liberty to see you ere many weeks be past and would beg of you in the mean time to inform me by a letter when i am likely or when very unlikely to meet you at home i am detained just at present by continual expectations of the hagley family  as i was returning from church on sunday last whom should i meet in a chaise with two horses lengthways but that right friendly bard mr thompson i complimented him upon his arrival in this country and asked him to accompany mr lyttelton to the leasows which he said he would with abundance of pleasure and so we parted you will observe that the more stress i lay upon this visit and the more i discover to you the more substantial is my apology for deferring mine into warwickshire i own i am pleased with the prospect of showing them something at the leasows beyond what they expect i have begun my terras on the high hill i showed you made some considerable improvements in virgils grove and finished a walk from it to the house after a manner which you will approve they are going to build a castle in the park round the lodge which if well executed must have a good effect and they are going likewise to build a rotund to terminate the visto the fault is that they anticipate every thing which i propose to do when i become rich but as that is never likely to be perhaps it is not of any importance  but what i term rich implies no great deal i believe you are a witness to the moderation of my desires and i flatter myself that you will believe your friend in that respect something above the vulgar  creed non illum tibi de scelesta plebe dilectum neque sic fidelem sic lucro aversum potuisse nasci patre pudendo if i come to your house positively i will not go to see mr m  he has been twice as near me as the grange with c  l  and never deemed my place worth seeing i doubt you are a little too modest in praising it wherever you go  why dont you applaud it with both hands utroque pollice  parcentes ego dexteras odi sparge rosas  i am so very partial to my native place that it seems a miracle to me that it is not more famous but i complain unjustly of you for as you have always contributed to my happiness you have taken every opportunity to contribute to my figure i wish i could say the same of some who have it more in their power  i have yet about a thousand things to say to you  not now though  lady l  hs visit i reserve till i see you a coach with a coronet is a pretty kind of phenomenon at my door  few prettier except the face of such a friend as you for i do not want the grace to prefer a generous and spirited friendship to all the gewgaws that ambition can contrive i have wrote out my elegies and heartily wish you had them to look over before i come  i know not how to send them  i shall bring and leave some poetry with you  thus and odores or rather a proper covering for thus and odores and piper and quicquid chartis amicitur ineptis  adieu dear sir believe me ever yours w shenstone  xlviii to the same with a song      dear sir being just returned from a small excursion it was with the utmost pleasure that i read over your letter and though it abounds both in wit and waggery i sit down incontinently to answer it with none  the agreeableness of your letters is now heightened by the surprise they give me i must own i have thought you in a manner lost to the amusements in which you once delighted correspondences works of taste and fancy etc if you think the opinion worth removing you need only favor me with such a letter now and then and i will place you in my imagination where you shall see all the favorites of fortune cringing at your feet  i think i could add about half a dozen hints to your observations on electricity which might at least disguise the facts and then why will you not put it into some newspaper or monthly pamphlet you might discover yourself to whom you have a mind it would give more than ordinary pleasure at this time  some other will take the hint  pity your piece should not have the advantage of novelty as well as wit  i dined and stayed a night with dr e  he was extremely obliging and i am glad of such a friend to visit at b he asked much after you  he showed me his ovid  i advised him to finish some one epistle highly that he might show it  the whole will not take though it goes against me to tell him so i should be glad he could succeed at b and could i serve him it would be with a safe conscience for i take him to excel the rest of b physicians far in point of speculation and diligence etc  i send you the song you asked for and request of you to write me out your new edition of the election verses and at your leisure a copy of the poem which we altered  the lark go tuneful bird that gladdst the skies to daphnes window speed thy way and there on quivering pinions rise and there thy vocal art display and if she deign thy notes to hear and if she praise thy matin song tell her the sounds that sooth her ear to simple british birds belong tell her in livelier plumes arrayed the bird from indian groves may shine but ask the lovely partial maid what are his notes compared to thine then bid her treat that witless beau and all his motley race with scorn and heal deserving damons woe who sings her praise and sings forlorn i am sir your most faithful friend and servant w shenstone have you read watson martyn and freke on electricity i accidently met with the two former by which my head is rendered almost giddy  electrics nonelectrics electrics per se and bodies that are only conductors of electricity have a plaguey bad effect on so vortical a brain as mine  i will infallibly spend a week with you perhaps about february if it suits you though i think too it must be later  i have been painting in water colors during a visit i made flowers i would recommend the amusement to you if you can allow it the time that is expedient  i trust you will give me one entire week in the spring when my e alterations may exhibit themselves to advantage    xlix to the same after a visit sunday feb          dear mr jago i am tempted once more to apologize for the the unseasonable visit i paid you though i feel myself entirely innocent in that respect even as much as the postboy was guilty for had my previous letter arrived in due time you had then been furnished with an opportunity of waving my company till a more convenient season i was only or at least chiefly uneasy upon your account i spent my time very agreeably and only less so than i might had i not been conscious to myself that i was intruding upon domestic tendernesses  i spent the sunday night and the next day at mr wrens and am now just returned from mr dolmans who has made me a genteel present of spences polymetis i have not yet read many dialogues in it but i have dipped in several and have reason to be well enough satisfied with the simple and uninvidious manner in which he has introduced mr lowths poem i have long known of this intended introduction which i accidentally found to have to have been settled betwixt them before i published mine on the same subject and a little dreaded the form of it i have long ago made considerable improvements in mine and have a mind one day to publish it once more after which let it sleep in peace i have sometimes thought of printing my next title page thus viz poems consisting of songs odes and elegies with an improved edition of the judgment of hercules and of the shoolmistress but i have but very few critical acquaintance and i live at a great distance from those i have stationed amongst the makers and the wearers of hobnails far from the joys that with my soul agree from wit from learning  very far from thee parnell i know i have thrown a great number of careless things into your hands i know to whom i entrusted my follies but i know not what they are  i believe in general that they consist of misbegotten embryos and abortive births which it had been merely decent to have buried in  some part of my garden but i was morally assured that you would expose nothing of mine to my disadvantage as to some that are less imperfect you promised your observations and i desire you would make them with the utmost freedom i can bear any censure which you shall pass by way of letter and i beg once more that you would not be sparing it will be esteemed as great a favor as you can do me when they have gone through your hands and those of one or two more friends i shall perhaps think of publishing them though as to that much depends upon the advice i receive and previously on the opportunity i have of receiving i am in hopes that you will be pretty full in discovering to me which you dislike the least what faults you find and what improvements they are capable of i set you a tedious task but i will return the favor as far as i am able either in the same way or any other this brings me to say that if there be any compositions of yours that you would have me to correct and there are several of which i want a copy i would beg you to send them your blackbird excels any singingbird i ever heard and i beseech you to convey it to the leasows by the next opportunity that he may acquire some near other ills and in other valleys than those in which he was produced  i have many compliments to make in your country to mr h  mrs n  mrs j  mr f  mr t  and your brother if i go over to mr w  s i will assuredly call and spend a night with you  that is precarious  but whether i do or not i would willingly hope to see you this spring and summer more than once as a critic and as a friend nor do i forget the promise of mr h  and mr f   but of these things more when i send for the papers which i purpose to do tomorrow fortnight that is the twentyninth of february  i have suffered greatly by railing at the black button on a parsons great coat had mr halls been thus distinguished he could not have mistaken mine for his own which latter i sent in order to be commuted at birmingham and was almost starved to death before i could accomplish the exchange there is no trifling with any part of orthodoxy with impunity  that is the moral  i have received a very obliging letter from lady luxborough wherein she tells me that lady hartford admires my place in her description mr thomson is intimate at lady hartfords and i suppose lady hartford may have been informed by l l that mr thomson has been here so i conclude in mere vanity that my farm is advancing in reputation  what think you of mr cartes history or what of his narrative concerning the pretenders touching for the kings evil i think one is not however to give up his book entirely because with all his superstition he may have several anecdotes that one would like to read  i have had great expectations from the beautiful veins of a piece of oak of which i have had a table made but upon a thorough survey of it it is so like nothing in the world as old b  s callimanco nightgown  i have nothing to add worth beginning upon another page but i happened not to make a regular conclusion in my preceding one  you must give me some time to color you a collection of flowers that octavo edition i showed you here and then i will make mrs jago a present of it i believe i can engage mr dolman to assist me who is much my superior in point of accuracy and the inscription at the beginning is to run somehow thus elegantissimae pvellae that is by trade a garlandmaker but this inscription i may alter if i can think of any thing more expressive of the regard which i have ever borne and still bare you  lord dudley is gone and franks are no more i have nothing to wish you but health and preferment  det vitam det opes   with these you will easily compound that cordial happiness having every other ingredient that is requisite at hand  i am most affectionately your very faithful friend etc w shenstone  l to mr jago the leasows mar          dear sir i have sent tom over for the papers which i left under your inspection have nothing to to add upon this head but that the more freely and particularly you give me your opinion the greater will be the obligation which i shall have to acknowledge  i shall be very glad if i happen to receive a good large bundle of your own compositions in regard to which i will observe any commands which you shall please to lay upon me  i am favored with a certain correspondence by way of letter which i told you i should be glad to cultivate and i find it very entertaining  pray did you receive my answer to your last letter sent by way of london i should be extremely sorry to be debarred the pleasure of writing to you by the post as often as i feel a violent propensity to describe the notable incidents of my life which amount to about as much as the tinsel of your little boys hobbyhorse  i am on the point of purchasing a couple of busts for the niches in my hall and believe me my good friend i never proceed one step in ornamenting my little farm but i enjoy the hopes of rendering it more agreeable to you and the small circle of acquaintance who sometimes favor me with their company  i shall be extremely glad to see you and mr fancourt when the trees are green that is in may but i would not have you content yourself with a single visit this summer if mr hardy to whom you will make my compliments inclines to favor me so far you must calculate so as to wait on him whenever he finds it convenient though i have better hopes of making his reception here agreeable to him when my lord dudley comes down  i wonder how he would like the scheme i am upon of exchanging a large tankard for a silver standish  i have had a couple of paintings given me since you were here one of them is a madona valued as it is said at ten guineas in italy but which you would hardly purchase at the price of five shillings however i am endeavoring to make it out to be one of carlo maratts who was a first hand and famous for madonas even so as to be nicknamed cartuccio delle madonne by salvator rosa two letters of the cipher cm agree what shall i do with regard to the third it is a small piece and sadly blackened it is about the size though not quite the shape of the bacchus over the parlour door and has much such a frame  a person may amuse himself almost as cheaply as he pleases i find no small delight in rearing all sorts of poultry geese turkeys pullets ducks etc i am also somewhat smitten with a blackbird which i have purchased a very sine one brother by father but not by mother to the unfortunate bird you so beautifully describe a copy of which description you must not fail to send me  but as i said before one may easily habituate ones self to cheap amusements that is rural ones for all town amusements are horridly expensive  i would have you cultivate your garden plant flowers have a bird or two in the hall they will at least amuse your children write now and then a song buy now and then a book write now and then a letter to  your most sincere friend and affectionate servant w shenstone p s i hope you have exausted all your spirit of criticism upon my verses that you may have none left to cavil as this letter for i am ashamed to think that you in particular should receive the dullest i ever wrote in my life make my compliments to mrs jago  she can go a little abroad you say  tell her i should be proud to show her the leasows adieu    li to mr  on his marriage this was written august         but not sent till the   th dear sir how little soever i am inclined to write at this time i cannot bear that you should censure me of unkindness in seeming to overlook the late change in your situation it will i hope be esteemed superfluous in me to send you my most cordial wishes that you may be happy but it will perhaps be something more significant to say that i believe you will building my opinion on the knowledge i have long had of your own temper and the account you give me of the persons whom you have made choice of to whom i desire you to pay my sincere and most affectionate compliments  i shall always be glad to find you praesentibus aequum though i should always be pleased when i saw you tentantem majora i think you should neglect no opportunity at this time of life to push your fortune so far as an elegant competency that you be not embarrassed with those kind of solicitudes toward the evening of your day ne te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido ne pavor and rerum mediocriter utilium spes i would have you acquire if possible what the world calls with some propriety an easy fortune and what i interpret such a fortune as allows of some inaccuracy and inattention that one may not be continually in suspense about the laying out a shilling  this kind of advice may seem extremely dogmatical in me but if it carries any haughty air i will obviate it by owning that i never acted as i say i have lost my road to happiness i confess and instead of pursuing the way to the fine lawns and venerable oaks which distinguish the region of it i am got into the pitiful parterregarden of amusement and view the nobler scenes at a distance i think i can see the road too that leads the better way and can show it others but i have many miles to measure back before i can get into it myself and no kind of resolution to take a single step my chief amusements at present are the same they have long been and lie scattered about my farm the french have what they call a parque ornee i suppose approaching about as near to a garden as the park at hagley i give my place the title of a ferme ornee though if i had money i should hardly confine myself to such decorations as that name requires i have made great improvements and the consequence is that i long to have you see them  i have not heard whether miss  s match proceeded  i suppose your objections were grounded on the persons age and temper and that they had the less weight as they supposed you acted indiscreetly yourself i can say but little on the occasion you know  better than i do only this i must add that i have so great an esteem for your sister that it will be necessary to my ease that whoever marries her she should be happy  i have little hopes that i shall now see you often in this country though it would be you in all probability as soon as any that would take a journey of fifty miles to see the poorest of the sons of men the truth is my affairs are miserably embroiled by my own negligence and the nonpayment of tenants i believe i shall be forced to seize on one next week for three years and a halfs rent due last lady day an affair to which i am greatly averse but through indolence and compassion i hope however i shall be always able as i am sure i shall be desirous to entertain a friend of a philosophical regimen such as you and mr whistler and that will be all i can do  hagleypark is considerably improved since you were here and they have built a castle by way of ruin on the highest part of it which is just seen from my wood but by the removal of a tree or two growing in a wood that joins to the park and which fortunately enough belongs to mr dolman and me i believe it may be rendered a considerable object here  i purpose to write to mr whistler either this post or the next the fears you seemed in upon my account are very kind but have no grounds i am dear mr  habitually and sincerely  your most affectionate w shenstone my humble service to your neighbors  smith whom you knew at derby will publish a print of my grove in a small collection    lii to mr jago with an invitation to the leasows sept   saturday night      dear mr jago i hardly know whether it will be prudent in me to own that i wrote you a long letter upon the receipt of your last which i now have upon my table i condemn this habit in myself entirely and should i am sure be very unhappy if my friends by my example should be induced to contract the same the truth is i had not expressed myself in it to my mind and it was full of blots and blunders and interlinings yet such as it was it had wearied my attention and given me a disinclination to begin it a fresh i am now impatient to remove any scruple you may have concerning my grateful sense of all your favors and the invariable continuance of my affection and esteem  i find by your last obliging letter that my machinations and devices are not entirely private  you knew of my draught of hagley castle about the bigness of a barleycorn you knew of our intended visit to lady luxboroughs and i must add mr thomas hall knew of my contrivance for the embellishment of mr hardys house nothing is there hid that shall not be revealed  our visit to barrels is now over and pad  lady luxborough has seen hagley castle in the original  and as to my desire that my draught might be shown to no christian soul you surely did but ill with it when you showed that drawing to a clergyman however you may have acted up to my real meaning if you have taken care not to show it to any connoisseur i meant chiefly to guard against any one that knows the rules in whose eyes i am sure it would not turn to my credit  pray how do you like the festoons dangling over the oval windows  it is the chief advantage in repairing an old house that one may deviate from the rules without any extraordinary censure  i will not trouble you now with many particulars the intent of toms coming is to desire your company and mrs jagos this week  i should be extremely glad if your convenience would allow you to come on monday or tuesday but if it is entirely impracticable i would beseech you not to put off the visit longer than the monday following for the leaves of my groves begin to fall a great pace i beg once more you would let no small inconvenience prevent your being here on monday  as to my visit at icheneton you may depend upon it soon after and i hope you will not stand upon punctilio when i mention my inclination that you may all take a walk through my coppices before their beauty is much impaired were i in a sprightly vein i would aim at saying something genteel by way of answer to mrs jagos compliment  as it is i can only thank her for the substance and applaud the politeness of it  i postpone all other matters till i see you i am habitually and sincerely  your most affectionate friend w shenstone i beg my compliments to mr hardy   p s i am not accustomed my dear friend to send you a blank page nor can i be content to do so now  i thank you very sensibly for the verses with which you honor me i think them good lines and so do others that have seen them but you will give me leave when i see you to propose some little alteration as to an epistle it would be executed with difficulty and i would have it turn to your credit as well as my own but you have certainly of late acquired an case in writing and i am tempted to think that what you write henceforth will be universally good persons that have seen your elegies like  the blackbirds best as it is most assuredly the most correct but i who pretend to great penetration can foresee that the linnets will be made to excel  more of this when i see you poor miss g  j  r  says is married and poor mr thomson mr pit tells me is dead  he was to have been at hagley this week and then i should probably have seen him here  as it is i will erect an urn in virgils grove to his memory  i was really as much shocked to hear of his death as if i had known and loved him for a number of years  god knows i lean on a very few friends and if they drop me i become a wretched misanthrope    liii to the same sunday night sept         dear mr jago i take this opportunity of acknowledging the justice of your excuses mrs jagos present circstances render her visit quite impracticable and yours i have the same kind of reason to dispense with as i guess that she could as soon take a journey herself at this time as bear that you should  but to say i was not greatly mortified would be doing myself the greatest injustice disappointed i was you may be sure to hear excuses even as much as sir john falstaff when mr dombledon put him in mind of security instead of sending him two and thirty yards of satin to make him a short cloak and on the whole i began to accuse you and mrs jago of colloguing together to fix your visit at a time when you were well assured you should have an apology to send me instead now if i should press this accusation pray how would you evade the force of it  the next thing i am to speak to is your verses i have made you my acknowledgments before and as you are so good as to accept them i will not trouble you with additional professions or repetitions of the past i will depend upon your goodsense for an excuse if i only add what i think proper as to any alteration wherein i have a view to your credit as my own i confess it requires some nicety to inscribe such an elegy as the goldfinches without the danger you foresaw but i think it may be done and is pretty nearly in such manner as no man of taste will be tempted to ridicule it and as for the vulgar of whatever rank they be it is absolutely necessary many times to give them up taste and tenderness are absolutely connected and you may very readily call to mind some charming things that must excite the laughter of your men of fire and banter but are by no means thought the worse of by men of true genius i will only mention andrew marvels fawn in drydens miscellanies i enclose the elegy with some few proposed alterations so i will not risque the silling my letter with criticism i also enclose the other verses you sent me which i think good ones and to stand in need of little alteration beside that of the inglorious name at the head of them to which notwithstanding i will never submit pray who is the young gentleman that translates your elegy into latin  the new dress will give you some amusement and if these lines be the product of the genius of a boy of that age he will in a years time be able to extend the same of your compositions i shall then be glad to see the gold finches under his hand though i have no extraordinary fondness for the latin poetry of a modern at least till your eldest son begins to translate our madrigals  i have not yet seen mr thomsons castle of indolence  i waited for a smaller edition but am now too impatient not to send for it on thursday next  i am fully bent on raising a neat urn to him in my lower grove if mr lyttelton does not inscribe one at hagley before me but i should be extremely glad of your advice whereabouts to place it  you speak of my dwelling in the castle of indolence and i verily believe i do there is something like enchantment in my present inactivity for without any kind of let or impediment to the correction of my trifles that i see i am in no wise able to make the leaft advances i think within myself i could proceed if you were here and yet i have reason to believe if you were here we should only ramble round the groves and chat away the time and perhaps that upon the whole is of full as much importance  i do not know but i do myself some little injustice here for i have wrote out my levities and my sonnets good and bad with many ornaments from the pencil and the next thing i do will be to transcribe my elegies the fault is i take no pains to improve what i transcribe and consequently am only able to exhibit my nonsense in a fairer dress  you must give me leave ere it be long to insert two or three lines i think in verse before mrs jagos flowerpiece  i am sure i am obliged to her for a fruit i greatly love  it was not entirely ripe but it was the only one i have tasted since i was last in london  yesterday dined here lady luxborough mr outing and mr hall lord dudley miss lea counselor corbet and mr sanders mr perry mrs perry and miss dolman and half a dozen footmen beside my own servants and laborers so you may guess we had no small fracas i now sit down amid solitude and silence and can hear little else beside the pendulum of my clock  yet my spirits are no way sunk but afford me just such a temperature of mind as inclines me to write to some familiar friend albeit i have a thousand things to talk of to you which i do not care to write i hope to be able to spend a few days with mr hardy before his melons are all gone and yet i would not have him keep one a moment longer upon my account i desire he would accept of my compliments as i trust he will  franks at present run low with me but i send you one which you cannot use so soon but i shall be able to send you others immediately i wish i could send you any thing more than the means of obliging  sir your most affectionate friend w s  live to the same sunday nov    dear sir i must fairly own that i have not sat down till now to return my acknowledgments for your last most obliging favor and yet i have been doing so in imagination almost every day since i received it i have only to desire that you would not think me stupid and then you must of course conclude me highly delighted to find the verses which had so greatly pleased me made so particularly interesting to me in testimony hereof i have caused these my letters to be made patent etc furthermore i am glad to see you dissent from some alterations i proposed for which generally speaking i think i can see your reasons as to any little matter which i have to mention farther i choose to defer it till i wait on mr hardy which i purpose to do before this month is out it may possibly happen the beginning of the next week but i dare not lay such stress upon a future event as to give you a commission to say so much to him instead thereof please to make him my compliments and tell him i talk of coming very soon  i borrowed dodsleys miscellany of lady luxborough in which are many good things i long to be making a mark on the head of every copy as i would do were the books my own here a cipher there an asterism of five points and there one of eight  if you and mr w  and mr g  and i were together for a fortnight to correct and revise might not we make a miscellany of originals that would sell  my fingers itch to be at it  but i fear it cannot be  thomsons poem amused me greatly  i think his plan has faults particularly that he should have said nothing of the diseases attending laziness in his first canto but reserved them to strike us more affectingly in the last but on the whole who would have thought that thomson could have so well imitated a person remarkable for simplicity both of sentiment and phrase  i study no connections in a letter and so i proceed to tell you that i have got a machine to exhibit landscapes etc to advantage it costs about fourteen shillings and i recommend one to you or mr hardy  smiths views with a little coloring appear ravishingly  but if you are not content with amusement and want fame which differs about as much as foxhunting from harehunting you must print  however if you can acquiesce in a limited reputation to give you a proper weight at all your visitingplaces which i think enough for all reasonable ends and purposes take the following receipt  a receipt to make fame take a shoemaker into your parlour that is reputed a good workman and bid him procure a piece of red or blue morocco leather let him shape this into the size of a quarter of a sheet of paper or it may be something larger let him double it in such a manner as to leave some part to wrap over then stitch it neatly at the ends lining it either with silk or the best yellow leather he can meet with then must you bespeak a silver clasp which you may have gilded but be sure it be neatly chased and properly annexed to the aforesaid morocco leather make a present of this to the prettiest girl you know but filled with half a dozen of your best compositions take care that one be in praise of her ingenuity for modesty sake desire her not to show them to any living soul but at the same time be careful that your clasp be splendid and your lettercase made according to the foregoing direction  adieu seriously yours w s  lv to a friend disappointing him of a visit june      fie on mr n  he has disappointed me of the most seasonable visit that heart could wish or desire  my flowers in blossom my walks newly cleaned my neighbors invited and i languishing for lack of your company mean time you are going to dance attendance on a courtier  would to god he may disappoint you according to the usual practice of those gentlemen  i mean by giving you a far better living than you ever expected  i have no sooner made that i am ready to recall that wish in order to substitute another in its place which is that you may rather squat yourself down upon a fat goose living in warwickshire or one in staffordshire or perhaps worcestershire of the same denomination i do not mention shropshire because i think i am more remote from the main body of that county than i am from either of the others but nevertheless by all means wait on mr n  show him all respect yet so as not to lay out any of the profits of your contingent living in a black velvet waistcoat and breeches to appear before him true merit needs naught of this besides peradventure you may not receive the first quarters income of it this half year he will probably do something for you one time or other but you shall never go into ireland that is certain for less than a deanery not for less than the deanery of st patricks if you take my advice lower your hopes only to advance your surprise  grata supervenient quae non sperabimus come to me as you may a week is elapsed since you began to be detained you may surely come over in a fortnight now at farthest  i will be at home  however write directly you know our letters are long upon their journey  i expected you the beginning of every week till i received your last letter impatiently  for my part i began to wean myself from all hopes and expectations whatever  i feed my wildducks and i water my carnations happy enough if i could extinguish my ambition quite or indulge what i hope i feel in an equal degree the desire of being something more beneficial in my sphere  perhaps some few other circumstances would want also to be adjusted  i have just read lord bolingbrokes three letters which i like as much as most pieces of politics i ever read i admire especially the spirit of the style i as much admire at the editors unpopular preface  i know the family hitherto seemed to make it a point to conceal popes affair and now the editor under lord bs inspection not only relates but invites people to think the worst of it  what collateral reasons my lord may have for thinking ill of mr pope i cannot say but surely it is not political to lessen a persons character that had done one so much honor  i am dear sir your affectionate w shenstone i have this moment received a long letter from lady luxborough and you are to look on all i said concerning both lord bolingbrokes affair and her resentment as premature my ladys daughter and soninlaw visit her next week    lvi to mr jago from the leasows as it appears on a rainy evening june      dear sir it would probably be so long before you can receive this letter by the post that i cannot think of subjecting my thanks for your last or my hopes of seeing you soon to such an uncertainty  i shall not now have it in my power to meet you at mr wrens immediately so would lose no time in requesting your company here next week if you please i hope mrs jago also will accompany you and that you will set out the first day of the next week even monday that you may not leave me in less than six days time under a pretense of necessity as to the verses you were so kind to convey i will take occasion when you come  to find out like a friend something to blame and mickle to commend so i say no more at present on that head  i love to read verses but i write none petit nihil me sicut ante juvat scribere  i will not say none for i wrote the following at breakfast yesterday and they are all i have wrote since i saw you they are now in one of the roothouses of virgils grove for the admonition of my good friends the vulgar of whom i have multitudes every sunday evening and who very fortunately believe in fairies and are no judges of poetry  here in cool grot and mossy cell we tripping fawns and fairies dwell though rarely seen by mortal eye often as the moon ascended high darts through yon limes her quivering beam we frisk it near this crystal stream then fear to spoil these sacred bowers nor wound the shrubs nor crop the flowers so may your path with sweets abound so may your couch with rest be crowned but illbetide or nymph or swain who dares these hallowed haunts profane oberon i suppose the rotund at hagley is completed but i have not seen it hitherto neither do i often journey or visit any where except when a shrub or flower is upon the point of blossoming near my walks  i forget one visit i lately made in my neighborhood to a young clergyman of taste and ingenuity his name is pixell he plays finely upon the violin and very well upon the harpsichord has set many things to music some in the soft way with which i was much delighted he is young and has time to improve himself he gave me an opportunity of being acquainted with him by frequently visiting and introducing company to my walks  i met him one morning with an italian in my grove and our acquaintance has been growing ever since  he has a share in an estate that is near me and lives there at present but i doubt will not do so long  when you come i will send for him  have you read my lord bolingbrokes essays on patriotism etc and have you read merope and do you take in the magazin des londres and pray how does your garden flourish i warrant you do not yet know the difference betwixt a ranunculus and an anemone  god help ye  come to me and be informed of the nature of all plants from the cedar on mount lebanon to the hyssop that springs out of the wall  pray do not fail to decorate your new garden whence you may transplant all kinds of flowers into your verses if by chance you make a visit at i  fifty years hence from some distant part of england shall you forget this little angle where you used to muse and sing  en unquam etc post aliquot tua regna videns mirabere aristas i expect by the return of tom to receive a trifle that will amuse you it is a gold seal of vidas head given by virtue to a relation of mine who published vida and introduced virtue into business  perhaps you remember mr triftram of hampton and the day we spent there from school it was his  i am very cordially yours w shenstone  lvii to the same      dear sir it is now sunday evening and i have been exhibiting myself in my walks to no less than a hundred and fifty people and that with no less state and vanity than a turk in his seraglio  i have some hopes of seeing you this week but if these should happen to be frustrated i shall find them revive with double ardour and vivacity the next did you tell me of a treatise that your mr millar had where the author endeavors to vindicate and establish gothic architecture and does not the same man explain it also by draughts on copper plates that very book or rather the title and the authors name i want  i shall never i believe be entirely partial to goths or vandals either but i think by the assistance of some such treatise i could sketch out some charming gothic temples and gothic benches for garden seats  i do also esteem it extremely ridiculous to permit another person to design for you when by sketching out your own plans you appropriate the merit of all you build and feel a double pleasure from any praises which it receives  i had here last wednesday dean lyttelton mr william lyttelton commodore west miss lyttelton and miss west they drank tea and went round my walks where they seemed astonished they had been so long ignorant of the beauties of the place said in general every thing that was complaisant or friendly and left me highly delighted with their visit and with room to hope for many more mean time why do not you come i do say you are not pylades  what you think because you have an agreeable wife and five fine children that you must employ all your time in caressing them at home or laying schemes for their emolument abroad is this public spirit is this virtue or if it be virtue do thou think because thou art vartuous there must be no cakes and ale is it not your duty to partake of them with a friend sometimes easing and relieving him under what boileau calls le penible fardeau de navoir rien a fair and what pope  stealing from the former denominates the pains and penalties of idleness  pray come the first day of the week and let mr fancourt accompany you  i have not much to add by way of news the duke of somerset is going to lay out thirty thousand pounds upon northumberlandhouse nine houses to be purchased and pulled down on the other side the strand for stables the strand there to be widened i cannot tell you half but one thing more i will which is that there will be a chapel on one side of the quadrangle with a gothic wainscot and cieling and painted glass and in it a dutch stove contrived so as to look like a tomb with an urn upon it  what need i write all this am i not to see you in a few days  not a word more positively having what may serve to assure you that i am dear sir  inviolably yours w shenstone the leasows july        lviii to the same the leasows march         0 dear sir though i have not hitherto troubled you with a letter i have not been void either of inquiry or information concerning the state of your affairs and of mr hardys health indeed it is now several weeks since i collected some particulars from your brother and i am now impatient for further intelligence as to the circumstances of our friendly reception at wroxall mr john jago has probably enough acquainted you with them he would however seduce me to give you a distinct account being assured as he says that mr wrens behavior must afford a good subject for drollery i do not know how far this would be proper but i think when i write again to my friend wren to give him a sketch of his own character just as it appeared to us during the time of our visit perhaps it may avail a little amidst his violent passion for gardening if he would but prune away some wild excrescences from one or two branches of his character he might bring himself to bear good fruit he should weed his mind a little where there has sprung up a most luxuriant crop of puns that threaten to choke all its wholesome productions spinas animo fortius quam agro evellat he has good sense and goodnature pity he should disguise them  not but that it is better to have the substance alone than the forms alone and so i conclude since i came home i have done little else than plant bushes hazel hawthorn crabtree elder etc together with some flowering shrubs that i have had given me and some that i have purchased to the amount of twenty shillings i think nothing remarkable has occurred only one miserable tempestuous day i had my lord stamford who called to see my walks my lord promised to come again in the summer and invited me more than once to enville by the way he is now building a gothic greenhouse by mr millers direction and intends to build castles and godknowswhat by all accounts the place is well worth seeing when you come in to the country which i hope you will not fail to do this spring pray do not you embroil me with mr miller in regard to any observations i made in his walks remember there were a great many things with which i was highly delighted and forget that there were a few also which i seemed less to admire indeed i thought it idle to regulate my expressions amongst friends only by the same rules which i ought to observe in mixed company i say ought for he has been exceedingly favorable to me in his representation of the leasows  i hope to see mr fancourt with you when you come this spring and why not your brother he can spend half a week every now and then at wroxal  i have nothing to insert or enclose in this letter that can render it at all agreeable  i cannot write i cannot think i can just muster up attention enough to give orders to my workmen i saunter about my grounds take snuff and read clarissa this last part of my employment threatens to grow extremely tedious not but the author is a man of genius and nice observation but he might be less prolix i will send you the life of socrates when i can get it home from barrels i wish both your circumstances and mine would allow of an utter inattention to them and then i believe our natural indolence would be a kind of match for our ambition i shall probably enlarge my acquaintance this year but what does it the circle of my friends with whom i can be easy and amused much will continue small as ever i could dwell a good deal upon this subject but i have only room to desire you would give me your opinion how i should inscribe my urn to mr somerville author of the chase cannot be tolerably expressed in latin without a circumlocution i aim at brevity and would therefore omit it pray read over the specimens i have thrown together and oblige me with a speedy answer if it extend to nothing else besides yours and mrs jagos health which i ought at this time more particularly to enquire after i am  your most affectionate and faithful friend w shenstone  lix to the same june       0 dear sir i acknowledge myself obliged to you for procuring me the pictures i received them both very safe as i have a pretty strong assurance i shall do most articles of which my servant tom has the care  he has punctuality and management to alone for his imperfections he brought me these papersculled busts from wroxall entirely unhurt contrary to the expectation of all that saw them after which he might undertake for almost any thing  the portrait is undoubtedly a good one i showed it to mr smart who is a painter himself though a clergyman and he allowed as much added also that it had something of sir godfrey kneller as well as of sir peter lely  the flowerpiece is very good so far as relates to the flowers the dog and parrot abominable and the grapes very exceptionable i never consider the two flowerpieces at icheneton with attention enough to cause a preference having never any thoughts that either would fall to my share i shall add nothing with regard to your choice but that i sincerely hope yours is the better piece i never heard of casteels i own nor can i find his name in any of my accounts of the painters though they take in pretty modern ones but i can say this for your comfort that if he excelled in any thing it was probably in flowers for i see his name at the bottom of those flowerpieces that i have in water colors as the designer of them and i think the designs are good though i could wish neither the cupid nor the fruitpiece had escaped us yet is there no blame to be laid at your door at least supposing that you are endowed with nothing more than rational conjecture and that you are not gifted with prophecy  and now having spoken i think to most parts of your letter i proceed to say a word or two in the way of appendix first then after five or six weeks work of masons and carpenters i plainly discover that my house is an unfinishable thing  and yet i persuade myself there will never be wanting a room in it where you may spend an agreeable day with your undoubted friend  did i ever tell you how unseasonably the three fiddles struck up in my grove about an hour after you left me and how a set of ten bells was heard from my wood the evening after it might have passed for the harmony of some aerial spirit who was a wellwisher to us poor mortals but that i think had it been so it would have been addressed to the better sort and of consequence have been heard whilst you were here this by way of introduction to what i am going to tell you mr pixell has made an agreement with his club at birmingham to give me a days music in some part of my walks the time is not yet fixed but if you were an idle man and could be brought over at a day or twos notice i would give it you and be in hopes i could entertain you very agreeably  you cannot think how much you gratified my vanity when you were here by saying that if this place were yours you thought you should be less able to keep within the bounds of aeconomy than myself  god knows it is pain and grief to me to observe her rules at all and rigidly i never can  how is it possible to possess improveable scenes and not wish to improve them and how is it possible with economy to be at the expense of improving them upon my fortune to be continually in fear of excess in perfecting every trifling design how irksome to be restrained from attempting any how vexatious so that i never can enjoy my situation  that is certain  economy that invidious old matron on occasion of ever frivolous expense makes such a hellish squalling that the murmur of a cascade is utterly lost to me  often do i cry out with cowley o rivers brooks when when in you shall i myself eased of unpeaceful thought espy o woods and groves when when shall i be made the happy tenant of your shade   paper fails abruptly therefore but sincerely and affectionately  i am dear sir yours w shenstone  lx to c  w  esquire the leasows sept      0 dear sir pray is laziness an excuse for not writing tell me  however if it be so i am afraid i shall want an excuse for laziness like the philosopher who supposing the world might rest upon a tortoises back found himself no less embarrassed for a pedestal to support his tortoise i have indeed been pretty busy at home in raising a pooldam and have interchanged a few visits with such of my acquaintance as live within three miles  what then  i abominate all excuses that are grounded upon the business or amusements of an idle man  as if such a persons time was so wholly filled up that he could not find half an hour to write a line to his friend it is best to acknowledge laziness at first and that there are particular intervals when one is much less disposed to write even a sew lines than at others and then as to laziness one has nothing to do but to plead human frailty which if a person has not too many frailties besides may perhaps be indulged him however veniam petimusque damusque will not fail to weigh with every goodnatured man the chief dealing i have with harris the jew is for the intelligence which he brings me concerning you and mrs w  but it seldom amounts to much more than that you are well and in your garden  he is an ebrew jew or he would tell me you had purchased a couple of genteel horses or a chaise and pair and were coming over to the leasows to spend a week with me  nevertheless i hope to see you soon but en passant i assure you i shall go in about a month to mr jagos and from thence to mr millers who i believe i told you was here with mr lyttelton lady aylesbury colonel conway etc i think i never answered your query concerning colonel lyttelton  he is the same person that you remember and your prophecy concerning him has been literally accomplished he is a man of courage genius generosity and politeness has been fortunate in the world was made a colonel at about six and twenty distinguished himself in several campaigns married the duchess of bridgewater and had the other day about sixteen thousand pounds lest him by colonel jefferies a very distant relation he has a seat and speaks in the house of commons has bought a town and country house the latter of which he is ornamenting in the modern way his duchess the most unceremonious eventempered woman that lives  so enjoy the spirit of prophecy and exert it again  it needs little more than good sense  which of the historians is it that foretold in his history a very remarkable series of events by dint of this alone and which were all accomplished let me know what you are doing now have you repaired the farmhouse you talked of  and have you remembered to make the man a couple of good large niches in his chimney corner where he and his family may spend a more comfortable evening than was ever spent by any first minister in christendom  perhaps also converse more to the purpose you tell me nothing of your mr jago seignior benedict the new married man tell him to leave his wife and family for a day or two saddle his mule and come to the leasows  tell him all pleasures are heightened by a little discontinuance  tell him did i say how can you for shame advise him so contrarily to your own practice  believe me dear sir very faithfully yours w shenstone  lxi to c  w  esquire the leasows nov      0 dear sir it never can be that i owe you for three letters as to two i will agree with you one that i received together with my books and the other soon after but that i am indebted for more than these  credat judaeus apella non ego even that same judaeus apella who affords me this very opportunity of sending my compliments to you and mrs w  and of assuring you that if i had not proposed to have seen you i had wrote to you long ago  master harris talks very respectfully of your garden and we have no dispute save only in one point he says that you labor very hard in your vocation whereas i am not willing to allow that all the work you ever did or will do in it is worth a single bunch of radishes however i dare not contradict him too much because he waits for my letter  how happy are you that can hold up your spade and cry avaunt satan when a toyman offers you his deceitful vanities do not you rejoice inwardly and pride yourself greatly in your own philosophy twas thus  the wise athenian crossed a glittering fair unmoved by tongues and sights he walked the place through tape tags tinsel gimp perfume and lace then bends from marss hill his awful eyes and what a world i never want he cries parnel mean time do not despise others that can find any needful amusement in what i think bunyan very aptly calls vanity fair i have been at it many times this season and i have bought many kinds of merchandise there it is a part of philosopy to adapt ones passions to ones way of life and the solitary unsocial sphere in which i move makes me think it happy that i can retain a relish for such trifles as i can draw into it mean time i dare not reason too much upon this head reason like the famous concave mirror at paris would in two minutes vitrify all the jews pack i mean that it would immediately destroy all the form color and beauty of every thing that is not merely useful  but i ramble too far and you do not want such speculations my intent when i sat down was to tell you that i shall probably see you very soon and certainly remain in the mean time and at all times sir  your obliged and very faithful servant w shenstone  lxii to a friend on various subjects    0 dear mr  with the utmost gratitude for the observations which you sent me and with the highest opinion of their propriety in general do i sit down to answer your obliging letter you will not take it amiss i know if i scrible broken hints and trace out little sketches of my mind just as i should go near to explain it if i were upon the spot as often as i think of you which i beg leave to assure you happens many times in a day they say a word to the wise is enough a word therefore to a friend of understanding may be supposed to be something more than enough because it is probable he is acquainted with three parts of ones mind before  the censure you have passed upon miltons lycidas so far as it regards the meter which he has chosen is unexceptionably just and one would imagine if that argument concerning the distance of the rhimes were pressed home in a public essay it should be sufficient to extirpate that kind of verse for ever as to my opinion concerning the choice of english meter i dare not touch upon the subject and i will give you my reason i began upon it in a letter which i intended for you about a month ago and i soon found that i had filled a sheet of paper with my dissertation and left no room for other things which i had more mind to communicate beside i sound it so blotted that i did not choose to send it and as the subject is so extremely copious i shall decline it entirely till talking may prove as effectual as writing  as to your advice with regard to my publications i believe it to be just and shall in all probability pursue it  i am afraid by your account that dodsley has published my name to the schoolmistress i was a good deal displeased at his publishing that poem without my knowledge when he had so many opportunities of giving me some previous information but as he would probably disregard my resentment i chose to stifle it and wrote to him directly upon the receipt of yours that i would be glad to furnish him with an improved copy of the school mistress etc for his second edition he accepts it with some complaisance desires it soon and i am at a fault to have the opinion of my friends what alterations or additions it will be proper to insert i have scribled a copy which i send this day to mr graves and mr whistler but i am greatly fearful i shall not receive their criticisms time enough and i shall have the same longing for yours a journey to whitchurch which i have long proposed might unite all these advantages and i heartily wish i may be able to effect it without inconvenience if i go thither i call on you  i am ever and entirely yours w shenstone  lxiii to the same the leasows march         dear sir what a stupid fool was i to show you those letters of my friend graves wherein he declares himself so freely against a regular correspondence see the effects of it you have taken immediate advantage of his example and i must never more expect an answer to any letter that i send you in less than half a century i wrote to you after i came home to thank you for all your kindness at i  etc but not a syllable have i been able to receive from you or a word that i could hear concerning you i could however very easily convince you that mr graves your precedent is not altogether so hardened an offender as you may imagine his last letter is a very affectionate recantation i enclose that part of it which regards mr f   what a number of schemes are irreparably broken by the sudden death of the prince of wales yours my good friend which seems to be destroyed amongst the rest has i think of late given you no solicitude your interest in mr n  will remain the same i suppose and if he would but serve you nearer home i will have no sort of quarrel with him that he did not transplant you into cornwall  it is at least some gratification to a persons self love when one finds the more ambitious hopes of more aspiring people as liable to be suddenly extinguished as ones own however the death of the prince gave me a good deal of concern though it no way affected my particular interest as he had all the humane affable and generous qualities which could recommend him to ones affection  mr graves has sent me two copies of verses one on medals to mr walker and the other on the late memoirs of the london heroines lady v  mrs pilkington and mrs phillips both good in their way which you shall see when you come over  have you seen the first books of the scribleriad by mr cambridge  the verses written in a country churchyard  mr w whiteheads ode to the nymph of bristol spring  or what have you seen  you live infinitely more in the world than i do who hear nothing see nothing do nothing and am nothing remedy this unhappiness by sending me somewhat that may rouse my attention  i must except what i hear from my lady luxborough who indulges me now and then with a letter in french  if you should think this letter more than usually dull you must know that since i saw you i have been generally dispirited till about a fortnight ago i found some nervous disorders that i greatly disliked and upon examination was told i had a nervous fever for this i have been taking saline draughts and boluss and hope i am something better though i am far from well i would not indeed have written to you at this time but i chose not to defer sending the enclosed postscript  you who have shared many of my happiest hours will excuse the produce of a more than ordinary dull one  mrs arnold comes up to enquire after my health and wishes i may get better that i may stir out and see the pretty creatures in the barn it seems she has a cow or two that have calved since i kept my room  why should i prolong a letter that has no kind of chance to afford you any amusement make my compliments to mrs  and believe me to be ever most affectionately  yours w shenstone i have just taken and signed a lease for life of the terras beyond my wood for which i am to pay annually the sum of one shilling  am not i man of great worldly importance to purchase ground and take leases thus  what matters it whether the articles that secure the premises to me would also cover them or not  my service to mr f  t  why will he not come and spend a week with me  i think you cannot both be absent at a time    lxiv to mr graves the leasows feb       0  dear mr graves since i received your letter i have been a week at w  i believe i may have told you that i never was fond of that place there is too much trivial elegance too much punctilio for me and perhaps as you express it too much speculation but i was fearful i might entirely lose mr whistlers acquaintance if i did not make an effort once in five years to return his visit besides i should have had no hopes of seeing him at the leasows hereafter and i am extremely desirous of seeing both him and you here having made many alterations which i do not undertake but with an eye to the approbation of my more generous friends but he seems to my great surprise to renounce the thing called taste in buildings gardens etc is grown weary of his own little embellishments at w  and longs to settle in london for the greater part of his time this i believe he would put in execution immediately but that he thinks it might give some uneasiness to his mother if he should quit the house that she with so much difficulty obtained for him i too am sick of the word taste but i think the thing itself the only proper ambition and the specific pleasure of all who have any share in the faculty of imagination i need not mention my reasons you will soon conceive them and however the case be there is one branch of it which so totally engrosses the persons with whom i principally converse that i was astonished to hear him speak even with indifference concerning the reigning taste for rural decorations i could ill forbear telling mr whistler that he was now literally a beau in a bandbox but the freedom might have given more offense than the joke was worth he has improved the place extremely but i do not like his colonnades you know nothing of that kind is tolerable unless regularly executed in stone that is one thing another is that colonnades are ornaments which will not bear to be very diminutive mr  whose house only i saw has been at the expense of a large cornice round it in most elaborate brickwork but with regard to his stuccowork within doors he is quite extravagant  i mention these things upon a supposition that you may like to hear any thing that regards the place but indeed they are so mighty trifling that i ought to doubt my supposition i supped with mr p  s family once at mr w  s and all was mighty well only i happen to have a violent aversion to cardplaying and at w  i think they do nothing else so that on account of my ignorance at quadrille or any creditable game i was forced to lose my money and two evenings out of my seven at pope joan with mr p  s children mr w  to make me amends invited me to breakfast and showed me your verses i assure you you have no occasion for a better advocate than mr w  whether with regard to his judgment or his zeal in behalf of the subject the verses or the poet i would fain have obtained a copy but he did not care to give one without your commission i hope you will oblige me so far i like them very much the subject is genteel and the verses easy and elegant we agreed upon one or two different readings and one stanza that concerns cards should i think be corrected not that i would have you less severe upon cards neither i was even glad to find that you gve them so little quarter i sometimes thought that mr w  s seeming fondness for them was a kind of contrecaeur  be that as it will his objection to the stanza as well as mine was solely founded on the versification  the sentiment i liked his latin verses but they do not interfere with yours send me a copy and confine my use of it by what limitations you please my reigning toy at present is a pocketbook and i glory as much in furnishing it with the verses of my acquaintance as others would with bankbills i did not know when i went to w  but i might have heard mrs g  accused of certain questions touching their law i mean of forms and ceremonies but i did not on the contrary i had the satisfaction of hearing her person her temper and her understanding much commended but this i did not want the delicacy of your taste is equal with me to a thousand commendations mrs w  is really so much altered by her indisposition that i did not know her she talks of going to bath this season  i talked of it too and wish it of all earthly things you must know i could not have come to claverton instead of going to w  as i did not determine on the expedition at home but at a friends house where i was betwixt twenty and thirty miles on my way thither besides i would allow myself more time when i turn my face toward bath than i could this winter your invitation as it is very obliging so it has many concurring circumstances to recommend it at this time i want to recover my health which must be recovered by bath or nothing i want to have you read some trifles of mine which must be ratified by you or no one but principally and above all do i long to see you my old friend and mrs g  whom i expect you should render my new one  i am obliged for your charitable endeavors to support my spirits your company would do it effectually but scarce any thing less in winter solitary life limited circumstances a phlegmatic habit and disagreeable events have given me a melancholy turn that is hardly dissipated by the most serene sky but in a northeast wind is quite intolerable after a long state of this kind upon every access of amusement one is apt to think it is not right to be happy that it is one of wollastons implicit lies a treating things contrary to what they deserve  your situation at claverton is admired by most people and if you could connect some little matter in the neighborhood would be as surely envied  it is now high time to release you  this is not a letter but an olio i desire my compliments to mrs g  and am affectionately and invariably  yours w shenstone as i must now use a frank i will send you a few inscriptions your imagination will supply the scenery on which what merit they may have depends there were different readings in the first copy of which i beg your opinion stanza the first at least this calm sequestered shade ambition never dares invade no etc but shuns etc stanza the second hither the plaintive halcyon hies avoiding all the race that flies my design was only to convey some pleasing ideas of things which though proper to the place a person might not chance to see there once in twenty times mr lyttelton and lady alyesbury necessitated me to give them copies though they probably did it out of complaisance only i gave them in the manner i send them you i hope you have not entirely dropped your love for rural scenes of which you were once so fond i will allow your taste for medals to preponderate  i beg dear sir you would neglect no opportunity of calling on me  i will come to claverton when i can    lxv to a friend the leasows sept         dear mr g  i am very sensibly obliged to you for the diligence and expedition which you have shown in answering my late request i cannot feel the very tenderness of friendship to be at all abated in me by our long separation nor will it at any time be possible i should so long as i receive such testimonies of your usual kindness and ingenuity  i have no sort of exceptions to make against the province in which you were engaged at cheltenham nor the light in which you appeared what you lost in any ones opinion of your independency you would gain in their idea of your merit genius and learning and then you had all those advantages par dessu  as to the compliments that were paid to mrs g  you have something of the same sort of reason to be pleased with them that i have to be pleased with those that are given to my place which i consider as naturally possessed of many beauties each of them brought to light and perfected through my own discernment care and cultivation and then your pleasure ought to be so much greater than mine as you have a nobler subject to enjoy  mrs g  has too much sense to object against the freedom of this similitude  i cannot help adding a few strokes to your picture of mrs  i think her an extremely superficial femalepedant for after an interval of many years since i first conversed with her at mr  s i found her conversation turn solely upon the same topics definitions and quotations i believe i could easily enough have recommended myself to a greater degree of her favor but her vanity and affectations are beyond what i could bear your account of  is very picturesque and agreeable to the idea i always had of him but i believe that idea was perfected by wh observations i made when i had some of his company at london there was something accountable enough to me in their burlesquing mr l  s monody he is you know engaged in a party and his poem though an extraordinary fine composition was too tender for the public ear it should have been printed privately and a number of copies dispersed only among their friends and acquaintances  but even so it would have been republished and it was too good to suppress i wish the burlesquers of such ingenuous profusions could be punished consistently with english liberty where were ye muses etc is imitated from milton and taken from milton from theocritus i write greek wretchedly but you will remember the passage    i heard once before it was burlesqued under the title of an elegy on the death of a favorite cat but the burlesque will die and the poem will survive  you tell me the author of peregrine pickle says if you will flatter mr lyttelton well he will at least make you a middlesex justice and it happened oddly that whilst i was reading your letter a neighbor told me i was put in the commission of the peace i have never received a single line from mr whistler and i believe my journey to w  has given the final blow to our friendship pray was not mr blandy some relation of theirs or only their attorney the affair is uncommonly shocking and i fancy the genuine accounts that mr w  sends you will be curious anecdotes at bath  i suppose you have painted your room with oil colors and made it really handsome  i drew out a festoon and a medal some time ago for a panel over mr p  s chimney but they knew not what to make of the medal and had only the festoon executed in stone color by a common painter  yours is better and in character  i am a degree more frugal than you for i only use quick lime and either blue or yellow and to take away the objection which i have to whited walls  i paid a visit to mr lyttelton the dean etc since he came down but had little of their company for they thought sir thomas was dying however by unparalleled strength of constitution he lingered in violent pain till last saturday when he died very much lamented he had good natural parts well improved by reading modern writers and by the knowledge of the world extremely prudent considerate humane polite and charitable  i have jumbled his more obvious qualities together that you may not think i am usurping the province of a newsman sir george will lose no time in building a new house or doing what is more than equivalent to the old one  i want no temptation to come immediately to c  this is a melancholy season with me always whether it be owing to the scenes i see or to the effect of hazy skies upon an illperspiring skin  i can say no more at present than that i most ardently desire to see you and desire my humble service to mrs g  i have a chalybeat spring in the middle of my grotto what think you of this inscription fons ferrvginevs is it antique  i am dear mr g  your most affectionate w shenstone  lxvi to mr graves on the death of mr shenstones brother the leasows feb         dear mr graves you will be amazed at my long silence and it might reasonably excite some disgust if my days had passed of late in the manner they used to do but i am not the man i was perhaps i never shall be alas my dearest friend i have lost my only brother and since the fatal close of november i have had neither peace nor respite from agonizing thoughts  you i think have seen my brother but perhaps had no opportunity of distinguishing him from the groupe of others whom we call goodnatured men this part of his character was so visible in his countenance that he was generally beloved at sight i who must be allowed to know him do assure you that his understanding was no way inferior to his benevolence he had not only a sound judgment but a lively wit and genuine humor as these were many times eclipsed by his native bashfulness so his benevolence only suffered by being shown to an excess i here mean his giving too indiscriminately into those jovial meetings of company where the warmth of a social temper is discovered with less reserve but the virtues of his head and heart would soon have shone without alloy the foibles of his youth were wearing off and his affection for me and regard to my advice with his own good sense would soon have rendered him all that i could have wished in a successor i never in my life knew a person more sincere in the expression of love or dislike but it was the former that suited the propensity of his heart the latter was as transient as the starts of passion that occasioned it in short with much true genius and real fortitude he was according to the english acceptance a true honest man and i think i may also add a truly english character but habeo dixi immo habui fratrem and amicum chreme all this have i lost in him he is now in regard to this world no more than a mere idea and this idea therefore though deeply tinged with melancholy i must and surely ought to cherish and preserve  i believe i wrote you some account of his illness last spring from which to all appearance he was tolerably well recovered he took the air and visited about with me during the warmer months of summer but my pleasure was of short duration haesit lateri lethalis arundo the peripneumony under which he labored in the spring had terminated in an adhesion of the lungs to the pleura so that he could never lie but on his right side and this as the weather grew colder occasioned an obstruction that could never be surmounted  though my reason forewarned me of the event i was not the more prepared for it  let me not dwell upon it it is altogether insupportable in every respect and my imagination seems more assiduous in educing pain from this occasion than i ever yet found it in administering to my pleasure  this hurts me to no purpose  i know it and yet when i have avocated my thoughts and fixed them for a while upon common amusements i suffer the same sort of consciousness as if i were guilty of a crime believe me this has been the most sensible affliction i ever felt in my life and you who know my anxiety when i had far less reason to complain will more easily conceive it now than i am able to describe it  i cannot pretend to fill up my paper with my usual subjects  i should thank you for your remarks upon my poetry but i despise poetry and i might tell you of all my little rural improvements but i hate them  what can i now expect from my solitary rambles through them but a series of melancholy reflections and irksome anticipations  even the pleasure i should take in in showing them to you the greatest they can afford me must be now greatly inferior to what it might formerly have been  how have i prostituted my sorrow on occasions that little concerned me i am ashamed to think of that idle elegy upon autumn when i have so much more important cause to hate and to condemn it now but the glare and gaiety of the spring is what i principally dread when i shall find all things restored but my poor brother and something like those lines of milton will run for ever in my thoughts thus with the year seasons return but not to me returns a brothers cordial smile at eve or morn i shall then seem to wake from amusements company every sort of inebriation with which i have been endeavoring to lull my grief asleep as from a dream and i shall feel as if i were that instant despoiled of all i have chiefly valued for thirty years together of all my present happiness and all my future prospects the melody of birds which he no more must hear the cheerful beams of the sun of which he no more must partake every wonted pleasure will produce that sort of pain to which my temper is most obnoxious do not consider this as poetry  poetry on such occasions is no more than literal truth in the present case it is less for half the tenderness i feel is altogether shapeless and inexpressible  after all the wisdom of the world may perhaps esteem me a gainer ill do they judge of this event who think that any shadow of amends can be made for the death of a brother and the disappointment of all my schemes by the accession of some fortune which i never can enjoy  this is a mournful narrative i will not therefore enlarge it  amongst all changes and chances i often think of you and pray there may be no suspicion or jealousy betwixt us during the rest of our lives  i am dear sir most affectionately yours w shenstone  lxvii to c  w  esquire alas dear mr w  the terrible event has happened i have lost the best of brothers and you are to pity not to condemn your unfortunate correspondent  about the middle of november i had prepared a letter for you which lies now amongst my papers at that time amidst all my apprehensions i had some hopes to support me but before i could send it my situation was greatly altered and the month did not wholly expire till it had effectually rendered me the most wretched of mankind  thus much it was necessary i should tell you you will pardon me if i do not descend any farther into an account of merit that is lost and of sorrow which is too apt to revive of itself be assured it is to me a loss which the whole world cannot compensate and an affliction which the longest time i can live will not be able to erase  you said you would let master w  come and spend a few days with me  i beseech you do  it will be some relief to me and god knows i have occasion enough for every assistance than can be drawn from correspondence company or amusement  you sir i presume proceed in the innocent recreations of your garden and those may at least prove a balance for any small disquiets that attend you if greater ills befall you you have persons near you to alleviate them a wife family visitants male and female friends in abundance and a table sufficiently hospitable to attract even your enemies with me the case is otherwise what i have undergone this winter may you never feel so much as in apprehension  believe me my friend affectionately and invariably yours w shenstone ix kal march mdcclii lxviii to the same july         dear mr w  i do not know why i made you a promise of a pretty long letter what i now write will be but a moderate one both in regard to length and style yet write i must par maniere dacquit and you have brought fourpence expense upon yourself for a parcel of nonsense and to no manner of purpose this is not tautology you must observe for nonsense sometimes answers very considerable purposes  in love it is eloquence itself  in friendship therefore by all the rules of sound logic you must allow it to be something what i cannot say nequeo monstrare and sentio tantum the principal part of a correspondence betwixt two idle men consists in two important enquiries  what we do and how we do but as all persons ought to give satisfaction before they expect to receive it i am to tell you in the first place that my own health is tolerably good or rather what i must call good being i think much better than it has been this last half year  then as touching my occupation alas othellos occupations gone i neither read nor write aught besides a few letters and i give myself up entirely to scenes of dissipation lounge at my lord dudleys for near a week together make dinners accept of invitations sit up till three oclock in the morning with young sprightly married women over white port and vin de paysans ramble over my fields issue out orders to my haymakers foretell rain and fair weather enjoy the fragance of hay the cocks and the wind rows admire that universal lawn which is produced by the scythe sometimes inspect and draw mouldings for my carpenters sometimes paper my walls and at other times my cielings do every social office that falls in my way but never seek out for any  sed vos quid tandem quae circumvolitas agilis thyma non tu corpus eras sine pectore non tibi parvum ingenium non incultum est in short what do you and how do you do  that is all  tell my young pupil your son he must by all manner of means send me a latin letter and if he have any billet in french for miss lea at the grange or even in hebrew coptic or syriac i will engage it shall be received very graciously thither am i going to dinner this day and there implebor veteris bacchi pinguisque ferinae  all this looks like extreme jollity but is this the true state of the case or may i not more properly apply the spem vultu simulat premit atrum cord dolorem  accept this scrawl in place of a letter and believe me  ever most affectionately yours w shenstone  lxix to mr g  on the receipt of his picture the leasows oct        dear mr g  i am very unfeignedly ashamed to reflect how long it is since i received your present and how much longer it is since i received your letter i have been resolving to write to you almost daily ever since you left me yet have foolishly enough permitted avocations of infinitely less importance than your correspondence to interfere with my gratitude my interest and my inclination what apology i have to make though no way adequate to my negligence is in short as follows after the receipt of your letter i deferred writing till i could speak of the arrival of your picture  this did not happen till about a month or five weeks ago when i was embarrassed with masons carvers carpenters and company all at a time and though it were idle enough to say that i could not find one vacant hour for my purpose yet in truth my head was so confused by these multifarious distractions that i could have written nothing satisfactory either to myself or you nothing worth a single penny supposing the postage were to cost you no more the workmen had not finished my rooms a minute when lady luxborough mrs davies and mr outing arrived with five servants and a set of horses to stay with me for some time after a nine days visit i returned with them to barrels where i continued for a week and whither by the way i go again with lord dudley in about a fortnights time other company filled up the interstices of my summer and i hope my dear friend will accept of this apology for so long a chasm of silence during which i have been uniformly at his service and true to that inviolable friendship i shall ever bear him  i proceed now to thank you for the distinction you show me in sending me your picture i do it very sincerely it is assuredly a strong likeness as my lady luxborough with all her servants that have seen you pronounce as well as i consequently more valuable to a friend than a face he does not know though it were one of raphaels the smile about the mouth is bad as it agrees but ill with the gravity of the eyes and as a smile ever so little outre has a bad effect in a picture where it is constant though it may be ever so graceful in a person where it is transitory however this may be altered when i can meet with a good painter i have no other objection but to the prominence of the belly the hair i think is good and the coat and band no way exceptionable i have given it all the advantage i can it has a good light and makes part of an elegant chimneypiece in a genteel though little breakfastroom at the end of my house  mr whistler and i are now upon good terms and two or three friendly letters have been interchanged betwixt us he presses me to come to whitchurch and i him to come over to the leasows but the winter comes when no man can visit  the dispute is adjusted by time whilst we are urging it by expostulation  no uncommon event in most sublunary projects  lady luxborough said very extraordinary things in praise of mrs g  after you left us at barrels yet i sincerely believe no more than she deserves i took the liberty of showing her your letter here as it included a compliment to her which i thought particularly genteel  she will always consider you as a person of genius and her friend  during most of this summer wherein i have seen much company either here or at lord dudleys i have been almost constantly engaged in one continued scene of jollity i endeavored to find relief from such sort of dissipation and when i had once given in to it i was obliged to proceed as they say is the case when persons disguise their face with paint  mine was a sort of painting applied to my temper spem vultu simulare premere atrum cord dolorem and the moment i left it off my soul appeared again all haggard and forlorn my company has now deserted me the spleenfogs begin to rise and the terrible incidents of last winter revive apace in my memory this is my state of mind while i write you these few lines yet i thank god my health is not much amiss  i did not forget my promise of a box etc to mr g  i had a dozen sent me one or two of which i could have liked had they been better finished they were of a good oval white enamel with flowers etc but horribly gilt and not accurately painted i beg my best service to her and will make a fresh essay my dearest friend accept this awkward letter for the present  in a few posts i will write again  believe me yours from the bottom of my soul  w shenstone i will send you a label for madewine after my own plan it is enamelled with grapes shepherds pipe etc the motto vin be paisan    lxx to mr jago the leasows nov         dear mr jago could i with convenience mount my horse and ride to harbury this instant i should much more willingly do so than begin this letter such terrible events have happened to us since we saw each other last that however irksome it may be to dwell upon them it is in the same degree unnatural to substitute any subject in their place  i do sincerely forgive your long silence my good friend indeed i do though it gave me uneasiness i hope you do the same by mine i own i could not readily account for the former period of yours any otherwise than by supposing that i had said or done something in the levity of my heart which had given you disgust but being conscious to myself of the most sincere regard for you and believing it could never be discredited for any trivial inadvertencies i remember i continued still in expectation of a letter and did not dream of writing till such time as i had received one i trusted you would write at last and that by all my past endeavors to demonstrate my friendship you would believe the tree was rooted in my heart whatever irregularity you might observe in the branches  this was my situation before that dreadful era which gave me such a shock as to banish my best friends for a time out of my memory  and when they recurred as they did the first of any thing i was made acquainted with that deplorable misfortune of yours believe me i sympathized in your affliction notwithstanding my own but alas what comfort could i administer who had need of every possible assistance to support myself i wrote indeed a few letters with difficulty amongst the rest one to my friend graves but it was to vent my complaint  i will send you the letter if you please as it is by far my least painful method of conveying you some account of my situation let it convince you that i could have written nothing at that time which could have been of any service to you let it afford you at least a faint sketch of my dearest brothers character but let it not appear an ostentatious display of sorrow of which i am by no means guilty i know but too well that i discovered upon the occasion what some would call an unmanly tenderness but i know also that sorrow upon such subjects as these is very consistent with virtue and with the most absolute resignation to the just decrees of providence hominis est enim affici dolor sentire resistere tamen and solatia admittere non solatiis non egere pliny  i drank purchased amusements never suffered myself to be a minute without company no matter what so it was but continual at length by an attention to such conversation and such amusements as i could at other times despise i forgot so far as to be cheerful  and after this the summer through an almost constant succession of lively and agreeable visitants proved even a scene of jollity  it was inebriation all though of a mingled nature yet has it maintained a sort of truce with grief till time can assist me more effectually by throwing back the event to a distance  now indeed that my company have all forsaken me and i am delivered up to winter silence and reflection the incidents of the last year revive apace in my memory and i am even astonished to think of the gaiety of my summer the fatal anniversary the dies quem semper acerbum etc is beginning to approach and every face of the sky suggests the ideas of last winter  yet i find myself cheerful in company nor would i recommend it to you to be much alone  you would lay the highest obligation upon me by coming over at this time  i pressed your brother whom i saw at birmingham to use his influence with you but if you can by no means undertake the journey i will take my speediest opportunity of seeing you at harbury  mr miller invited me strenuously to meet dr lyttelton at his house but i believe my most convenient season will be when my lord dudley goes to barrels for i can but ill bear the pensiveness of a long and lonely expedition after all if you could come hither first it would afford me the most entire satisfaction  i have been making alterations in my house that would amuse you and have many matters to discourse with you which it would be endless to mention upon paper  adieu my dear friend may your merit be known to some one who has greater power to serve you than myself but be assured at the same time that no one loves you better or esteems you more  w shenstone  lxxi to the same the leasows jan         dear mr jago although i have many reasons to urge why i did not write to you before or visit you from barrels as i fully intended i will venture to wave all particulars till i see you and only assure you in the general that i was never able to write any thing satisfactory or to visit you at that time with any sort of convenience  believe me my good friend if inclination might have ruled i had been with you at harbury many weeks ago sure i am they must be the cares of home and not the pleasures of it that ever were sufficient to detain me during the winter season nor do i think i have an enemy that wishes me more miserable than i have almost constantly found myself ever since the beginning of it  i cannot even now fix a time when i can see you and perhaps it may be deferred till mr millers place will have received some advantage from the spring and in that case i would infallibly see my lord guildfords but i leave this undetermined and i hope if you can wander from home with any kind of satisfaction you will do me the justice to believe that you have no friend alive who will more gladly receive you than myself  i have papered some rooms this last year and would willingly have you see them before their colors are vanished which i think will unavoidably be the case of one before a second summer be half concluded  thus is beauty as uncertain as either fortune or fame  i suppose you have heard there is a citation from doctors commons and a writ of ne exeat out against mr w  for an intrigue with  if you have not be not precipitate in spreading the story  they say he has fled into france on the occasion  what a shocking affair is this so early in life so extensive so lasting so irremediable in its consequences but sic visum veneri cui placet impares formas atque animos sub juga ahenea saevo mittere cum joco your misfortunes and mine incline us almost to love all people that are miserable but how will the daughters of the philistines rejoice on the occasion nay almost countenance anothers loss of virtue by manifesting their own apparent want of humanity  there is a most admirable piece of allegory on this head in the female fables by brooks if i mistake not to whom the author in his preface acknowledges himself greatly indebted  i am truly sorry to understand how much you are alone i really imagined you were much happier in point of company than myself as you live in a much politer neighborhood amongst persons of genius learning and humanity and happier you are for however i make a shift to scrape some company around me they are such as can affect me with little else besides the spleen  do not dwell too much on subjects that make you thoughtful superficial amusements are out point till some time hence i am an ill adviser but i prescribe you the methods which i have found most effectual with myself  i have not been forgetful of the task that you enjoined me to give you my observations on the verses which you enclosed  i will write my sentiments on a separate paper do not punish me with silence and suspense concerning you but write i can ardently desire what i but little deserve being  your most affectionate friend w s  lxxii to the same the leasows feb         dear mr jago i wrote you some account of myself and enclosed some trivial criticisms in a letter i sent you about a fortnight ago which i hope you have received  tom comes now to enquire after your health and to bring back my ode to colonel lyttelton in regard to which i desire that you will not be sparing of your animadversions i whispered my difficulties to mr miller at hagley how delicate i found the subject and how hard it was to satisfy either myself or others in all which points he agreed with me nevertheless having twice broke my promise of sending a corrected copy to sir george i was obliged to make my peace by a fresh one which i suppose i must of necessity perform  give me your whole sentiments hereupon i beseech you in particular and in general as a critic and as a friend  the bad state of spirits which i complained of in my last for a long time together made me utterly irresolute every thing occasioned me suspense and i did nothing with appetite  this was owing in a great measure to a slow nervous fever as i have since discovered by many concurrent symptoms it is now i think wearing off by degrees i seem to anticipate a little of that vernal delight which milton mentions and thinks able to chase all sadness but despair at least i begin to resume my silly clue of hopes and expectations which i know however will not guide me to any thing more satisfactory than before  i have read scarce any new books this season voltaires new tragedy was sent me from london but what has given me the most amusement has been the lettres de madame de maintenon you have probably read them already in english and then i need not recommend them the life of lord bolingbroke is entirely his public life and the book three parts filled with political remarks  as to writing i have not attempted it this year and more nor do i know when i shall again  however i would be glad to correct that ode to the duchess of somerset when once i can find in whose hands it is deposited i was shown a very elegant letter of hers the other day wherein she asks for it with great politeness and as it includes nothing but a love of rural life and such sort of amusements as she herself approves i shall stand a good chance of having it received with partiality she lives the life of a religieuse she has written my lady luxborough a very serious letter of condolance upon the misfortune in her family and need enough has lady luxborough of so unchangeable a friend for sure nothing could have happened to a person in her situation more specifically unfortunate  mr reynolds has been at barrels i hear and has brought her a machine that goes into a coatpocket yet answers the end of a jack for boots a readingdesk a cribbageboard a pair of snuffers a ruler an eighteen inchrule three pair of nutcracks a lemonsqueezer two candlesticks a picquet board and the lord knows what beside  can you form an idea of it if you can do you not think it must give me pain to reflect that i myself am useful for no sort of purpose when a paltry bit of wood can answer so many but indeed whilst it pretends to these exploits it performs nothing well and therein i agree with it so true it is with regard to me what i told you long ago multa and praeclara minantem vivere nec recte nec suaviter   we have a turnpike bill upon the point of being brought into the house of commons it will convey you about half the way betwixt birmingham and hales and from thence to hagley but i trust there will be a left hand attraction which will always make you deviate from the strait line  i should be ashamed to reflect how much i have dwelt upon myself in this letter but that i seriously approve of egotism in letters and were i not to do so i should not have any other subject i have not a single neighbor that is either fraught with politeness literature or intelligence much less have i a tide of spirits to set my invention afloat but the less i am able to amuse you the more desirous am i of your letters which afford me the truest entertainment even when my spirits are ever so much depressed  that universal cheerfulness which is the lot of some people persons that you and i may envy at the same time that we despise is worth all that either fortune or nature can bestow  i am with entire affection yours w shenstone  lxxiii to mr graves the leasows mar         dear mr graves i am vexed to find you have no copy of those verses  i must make a fresh enquiry and should they happen to accompany this letter as i fear they will not be so good as to assist me all you can in the way of hints and corrections corrections of what is and hints of what may be i do not reckon much upon these verses or the patronage which you mention though the duchess is a woman of high reputation and has as much benevolence as any woman upon earth  i do not include the design of visiting bath as a public place i have long since given up such schemes of gaiety and expense i visit you and mrs graves at the least i mean to do so  inoculatioin is a point on which i never speak a syllable in the way of pro or con i mean not so as to influence particulars for in the general i esteem it both right and salutary and even right because we find it salutary  i do not know whether i could not bear the dishonor of friends or relations better than their death  it must afford one no small satisfaction to give them ones affection and assistance under every frailty to which human nature is exposed at least so long as they are true to friendship it is mr whistlers opinion as well as mine but mr  s case is altogether different and i make no question that he thinks as you do upon the occasion  poor danverss death affects me more than you would perhaps imagine if you remember i was at m  when the scheme of his going abroad was in agitation  i think how this event must affect mrs t  whose concern will not be lessened by her long separation from him i dare say he reckoned upon his relations here as his best estate whatever he might gain elsewhere and no doubt the hope of retiring amongst them has been a constant spur to his diligence  the event was always uncertain and has proved at last unfortunate yet as melmoth says very justly the course of human affairs requires that we should act with vigor upon very precarious contingencies  i desire you would give me a sight of the latin inscription  i think it was the gentlemans magazine in which i was shown your verses  i have a particular and lively idea of your place though i do not remember to have seen even such parts of a scene as i have united together in my imagination i cannot think otherwise than that the frontdoor opens here the gardendoor there the stream runs in this place etc etc  hac ibat simois haec est sigeia tellus the sight of the place could not impress my imagination more deeply though the impression i am to acquire will hardly leave one line of my present one remaining cabbagegarden ornee is very high burlesque and affects the improvements of your friend too nearly  let me know in what manner mrs graves and you are drawn be as particular as you please  i could not be clear from your letter whether you had received the box or not that together with the tallies lay on the table before me while i wrote to you last and went with my letter to birmingham  pray satisfy me directly whether you received them  they are trifles indeed but as they acquit me of my promise they are virtually of consequence  mr whistler has not answered a letter which i sent him above two months ago nay i think a quarter of a year  you are rich  i have only to wish the continuance of your riches with some diminution of your fatigue and yet the most laborious man in the world is i am fully assured more happy than the laziest  the rival brothers has some of dr youngs affectations and i question if the moral be absolutely true  at least mr addison is in some measure against it but on the whole i think it a noble tragedy abounding as much with refined sentiments and elevated expressions as the gamester and the earl of essex are deficient in both  my verses are not yet sent to sir george lyttelton i start new difficulties and cannot make them to my mind yet have promised him a copy and disappointed him thrice and can hardly defer it much longer without great offense  i have scarce been twenty yards from home this winter last night i visited one of my neighbors and what with wine sitting up late a perfect flux of discourse and a return home through the dark found myself vertiginous before i was aware never did priors manly description i drank i liked it not etc seem so natural to me as it does today i am absolutely vile in my own sight and i abhor myself in dust and ashes i was never so intoxicated as not to know what i said or to talk more nonsense and yet how many things could i wish unsaid that i let fall last night  we are going to add two new bells to our present set of six to have a turnpikeroad from hagley to birmingham through hales and to emerge a little from our obscurity i am dear sir with compliments to mrs graves  ever most affectionately yours w shenstone  lxxiv to the same with observations on arms inscriptions etc the leasows july         dear mr graves i send you my ode as i sent it to the duchess some weeks ago why i pitched upon one reading sooner than another i will not now explain nor will i trouble you to make any fresh remarks upon it at present only when you happen to read it over at your leisure if any thing occurs to you that would tend to perfect it i would beg you occasionally to make some memorandums i have not yet received an answer but as i accompanied the verses with a letter i suppose i shall receive one in return i also added to fill a blank space in my paperbook a poem which i call the vista and which you may perhaps recollect how properly i know not for i had the benefit of no persons judgment or advice  lord dudley made mr dolman a present of a piece of plate a large cup in consideration of his sisters being at broom about half a year there was on it one supporter awkwardly enough holding up the coronet in his paw and from the coronet proceeded a label with amoris ergo dudley i do not know who was the manager or whence he had the inscription but i think from dr h  this is elegant and enough nevertheless as there may be some convenience in dazzling the eyes of the people where i dwell and as such eyes as theirs are not to be dazzled and hardly struck by elegance alone i chose the method that was most magnificent  i wish they are not invidious enough to say that his arms are engraved there for want of some of my own so i would not be long before their notable suggestion  i have truly so low an opinion of arms since they became purchaseable by money and since the present unlimited use of them that were i to find a coat to my name in the office which i did not like i would not use it but substitute what was more agreeable yet some sort of right or claim is requisite to satisfy ones delicacy with an opinion of property and indeed to fix ones choice where one has the whole furniture of the universe for its object  after all the vulgar are more struck with arms than any thing stupet in titulis and imaginibus and i believe there were near two hundred people gathered round lady luxboroughs landau at birmingham and declaring her arms to be very noble or otherwise  i do not therefore choose to employ a vulgar mind about this matter  were you to go london i should gladly solicit you or if you have any friend you could write to in town to search the office for really i have none that i like for the purpose it will not cost above a couple of shillings  i will send you a draught of the lid of my standish when it arrives  for i really do not know what mr hylton will put upon it i find he consults with dr b  my lords physician   de dudley would run most abominably and baro dudley may be authorized by the frequent practice of maittaire  if it be inscribed dudley alone i can add the rest if i should hereafter think proper and i wish it may be so  my verses to the colonel are not yet transcribed  i think the latin inscription to your brother very elegant and i should not care to have any part of it omitted  i would by all means have this little history of his life perpetuated his saltem etc and were you to put it into english it would be too long for an inscription  unless you were by means of a printed elegy with notes or any other such method to produce the same effect and then you might make the epitaph as short as you pleased  after all the first method is perhaps as eligible when the affair is nearer a conclusion i should be glad to be of any service  i will think and write again about it  and now having spoke to such matters as have been the subject of our late correspondence i am at liberty to diversify my letter as i may  i should be glad to know in your next whether you have heard of late from mr whistler and whether he is confined at home as usual by his mothers state of health i almost despair of ever seeing him again at the leasows though there is hardly any pleasure i so much covet as that of surprising him with the alterations i have made and the articles i have purchased during the five years since he was in shropshire add to this the several acquaintances i have formed which he would like and the amusing visits i could pay hereabouts with freedom  i do not know whether you saw mr davenport and his family at bath this spring he is laying out his environs and i am by appointment to go over the week after next he has also a painter at this time taking views round his house which is one of the most magnificent in our country yet i never leave home but with reluctance  i really love no place so well and it is a great favor in me to allot any one a week of my summer  add to this that my constitution requires nursing and i am most happy where i am most free it is in vain to say they allow you all freedom where you cannot allow it yourself for this reason i never more enjoy myself than i do at the grange and yet this to some may appear paradoxical  i yesterday embellished my chalybeate spring  the inscription that is out on the stone is as follows viz fons ferrvginevs yet i question whether some of the following be not preferable if they are i beg you will tell me one shilling and sixpence produces the alteration fons ferrvginevs or divae per qvam latebrae or divae locorvm omnivm or divae nimirvm rvsticae or divas cvi debetvr or divae per qvam licet  believe me ever with my best compliments to mrs graves  your most obligde and most affectionate servant w shenstone  lxxv to mr jago the leasows jan         dear mr jago i am at a loss how to begin this letter  i will not however after the usual way give you a tedious list of apologies in the front of it some account of my long silence you will find dispersed throughout the letter and as for what is deficient i will depend upon your friendship  there has not been a person here since you left me of whom i could obtain the least intelligence concerning you and as an enquiry by the post was my only obvious method i do acknowledge myself to blame notwithstanding all the excuses that i can make  amidst the conflux of visitants whom i received this season i was hardly once so happy as i was in your company i was the happier in seeing you so and if you remember i took notice at the time how little your vivacity was impaired in comparison of my own if i was then but a dull companion guess whether solitude and winter were likely to make me a better correspondent that vein of gaiety and humor which you were once so partial as to discover in my letters will scarce appear there any more not even to the eyes of the most partial friend i have should you deny what i assert and impute it to a fit of spleen yet you may allow that it will scarce enliven any letter that i write in winter friendship still remains friendship like the root of some perennial flower even then perhaps gathers strength in secret that it may afford a better display of its colors in the spring  i do not pretend this to be an adequate apology i know my dearest friend that you both like to see and hear from me it proves however that you have no great loss either of my letters or my company  i am as the phrase is deeply penetrated by the civilities of your mr miller he took a short dinner with me once this season dropping sir george at mr p  s  he could not have pleased me better  here he happened to meet mr lyttelton and captain whood he afterward breakfasted here and in general seemed glad of every occasion to bring me the genteelest company to him i owe miss banks and lord temple can you think that radway now as well as harbury has no attractions for me you know me too well but i have not truly such a state of health as to dare to be from home friends will say you may be as free at our houses as your own etc and they will mean as they say but if you cannot make yourself so what is all this to the purpose  i cannot give you a detail of what has passed with me since i saw you lord dudley with myself made one visit to lord plymouths we met mr and mrs winnington  we took a trip to mr vernons where we found mr coventry and other company the impressions i received from them would afford subject for conversation betwixt you and me but i must not assign too much of my paper to that purpose  lord plymouths piece of water should have been a serpentine river i could give you strong reasons  i think my lord such a character as will make a reputable figure in life  beloved he is and must be at first sight  lady plymouth is the most amiable of women and of all the world the properest person that my lord could have chosen the plan for their house i think right supposing it right to continue it where it is the park is capable of some considerable beauties lord plymouth has been once here since and talks of causing me to come and design for his environs  i seem to be highly in his favor  i hope some time to meet you there  my ode after an astonishing delay was presented to the duchess of somerset  it produced me two genteel letters from her grace i am well satisfied with the event for some reasons which i will one day give you  none of moment  soon after this dodsley pressed me to contribute as amply as i pleased to a fourth volume of his miscellanies i at first meant to do so pretty largely i then changed my mind and sent only some little pieces part of these were my own part mr whistlers mr gravess and some accidental pieces of others which i found in my bureau  i purposed to send something of yours too of myself if i was hurried else not without your consent what i thought of was your linnets last week he writes me word that the town will now be too much engrossed by the business of elections and that he does not proceed this winter  so that we shall now you see have time to meet or write upon the subject  mr graves sent me the enclosed little fable for dodsley if i approved it  i made some alterations and sent it  return it to me if you please  it is pretty but the inscription must be to a friend  some correspondence i have had this winter with mr hylton about toys and trinkets which he gets done for me in london he is by far a better friend and correspondent than a poet should you take a trip to town he would be quite proud to see you  i am now like the rest of the world perusing sir charles grandison  i know not whether that world joins me in preferring clarissa the author wants the art of abridgement in every thing that he has written yet i am much his admirer  my dear friend cherish and preserve your own vivacity and let not this phlegmatic epistle impair it if occasion offers call on me for my own sake and believe you have not alive a more affectionate friend  w shenstone  lxxvi to mr graves on the alternations of pleasure and pain the leasows april         dear mr graves it is a long long time according to the computation of friendship since i had the pleasure of a line from you and i write chiefly to remind you of it not with any hopes of affording you the amusement of a single minute in truth i have not spirits for it the severity the duration the solitude of this winter have wellnigh exhausted them  the succession the regular succession of pain and pleasure becomes every day more clear to me it begins to seem as ordinary as the course of day and night thus my last summer was the most amusing i ever saw my winter the most disagreeable allow me to accept one only i mean that evermournful winter which robbed me of my dearest relation sometimes this pain and pleasure are contrasted within the compass of a day sometimes in different weeks etc etc however do not think me superstitious there is hardly a person that is less so yet i am firmly persuaded of the alternation either in the mind or in the events themselves my summer i said before was highly entertaining my winter rendered equally disagreeable by a longcontinued squabble amongst our principal parishioners and by the death of my bestbeloved and the most accomplished of my relations m  d  she risqued going to london for the sake of finding something new was seized with the smallpox and died in all her bloom  the natural consequence which we should draw from observations of this sort is equanimity aequam memento rebus etc and again sperat infestis metuit secundis etc enough of this which i should not mention but that the fact itself strikes me continually more and more and were i to mark the pleasing and unpleasing parts of my existence in an almanac as the romans did their fasti and nefasti i know not if at the years end the black and white marks would not nearly balance each other  i have bought hogarths analysis it is really entertaining and has in some measure adjusted my notions with regard to beauty in general for instance were i to draw a shield i could give you reasons from hence why the shape was pleasing or disagreeable i would have you borrow and read it  grandison i cannot think equal to clarissa though were merit in this age to be preferred the author of it deserves a bishopric  jago has been fortunate for once but the value of his livings must be exaggerated in the newspapers  if mr whistler would give me a visit in the height of my season this year i would look upon it as one of the most pleasing events that could happen to the remainder of my life and i would not presume to hope that fate would ever allow me a repetition of it  my love of toys is not quite exhausted  i have purchased or rather renovated some that are both rich and beautiful though short of what i meant them i have amused myself with designing little ornaments this winter some of which may turn to account under the management of some birmingham mechanic  to atchieve ease in that season is the most that i can hope and it is more than i often obtain  excuse this worthless letter which must cost you money as they tell me franks are useless i could not avoid some uneasiness upon reflecting how long you have been silent present my best compliments to mrs graves and pay a tribute of one single halfsheet to that affection with which i am ever  yours w shenstone  lxxvii to the same on the death of mr whistler the leasows june        dear mr graves the melancholy account of our dear friend whistlers death was conveyed to me at the same instant by yours and by his brothers letter i have written to his brother this post though i am very ill able to write upon the subject and would willingly have waved it longer but for decency the triumvirate which was the greatest happiness and the greatest pride of my life is broken the fabric of an ingenuous and disinterested friendship has lost a noble column yet it may and will i trust endure till one of us be laid as low in truth one can so little satisfy ones self with what we say upon such sad occasions that i made three or four essays before i could endure what i had written to his brother  be so good as to excuse me to him as well as you can and establish me in the good opinion of him and mr walker  poor mr whistler how do all our little strifes and bickerments appear to us at this time yet we may with comfort reflect that they were not of a sort that touched the vitals of our friendship and i may say that we fondly loved and esteemed each other of necessity tales animas oportuit esse concordes poor mr whistler not a single acquaintance have i made not a single picture or curiosity have i purchased not a single embellishment have i given to my place since he was last here but i have had his approbation and his amusement in my eye i will assuredly inscribe my larger urn to his memory nor shall i pass it without a pleasing melancholy during the remainder of my days we have each of us received a pleasure from his conversation which no other conversation can afford us at our present time of life  adieu my dear friend may our remembrance of the person we have lost be the strong and everlasting cement of our affection assure mr john whistler of the regard i have for him upon his own account as well as his brothers write to me directly if you have opportunity whether you have or no believe me to be ever most affectionately yours  w shenstone i beg my compliments to mrs graves    lxxviii to the same the leasows july         dear mr graves the particulars relating to our poor friends departure occasioned me much concern and indeed some tears yet as those particulars are what one covets to hear and the melancholy which they produce is never unmixed with pleasure i think myself much obliged to you for the care you took to convey them it is possible the letters i wrote to you and mr j whistler might appear too tender from a mere friend of the deceased but there is a sympathy betwixt friends which is not always found amongst relations nor does kindred imply friendship a whit more than friendship does kindred it is not many weeks ago that i had a bill filed against me in chancery by young d  the only near relation i have by the mothers side and the next in lineal succession to my share of the penns estate  do not let this surprise you i believe the affair will be accommodated  he only wanted to procure a division of the harborough estate at a large expense which might be better adjusted without any in other words to run his head against a stonewall that he might have a chance of causing it to tumble upon me would you consent that i should suffer him to have the mansion house at harborough thrown into his lot were i so to do i could make it advantageous to myself and the dispute were at an end but i have a kind of romantic veneration for that place and family which if you remember i have expressed in one of my best elegies elegy xv   pray what will become of our letters to mr whistler as i am not conscious of any thing dishonorable in mine and i am sure i may say the same of yours methinks i could wish that they might not be destroyed it is from a few letters of my own or others alone accidentally preserved that i am able to recollect what i have been doing since i was born  i met when i was last at barrels a surgeon of bath whose name i think was cleland he knew your name and place but i find was not personally acquainted with you  i am glad enough to hear that your place gets into vogue it is i think what you should choose upon all accounts let the beauty of the place guide them to the merits of its owner i have often thought myself that were a person to live at the leasows of more merit than myself and a few degrees more worldly prudence he could scarce want opportunities to procure his own advancement my rural embellishments are perhaps more considerable than yours but then the vicinity of bath might occasion you a greater conflux  your unexpensive illuminations please me highly  i have purposed these many years to purchase a set of tin lamps of about fourpence apiece to stick against trees and to use upon occasion in my coppice or rather in my grove where some of the waterfalls would not fail to show delightfully  you asked me about jagos preferment the living last given him by the bishop of worcester is i believe near an hundred pounds a year  with this he has harbury of about fifty and cheslerton a sort of chapel of ease about forty in the whole therefore about a hundred and ninety but then he is obliged to keep a curate and what i think yet worse is that he cannot make it convenient to live at his new situation which is a pretty one  i have had some visitants this season indeed as many and as considerable as such a sort of season could afford me a scotch peer called upon me in his way through birmingham his title was  he seemed to have a very clear head a very polite and easy manner and all the refinement of true taste without the warmth or appetite  i could not help thinking him on many accounts characteristic of the scottish nation  would to god i could see you and mrs graves here this summer i have the same wish it may be my lot to visit you next autumn be assured i purpose it  i expect dodsley every week he will i am convinced be for publishing his miscellany next winter would mr w  think you agree that you and i should be allowed to publish such of poor mr whistlers papers there as we judged were most likely to do credit to his memory  adieu dear mr graves let us reconcile our affections to the ordinary events of life and let us adopt my friend jago into our second triumvirate i am however always with peculiar attachment yours  w shenstone my best compliments to mrs graves   p s since i wrote the foregoing i have had mr davenport of davenporthouse with all his family  his brother the clergyman remembered you by your picture  his wife is the finest person etc i have seen here except lady aylesbury  ingenious easybehaved and of an excellent temper  they come to bath in a fortnight  since that time sir george lyttelton mr lyttelton and miss lyttelton sir george thinks some alterations requisite in my verses to which i cannot bring myself easily to conform  but must  i look upon my scheme of embellishing my farm as the only lucky one i ever pursued in my life  my place now brings the world home to me when i have too much indolence to go forth in quest of it    lxix to the same on hearing that his letters to mr whistler were destroyed the leasows oct         dear mr graves it is certainly some argument of a peculiarity in the esteem i bear you that i feel a readiness to acquaint you with more of my foibles than i care to trust with any other person i believe nothing shows us more plainly either the different degrees or kinds of regard that we entertain for our several friends i may also add the difference of their characters than the ordinary style and tenor of the letters we address to them  i confess to you that i am considerably mortified by mr john w  s conduct in regard to my letters to his brother and rather than they should have been so unneccessarily destroyed would have given more money than is allowable for me to mention with decency i look upon my letters as some of my chefdoeuvres and could i be supposed to have the least pretensions to propriety of style or sentiment i should imagine it must appear principally in my letters to his brother and one or two more friends i considered them as the records of a friendship that will be always dear to me and as the history of my mind for these twenty years last past the amusement i should have found in the perusal of them would have been altogether innocent and i would gladly have preserved them if it were only to explain those which i shall preserve of his brothers why he should allow either me or them so very little weight as not to consult me with regard to them i can by no means conceive i suppose it is not uncustomary to return them to the surviving friend i had no answer to the letter which i wrote mr j w  i received a ring from him but as i thought it an inadequate memorial of the friendship which his brother had for me i gave it to my servant the moment i received it at the same time i have a neat standish on which i caused the lines mr w  left with it to be inscribed and which appears to me a much more agreeable remembrancer  i have read your new production with pleasure and as this letter begins with a confession of foibles i will own that through mere laziness i have sent you back your copy in which i have made some erasements instead of giving you my reasons on which those erasements were founded truth is it seems to me to want mighty few variations from what is now the present text and that upon one more perusal you will be able to give it as much perfection as you mean it to have and yet did i suppose you would insert it in dodsleys collection as i see no reason you have to the contrary i would take any pains about it that you should desire me i must beg another copy at your leisure  i should like the inscription you mention upon a real stoneurn which you purchase very reasonable at bath but you must not risque it upon the vase you mention on any account whatever  now i mention bath i must acquaint you that i have received intelligence from the younger dodsley that his brother is now there and that none of the papers i sent him are yet sent to press that he expects his brother home about the fourth or fifth of november when he proceeds with his publication possibly you may go to bath whilst he is there and if so may choose to have an interview  i shall send two or three little pieces of my own in hopes that you will adjust the reading and return them as soon as you conveniently can all i can send tonight is this ode to memory i shall in the last place desire your opinion as to the manner of placing what is sent the first pages of his miscellany must be already fixed i think to propose ours for the last but as to the order it will depend entirely upon you  adieu in other words god bless you  i have company at the table all the time i am writing  your ever most affectionate w shenstone  lxxx to mr jago the leasows june         dear mr jago were i to pronounce my sentence upon the long suspension of our correspondence i should impute the blame of it in almost equal measure to yourself and to me to you for an omission of the letter you promised me when last in town to me for waiting in expectation of it and for neglecting to do justice to the sentiments of my heart on the occasion of your late preferment great were the hopes i had indeed conceived that your increase of revenue had been accompanied with a place of residence which was more to your mind than that where you at present abide but i do not find by any accounts that you purpose to leave harbury for which no doubt you have reasons which i do not yet penetrate but which may demand my assent the moment you discover them i have but little to say of the life i have led since you received some account of me from mr hylton in london the winter or at least its ministers continued to tyrannize during the minority of spring and the spring has alike been slow in giving up the reins to summer of consequence i seem in a sort of middle state betwixt a dull halfanimated grub and an insignificant locomotive fly neither in the one state or other am i of the least importance but from the advances which i have already made you are somewhat the more likely to find me in your garden about a fortnight ago i received a line or two from our intimate acquaintance and schoolfellow mr hall it was brought me by sir edward boughtons gardener a fellow of good taste to whom mr hall desired i would cause the leasows to be shown i find you have delighted mrs hall by some alterations which you propose for their environs and which they thoroughly resolve to put in execution when i come over into warwickshire as i hope to do soon i shall be very glad to make them a visit in your company my spirits though far from good are better in the main than they were in winter and on some peculiar days are raised as high as to alacrity very seldom higher seldom so high  you must from hence at least take matters in the order or rather disorder in which they occur mr miller i saw on wednesday last in lady lytteltons coach who stopped two minutes at my gate on her return from london i enquired concerning you but could gather no intelligence  mr hylton who is now in warwickshire if he have not strolled to london has been with me several months this summer he is adding a room or two to his place which lies very near me and purposes to reside there as soon as it is finished the situation is not void of beauties but if you will pardon the vanity must veil its bonnet to mine i have heard of planting hollies pyracanthas and other berrybearing greens to attract those blackbirds which you have so effectually celebrated it shall be my ambition to plant good neighbors and what with lord dudley and his exotics mr hylton with his fossils and myself with my ferme ornee is there not some room to expect that we may attract the tasters this way but first we must take some care to advertise them where their treasures lie  another day is passed and mr miller etc has again been with me and waked me out of a sound sleep to breakfast  he mentions with what reluctance he left a surveyor at radway employed in taking plans of the field of battle near edgehill this he purposes to enrich with a number of anecdotes gleaned from his neighborhood which must probably render it extremely entertaining and surely edgebill fight was never more unfortunate to the nation than it was lucky for mr miller he prints together with this plan another sheet of radway castle i approve his design he will by these means turn every bank and hillock of his estate there if not into classical at least into historical ground  i have done mighty little about my grounds since last winter as indolence has on many occasions contributed to impair my finances it is but just that it should sometimes contribute to restore them yet i am not quite destitute of something new for your amusement  of late i have neither read nor written a syllable what pleased me last was hogarths analysis i expect dodsley down every week and as he will spend a few days with me i could wish you were to meet him his genius is truly poetical and his sentiments altogether liberal and ingenuous  i am at present a surveyor of roads employed in repairing my lane to the turnpike  how glad should i be to meet you and to show you its beauties to show you mr hyltons new series of coins  his designs as well as his performances at lappa  how glad should i be to see you yea i would hardly fail to return with you to harbury were you to add this one obligation i left mr miller in doubt whether he would not see me at radway some time next week evil and capricious health the particulars of which would make a detail of no importance destroys all my punctuality and bids me promise with fear you i trust are mostly at home and were you to be at snitterfield i would follow you without reluctance so with hopes to see you shortly either in warwickshire or shropshire i relinquish the subject  i have reserved a very melancholy subject for the last may you and mr graves and myself stand firm to support the fabric of friendship which has lost a very beautiful column in poor mr whistler he died of a sore throat which in a few days time turned to an inward mortification  i will say no more on the occasion very affecting has it been to me  god preserve your life your happiness and your friendships and may you ever be assured of that with which i am dear sir  your most affectionate humble servant w shenstone shall i beg a line from you as soon as may be  i do most earnestly  i am given to understand that i may expect a visit this summer from the bishop of worcester from lord ward lord coventry and lord guernsey  it may be so but honors of this sort which would formerly have affected me perhaps too deeply have now lost much of their wonted poignancy can such persons bear to see the scenes riant and to find the owner gloomy let them as they are able make my circumstances more affluent and they shall find the reflection in my face and in their reception but as this will never be it is no compliment to declare that an hour or twos interview with you or mr graves outweighs the arrival of the whole british peerage  something else i have to say young pixell last winter told me that the organist of worcester had set your ode the blackbirds to music that he liked the music and that he would sing it next evening at the birmingham concert i have not heard him mention it since and i forgot to enquire but if you happen to have the notes i should be glad if you would enclose them for me  i have been of late much bent upon the increase of horns in this neighborhood  do not interpret me perversely i mean french horns only my lord dudley has had a person to teach two of his servants  nothing  at my instigation but your old acquaintance maurice who lives at the corner of my coppice will exceed him in a week by means of a good ear i have borrowed a horn for him adieu    lxxxi to c  w  esquire july        dear mr w  you do me justice in believing that i am truly sorry you have not been well a degree or two of regularity more than what you have already will i fancy restore your health and my satisfaction and i beg you will afford me the earliest account of your recovery  i considered master w  s visit as an absolute engagement and remained at home in constant expectation of him for a fortnight together  i am however not sorry for his own sake that he is gone to oxford especially as you seem to have an assurance of its proving advantageous pray assure him of my earnest wishes for his happiness and that the leasowes will be always at his service whenever through the fickleness of human nature he thinks proper to give up a muse for a waternymph  i expect mr hylton daily  he was last week in london and is now i believe at coventry  he will probably visit you before he comes into this country  he talked of it when he left me  i am obliged to be brief  postwoman waits for me multa gemens dodsley is the man for your purpose  he has with good genius a liberal turn of mind  i expect him to spend a few days here every week  i will if he return through warwickshire occasion him to call upon you but you know he is often lame with the gout and will hardly be able to make any long digression  your case is exactly mine you say you cannot bear wrongs with patience but you can sleep and forget them  so can i  so do i  did i never tell you if not i do so now that indolence in a thousand instances give one all the advantages of philosophy and pray if you call me lazy any more take care that you do not use an expression by way of disparagement which i consider as the highest honor i am a fool however for discovering my secret what a number of compliments might you have made me unwittingly  tacitus pasci si posset corvus haberet plus dapis and rixae minus invidiaeque had i time i could comfort you under your illusage by discovering to you the similitude of my own situation  excuse this scrawl accept my compliments carry them to mrs and miss w  and believe me ever your obliged and most obedient humble servant  w shenstone  lxxii to mr jago on their contribution to dodsleys miscellanies the leasowes jan         dear mr jago i am sure you must be puzzled how to account for my silence after the honor you have done me by your verses and the request you made that i would write  i am also as much at a loss how to give a proper weight to my apology to say i have been ill would perhaps imply too much when i would only allude to that state of heaviness and dejection which is so frequently my lot at this time of the year and which renders me both averse to writing and utterly dissatisfied with every thing that i do write  if at any time my head grew a little less confused than ordinary i was obliged to devote my attention to the affair in which i had so foolishly involved myself with dodsley you are unable to conceive what vexation it has given me i could not endure to disappoint him of consequence it has been my lot to study the delicacies of poetry when my brain was not sufficient to indite a piece of common prose but as the mouse by which i mean my own performances will so soon make its ridiculous appearance it were totally impolitic in me to expatiate on the labors of the mountain  the first letter i received from you left me greatly dissatisfied i was then to send d  my final instructions in a post or two  you took little notice of any query i made and intimated a disapprobation which agreed too well with my own internal sentiments i knew not but you were angry at the liberties i had taken though i could have suppressed any single paper which i had then conveyed to london  little did i then imagine that it was in my power to have protracted the affair till now had that been the case i should have troubled you with repeated embassies for i abhor the tediousness of the post and my servants do little at this time of the year that is of more importance than their masters poetry  your next letter convinced me that you had taken no offense and so far i was happy but then i wanted to have your goldfinches as correct as your blackbirds there were some things i wished you to alter and others in regard to which i was desirous to speak my sentiments add to this my own verses with which i was infinitely more dissatisfied why then did i not write  the true reason was that i was pressed by d  to send conclusions every post and though i have had all this leisure as it happens since you wrote i never could depend upon more than the space of a day or two besides criticisms in the way of letter are extremely tedious and dissatisfactory insomuch that i am thoroughly determined never to print any thing for the future unless i have the company of my friends when i send to the press hurried as i then was i sent up your two copies and what i proposed for him of my own with a kind of discretionary power to select the best readings how you would approve of this measure i knew not but i had this to plead in my behalf that d  was a person of taste himself that he had as i imagined many learned friends to assist him that his interest was concerned in the perfection of his miscellany and that i submitted my own pieces to the same judgment  after all i am but indifferently satisfied with the present state of these contributions d  writes just so much as he deems necessary in the way of business and passes by a thousand points in my letters which deserve an answer his last acquaints me that he has spent a whole day in the arrangement of what i have sent him and that he purposes to send me proofsheets before the close of this week desiring i would send them back by the return of the post whether they arrive on saturday or on monday i can keep them till the thursday following  and this brings me in the last place to the main purpose of this letter  it is a request on which i lay great stress and which you must not refuse me upon almost any consideration  i beg in short that you would promise me the favor of your company on monday or even tuesday next if possible and let us jointly fix the readings of your pieces of my own and those of our common friends  you will immediately comprehend the expediency of this now in particular that our names are to appear some alterations i think necessary in your goldfinches and there are two or three stanzas which i think you might improve  nevertheless i will not pretend that this journey is so requisite upon your own account as mine and will recommend it upon no other footing than the pleasure you will receive by the obligation which you will confer  i thought to have concluded here but as an envelope is now become altogether necessary have a temptation to proceed which i did not see before  it is now become friday the twentyfourth of january the packets i send and the request that i make upon so little warning will at first astonish you  unforeseen interruptions would not suffer me to dispatch my courier sooner  what then remains but that i endeavor to adjust this affair agreeably to its present circumstances  you will readily conceive from what you observe in my packets how desirable your company is to me at this juncture supposing it then in your power to come over on monday tuesday or even wednesday i am inclined to believe you will supposing it not so i can foresee you will not have leisure to satisfy my queries by the return of the bearer and what i would next propose is that you would either suffer me to send again to you betwixt this time and thursday next or that you would yourself dispatch a purposemessenger and allow me to pay for his journey  in either of these latter cases i am sure you so well know the nature of my present irresolution that you will endeavor to afford me all the assistance you are able  adieu my dear friend and depend upon my best services on every possible occasion  i am ever your most affectionate and most obedient servant w shenstone  lxxxiii to the same on the same subject the leasows feb         dear mr jago i received a letter from dodsley dated the fifteenth of february informing me that you were then in town had been with him and left your directions whether he might send you a set of miscellanies  february the twentieth and not before arrived young h  with your letter very obligingly intended to give me previous notice of your journey but which by the iniquity of chance tended only to acquaint me with an opportunity which i had lost  there is nothing could have been so fortunate as your journey to london had mr h  thought proper to bring your letter in due time  what excuse he made for his neglect or whether he made any i have really forgot this i know that the whole affair has been unlucky there has been abundant time for consultation and a perfect series of opportunities of which we have not been suffered to avail ourselves  it is now three weeks or a month since i corrected the proofsheets was so hurried in the doing of it that i scarce knew what i wrote and yet in spite of all this hurry the book is hitherto unpublished now indeed it must be much too late for alterations as d  has given me some room to expect a book this very day  i know but little what he has done in consequence of that discretionary power with which i through haste was obliged to entrust him but in what i have done myself you may expect to find all the effects of dullness precipitated  it is now the twentythird of february and i have received no fresh account of our friend dodsleys proceedings nor am i able to trace them as i expected in the newspapers  as to your share of this miscellany you can have no cause to be dissatisfied  after what manner he has thought proper to print lady l  s verses i am a good deal uncertain but i apprehend he has not followed her own readings very precisely and that the blame thereof is to be thrown upon me  i am concerned for the memory of my poor friend whistler and regret that his better pieces did not fall into my hands i think that dodsley however would have done him greater justice had he inserted his translation of horace and lydia it is true the translations of that ode are out of number but his if i mistake not had many beauties of its own  i do not know whether i ever hinted to you that his genius and that of ovid were apparently congenial  had he cultivated his with equal care perhaps the similitude had been as obvious as that of your twindaughters  mr graves has one small wellpolished gem in this collection his verses upon medals  his little conjugal lovesong is also natural and easy  i told you what i least disliked of my own puerilities  if the printing of my rural inscriptions be invidious it was altogether owing to the instigation of sir g  l  there are four or five little matters which if he have printed with my name incorrect as they are i shall be utterly disconsolate at least till i get sight of a succeeding impression  for though i am not much solicitous about a poetical reputation and indeed it is of little importance to so domestic an animal as myself yet i could ill endure to pass for an affected powerless pretender  and now no more upon the subject  i have nothing to add that can the least amuse you  you who have been conversant with all the busy and the splendid scenes of life can want no materials to make a letter entertaining  indeed you never did  i shall be glad however to receive a long one upon what subjects you please  i have passed a very dull and unamusive winter my health indeed rather better than i experienced it last year but my head as confused and my spirits as low i live in hopes of an opportunity of seeing you at harbury but i begin now to receive visits as an honest beggar does an alms with my humblest thanks for the favor and with a despair of making a return  perhaps my next letter may discover somewhat more resolution inclinations i never want being at all times with singular affection yours  w shenstone  lxxxiv to the same the leasowes april        dear mr jago i have so long expected the favor of a few lines from you that i begin at last to question whether you received the letter i sent you it was enclosed in one to mr m  whom i requested to further it with all convenient expedition i am neither able to recollect the whole contents of it nor indeed if i were could i endure the thoughts of transcribing them the chief intention of it however was to acquaint you of mr h  s unhappy delay in the delivery of that letter with which you favored me from radway  what confirms me in a suspicion that my last letter miscarried is that mr wren lately acquainted me of your being at wroxall upon business and of your making some slight mention of mr dodsleys publication without intimating that you discovered any design you had of writing to me this is mere preamble and stuff implying nothing more than the desire i have to hear from you when it ought also to express how impatiently i long to see you worldly concerns and my winterly state of health have detained me at home for these many months past worldly concerns may have confined you likewise but as your health and spirits are universally better than mine and as you have much less dislike to traveling than myself i would hope that my absence from harbury will never cause you to neglect any opportunity of coming hither for my own part i have been meditating upon a visit to you all this winter and do at this time resolve most strenuously to perform it before june but the many such schemes of pleasure in which i have been disappointed are a sort of check upon my expressions and make me promise with fear as to dodsleys performance which you must have received before this time i will make no observations till i have the pleasure of seeing you and yet there are many points i would discuss and many accounts i want to give you so many indeed that they would furnish out perhaps a superficial drawling letter but would serve infinitely better for conversation with the book before us the volume i am told is well received in town though political intelligence must engross much of its present attention  mr hylton is in my neighborhood and upon the point of settling at his farm could you possibly spend a week with us we would try to make it agreeable at all events i beg to hear from you and that not merely as it will afford me great pleasure but as at the same time it will ease me of some solicitude i will not make this a long letter though i wish to receive a long one in return having a head very little qualified to add any thing that may amuse you though a heart very sincerely and affectionately at your service  w shenstone  lxxxv to the same the leasowes dec         dear mr jago though the silence that has prevailed for so long a time betwixt us be i fear to be placed to my account yet do i by no means imagine that you will desire me to fill half this letter with apologies suffice it that i owe all the world at this time either letters visits or money yet that my heart is as well disposed in each of these respects as that of any one person who is insolvent the regard indeed that i owe to you has been a troublesome inmate within my bosom for some time past making daily remonstrances against the injustice which i have done it and urging me strenuously to take horse and make my personal apologies at harbury  i return you many thanks for mr s  s company and for the sight of the manuscript which he showed me alas that i cannot spare money to drain and to improve my lands or to put almost any part of his excellent rules in execution and yet that mr child of kinlett hearing my place always termed a farm should come expecting to find all things managed here according to the perfection of husbandry as little can i pretend to improve mr s  s treatise as his treatise will my farm no farther at most than in what regards the style or plan of his performance yet could i wish to see both it and him again before he prints it wishing him all the success which his very endeavor deserves assuredly the present is not the time for his publication more immediate remedies than can be derived from agriculture are become absolutely requisite to relieve the sufferings of this nation  i should be extremely wellpleased to visit you at harbury but cannot even propose to myself that happiness at present and were i even to promise have but too much reason to know the uncertainty of my performance yet am i sensible enough we ought to meet if we purpose that what we print should have the advantage of our mutual criticisms let me then conjure you to come over at your convenience for a few days that we may agree at least upon some general points and make no worse a figure in the future miscellany than we have done in the foregoing see the edinburgh review no     but i have really more things to say than i will pretend to scrawl upon paper nor can i endure to retail a few particulars while i am impatient to communicate the whole  let me acquaint you while i remember that there is at this time a mr duncombe and his son clergymen that are publishing a new translation of horace whatever you may think of their success after francis i believe i may pronounce them men of real merit and in no wise destitute of learning or genius they have requested me to communicate any version or imitation that i can furnish either of my own or of any friends wherefore it you have any thing of this fort i should be glad if you would put it in my power to oblige them the son has an ode to health in the fourth volume of dodsleys miscellany  under the head of intelligence i have mighty little to convey  the house at hagley is in a manner finished so far as concerns the shell and wants nothing besides a portico to be as complete as most in england  pray remember me to mr talbot mr miller and mr holbeach should they call upon me next year they will find my place better worth their notice  i am and have been ever cordially and most affectionately  your most obedient servant w shenstone  lxxxvi to mr graves with some account of politics and poetry the leasowes april        dear mr graves you will be harrassed with my letters till you condemn my excessive leisure as loudl as i have lamented that you should ever feel the want of it nor is it a point so easily decided which of us may be the greater sufferer you through my officiousness or i by your long silence yet the partiality which you have ever shown me will i think dispose you to receive my letters more patiently than it is in my power to sustain the loss of yours after all i should not write at present but that the miscellanies with which dodsley compliments us arrived last week at the leasowes i desire therefore you would acquaint me whether the fet that he means for you should remain here till your arrival or if you choose that i should send it by the birminghamstage to bath having made this enquiry i was thinking to conclude but cannot reconcile myself to the novelty of sending you three empty pages the parliament will rise too soon for the publication of my rural elegance and having performed my promise to dodsley i think no more about such laurels as the public can bestow upon me but am giving all my attention to such as i can purchase of my nurseryman i wish however that the volume may recompense dodsley for his trouble i may also add for his ingenuity and for his politeness in giving each of us a complete set they are elegantly bound and all as much alike as possible  the present crisis of state affairs does not seem to favor his publication as the attention of the public must lean greatly to that quarter i saw a letter from sir william m  who corresponds with lady luxborough which placed the struggles of the ministry in a clearer light than they had yet appeared to me it seems that persons of all denominations are for carrying on the war with vigor and the kings application for a vote of credit was received with general approbation the zeal of the parliament was indeed so remarkable on this occasion that instead of the  00000 l at first intended it was thought proper to propose a million but the services were ascertained and the chancellor of the exchequer made accountable for the application of it the augmentation of the fleet with  0000 seamen the raising  000 marines on a plan of dividing them into small companies which will render them more useful both by sea and land the completion and reinforcement of the irish regiments are the uses to which this million is to be appropriated mr fox and his landwar party sat mute whilst mr leg with great openness and perspicuity explained the present schemes as they were calculated to exert our whole strength at sea and if possible no where else mr dodington who it seems has not spoke for many years charmed every body his wit did not only entertain but animate and affect his hearers it were better he said than lose the dominion of the ocean that the ocean should overwhelm us for what briton could wish to leave a posterity crawling upon this island only to feel the tyranny and swell the victories of france it seems f  in his opposition to the duke of newcastle is supported by the duke of cumberland his army and the scotch that the ministry or the d of n  s party seem not displeased with a prospect of uniting with the tories who now hold the balance and it seems the tories by sir williams letter are as little displeased to unite with the ministry  you will guess that good part of this political account is transcribed and you will guess aright i had some thoughts that it might amuse you and had no occasion to use other expressions  let me now once more return to the futile objects of my own amusement the impression upon this letter will be taken from my new seal the motto that i have pitched upon is superest memoria though i yet retain some hankering after the single word praeteritis probably this however is not the last seal that i shall cause this man to cut in steel the altar is not yet finished ante omnia musae but it does not quite satisfy me  i will enclose the two last letters i received from mr dodsley but you must not think i build too much upon any compliment which he there makes me  it is true i think him a very sincere man but he cannot have been conversant so long with modernwriters but he must conjecture when their piece is published that they a little hunger for applause i am now uncertain whether you will receive a letter from him as he has unaccountably i think sent your books hither and not to bath i am however fully satisfied that your first and last pieces more especially do credit to his collection and must please all persons of taste  i desire my best respects to mrs graves who will be pleased to see the affection that subsists betwixt you perpetuated she will also feel some satisfacton in the professions of friendship that are made you by your most affectionate and faithful humble servant  w shenstone  lxxxvii to the same with a recommendation of mr dodsley to his acquaintance from mr baskervilles birmingham july         dear mr graves it were needless for me to recommend to you a person whom you so truly esteem as mr dodsley and from whom you will gladly receive a visit not more upon my account than upon his and your own  all i beg is that considering the shortness of his time at bath you will be acquainted with him at first sight which i think should ever be a maxim with persons of genius and humanity  he has made a few days extremely agreeable to me at the leasowes has been showing me his new tragedy which i wished you also might peruse if i be not unaccountably imposed upon by my friendship for the writer the extraordinary merit of this performance is altogether unquestionable  i will not inform you through what hands it has passed in town because i would have you communicate your sentiments to him with entire freedom being assured the delicacy of them may yet be of service and that the openness with which you communicate them will be infinitely pleasing to mr dodsley he has done me the honor to ask me for an epilogue  i wish but fear to undertake it  should any lucky hint occur to you i well know how much you are able to manage it to advantage in that case i would beg a line from you the first opportunity  what talk i of a line from you who am at this very time many letters and apologies in your debt but i cannot add many syllables to the letter i am writing  i will write again in a few days mean time my compliments to mrs graves and remember that mr dodsley and you become well acquainted at first sight  i am ever dear mr graves your most affectionate humble servant w shenstone  lxxxviii to the same on mr dodsley and his works the leasowes mar        dear mr graves i have passed a very dull and unamusive winter here  the worse for being neither disposed nor qualified to keep up a correspondence with my friends with you among the chief and yet it is upon you that i must depend to make up my deficiencies with mr dodsley  the poor man has been afflicted with the most lasting fit of the gout he ever underwent before  his patience on these occasions is inimitable his excursion to the regions of terror and pity is not the only instance of his ability to compose verses in the midst of pain when he sent me a copy of it he let me know that he had transmitted another to you by the same post i should be glad to receive your remarks upon it ere i communicate my own i have for some weeks past sound my head so terribly confused that it has been with difficulty i could think or express myself on the most superficial topic i hope in a little time to be able to examine it more attentively than i can at present yet in the mean while must acknowledge that i think his subject capable of furnishing extraordinary beauties for an ode and such i think he should call it dropping the narrative parts and the connexions as much as possible i cannot wish him to print it without very material alterations and what would occasion almost the same trouble as it would require to newwrite it i do not mean this as a condemnation of what he has already done so much as a proof of my opinion how much he will he able to improve it after all it will scarce affect me half so so much as his tragedy he is so honest a man that the work he has to give the world is much better than the specimen or to borrow an idea from my situation the grain that he has to deliver will prove much better than the sample it is with shame i acknowledge i have not yet sent him his epilogue and i feel the greater compunction of mind upon this score as it is possible he may impute my neglect to garricks refusal of his play this weighs nothing with you or me a thousand motives may affect a manager that have little or nothing to do with the merit of the performance yet he may so far thank mr garrick that whatever his refusal takes from the reputation of his tragedy it will through dodsleys industry add apparently to its value i have not yet been able to satisfy myself with every part of your epilogue and must either omit sending it at present or must send him an imperfect copy if you write to him let me beg you to give the most favorable account you can of me  somebody acquainted me i think it was mr talbot that your old friend ballard had bequeathed you his coins for a legacy i was truly glad to hear it but have wondered since that you never once informed me of so considerable an acquisition  i remember a poem of yours called  upon the present taste in gardening which you will not wonder if my late employments make me wish once more to see be so kind as to send me a copy of this as well as of any other little pieces that you have in your bureau some of yours deserve a better place than what is assigned them in the magazine in particular i remember that upon enigmas and mopsy be assured i will make no use of any without your previous consent you know i suppose that dodsleys other miscellanies do not appear before next winter  i have received from him together with his ode a few elegies published by mr whitehead they are i think worth your perusal and designed by my worthy friend to excite my emulation alas that i am so ill able to deserve the encouragements which i receive from him  my neighbor baskerville at the close of this month publishes his fine edition of virgil it will for type and paper be a perfect curiosity he follows the cambridge edition  what think you of their management in regard to mr byng i cannot help thinking the king should pardon him the court martial by acquitting him of cowardice or disaffection have left no motive for his negligence beside an error of his judgment for we cannot impute it to supineness indifference or inattention and then to sentence a man for error is to expect infallibility that twelfth article of war is most undoubtedly illexpressed  pray do not forget my best respects to mrs graves  let me hear from you soon and believe me ever  yours w shenstone  lxxxix on the same the leasowes april        dear mr graves what remarks i had to make upon our friend dodsleys ode i sent him the last post i would gladly have occasioned them to pass by claverton but having delayed them so long i was impatient to convince him that i had not wholly disregarded his request they are indeed pretty copious and yet i have reserved to myself the privilege of recriticising when i see his altered copy i recommended to him the addition which you proposed and some others and if he will but take the pains that i have chalked out for him i doubt not that he will render it an excellent ode though he may not find it a very popular one i have also sent him a copy of our epilogue not much different from what you saw to these i added my little ode on lady luxboroughs furnishing her library and perrys verses upon the malvernwaters at the close of these last there appears with perrys approbation a short address to dr wall of worcester a very eminent physician and the patron of this mineral who has promoted a subscription in the county toward building near this well for the accommodation of strangers  i purpose also to give dodsley the little ode i enclose and would beg the favor of you to advise me concerning the additional stanzas fix the readings in the rest and to return me the copy  i come now to analyze your remark on ballards legacy which is indeed very ingenious but will scarce bear examination nor do i think that you rather wish to have found that set of medals than to have them given you by a deceased friend assuredly if we do not allow pleasure to be predominant in this kind of melancholy we destroy the foundation of all tragic or elegiac writings melpomene has no place amongst the muses and the pains that we have taken with our friend dodsleys pensive ode have been employed to no purpose but you want not these pedantic flourishes and are wholly of my mind  martins magazine is i believe pretty obscure and i wonder where you got a sight of it it was however fortunate enough for me that you gave no copy of james dawson i never yet saw your verses on that grotto or from phaedrus and i want to see your w  once more concerning which you are silent your pepperbox and mopsy might i think appear in dodsleys miscellany either with or without your name i also want a copy of your verses upon riddles and whenever you have a leisure hour should be glad if you would look them out and send them  go and think yourself an happy man at least if your children be recovered as i am inclined to think they are and give my service to mrs graves for the happiness that she occasions you of which i cannot but partake being with constant and sincere affection your most obliged humble servant  w shenstone  xc on the same about      dear mr graves do you know my handwriting  it is really such a length of time since you had demands upon me for letters that i am hardly able to enumerate the several causes of my neglect this i know that scarce a day has passed during this interval of silence in which i have not remembered you with the most affectionate esteem  i hope you correspond with our friend dodsley and that it is not altogether disagreeaable to you to find he is printing some of your verses he has many alas too many of mine which i suffered him to take away in summer and which the state of my winter health and spirits renders me but ill able to revise i believe i am even now the principal cause that his two volumes remain yet unpublished nor can i express the pain it gives me to be thus detrimental to his interests and to delay the publication of so much better pieces than my own i am also dissatisfied upon another score i mean that i have been wanting to myself in not asking the benefit of your advice which i have heretofore experienced to be at once so comfortable and so advantageous but although the scheme was projected in summer the business of correction was by me at least deferred till winter and then i had neither spirits to correct or to correspond  i am really as much obliged to you for the pains which you took on my behalf in london as though the subject of your enquiry were a thing of more importance to me but indeed you can hardly conceive how indifferent i am now grown not only as to articles of that sort but to aught that regards external splendor  i really have not time to enter upon the merits of inoculation but am very sure that mrs g  s danger was enough to influence your determination i am heartily glad to hear of her recovery and can but look upon the weeks which i purpose to pass some time hereafter with you at claverton as the most agreeable of any that belong to the remainder of my life i i am sensible that if i coveted to shine in poetry i should lose no time in visiting public places but my wishes of that sort are most extremely limited and i shall visit you on the account of friendship that is past all doubt on a much better principle  i have long meant to write to you and have accordingly given some answer to most parts of your last letter nevertheless the occasion of this present letter is quite of another kind  a young painter of my acquaintance is advised to to go to bath has a recommendation to the bishop of b  who will introduce him to the duke of n  and though i cannot so easily bring him acquainted with nobles or primeministers i can give him directions to my friend who in point of taste is their superior the person then who i suppose will be the bearer of this letter has by dint of mere ingenuity risen to a considerable eminence in fruitpieces etc he has been employed by lord lyttelton and is much admired at oxford for my own part i believe you will think he is in few respects inferior to and has if i am not mistaken some advantages of stranover but you will see his pieces all i have to say further on the occasion is that he is a native of our parish and a particular friend of mine and if it were in your power to promote his interest at bath you would not only highly gratify me but at the same time do a service to one of the least assuming most ingenious and most amiable men i know  i beg my best respects to your family and am dear mr graves most affectionately  yours w shenstone  xci on the same the leasowes may  0      dear mr graves i thank god i have recovered a tolerable degree of health this spring though by no means free from so much heaviness and lassitude as renders me averse to all activity of body and mind in the course of my disorder so long as i could bear to think of any sublunary enjoyment i remembered my friends and of course thought much of you but its advances were so precipitate when i sent for the physicians that i soon received a wrench from every object of this world and it was by slow degrees even after my recovery that my mind took so much root again as appears necessary for its immediate support i suppose you have been informed that my fever was in great measure hypochondriacal and left my nerves so extremely sensible that even on no very interesting subject i could readily think myself into a vertigo i had almost said an epilepsy for surely i was oftentimes near it  it became therefore expedient for my recovery to amuse myself with a succession of the most trivial objects i could find and this kind of carelessness i have indulged till it is grown into an habit even letters to my friends are hardly consistent with my rule of health yet i could be no longer silent with regard to you without feeling a sensation that would hurt me more this may fairly enough be termed the first letter i have wrote since my recovery wherein if i should tell you one half that i am inclined to do relating to this dreadful illness what room should i then leave to speak on any other subject i must therefore tell these things by word of mouth or write them some other time the journies which my friends and indeed physicians propose for me are what certainly bid fairest for the completion of my cure yet there are many many things which however unfit for the task i must endeavor to adjust before i can leave home with any possibility of enjoyment need i mention any other than my cursed embarrassment with d  who during my danger was induced to stop proceedings but is now beginning law afresh and by the removal of tenants from his share of the harborough estate has now wriggled himself into possession of almost one half of mine however i am not without hopes of seeing all terminated in a little time nor entirely without a prospect of seeing you at claverton this summer that you may think this the more probable i am pressed by two young gentlemen whom i very much esteem to accompany them on a visit to mr bamfylde in somersetshire these two gentlemen are mr dean and mr knight perhaps you may have heard of mr bamfylde who is very much at bath is there now with his lady or has left the place but lately and whose fortune person figure and accomplishments can hardly leave him long unnoticed in any place where he resides yet my visit to estercomb must be of secondary consequence to me whilst you live by the roadside i am much obliged to you for your compliment on my poematia in dodsleys miscellanies which came very seasonably considering how i had been mortified by the first sight of what was done to speak the truth there are many things appear there very contrary to my intentions but which i am more desirous may be attributed to the unseasonableness of my fever than to my friend d  s precipitation my purpose was to acknowledge as mine none of the pieces which now follow the longer ode to lady luxborough her name was actually erased as also my own at the close of your fable the verses by mrs bennet to mr richardson were absolutely new to me were my name occurs again all this is against me as a thing in itself invidious to have ones name recur so often and as my own lines contradict the merit which my friends so liberally allow me  the verses of mine in the sixth volume which was printed before the fifth were printed without my knowledge and when i sent up an improved copy it arrived a good deal too late as things happen i am made to own several things of inferior merit to those which i do not own  all this is against me but my thoughts are avocated from this edition and wholly fixed upon a future wherein i hope dodsley will be prevailed upon to omit some things also from other hands which discredit his collection and to balance all my discomforts on this head the world will know that i am esteemed by a person whom i esteem so much as you  i know not how it happens but the taste for humorous poetry does not prevail at this time yet i cannot agree with mr j warton that it is no poetry at all any more than that a good representation of dutch boors is not a picture  his brother the professor is to be here with his pupil lord donegal etc this summer  mr spence and mr dodsley will stay a day or two here this month in their way to scotland and mr home the author of douglas etc called on me and we spent an evening together at admiral smiths thus my ferme ornee procures me interviews with persons whom it might otherwise be my wish rather than my good fortune to see would to god it could attract you whom i more long to see than any one and let me tell you there were considerable additions made to it last year dodsleys present of faunus a new gothicbuilding or rather a skreen which cost ten pounds and the ruins of a priory which however make a tenants house that pays me tolerable poundage  i am growing a little into your taste why should not you advance farther into mine i mean i have a love for medals by means of some that have been given me yet do not think that i shall ever rival you  my object is only beauty and i love only those of exquisite workmanship so that this is no more a rivalship than that of two persons who admire the sex but love different individuals a rivalship which i trust is more likely to cement our friendship than disunite us which it is my conviction and my comfort no sort of rivalship will ever do i have hardly room to express my good wishes for long health and happiness to mrs graves and your little family and to subscribe myself my dear friend  your ever affectionate humble servant w shenstone  xcii on the same july         dear mr graves it gives me great anxiety when i reflect how long i have waited for the satisfaction of a line from you i beg if you are alive and well you will let me know so by the next post  mr dodsley and mr spence have been here and stayed a week with me the former was in certain hopes of seeing you in town but i do not find that he either saw or heard from you which adds to my anxiety  i have seen few whom i liked so much upon so little acquaintance as mr spence extremely polite friendly cheerful and master of an infinite fund of subjects for agreeable conversation had my affairs permitted me they had certainly drawn me with them into scotland whither they are gone for about a month upon a journey of curiosity  i believe it will give you pleasure to hear that my lawsuit with d  is accommodated by the generous interposition of my lord stamford concerning whose benevolence and magnanimity it is impossible for me to speak in the terms which they deserve it is ended i hope not very disadvantageously for me apparently with one advantage of being entirely exculpated in the opinion of all mankind the common method as m bruyere observes is to condemn both on these occasions  this suits peoples indolence and favors their impartiality  and though the equitableness of my whole conduct in this affair was selfevident to all that were near me yet i found many that were inclined to blame us both and some that i could never convince till now that the fault was not wholly mine  your pepperbox and saltseller are in one of the chronicles  they pillage dodsleys two last volumes of all that is worth perusal  i surely have some friend amongst the writers of the monthly review for i have not only escaped a flogging but am treated with great civility  i never know how to leave off when i begin writing to you having always a great deal to say i only purposed you a few lines to desire you would write directly pray make my best compliments to mrs graves and believe me ever yours most invariably  w shenstone  xciii to the same containing an account of his excursions and amusements the leasowes nov         dear mr graves i have had daily expectations of a line from you these two months conscious however that i did not deserve any and affording a manifest instance of of the infatuations of selflove the last letter that i received of yours is dated the close of july since which time i have been chiefly engaged in my customary amusements embellishing my farm and receiving the company that came to see it my principal excursions have been to enville on lord greys birthday to lord wards upon another invitation and to the worcester musicmeeting i need not mention what an appearance there was of company at worcester dazzling enough you may suppose to a person who like me has not seen a public place these ten years yet i made a shift to enjoy the splendor as well as the music that was prepared for us i presume nothing in the way of harmony can passibly go further than the oratoria of the messiah it seems the best composers best composition yet i fancied i could observe some parts in it wherein handels judgment failed him where the music was not equal or was even opposite to what the words required very many of the noblesse whom i had seen at the leasowes were as complaisant to me as possible whereas it was my former fate in public places to be as little regarded as a journeyman shoemaker  there i first saw our present bishop also our late bishops monument which is fine  lastly there i first saw my lady coventry to whom i believe one must allow all that the world allows in point of beauty  she is certainly the most unexceptionable figure of a woman i ever saw and made most of the ladies there seem of almost another species on the whole i was not a little pleased that i had made this excursion and returned with double relish to the enjoyment of my farm it is now high time to take some notice of your obliging letter  i think i was not told the purport of the journey you made to london so can only say i am very sorry for the aggravating circumstances of your disappointment and hope long before this time that mrs graves is quite recovered  did i forget to make your excuses to dodsley or no  he was here as i remember soon after with mr spence in their way to scotland  mr spence the man you would like and who would like you of all mankind he took my elegies into scotland and sent them back on his return with a sheet or two of criticisms and an handsome letter  how much am i interested in the preservation of his friendship  and yet such is my destiny for i can give it no other name i have never wrote to him since this impartiality of my neglect you must accept yourself as some apology but to proceed mr spence chose himself an oak here for a seat which i have inscribed to him spences oak subintellige sedem istam hanc vellet  i absolutely forgot to talk to dodsley about your  and i am vexed because i could with a safe conscience have raised his idea of your abilities  however it is not too late even if you care to publish it this winter  his play comes on i fancy this very night at covent garden what he says in behalf of this step is that there was no glimpse of probability that garrick would ever admit it at the other house he says the players liked it and seemed inclined to take    mrs bellamy is his cleone and speaks the epilogue of which more anon i suppose he acts by lord chesterfields opinion for i know when he was going to print it since he came home with a proper dedication to mr garrick my lord then prevented him telling him it would be acted one day or other  did i ever send you a copy of the epilogue with all the additions and alterations dodsley first liked then disliked it and lastly liked it again only desiring me to soften the satire shorten the whole for it was upwards of sixty lines and add a complimentary close to the boxes  all this i have endeavored and sent it him last monday  you would not care to own it and he would fain have me but i think neither of us should run the risque where so little honor is to be acquired yet mr melmoths name to the prologue is an inducement  i was very near surprising you at claverton this autumn with my friend young knight in his way to mr bamfyldes but he goes again in spring and i shall certainly accompany him i have bespoke but not yet procured any horses for my chaise it is a neat one you will find and i have made two or three excursions in it  i saw mr patchens topographical letters soon after they were published  it you continue to me the honor of a shield in your gothic alcove the field should be either or three kingfishers proper or with the addition of a chief gules three trefoils argent  no bar cheveron bend etc  more of this when i write again  motto flvmnina amem sylvasque inglorivs  rvra mihi  i cannot recollect my company of the season to tell it you  sir francis dashwood lord litchfield and mr sheldon were here together in the beginning of the autumn and i have strong invitations to visit them  i have a very genteel letter from sir francis offering me goldfishes and i have a double inducement to visit mr sheldon as he lives near mickleton and is the most agreeable man alive  your acquaintance lord w  dined and spent good part of a day with me  under a sort of gloomy appearance a man of admirable sense and some humor  i put him in mind of you and the remarkable monument at cambden  mr thomas warton was also here with lord donegal and has since sent me his inscriptions which are rather too simple even for my taste  bishop of worcester with his family and company  lord willoughby  lord foley  i mention lord foley the rather because i shall call on your friend dr charleton who was also here to pass a day or two with me at whitley  i shall pass also a day or two at our bishops whom i met since at enville these two  propose what i will besides will probably be the principal or only excursions that i shall make this winter  god send it may no more affect my health than it has hitherto done  i am at present tolerably well and live more temperately than before  would to god you could come over go with me to dr charletons and lord foleys and lord stamfords and pass a week here i would meet you with my chaise at worcester or even farther i have finished a building opposite to the new stable which i think you saw  they together give my house a degree of splendor did you see my priory  a tenants house one room whereof is to have gothic shields round the cornice  i am in some doubt whether to make it an house of lords or house of commons if the former my private friends will have shields round my gothic bedchrmber  the wretch is cursed that begins a letter with no better a pen than i finish one with my dear friend write directly a long letter  keep me alive in the memory of mr graves and believe me ever yours most affectionately  w shenstone  xciv to the same in expectation of a visit christmas      dear mr graves there can be nothing more welcome to me than the intelligence which you give of your intended visit at the leasowes god knows how few of these interviews may for the future be allotted to us and i should be glad at least to testify the joy which they afford me by meeting you at birmingham or elsewhere within one days journey for my chaise  pray be so good as to give me one more letter before you set out  very glad should i be to pay my respects to your brother at mickleton for whom i have the truest respect but dare not give encouragement for fear that aught should interfere  i have ten thousand things to say to you but will defer them i think all i am positive your  may be made advantageous to you by means of dodsley and even reputable if you so please  will not mrs g  accompany you pray convince her of my sincere regard  i want to congratulate you on your escape from the smallpox in a manner different from your ordinary acquaintance yet am not able to express my sentiments  guess the rest knowing and sufficiently knowing that i am with constancy and ardour your most affectionate friend  w shenstone  xcv to mr jago the leasowes jan        dear mr jago if you knew the maxims on which i conduct myself you might call me perhaps unpolite but i think by no means unfriendly i mean with respect to the ordinary congratulations on your marriage were you and i less intimate less experienced and less assured friends it had been no venial omission to have neglected such a ceremony perhaps i should not have neglected it but as i have the satisfaction of believing that you would rejoice in any success of mine so i hope you would not distrust my sentiments upon any change of your condition which you yourself esteemed for the better i do indeed my worthy friend wish you much joy both now and at all times and you will ever discern it in my face as often as fortune grants us an interview  mr s  is a benevolent man and i am sure would withold no information that tended to illustrate our friendship on either side  i have thoughts of proceeding on to harbury whenever i come to mr wrens as i have long enough made my friend a promise and intend ere long to do many reasons occur why i cannot set forward tomorrow morning are these reasons substantial or no other than the sly and sophistical insinuations of indolence  surely the former  dodsley and indeed mr spence both expect me in town this february  i fear it will not be but if it should how readily would i give notice and become obliged to you for your company  though i should have expected you would select a partner whose society you could enjoy yet i was not a little satisfied with the hint given me in your letter as well as in one i had before received from mr s  it is not for such ladies as you and i esteem that mrs see epilogue to cleone bellamys extraordinary lecture was intended and a lecture it would have been with a vengeance had not d  omitted some thirty lines and substituted about twelve or fourteen of his own however he is now going to print his fourth edition of it in which the original epilogue will be restored as well as considerable improvements introduced into his play he sold two thousand of his first edition the very first day he published it  i have so much to tell you and of so various kinds that i am afraid to expatiate upon any one article cannot you make a shift to call upon me before my public life arrives  i would send my chaise to meet you at any place you should appoint  i have passed my winter hitherto pretty cheerfully amongst my books in what i call my library it now better deserves that name by the form i have given it and the volumes i have added  mr s  would tell you something of my other occupations  i could wish that you would favor me with a copy of your essay on electricity and with any new copy of verses of your own or of your friends  be not apprehensive there shall nothing more appear in print of your composition without your explicit consent  and yet i have thoughts of amusing myself with the publication of a small miscellany from neighbor baskervilles press if i can save myself harmless as to expense  i purpose it no larger than a lansdowns a philipss or a pomfrets poems  have you read my friend dr graingers tibullus  it affords you an elegant edition of a good translation and of the text he is engaged in a war with s  and has just sent me his pamphlet which i could wish you to read in order to form a judgment of s  s character spence i see has advertised his parallel betwixt malliabecqui and his tailor it is merely a charitable design and such are now all spences views  what remains of my paper must be employed not in mere ceremony although in something that bears the form of it in my best compliments to mrs jago and my offer not indeed of a part of the friendship which i owe you but rather of an equal quantity in an assurance of the cordiality with which i shall rejoice to see both her and you and in confirmation of that affection with which i have ever been and am my good friend your mos obedient servant  w shenstone  xcvi to mr graves on their several situations and compositions the leasowes april         dear mr graves you will think my silence long and i should be sorry to have you quite regardless of it although i fear it must be my fate to trespass frequently upon your kind solicitude  i have no excuse to make besides some frivolous avocations and much of that heaviness and lassitude which disinclines one to write letters  i passed the former part of winter with more vivacity than i did the latter or even the incipient spring owing possibly to these cold winds which will not permit me to use my wonted exercise you will laugh at the word vivacity when applied to so dull an animal but i speak comparatively of that unmeaning drowsiness which is my lot at other times and was in some sort while you were here  mr dodsley tells me he received a letter from you acquainting him that cleone would be played at bath i should be glad to receive from you any particulars of its success he is publishing an elegant edition of it which i expect by this very post the new plate of my grove which will appear at the end of his melpomene is perhaps liable to some exceptions but by much the best that has yet appeared do not forget to send me your objections to it as to the epilogue i have totally banished i think every one of the lines which he substituted have left to him the choice of two or three readings for the four last lines and though none of them quite please me yet the epilogue on the whole discovers more of genius is more spirited and less inaccurate i shall be glad to find that you think the same with me  in regard to your place so far as i can form an idea of it i would have you consult selfamusement i mean without too much regard to what others say or think as to distinguishing your ingenuity which i unfeignedly desire you may the press affords you more adequate materials than either your fortune or perhaps your place do not imagine however that i shall not be much delighted with every stroke i trace of yours at claverton my faculties are very strongly intuitive in respect of every thing belonging to you and i should be ashamed if any nook or angle that you had rounded any wall that you had ruinated any stream that you had diverted or any single shrub that you had planted should elude my discovery yet you will shine more by means of the press and if i said any thing concerning your  that did not encourage you to perfect it i am sure i must use terms very inexpressive of my meaning without any more words let me entreat you to proceed with it give a full scope to your imagination and if there should be aught one would wish retrenched it is mighty easily done  i have indeed thoughts for i never use the word resolutions of publishing my elegies next winter  you will gainsay when i tell you my intention of publishing also my very farm at least about eight or ten scenes taken from it by way of topand tailpieces for those elegies  the world will perhaps tax my vanity but i do not in the least care  the pleasure which that world gives me i am very conscious will not be too high and i am determined that the pain it may seek to give shall bear proportion yet should i be sorry to obtrude stuff upon it either from the pencil or the pen and my good friend mr dodsley has sometimes pained me not a little  i tell you you cannot allow for winter  that very scene near priorygate shows not a bit of road in summer though the consciousness of a firm rail there would add to my own tranquillity  mr knight has given me stranges prints which i hear are fine dodsley gives me swans but for these two months past i have been a librarian or rather a bookbinder yet nothing more unfeignedly than yours and mrs gravess most affectionate humble servant  w shenstone  xcvii to the same on fables mottoes urns inscriptions etc the leasowes oct        dear mr graves depend upon it i shall see claverton before winter  the mischief is that with as violent a propensity as ever person felt i shall not be able to reach your hemisphere while mr spence mr dodsley and mr whitehead give it such peculiar luster in my eyes this i did not despair of doing at the time mr dodsley left me at birmingham it turned upon an event which i did not indeed explain to him the accommodation of the affair with d  which concerns near one half of my little fortune and which if i have any luck on my side must now be perfected within a fortnight i was shown the rough sketch of our conveyances last saturday  once for all my indolence is not in fault my health and my worldly embarrassments have often been so and at present are pol me miserum patron vocares si verum etc  dodsley to give his book eclat should allow himself time to abridge and polish it is not enough in my opinion merely to surpass lestrange and croxall the grand exception to fables consists in giving speech to animals etc a greater violation of truth than appears in any other kind of writing this objection is insurmountable their peculiar advantage is to remove the offensiveness of advice in order to which one should perhaps pursue a medium betwixt the superfluous garniture of la fontaine etc and the naked simplicity and laconism of phaedrus in respect of his own newinvented fables i wish him to devise uncommon subjects and to inculcate refined morals but pray send me your two directly which will answer all that i expect in fables  did mr dodsley tell you of the seat in my shrubbery which i had taken the freedom to inscribe to you i could not satisfy myself in an inscription and from a kind of spleen and aversion to delay made use of the shortest that i could devise the seat and scroll are elegant the inscription only amicitiae et meritis  i will not be so affected as to pretend that the much greater compliment you design me is more offensive to my modesty than it is pleasing to my friendship i wish however it could be a little shortened the inter hortensis elegantiae studiosos seems a little too verbose for inscription beside i had rather the compliment were not thrown with so much emphasis upon any skill i have in gardening but in some sort divided betwixt that and poetry if you perceive no great objection suppose amicitiae g s or amicitiae g s amicitiae g s or cvivs votis a motto fortvnatvs et ille deos qvi novit agrestes panaqvf silvanvmqvf senem nymphasqve sorores virg illustravit seems an happy word here if it do not say our too much of nobility villa i presume implies no more than a country mansion house  but i leave the whole to your discretion  now you speak of our arcadias pray did you ever see a print or drawing of poussins arcadia the idea of it is so very pleasing to me that i had no peace till i had used the inscription on one side of miss dolmans urn et in arcadia ego mr anson has the two shepherds with the monument and inscription in alto relievo at shugborough  mr dodsley will borrow me a drawing of it from mr spence see it described vol   page    of the abbe du bos sur la poesy et la peinture  tell mr dodsley if he be yet at bath that mr cambridge called and dined with me answering precisely to the idea which i had conceived of him from mr d  s account  i wish to god he may have brought you acquainted with mr spence to whom you are in my estimation the most like of any one i know is mr spence yet at bath mr d  is gone or going either he or the former told me that on the princes asking pope how he could be glad to see him when he expressed so much contempt of kings pope answered though he did not like old lions he loved the young ones before their claws grew anecdote of pope and the prince of wales long ago pray read madame de sevignes letters  they have amused me much of late i hope within a post to send you a neat plan of my farm etc the same to mr spence by your means if he be at bath do you hear who is to be bishop of worcester give me the earliest intelligence you can gather  the late bishop visited me last year and intended i hear to have done so this i wish we may have another as obliging and polite as i always found his late lordship  i want to enclose some little engravings etc to you but must wait till i can get a frank write directly for this once i beg you though you prove dilatory another time of all books whatever read burke second edit of the sublime and beautiful and of all points whatever believe that i am with my best good wishes to mrs graves dear sir ever your most affectionate and invariable friend  w shenstone di memoria nvdrissi piv qve di speme how do you like this motto for an urn  my best compliments to mr spence and mr dodsley if at bath i will write soon to each of them  your garden is as pretty as you can make it    xcviii to the same the leasowes oct         dear mr graves i want no conviction of the pleasure which you will receive from the termination of my infernal lawsuit it must if i have any luck be finally adjusted in about nine days time after having robbed me of my peace for six of the best years of my life during the former part of life i languished for an acquaintance somewhat more extensive and when the company that flocked to see my place removed all grounds of that complaint this accursed dispute arose and mixed with every enjoyment that was offered me  i have sometimes found entertainment in balancing the good and evil that has been allotted me in general and have in the end imagined the good prevalent and that i have great reason to be thankful for more happiness than i deserve  yet are there many awkward circumstances that forbid the scale to fall precipitately among the chief i place the distance to which i see you and one or two others removed this is indeed an heavy article and were it not for letters would be insupportable  as to mr dodsleys collection of fables you are mistaken if you think that i perused the quarto book i dipped into it here and there and thought there wanted much alteration there was a little book with a papercover on which i bestowed no small pains and when i had so done crossed the fables which i thought might well enough pass muster addison would have been the best writer of fables of any author i know  the purity of style  the conciseness  the dry humor  and the familiar manner  as to dodsleys publishing this winter he may possibly do so without loss of credit but when one considers that they are or ought to be the standard for years to come one can hardly avoid wishing him to give them the polish of another summer twas fortunate that you pitched upon the raven and magpie to transcribe for me as mr dodsley had sent me the sunflower and the tuberose before i think the last somewhat inferior but will reconsider it before i write again the fable which i literally translated from phaedrus was the wolf and the crane in order to give dodsley an idea on what rollin laid the stress in fables  as to the inscription i will endeavor to adjust it to your mind  meritisque reconditioribus may do but is not explicit enough i want fully to express a character that shines remarkably among select acquaintance and yet through extreme refinement makes less figure in the public eye  i had made the same objection to burkes chapter upon words  and yet there seems to be something right in it du bos which i have only seen in french but which i believe is also translated consists of three volumes   mo his subjects are pleasing and his knowledge may be entertaining but his genius seems not very profound from the little that i have consulted in him  dodsley is precisely what you say of him an object of esteem and love and in some degree of admiration his ear does not wholly please me in writing and yet he is intimately affected with music  lord l  s ear is perhaps the reverse i mean he does not much regard music yet writes harmoniously in verse and prose  robertson i think to buy  butler also though i shall not admire him  lord clarendon when i am rich  rasselas has a few refined sentiments thinly scattered but is upon the whole below mr j  did i tell you i had a letter from johnson enclosing vernons parishclerk pray take dodsleys advice in regard to your  and heighten the ridiculousness of your hero which his kind of lunacy will countenance yet admit him to say good things  but do not make any alteration in the narrative of your own story  at least till i have again perused it  do not spurn this fifty pounds it will procure you numerous conveniences which you would perhaps otherwise deny yourself  i have passed four or five days betwixt this week and last at my lord wards at hinley  this has furnished me with franks beside the consolation i derive from having paid a visit of this kind it is spinis e pluribus una saltem exempta the restraint renders them spinae i hope i may say so without umbrage or giving an appearance of disrespect for mr w  is an agreeable man and my reception was very polite  i have three or four more of these superb visits to make and which i may not omit without giving real offense to lord plymouth next week lord stamfords the week after then to lord lyttelton at our admirals and then to lord foley if your friend dr charleton will accompany me then etc alas alas quid me exempta juvat spina i must conclude upon a separate paper that your expectation may not deceive you in regard to the plan i promised i enclose a survey of my farm reduced to miniature by a neighboring artist let me know if it bring the place to your memory  i think to have a plate which may be done at birmingham for six or eight shillings that shall leave me no trouble but to tinge the impressions with colors in order to give my friends but do you advise me to engrave this or another that is twice as large  i have purchased gerard upon taste the author of which is a professor at edinburgh and the book commended in the review  you will say that the reviewers are partial to scotchpeople  i know nothing of that but the book is learned and on a pleasing subject  i may perhaps add a ver important one  for surely it is altogether unquestionable that taste naturally leads to virtue i am however in some doubt whether it will give you that amusement which burkes has done  i must now take my leave having engagements of a different kind but not till i have desired my hearty respects to mrs graves and her acceptance of this grove and kingfisher i am dear mr graves ever and most entirely your very affectionate  w shenstone  xcix to the same on his want of leisure the leasowes nov         dear mr graves though i write to you again so soon yet it really grieves me to hear the complaint which you so often make for want of time i who have time to waste by lustres cannot have patience with the world that suffers you to want the leisure which you would employ to so much better purposes perhaps however you are as happy as more leisure could make you the case is not so clear as to leave me satisfied of the contrary and yet as the pleasures of imagination have an undoubted claim to a real existence they must surely afford very lively sensations to persons of your sensibility and refinement  be this as it may i will always murmur that you can so ill spare time for literary amusement  nevertheless make one effort and finish the task you have now before you i must confess you may naturally reply that i am now become an interested person but this i am sure will be no check to your activity  mr william duncombe sent with the first volume of horace one of the satires in ms inscribed to me upon purchasing however the second volume i find my name is changed to hawkesworth  who knows but i lost this compliment by writing to you my friend while i should have been writing to him  if so indeed you ought to make it up to me and i am sure i shall prize your compliment beyond that of which i have been deprived  the view of b  which you mention i have indeed seen a long time ago but surely the waterfall is quite detestable there is something on each side as i remember that puts one in mind of a porridgepot boiling over beneath the potlid the appearance of the house and the background is better this was adjusted by the painter the other as i think smith told me by an old housesteward of lord t  s  i have enclosed another copy of the lines to venus for your emendation  thank you for the stanza you introduced  i meant indeed before to allude to natural beauty more than moral but did not fully enough express myself there remains no transition now but from animal beauty to inanimate which is easier  you will observe that i take great liberties with the fables you ask me to revise  dodsley must think me very fantastical or worse while i was correcting those he wrote at the leasowes  i find my ear much more apt to take offense than most other peoples and as his is far less delicate than mine he must of course believe in many places that i altered merely for alterations sake i cannot be easy without some certain proportion betwixt one sentence and another betwixt one member of a sentence and another without a melody at the close of a paragraph almost as agreeable as your magnificent salon  i have not written to dodsley any decent letter since he arrived at his house in london  i must now apply myself to write half a score fables and if he chooses it a translation of la mottes discourse upon the subject  your reply in regard to the delay of my publication cannot be answered that is certain  whitefields journal i fear is purged of its most ridiculous passages  dodsley brought one down hither for mr deane to show my lord d  th but he tells me there remains nothing of that gross absurdity which i saw in your brothers at mickleton  the painter whom i just mentioned to have taken some portraits through my recommendation and to have painted a ruin for my greenroom offers to give me my picture if i choose to sit  were you here to lend me your assistance i should certainly comply  mean while tell me what you think of some of the attitudes that i enclose what i myself prefer at present is to lessen my dimensions which of itself gives a kind of beauty and to appear in a kind of nightgown agreeable to the attitude marked aa the man evidently hits off likenesses and is esteemed to shine among the painters of birmingham i shall be forced to have you picture copied by him which by means of dampness flies off the canvas so that on the whole i shall re pay his compliment  this last article puts me in mind that i owe you my picture whenever you demand it but i would choose to defer it till the spring for some certain reasons regarding economy remember me always to good mrs  and believe me yours with all possible affection  w shenstone  c to the same with an account of a design for his own picture the leasowes jan      0 dear mr graves were i to regulate my compliments by the arrival of times and seasons i should congratulate you upon a correspondence which now enters upon its three and twentieth year  our frienship is of something older date and is not this an achievement that deserves the honor of a triumph both for you and me too  more i am sure than the regular destruction of fifteen or twenty thousand wretches in the field considering how uncommon we find friendships of so long a duration and how cheap we find such victories not only on the prussian but on the austrian side  mr cambridge scriblerus who called here this autumn was considering this massacre rather in a philosophical than political view and indeed it does not appear to me that plague earthquake or famine are more pernicious to the human race than what the world calls heroes but enough of this  your want of leisure gives me pain surely if i may guess by one or two of your last letters you have enlarged the number of your scholars and extended your domestic cares beyond what your circumstances require  you must not judge of my painters abilities by the small sketch i enclose  i desired him to give me a slight one and have perhaps ruined even that by endeavoring to bring it nearer to what the picture now is myself it will give you a tolerable idea in the most points except the pan which has his face turned toward the front and is not near so considerable  i chose to have this term introduced not only as he carries my favorite reeds but as he is the principal sylvan deity  the waternymph below has the word stour on the mouth of her urn which in some sort rises at the leasowes on the scroll is flumina amem sylvasque inglorius alluding to them both  the pan you will perhaps observe hurts the simplicity of the picture  not much as we have managed him and the intention here is i think a balance  the dog on the other side is my faithful lucy which you perhaps remember and who must be nearer the body than she perhaps would if we had more room however i believe i shall cause her head to cut off that little cluster of angles where the balustrade joins the base of the arch the balustrade is an improvement we made the other day it is i think a great one not only as it gives a symmetry or balance to the curtain of which you complained but as it extends the area on which i stand and shortens the length of this halfarch the painter objected to a tree i know not why unless that we could introduce no stem without encroaching too much upon the landscape but the reason be gave was it would be an injury to the face  the console is an apollos head the impost does not go further than the pilaster which ends the corner and here the drawing is erroneous  we are i think to have a carpet though we know not well how to manage it  and now i must tell you the dimensions  the figure itself is three feet three inches and a half the whole picture four feet eleven inches by two feet three inches and threequarters  the color of the gown a seagreen waistcoat and breeches buffcolour stockings white or rather pearlcolour curtain a terrasienna or very rich reddish brown  i think the whole will have a good effect but beseech you to send me your opinion directly there are some things we can alter but there are others we must not  your shall have one of the size you desire in the spring but will you not calculate for some one place in your room the painter takes very strong likenesses is young rather daring than delicate in his manner though he paints well in enamel goodnatured slovenly would improve much by application adieu  w s  ci to the same on fable and other articles of taste and literature the leasowes feb      0 dear mr graves i could not understand by mr dodsleys last letter to me that he had any sort of intention to publish his fables this winter presuming upon this delay and having neither had the leisure nor the frame of mind fit to take his preface into consideration i have hitherto deferred to do so and can only say in general that i could wish you had happened to be more copious in your observations la mottes discourse on fables is a most excellent performance containing as appears to me all that need be said upon the subject and this expressed with all imaginable elegance and perspicuity i believe i shall advise our friend d  to make more ample use of this dissertation there is a translation of la motte into prose which is altogether below contempt and yet for aught i know the only one the word naive is very probably that for which he has substituted the word lively though by no means of similar import natural approaches nearer it but according to la motte is not precise and as the words naif and naivete seem of late to become more in vouge i will here give you an extract of what he says upon the subject je ne souhaiterois plus rien a lauteur de fables  ce nest detre fidele au sentiment and de le peindre toujours avec la naivete qui le caracterise car jose encore distinguer le naturel and le naif le naturel renferme une idee plus vague and il est oppose en general au recherche au force au lieu que le naif lest particulierement au reflechi and nappartient quau sentiment le sublime selon cette idee peutetre naif la reponse du vieil horace a la question quon lui fait sur la conduite de son fills que vouliezvous quil fit contre trois quil mourut cette reponse est naive parce que cest lexpression toute nue du sentiment de ce romain qui prefere la mort de son fills a sa honte il ne repond pas precisement a ce quon lui demand il dit seulement ce quil sent ce nest que dans la verse suivant que la reflection succeed a la naivete ou quun beau desespoir alors le secourut il raisonne dans ce verse il na fait que sentir dans le premier  les occasions du naif sont peutetre plus frequentes dans la fable and leloge de la fontaine est de nen avoir gueres manquees dans la fable du pot au lait le discourse quil preto a sa latiere est un chesdoeuvre de naivete dautant plus singulier que sous lapparence du raisonnement le plus suivi le sentiment se montre dans toute sa force ou pour mieux dire dans toute son yvresse    and now let me know what english word you would employ to interpret naif sentimental has some pretensions but is not wholly to ones mind  i bought the quarto edition of la mottes fables to which this essay is prefixed though the vaunted cuts which tempted me to this extravagance did not answer my expectation the author with much address begs the duke of orleans to be at the expense of them which to the best of my remembrance was deux mill ecus  mr hurd you see is one of dr warburtons chaplains i bought his dialogues moral and political almost as soon they were published sir edward lyttelton told me the introductory one would be omitted in the next edition the three following are very ingenious but the two former are a little ambiguous in regard to his intended moral the two last are wholly political and i have not yet perused them though esteemed the best  have you seen dr smiths theory of moral sentiments which is prodigiously commended and which i have bought but not read  you will see an account of this in the monthly review  i have lately been reading one or two volumes of the rambler who excepting against some few hardnesses in his manner he too often makes use of the abstract for the concrete and the want of more examples to enliven is one of the most nervous most perspicuous most concise and most harmonious prosewriters i know  a learned diction improves by time  i am sorry to find no mention of your  in all the letters which i have received of late do not think of dropping or even delaying the publication of it only if you please before it goes to the press let me peruse it once deliberately  what think you if dodsley approve it of admitting cuts into your scheme  and now from cuts i proceed to pictures alcocks portrait of me is in a manner finished and has been hung up for these nine days past in its carved frame opposite to the fire place in my library they say it is a likeness allowing for the diminution of size indeed if i can conclude any thing from the strong resemblance which he has produced of others here i may form some conjecture that he has not failed in mine  be this as it will the picture is upon the whole a tolerably pleasing one and this is the most i must dare to say considering my own person makes so large a part of it  what think you of a tawney or reddish brown for the robe or nightgown with black for the waistcoat and breeches reserving green for the curtain though green is with me at least no very gay color nor has it that effect which you apprehended in the drapery terrasienna is a delightful color so i think is roman ocre burnt let me know then what objections you have to the drapery just now proposed let me know also any design that you think most pleasing for a background or any story of two or three figures that would be suitable for a relievo  from pictures i proceed to painters i believe alcock would go and settle at bath if amos green could be induced to join him amos green is the name of the painter whom i recommended to you before my fever he is esteemed inferior to no one in england for fruit he also paints flowers insects and deadgame very well to this he would adjoin the business of waterpainting alcock would paint portraits in oil and to this he would add enamelpainting both of them the bestnatured young fellows in the world now suppose them also ingenious and tell me whether they would have a chance to thrieve  you ought to have a very considerable amends if you are to be plagued with writing and with musicmasters  i believe i rate your time and trouble at a much higher price than you do yourself  dr blackstone has raised himself to a very eminent figure indeed in the world of letters i rejoice at it without one particle of envy both as he is your friend and a person of merit i believe no one besides yourself would have dreamt of your odd analogy betwixt him and me  i know not how they came to insert that insipid song of mine in the chronicle  what sensation it caused in me was that of disapprobation as it looked like laying stress on what one knows to be of no importance  the chief points wherein my picture varies from your drawing is in the corner below the base of the pedestal where an antique vase is introduced with a flower and two or three leaves of the scarlet geranium the gilt vase agrees well enough with the gold fringe on the edge of the curtain but the whole is so subdued as not to catch the eye too strongly it was chiefly meant to obviate the disagreebleness of the parallel lines and angles occasioned by the step in that corner but it crowds that side a little if one look from top to bottom and though a pleasing object it is hard to say whether it does more good or harm  it is time now to take my leave with my hearty respects to mrs graves and with the usual assurance that i remain your most affectionate and faithful friend  w shenstone do write soon    cii to the same on his neglecting his correspondence the leasowes july      0 dear mr graves i must confess that i do not altogether find your argument conclusive  an hurry of business may be necessary and somewhat inconsistent with frequent correspondence but a state of leisure which i wished you does not imply a course of dissipation which makes your present apology for not writing to me before and so betwixt business at one time and dissipation at another i am to be defrauded of a correspondence that is quite essential to my wellbeing pardon me if on such occasion you find me extremely clearsighted in the foibles of my friends and do not say with the man in horace cur in amicorum vitiis etc the matter is too important for me to connive at any sort of sophism  however to make you easy on this head i am convinced the letter was owing to you for which i will draw my apology neither from business nor dissipation and yet how justly might i palliate my long silence upon either footing since i wrote to you i have been busied in bringing about a conclusion with d  the letters journies etc previous and posterior to the execution of articles would afford me noble matter for excuse  the constant attendance upon workmen of which i have fourteen or fifteen this very day making a piece of water below my priory would produce more on the score of dissipation  you remember the place  this at present is my chief employment although alcock is drawing on the side of my table  i wonder you do not get some little urns turned in any sort of wood about fourteen or fifteen inches high and painted on the side with figures in the manner of some antique bassorelievo he has done something of this sort for me you may if you so please have the ground a dark bronze and the figures a light one i am of late grown fond of bronze which you yourself may easily execute and i think it always was your taste  dodsley comes hither in about a fortnight and prints one edition of his fables by means of baskervilles press and paper mean time he is to give me his picture done by reynolds and to send me two bronzed plaster urns of about twelve inches with bassorelievo and two figures ditto of homer and virgil of about twentyone inches for two niches in my library the parcel is to be pieced out with ogilbys virgil which i want for the sake of the landscapes  and now to the particulars of your letter  i can readily conceive how much greater pleasure you must receive from the retinue of your journey than an archbishop can from all his equipage and i can truly assure you i find a pleasure in every pleasure you enjoy  your room indeed will be a noble one but be sure remember the imploravit opes hominis fraenumque recepit and guard against it  to speak my sentiments i think you will i think with you in regard to tristram shandy so does the author of the monthly review you will see i bought webb instantly but have not read it lord lyttelton is allowedly the author of those dialogues whose the very last i do not know there is a noble specimen of scotch poetry translated from the erse language  i have had two copies sent me from scotland and had i two franks would send you one chrysal or the the adventures of a guinea real characters intended will amuse you something ever occurs that obstructs my traveling at all  and though i long ardently to visit you the lord knows when it will be yet be it certainly will when i accompany mr knight to mr bamfyldes where i am pressingly invited by that gentleman and his neighbors lady egmont sir charles tynte etc  i have about an hundred things more to say which i must defer till i have heard from you  god bless you and yours  w shenstone  ciii to the same on dodsleys fables and other literary articles the leasowes mar        dear mr graves although this interval in our correspondence must be placed i fear to my account you will hardly think it mends the matter to fill my present letter even with the bestgrounded apologies  i will only mention a bad state of health which has been my lot this winter as a general excuse for two or three months silence and then declare as with truth i may that the esteem and affection which you have so well deserved of me have never undergone the least diminution or abatement it is with me a melancholy task to write letters when i am not well although it be the time of all others when it is most necessary for me to receive them  our friend dodsley i presume has sent you a book of his fables before this time what merit i have there is in the essay in the original fables although i can hardly claim a single fable as my own and in the index which i caused to be thrown into the form of morals and which are almost wholly mine i wish to god it may sell for he has been at great expense about it the two rivals which he has to dread are the editions of richardson and of croxall the fables in croxall are tolerably written his reflections little to the purpose either for boys or grown people  richardsons improvement of lestrange would be a better collection both for the fables and the moral reflections had he not admitted through an extravagant and mistaken love of drollery that vulgarity of phrase which in many places is not common english this i think a true state of the case say the best you can in behalf of dodsley  as to his cuts though to him expensive they will hardly i fear meet with much of your approbation  the scale is much too small  and the emblematick prints which are larger will scarce i fear be understood  i procured a copy from baskerville before the plates were inserted and have caused my painter alcock to supply the vacancies with some devices of my own  some account of which i send you as it may amuse you for a minute i want one or two to complete my scheme and should be glad if you would propose some in your next letter  i return you my hearty thanks for the hints you gave for the cambridge verses but when i received them it was too late and i myself too much indisposed either to throw them into proper form or even to answer that gentlemans letter which i thought a very genteel one  i know not what he did on that occasion having seen neither cambridge nor oxford verses  mr dodsley gave me the environs of london  between friends i wish he may find five thousand readers whom the management of that work pleases more than me  i will try to get you some of the cuts if you desire me to do so though it will reflect a kind of tacit dislike of the whole performance  his brother publishes this winter the works of soame jenyns in three pocketvolumes and a chinese novel from a ms translation revised etc by a friend of mine you have perhaps heard me speak of mr percy  he was in treaty with mr james dodsley for the publication of our best old ballads in three volumes he has a large folio ms of ballads which he showed me and which with his own natural and acquired talents would qualify him for the purpose as well as any man in england i proposed the scheme for him myself wishing to see an elegant edition and good collection of this kind  i was also to have assisted him in selecting and rejecting and in fixing upon the best readings  but my illness broke off our correspondence the beginning of winter  and i know not what he has done since  there is a new peerage going to be published  with i believe the draughts of the peers houses  lightholer called here and said he had taken lord lyttletons and lord stamfords for that purpose  the latter of which he showed me  thus have i told you what i hear of new publications  as to what passes in the busy world i know no more than the chronicle informs me  unless when your letters happen to be rounded with little anecdotes from bath  have you seen baskervilles new prayerbooks  my lord dartmouth has undertaken to present two to the king and princess  do for charity sake make me some amends for this long chasm in our correspondence by a very early and long letter  i am sick to hear from you being with ardent and sincere affection your ever faithful friend and servant  w shenstone  our little life is rounded with a sleep shakespeare civ to the same with some political anecdotes the leasowes may        dear mr graves i will upon your last assurance take it ever for granted that you do not omit writing upon any score of ceremony this will render your silence at least in some degree less irksome to me when i do not think it the effect of my own procrastination  mr dodsley had sold two thousand of his fables long ago but complained that he should lose thirty pounds by my neighbor baskervilles impression and that he should not be more than ten pounds gainer upon the whole i told him it was enough in books of this sort if the first edition paved the way for their future establishment in schools and surely so it is for a book of this kind once established becomes an absolute estate for many years and brings in at least as certain and as regular returns i would wish him to give the polite world one more edition from baskervilles press admitting only a new set of emblematical top and tailpieces and confining those empty cuts relating to each fable to the cheap edition which he prints at london a second edition of this latter sort will appear in a little time and if you have any improvements to propose he will very thankfully receive them mr spence offers him to write the life afresh and spence burke lowth and melmoth advise him to discard italicks i confess he has used them to a very great excess but yet i do not think they should be utterly discarded  i did not intend that mr davenport should ever hear of those verses and how he came to do so is past my comprehension he seemed to me to have deserted worfield without any intention to return again i therefore meant to inscribe them under my own venus in order to afford some novelty at an easy rate to those who are curious enough to repeat their visits here pray if you see mr and mrs davenport present my best respects to them and as to the verses i will send you a copy for them if you desire or advise me so to do  mr s  is agreeable not void of learning has some smartness but little taste  mrs s  has much of the latter and perhaps imagination which makes a part of taste may have had no small share in converting her to popery  mr powys i have almost forgotten  you are ingenious very inventive in regard to the means of giving yourself mortification i dare to say your new building suggests no such idea as you conceive  and i think it sufficient in a parsonagehouse if one sees detached specimens of taste or elegance without uniformity or even without consistency  i do not find but that you figure among the gentry near bath dr charlton who was here yesterday with sir francis and mr knight gave me an account that the b  of g  had been to pay his respects to you i will not enter into particulars but would wish you to cultivate his acquaintance  i showed sir francis the dead coloring of the picture which i intend to send to you  but you must know that alcock is the most volatile of all creatures that have not wings by way of improving the picture i meant for dodsley he has made it infinitely less like and yet it must go to london as it is for god knows when he can be brought to alter it  i asked the doctor how mr blackstone came to obtain a seat in parliament and his answer was the king insisted on it as he was a man of learning and ingenuity  the enmity betwixt lord l  n and mr p  i find continues in its full force insomuch that my lord is to have no place while mr p  continues in the ministry  my lord b  s promotion was it seems demanded by the d of n  and mr p  as they would not be exposed to bear the blame while he was the chief mover behind the curtain these little particles of intelligence have i believe sir  for their author  i was told by another politician the same day that we were not to expect a peace  that the french who might give up the colonies would not resign the fishery  mr knight his mother and sister go through bath to mr bamfyldes in about three weeks if nothing intervene i am teazed greatly to accompany them  by my own inclination i can assure you as well as their importunity i do not say i will not nor must i ever promise you beforehand that i will i have good reasons to the contrary they have some thoughts of bringing dr charlton into the party  believe me ever yours and mrs gravess  w shenstone  cv to the same on the intended publication of his works the leasowes sept         dear mr graves i ought to have thanked you many weeks ago for a very long and entertaining letter the length of which as well as the entertainment was increased by a postscript a few days after  but as the winter is with me a dull and uniform season so the summer is a time of universal dissipation and very happy do i think myself when after a continual succession of company visits paid and excursions taken i can sit down in peace and quietness to attend to the business of correspondence and friendship either reason habit or complexion tells me that i am never otherwise so properly employed  the last digression i made was to the concert at worcester to hear the messiah well performed to meet a number of faces one knows but first and principally to visit your brother without which motive i had not gone in the two former respects the journey answered my expectation  but alas your brother was gone into herefordshire i however alighted out of the chaise and the housekeeper very civilly showed me his delightful parlour that looks into the meadows the prebends gardens and down the severn to malvernhills a more agreeable townhouse cannot possibly be found any where but i regretted when i reached the inn that i had not asked to see his children for i either heard them upstairs had a glimpse of them at the window or fancied to a degree of conviction that they were most of them within the house i now return to remark upon some particulars in your letter  i believe it is that indifference you complain of which is the grand detriment to genius in an advanced part of life in all poetical affairs we are too apt to cry out with pallas non est mihi tibia tanti and this renders all our efforts tame prosaic and judicious but this propensity as well as many others we should guard against upon the approach of age change the object of our amusements cherish hopes well or illgrounded of finding that pleasure in the novelty of objects which we have not found in any individual these are the means of preserving our vivacity a somewhat longer time than it naturally lasts but how far it is prudent to attach ourselves to the world that we must leave is a point which you better can determine refined taste as it implies a love of physical beauty has this tendency  there is nothing can be more rational than what you say about the expediency of losing no time if i mean to collect and publish what i have written you are indeed very partial to my abilities but allowing for that what you mention coincides with what i have thought myself and this for some years past a more agreeable kind of distraction in summer and an indifferent state of health and spirits in winter have hitherto prevented any progress in the correction of my pieces to these i might add a suspense about the compositions and the manner proper for publication i am now most inclined to make a collection of the whole i mean the best of what are already printed or in ms to publish them by subscription in a large quarto size for the sake of profit and to apologize for this method by mentioning the expense of top and tailpieces with which i mean they shall be embellished some of these by the bye may be taken from my farm the rest emblematical in an easy and careless but at the same time elegant manner i should think the instance of mr pope might render this method not disreputable and it might be advertised as was done by mr spence that unless a certain number were subscribed for the whole affair should be no farther prosecuted this would put it in the way of many friends to serve me who i flatter myself with inclination esteem themselves void of opportunity let me beg you to think seriously of this as well as of a general title page before you write again  thank you kindly for all the little diverting anecdotes that are contained in your letter i am glad to hear your place brings you company partly as it tends to amuse you and yet more as it tends to make your merit more conspicuous you and i have led a life of total disinteressment let me advise you to seek some advantage from your commerce with great men  the boy who was here with you and mrs graves was here last friday evening with a mr jolliffe and his son the latter of whom observed your name upon the bench and seemed proud to declare that he was once your schoolfellow mr stratford to whom i had written about some goldfishes says in his answer i had the pleasure from bath of waiting upon mr g  and was as much satisfied with the miniature beauties of his place as with the polite reception i met with from the owner if you have an opportunity you will oblige me by presenting my compliments to that gentleman  i met dr charlton at worcester who stands high in my esteem  the account of gothic architecture etc is curious but i have found it in dr warburtons edition of pope  i enclose the verses on the venus de medicis  i told you before my intentions etc concerning them and since i hear that they have appeared in some one of the magazines  through dodsleys or percys means for i surely gave a copy to nobody besides  and those copies must be much imperfect  my picture shall be sent to you as soon as i can possibly get alcock over who has promised to come every week for these three months past i believe he will come soon  i did not know of mr wartons compliment but he is very obliging to me on all occasions and sends me all that he publishes  i have not yet read dr robertsons history to my shame be it spoken though i have the honor to know the author  i hope the king will oblige the irish peers with a place in the procession as that people seem greatly out of temper and i fear not without some reason  i see my friend dodsley has let off his little squib upon the marriage in the chronicle  the king sought a partner etc and last night was brought me from baskervilles press on the same occasion very pompously printed the most despicable grubstreet i ever saw  i have made some little improvements about my place have taken away the wall in front and made a handsome ring have extended my path in one piece of ground greatly for the better  but the grand water in the valley will make no figure till next spring  i have also assisted my friend hull the comedian in altering the tragedy of rosamond had it brought upon the stage to a full house at birmingham where it was very well received put hull into a way of making an indirect compliment to the present king in the ten last lines of his epilogue which was followed by god save great george etc in a full chorus of the audience and actors drawn out abreast upon the stage  since this there has been deposited in my hands a large collection of poetry by a miss wheatly of walsall many of the pieces written in an excellent and truly classical style simple sentimental harmonious and more correct than i almost ever saw written by a lady they will be published i believe by subscription under the patronage of lord dartmouth  but nothing in the poetical way has pleased me better than a compliment which i received about nine days ago by the post under the feigned name cotswouldia  she must be some gloustershire lady that has seen the place as she raises up a fairy in my grove into whose mouth she puts the compliment it seems written by somebody of fashion by the style  can you form any conjecture  there was a mr freeman of betstow or some such name with two or three ladies in a coach and fix that were here not long before a very genteel and polite young man  i really know not how to stop when i begin a letter to you and it is one reason why i look upon the task as too considerable to be undertaken at all times pray write soon and believe me wholly yours and mrs gravess  w shenstone  cvi to the same suggesting to him a subject for poetry the leasowes may  0      dear mr graves i find you will not write unless i give a regular answer to your letters and yet god knows i have a better excuse for my delay than i wish my friend to have for his punctilio  i mean indisposition  whence it has happened i cannot say unless i may blame these continual east winds but i have suffered more from the smiles of spring than i have really done from the frowns of winter  having premised thus much i lay your letter before me the expense of printing a sheet of those commendatory verses at a common press is eighteen shillings and at baskervilles about three pounds ten shillings nor do i mean any decorations unless perhaps the kingfisher or view of my grove which you know i have engraven ready to my hands so you see that this offering to vanity is not likely to be the most expensive  i wish you had bestowed somewhat more attention upon the title in which case i really believe the job had been executed long ago pray be so kind as to reconsider it  is not the garland of friendship a little too quaint for that as i remember was what i proposed  the motto which you proposed was a very good one and i think also that the addition of the next line would be an improvement to it et isti errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum but i do not love double mottoes so if i admit this i must exclude what i proposed which to speak the truth was of my own invention  the custom of prefixing commendatory verses to collections of poetry is now seemingly grown obsolete besides in my case they would only show that i had taken up more fame than my funds would answer i return you many thanks for your poetical benevolence but why do you mention it under the name of epigram i do not even choose that it should have the air of simile from the beginning lo the tall youth by partial fates decree to affluence born and from restraint set free how pleased he etc   i have taken this and some other liberties with it and shall insert it among the rest unless you choose to redeem it with something more to your satisfaction for to speak with frankness i think it better calculated to do me honor than yourself though i could esteem it good if it came from a person whose abilities i respected less than yours there is a subject here which i would recommend to you if by so doing i should lay you under no restraint it is my principal cascade its appearance well resembles the playfulness of infancy skipping from side to side with a thousand antic motions that answer no other purpose than the mere amusement of the proprietor  other similitudes etc would here occur cui enim nascenti faciles arriserunt musae etc it then proceeds a few hundred yards where it rolls and slits iron for manufactures of all kinds resembling the graver toils of manhood either in acquiring money or furnishing the conveniences comforts or ornaments of life and in this manner it proceeds under the name of the stour supplying works for casting forging and and shaping iron for every civil or military purpose perhaps you may not know that my rills are the principal sources of this river or that this river supplies more ironworks than almost any single river in the kingdom for so my friend mr knight told me  the mr d  you enquire after and who wrote the best address sir robert walpole ever received is mr dodington  did i never send you a list of all the concealed names in that miscellany  i began to transcribe one from my own set but find one part of my list is lost i however send it and will piece it out when i find an opportunity as i purpose also to give you some account of our several merits of dodsleys fables by the way do not the verses to dr cornwallis now bishop affect you sensibly vol vi p      they do me whenever i read them and i cannot help applying them to myself i feel somewhat of the same sensation when i read the letters of henry and frances in which from selfpartiality no doubt i find myself extremely like henry  pray let me hear if you please of mr davenport  i wish i had learnt to draw well in early life  it would have given me some very great advantages let me hear also much of mr melmoth who i presume has left you long before this time i did once design to have sent you down my proposals for a subscription and requested the favor of you two to settle them finally without any further reference to myself but my head and spirits have been too bad to undertake even a common letter  what think you of dr lowths grammar  livie met him at mr dodsleys and says he is well pleased with our frontispiece etc to horace livie could not present his book to lord bute himself on account of my lords indisposition mr dalton dr daltons brother who teaches the k to draw presented it it seems this dr dalton who gave the drawing of lord butes arms has lodgings in the palace and sees the king every day while livie was with him word came that the king was coming into his room upon which livie was sent out another way  the king asked dalton whom he had with him  and was answered an editor of horace who had inscribed it to lord bute  dalton is to present a copy to the king  i enclose to you a specimen of the decorated parts of horace with the frontispiece  the book will be published in a months time when i mean you a copy from those that are allotted to me  my lord butes arms are unexceptionably well finished  the other plates either through negligence or the wilfulness of the designer and engraver have given me infinite trouble and vexation however with about twothirds of my directions observed they will i hope afford you some pleasure and discover somewhat more beauty and spirit than one commonly finds in such designs  send me your remarks very particularly i beseech you  w s  cvii to the same the leasowes nov  0      dear mr graves do i really owe you an apology you who are embarrassed with such a number of momentous concerns as hardly allow a fair trial to letters of mere amusement alas i cannot shelter my long silence under a supposition of this kind i believe i even hope that you have disapproved my long neglect as i can very faithfully assure you i have repeatedly done myself there are certain times and seasons when i have not either the power or the will to write as hannibal said about attacking rome quandoque memtem non dari quandoque potestalem this being an intellectual kind of lethargy it would have been at least a friendly office if you had rouzed me as you might have done by a supernumerary letter i never receive a line from you but i feel an almost irresistible propensity to answer it that very instant impediments sometimes occur and that instant being neglected matter is accumulated for a longer letter than i am always resolute enough to undertake at the same time i can never content myself with uttering one half of what i have to say  pray is not that good sort of man to whom you allude a mr k  let him be ever so good a sort of man in the common estimation i dare aver him to be neither an ingenious person nor a candid critic there may be fifty or more preferable readings to what are received in this new horace yet he will find a better text there upon the whole than in any one edition before extant as to the beauty of type and presswork it is too obvious to need vindication the accuracy of the latter almost exceeds what was ever found in any other book then as to the frontispiece it is i think much superior to such as ordinarily occur the subject animated and well chosen and the execution very commendable at least if we allow for the nice touches which it required and the uncommon difficulty of getting any thing of this kind done to ones direction  mr walpole is a lively and ingenious writer not always accurate in his determinations and much less so in his language too often led away by a desire of routing prejudices and destroying giants and yet there is no province wherein he appears to more advantage in general than in throwing new light upon characters in british history i wish he would compose a regular work making this his principal point he has with great labor in his book of painters recorded matter of little importance relative to people that were of less i have a right to be severe for his volumes cost me above thirty shillings yet where he drops the antiquarian in them his remarks are striking and worth perusal  i have sent for gesners rural poems and intend to see the death of abel though i expect to find small pleasure in this poetical prose unless exquisitely well tuned  thank you for the anecdote of lord courtney a thousand such sort of things that engage the public attention are never capable of penetrating the depth of my retirement  mr melmoth you will probably see often as he intends to make bath his place of residence  the omphale you sent me is a most excellent figure and i shall wish much to get a good cast of it at least when i am able to afford it  when i write again i will give you the best account i can of my share in dodsleys new fables though it will be no easy matter to speak separately of it with any precision  and now i think i have spoke to most of the articles in your last letter  mr dodsley who says he visited you would acquaint you how we divided our time whilst he was here into two principal parts lun a dormir lautre a ne rien fair yet we paid our devoirs to a good deal of genteel company of which this season has afforded me at least an equal share with any that went before i will particularize a few opening the list with no less personages than the duke and duchess of richmond  mr walsh member for worcester  earl of bath with dr monson mrs montague who wrote the three last dialogues printed with lord lytteltons and other company from hagley  sir richard ashley  mr mordaunt  dr charlton with mr knight  earl and countess of northampton  mr amyand  lord plymouth and sir harry parker  mr and mrs morris of percefield  lord mansfield with mr baron smythe lord dartmouth and mr talbot  marquis of tavistock and earl of ossory  your nephew mr graves with mr hopton and one of the senior proctors of oxford  lord and lady dacre  baron plessen gentleman of the bedchamber to the king of denmark with mr wendt his tutor  lord and lady vernon of sedbury with his children sir charles and lady tynte and mr garricks brother  mr and mrs melmoth  colonel james  lady ward and lady uill with miss wrottesley miss pigott etc  lord lyttelton mr lyttelton and mr rust  lord and lady dartmouth with lord and lady willoughby de broke  mr anson of shuckburgh with mr stuart the painter and publisher of athenian ruins  mr pepys and sir w wheelers son mr pitts nephew etc  colonel bamfylde with mr knights family etc etc i did not imagine my list would have engrossed so much of my paper and leave so little room to speak about the individuals  lord m  appeared to me rather a man of wit than a man of taste baron smythe the reverse  mr and mrs morris extremely polite and agreeable people invited me pressingly to their habitation i could not help reflecting on the singular happiness of mr morris to be possessed at once of a large fortune one of the finest situations in england and a wife whose taste for rural improvements appears even superior to his own at least if the beauty of her person did not impose upon my judgment there are many others whom i would distinguish if my time or paper would permit  i suppose that you and mr dodsley would be mighty unanimous with regard to the propriety of setting my subscription on foot  i do not dispute any of your arguments  they tally exactly with my own opinion at least allowing for the higher idea you have of my pieces than they deserve  the truth is that i have deferred the publication too long already  till many of the compositions will not appear to the same advantage as before and till i have not half the power that i had formerly to improve them when i am lowspirited i almost shudder at this tremendous contract with the public when my spirits are elevated i see the necessity that you do of not losing a moments time  were you here a week you would put the matter upon a footing that was unalterable  would to god you were here or any one like you however it is probable you will soon hear from me again upon this very subject  i know this that if i print at all the subscription is by no means to be neglected this present winter  i have seen our friend dr charlton many times this season at the leasowes at mr knights at his own house and at my lord foleys this visit to my lord foleys was performed about three weeks ago i went with young knight and the company of the doctor and sir francis charlton took off all restraint and made the visit perfectly agreeable my lords behavior was entirely free and hospitable and his conversation lively and entertaining  i must confess far beyond the idea which i have been taught to conceive of him  his table the most magnificent i believe of any noblemans for thirty miles round  his park and wooberyhill adjacent afford views that are either extensive wild beautiful or grand the portico before his lodge deserves particular notice  his house large and commodious and well furnished but scarce any of the rooms high enough to stand the test of modern criticism but what strikes more than all the rest is the magnificence of his chapel  which however i cannot stay to describe for i this very moment receive your letter  after having written so much before i can only touch upon some few particulars  i believe my scheme of publication will proceed in a little time and that you will soon hear from me again  if you can possibly excuse me to mr davenport and keep me well with him for a week or fortnight i will not fail to write him a respectful letter i am truly ashamed of my neglect but have written more letters within this week than i have done for a quarter of a year before  that there is a faction forming against lord b  i really believe  the war may suit the  world and the city of london has generally the art to represent the landed and trading interest as precisely the same thing  but i think there is a very material difference which it would be no way difficult to demonstrate  at least i am one that cry out nulla salus bello pacem te poseimus omnes i am quite unacquainted with the affair relating to colonel wilkes and lord butes son  and now though i mean to write again soon i will release you from this unpleasing scrawl  i beg however that you would not fail to write to me directly if you can find leisure being quite impatient to converse with you after such a chasm in our correspondence and being with unvariable affection my dear friend for ever yours  pray my best respects to mrs graves  w shenstone my friend dr grainger has written a poem in blank verse which he calls the sugarcane  it is divided into four books  and is capable of being rendered a good poem my friend jago has written another poem in blank verse also which he calls edgehill  it is descriptive chiefly of the prospect  but admits an account of the sight there and many little  and  with compliments also to the gentry of warwickshire  it lies now upon my table    cviii to mr jago      my dear friend a thousand thanks to you for the very obliging and humorous poem which you are so kind to send me i really think it very ingenious and upon the whole extremely correct although i have taken the liberty of proposing one or two hints for farther improvement the relation that it bears to me and my place may tend to prejudice my judgment but i cannot conceive that it requires aught beside impartiality to relish the beauties of this poem i beg i may receive a fair copy in your own hand as soon as possible and i will consider in the mean time how to show it to the public in the most advantageous manner it certainly does me honor as things are at present circumstanced it may tend to do me good which i am very sure you would be glad to see i am a little ashamed to be so much behindhand with you in favors of this and other kinds but i live in hopes there may come a day when i shall find occasion to express my gratitude the pictures you sent arrived safe on thursday and have been since cleaned and put up in their places i cannot enter upon this subject now finding it almost six oclock at night and having just received a letter from mr dodsley which he requires me to answer by return of post it relates to the scheme mentioned in his last which is intended for my emolument but which i must not expect to succeed without considerable mortification this inter nos  you must by no means lay aside the thoughts of perfecting edgehill at your leisure it is possible that in order to keep clear of flattery i have said less in its favor than i really ought  but i never considered it otherwise than as a poem which it was very advisable for you to complete and finish i am now to desire my best respects to mrs jago and to bid you an affectionate adieu  tu comes antiquus tu primis junctus ab annis i am my dear friend ever yours with the truest esteem  w shenstone dec         cix to sherrington davenport esquire the leasowes jan        dear sir mr g  tells me that you have done me the honor to lay some stress upon receiving a letter from me alas it must be owing purely to your benevolence which makes you wish to hear of an absent friend and not to any expectations you can reasonably form of entertainment from his pen the long letter with which you favored me was so very lively as well as ingenious that i despaired of drawing from my fountains the vivacity you do from the bathwaters but be this as it will the vein of friendship that runs through your letter demands my amplest acknowledgements and if you will accept of such returns i promise they will be as hearty as they are insipid  i agree with you that the first sallies of imagination will generally prove the most sprightly and that they will often comprehend the principal features of a subject they are of the nature of deadcolouring in a portrait which one sometimes thinks more spirited than the same performance when finished and yet a good painter will not hurt a portrait by the subsequent labor he bestows upon it nor will a good writer injure his piece by the pains he takes to round and perfect it it must be some defect in the taste of either that makes his diligence detrimental or gives occasion for a standerby to cry out manum de tabula i believe it will appear upon examination that works which cost most labor have generally been thought the easiest and pleased the longest one cannot however deny that there is a sort of persons formed by nature for shooting flying which by the way i could never do and that their sallies of imagination are what they can hardly improve by any future pains these may be called men of wit and fire but it is the union of taste with these that constitutes fine writing true taste will never stiffen or overcharge any performance it will rather be employed to smooth simplify and give that ease on which grace depends one can as little deny that there are kinds of writing which have a better chance than others to succeed without much labor which start forth mature at first as pallas did from the brain of jupiter works of humor are often of this sort and there are many instances in butlers hudibras yet i think the humor of swift was greatly owing to a judicious revisal pardon me my dear friend for this tedious discussion which you little thought of bringing upon yourself by the obliging hint you gave concerning those verses upon venus i do acknowledge that an additional stanza there containing a reflection on chinese architecture were better laid aside it seemed to me one of the splendi da peccata that might be a little popular at this time and has therefore for this season appeared on a board by the side of the venus we who cannot erect fresh temples or even add a new gardenseat every spring are obliged to make the most we can of a new and tolerable copy of verses that costs us thought instead of money and even at a pinch to piece out a dull scene with duller poetry how else could i keep my place in countenance so near the pompous piles of hagley and yet there are few fashionable visitants that do not show an affection for the little amoret as much as they admire the stately sacharissa  plerumque gratae divitibus vices i have often considered why those possessed of palaces yet esteem a roothouse or a cottage as a desirable object in their gardens  is it not from having experienced the imperfection of happiness in higher life that they are led to conceive it more complete beneath a roof of straw where perhaps it may really be as defective as in the apartments of a king or a minister  a thousand thanks to you and mrs davenport for the accommodations you so kindly offer me experience will no more suffer me to question the cordiality than the politeness of your reception what an amusing picture have you given of bath pleasures carried to the utmost height and opiates ready when one is cloyed with pleasures and yet let me confess a truth you have lightly touched upon those very articles which would prove to me the most specifically pleasing for can any temptation be stronger than to say that you reside there and does not my friend g  reside at claverton of whose genius and friendship i have had proofs these twenty years past and have you not mr webb and now mr melmoth to make bath enviable for the residence of literature what a joy would it afford me to go on a party with you to percefield whither mr and mrs morris gave me the most pressing invitations  these surely are pleasures of which  i hope one day to partake  my health generally bad in winter and spring has hitherto been tolerable the influenza of last spring continued to depress me half the summer would you think the verses i enclosed were written on that occasion by a young journeyman shoemaker and one that lives at the village of rowley near me he considered my disorder in somewhat too grave a light as i did not think my life endangered by it but allowing for this and the partiality he shows me you will think the lines pretty extraordinary for one of his occupation they are not however the only or perhaps the chief specimens of his genius and yet before he came to me his principal knowledge was drawn from magazines for these two or three years past i have lent him classics and other books in english you see to him i am a great maecenas although you and my friend expect me to become an author by subscription  on this head i will say no more at present than that i am infinitely obliged by your extreme friendly offers my friend g  who knows my sentiments has sometimes the honor of waiting on you i ought not therefore after this tedious epistle to begin to trouble you with a written explanation of them believe me dear sir with my most respectful compliments to mrs davenport  your ever obliged and most obedient servant w shenstone i will send you some other of woodhouses verses when i can get him to transcribe them    cx to mr jago the leasowes jan        dear mr jago my last letter must have been confused and the arrival of it i fear uncertain  the hare and birds in one of the pictures which you sent me i think are well the other parts of it indifferent they gray hound worst of all the portrait is by no means equal to its companion either in beauty of the person or skill of the painter yet it matches so well with the other that i find my parlour very much embellished by it pardon the freedom with which i criticize your present and accept once more my very thankful acknowledgements  i am truly glad to find so worthy a nobleman and so warm a friend of yours as my lord willoughby is made a lord of the bedchamber  i have heard nothing since i wrote last in regard to my affair though i expect to do so every day i have such a tribe of humors and peculiarities that it is easier to make me rich than to make me happy and ten to one that the favor will not be conferred without disgusting some of these said humors etc however one must make the best of it and reflect that mortifications in one place may preclude mortifications in another  i go tomorrow by appointment to enville where i may probably stay till saturday i have wished most heartily for a copy of your fable to take with me but dodsley has not yet returned that i sent him pray consider my proposed alterations rather as hints than real improvements and let me have a copy as soon you can i wrote my criticism over twice and know not whether i sent the best or the worst copy so i send the other though perhaps much the same i forgot to particularize many shining parts in your little fable that are either elegant or humourous of the former sort nothing could be happier than what you say about h  as it touches in the gentlest manner on a possible truth which if expressed rather than implied might not be altogether inoffensive this beauty is produced by substituting h  instead of l  the place instead of the proprietor  i have lately read the death of abel  it is not void of merit but might have been made much more pathetic by a more simple and prosaic style  i desire my best respects to mrs jago and your family  may not i see you here this christmas as i wish to do because it is the season present and not that i am not at all times and at all seasons most unseignedly glad to wait upon you and most affectionately your ever faithful servant tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes unum opus and requiem pariter disponimus ambo etc your kind remembrance of me in your edgehill has brought these quotations into my head adieu  w shenstone  cxi to the same jan         my good friend i am suspicious that my letters of which i have sent two do not reach you by the way of warwick this is meant as an experiment whether they will arrive by way of southam it is meant withal to remind you of perfecting your little fable and dispatching it to me as soon as may be i would fain transmit a copy to lord s  s before the family separates or leaves enville by whom i am sure it would be admired  i am just returned from a visit which i made there and four or five days passed very happily at coming away i showed my lord two or three of mr d  s last letters which laid open to him the scheme that was carrying on for me i requested also if there should be occasion which there possibly might not that he would allow me the honor of being known to him he said he was glad to find what was going forward and had long wished to see something of that sort begun before that he should be in town i think in february and would do me any service in his power he desired me also to acquaint mr d  in allusion to the latters uncertainty about my lords political connexions that he thought it the duty of every honest man to support the present government and that he should continue his regard for the minister so long as he saw nothing in his measures that was prejudicial to his country  i know that you will take a friendly part in any good that may befall me pray write be it ever so carelessly and believe me ever yours and mrs jagos most affectionate and faithful  w s  the writer survived the date of this letter but a short time his death happening on the eleventh of the following month to the inexpressible grief of his more intimate friends and the generous concern of those who too late acquainted with his merit were indulging themselves in the pleasing thought of having provided for his future ease and tranquil enjoyment of life  the end
