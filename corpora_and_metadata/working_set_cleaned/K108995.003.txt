dibdins history of the stage  a complete history of the stage  written by mr dibdin  the players cannot keep counsel they will tell all vol iii  london printed for the author and sold by him at his warehouse leicester place leicester square  the stage book v from the birth of shakespeare to the death of elizabeth chap i state of the stage throughout europe at the birth of shakespeare there cannot be a clearer truth than that the stage knew nothing of superior merit in tragedy from euripides and in comedy from menander till shakespeare rome imitated but did not invent italy faintly copied the romans imitations spain sketched but could not paint and france traced but could not draw england continually fluctuating under the influence of various fortunes as customs manners and circumstances prevailed adopted the style of other countries and added to theirs no mean degree of native genius but the efforts were merely thespian and required an aeschylus to perfect them  at the birth of shakespeare italy had fairly struggled with england for preeminence in the dramatic art for nearly fifty years and it cannot be denied that the opposition was very formidable as to talents for during the life of leo the tenth which some of the critics have distinguished by the pompous title of the italian augustan age led on by the prelate trissino and the cardinal bibiena almost the whole of that groop of authors who were patronized by laurence of medicis joined their united labors against buckhurst still and other authors who followed heywood and who by their ingenious and meritorious labors gave the english theater the first lift toward regularity  the reader by this statement will at first sight unequivocally decide in favor of italy for when we reflect on the extraordinary merit of the great tasso whose rinaldo has been the admiration and his aminta the delight of the critics whose gierusalemme liberata has been pronounced by many writers of taste to be the completest epic poem that ever graced literature and who as a philosopher an orator a logician a critic and a poet has merited and obtained the warmest praise from the soberest and best informed judges  when we reflect on the genius and fire of the wonderful ariosto whose orlando furioso alone has raised to him a monument of fame on which every admirer of luxuriant fancy and extraordinary strength of mind have in their warm and spontaneous admiration added an ornamental laurel in short when we consider that these and various other eminent authors whose abilities were indisputably competent to carry the dramatic art into complete perfection even at that period were not only the admiration of europe but candidates for dramatic fame it should appear even absurd to put the english stage in competition with the italian  nothing however can be truer than that upon a comparison the italian drama sunk to annihilation by the side of the english for whether these great authors wrote for the stage merely to gratify an eccentric propensity though it is extremely difficult to conceive how a writer of great genius can feel indifferently while employed so eligibly or whether they wrote extravagantly ridiculously and absurdly to gratify an extravagant a ridiculous and an absurd taste it is unequivocally certain that the italian theater consisted of nothing but the grossest buffoonery and sunk into gradual contempt while the english theater began at that time to grow refined and very soon gave visible signs of its attaining that perfection of which it was capable and to which it was regularly hastening  one great reason for the decline of the italian theater was its shocking impiety for it never admitted of merely profane subjects except in operas which certainly are the only species of dramatic amusement in that country worthy attention and even these were by no means perfect in their nature till early in the present century when they found a kind of shakespeare in metastasio  as to spain the theater never even to this moment boasted any thing like regularity spite of the astonishingly fertile genius manifested in the multitudinous productions of the most celebrated authors of that country in spain as in italy this may be accounted for by instancing the horrid impiety introduced into their autos sacramentales in one of these strange pieces the audience are treated with the prospect of a church on fire a knight is presently discovered who full of devotion rushes into the flames and at length having rescued the host from the conflagration which ought by the bye to be invulnerable returns with it safe and sound in his hand upon which the rest of the actors accompany him in a ndango  which in its place i have already given some account of  small pieces however called entremesses or jornados evidently the sirventes and tensons of provence and the ancient interludes of england were performed by a few actors and appear to have been more like regular farces than those exhibited in any other country at so early a period these nevertheless were soon on the decline and when they were attempted again at the time of calderon they were the most wretched trash that can be imagined  these trifles however served for the ground work of a better sort of performances for much about the time of heywood they grew into something more considerable till lopez de rueda and navara shortly after the birth of shakespeare began to shape them into acts and give them a precise length but these though they were followed by cervantes whose don quixotte has immortalized him and lopez de vega with his fifteen hundred plays both of whom were cotemporary with shakespeare never were able even if we add to theirs the labors of calderon solis salazar molina and many others to bring the spanish stage to any thing better than the resemblance of a crowded garden overrun with weeds and interspersed here and there with flowers of rare and peculiar beauty  the german theater not as i have mixed it before with the dutch but properly that theater established in the principal cities of the empire boasts a very early origin a truth which may serve to strengthen those conjectures which have been ventured concerning the antiquity of the english stage  ancient germany had its bards doubtless the druids who composed and sung in honor of their heroes and these are to be traced from a very early period till charlemagne they then began to exercise their profession more decidedly and were called masterlanger or mastersingers these were protected by various monarchs and in particular received great encouragement from otho the great and maximilian the first  in consequence of this distinguished countenance they grew more and more celebrated and presently mentz strasbourg nurembourg augsbourg and other cities boasted their different societies of mastersingers who attended at tournaments public meetings and other solemn ceremonies not long ago the society of strasbourg was in existence and enjoyed certain revenues established many ages in favor of that company which was composed of tradesmen such as tailors shoemakers millers etc  thus in these societies of mastersingers we have not only in the clearest manner the troubadours and trouverres of provence but in the society of strasbourg we have the establishment of the minstrels of chester we find nothing however very celebrated in their productions nor till about the middle of the sixteenth century worth notice at that time one haanssahcs who had by no means a despicable genius wrote some dramatic pieces in which he performed himself but they are like the pieces of other countries taken from sacred history and therefore cannot rank as representations of common manners  the german theater however was not also without pieces on profane subjects and the authors of these joined at length by haanssachs like the children of sans souci in france and the interluders in england began to prepare the theater for the reception of regular tragedies and comedies  this event however did not take place so soon as in england or in france for the german regular theater owes its origin to the dutch and the reader will remember that they had no theater themselves till      in the year      a company of dutch players went to hambourg and from that moment the german theater altered its manner the mastersingers were soon routed a regular company of german actors turned them into contempt and ridicule from this company sprung several others and having the example of england and by this time france before them their poets wrote regular tragedies and comedies in tolerably correct verse  the german tragedies and comedies however even to this hour are clogged with the heaviness and gloom of the dutch of which they were originally imitations horrible noises bloody swords specties flaming torches magic hands tombs dungeons racks and every other subject to excite terror pervade their tragedies one would think to divert the auditor from either sleeping or venting his indignation at their intolerable dullness  thus the only nation that held out the shadow of a pretention to dramatic fame even up to the time when shakespeare produced his first play was france there indeed appeared a dawn of something like regularity but it was cold tame and obscure being a greek and roman mixture improved by ingredients taken from the english who had been at the source before them  lazare baif and jodelle were the only authors of any consideration who wrote before shakespeare garnier being his sole rival during the first half of his career and hardy during the last for the great corneille did not bring out a single play till nine years after the death of our immortal poet by which time the united labors of shakespeare jonson beaumont and fletcher massinger randolph and the other authors of that time comprizing a mass of dramatic excellence such as no age nor country has ever produced passed in review before english spectators  what then shall we say of the french who in the same breath boast of having taught england the dramatic art and call corneille the father of the stage and successor of aeschylus who in point of years might have been shakespeares grandson  chap ii shakespeare great and extraordinary objects naturally attract universal attention unfortunately however human nature is composed of such various and complicate materials that it is extremely difficult in any case to lift this attention into admiration the sun that cheers and invigorates us is a perpetual object of reproach we feign to sink under those very rays that dispel the mists of contagion that sweeten the provender for our cattle that ripen the fruits which pamper our luxury and that whiten the corn which composes our daily bread we overlook the beauty the majesty the splendour which savages more faithful to nature and more ignorant of refinement make their subject of adoration which to enjoy cost us nothing but the trouble of opening our eyes and the admission of a little heartfelt gratitude all these incomparable advantages though essentially material to our very existence we take to ourselves as carelessly and indifferently as any other common benefit of nature without a remark without thanks without emotion while we rack invention to devise a thousand expensive operations to discover spots which in the scale of the universe are perfectly immaterial and which but for this restless and insatiable curiosity would for ever have been hidden from our observation  shakespeare whose writings are the offspring of an intuition that mocks description that shames the schools and that ascertains sublimity whose knowledge of human nature was profound penetrating and infallible whose morality and philosophy confirm all that was good and wise in the ancients whose words are in our mouths and their irresistible influence in our hearts whose eulogium may be felt but cannot be expressed and whose own pen alone was equal to the composition of his epitaph this shakespeare in the mouths of his fellow creatures is more known for a few inconsiderable blemishes sprung from redundant fancy and indispensible conformity than for innumerable beauties delightful as truth and commanding as inspiration  look at the various authors who by way of compliment to their own sagacity have deigned so far to honor biography and literature as to point out all the blemishes both as a man and as a writer of him whose virtue and whose merit were either above their comprehension or else their tingling envy would not allow them to praise do we hear from them a word of his polished manners that made up the delight of the court of elizabeth that laughed euphuism from the circle and that endeared him to the friends of lord southampton and various other patrons not a syllable they just allow that he was a good kind of man well intentioned but they never fail by way of a drawback to tell you that he was a bungler at wool combing that he was a notorious deer stealer and that he turned out a very bad actor  have we any author who has had the fair disinterestedness the noble candor to indulge himself and gratify the world by any exclusive work that has instanced the various ways in which shakespeare so greatly commanded all the passions of the soul in which with a portraiture full of imagination and faithful as nature he drew ambition jealousy tenderness piety villainy rashness credulity licentiousness and a hundred others with all their shades and gradations not one we have however a little myriad of critics and hypercritics who have done his memory the credit to render his works profitable to themselves by making holes as fast as tinkers in his reputation which they fancy and endeavor to persuade the world they have adroitly mended by patching them up with dross of their own well did he say that mens perfections are written in sand their faults in marble  in my province i do not consider if i were ever so inclined that i have a right to examine the private character of any man farther than as it may have influenced his public conduct nor even then unless it should relate to his connection with the drama if by deduction i can show that the world has been imposed on by a false character given in favor of any mans works through patronage procured by adulation meanness and the sawning arts of a sycophant it is very fair to place the public and private sentiments of that man by the side of each other and to appeal to the world be this or any other the description of his mental blemishes whether by that criterion they have purchased gold or been imposed on by tinsel  if on the contrary i can produce any instances where meekness and modesty have been borne down by rancour and envy it will be my duty to dwell upon the virtues of him who may have had the public misfortune and the private happiness to possess those qualities nor can i lay a claim to impartiality the forwardest requisite of a historian if i neglect in such cases to deduce from the heart of the man the merit of the poet  shakespeares genius was so brilliant his knowledge so wide and universal his conception so true and his sentiments so godlike that to meditate his character is to suppose perfection yes say the cavillers but his writings are full of faults and how as a private man will he be able to stand or fall upon a comparison with them thus quaintness in complaisance to the time at which he wrote temporary satire then perhaps excellent now obsolete and other venial inaccuracies for it is extremely difficult to call them errors which we ought not to condemn or if we ought do we easily know how are quoted to deface his monument of marble and tortured into as many shapes as envy has snakes to ornament a sandy beap mistaken by the ignorant for the monument of his commentators  but as i mean to allot a chapter to an examination of those gentlemen who would have sound it more to their honor to have excelled shakespeare by the beauty of their own writings than to have exposed their ignorance in cavilling at his who have set about to filtrate air to elucidate light and every one of them by a different and constantly an impracticable process who are like gardeners that cut shrubbery into the forms of birds pyramids vases and other unnatural objects and call all those fools who love to see nature in her real form i shall at present content myself with taking first a general and afterward a particular view of the writings of shakespeare not like a lounger in the boxes who criticizes upon fashions nor an aristarchus in the pit who stretches one fault to hide a thousand perfections but a spectator in the two shilling gallery who goes to the play to be pleased i know that in this assertion i have a right to anticipate a great deal of ridicule it is a compliment however of which i am rather covetous i have heard it frequently argued that education goes for something and i shall have shakespeares own remark turned against me that the applause of one of the judicious outweighs a whole theater of others certainly i am a great advocate for the advantages of education though real genius requires but little and in perverse minds naturally sterile education generally precludes candor but education is less necessary in theatrical criticism than in any other partidges thinking bransby the best actor and giving no merit to garrick because he was frightened at the ghost exactly as he should have been had a ghost appeared to him is an indelible test of this the observation was written by a consummate judge of nature and who therefore admired shakespeare and garrick education may ascertain the purity of diction may pry into construction may find out any violation of the unities and judge of a poets blank verse by the number of his dactyls and his spondees it has however very little of the heart and will be more likely to suppress than to stimulate tears and smiles a play is or ought to be a representation of nature of which every spectator is as far as his understanding permits a judge judgment then not education is the critical quality which is less likely to be perverted without than with education and the deduction fairly is that he who sits in a theater determined to let whatever passes before him have its full effect on his passions without reserve or abatement is a fairer and therefore a better theatrical critic than he who weighs every thing in the balance of consideration and while he pauses on the discovery of a few blemishes loses sight of a number of beauties the spectator in the two shilling gallery then seems best to answer this description and it will be difficult to find an argument to prove that in this acceptance shakespeare did not use the word judicious   the writings of shakespeare take in so large and so wonderful an extent of compass that while we acknowledge that he wrote better we are obliged to add that he wrote more than any other dramatic writer one voluminous author writes tragedies for which he is deservedly celebrated that after all contain only the representations of a few passions placed in different points of view another equally voluminous writes comedies with the same just right to celebration in which a few follies and absurdities are properly ridiculed shakespeare goes infinitely beyond all this he takes the whole round of the passions bends them into every form in which they ought deservedly to be exhibited exposes them to contempt holds them up to ridicule commands for them admiration conciliates pity excites terror and in short displays in his faithful portraiture of them every effect that can unlock the anxious mind or gratify the susceptible fancy and when satisfied with exploring and laying open to view the motley group of affections that characterize nature in the beings of this world he stretches his comprehensive imagination and invents a new world inhabited with beings the offspring of his own fancy who in their allegorical character give a refinement to virtue an aversion to vice and a ridicule to folly which no actual representation of them could have had the force or the beauty to convey  thus shakespeare by having left nothing unrepresented either as a positive and naked exhibition of nature or a deduced and figurative description of her has gone unequivocally beyond all other writers and were there nothing else to sanction his astonishing merit and extend his wide fame he would yet indisputably stand above all dramatic authors ancient and modern  but when we consider that there had been no school in which he might study this art that no dramatic writer since aeschylus whose soul seems as if it had transmigrated till it was born anew in shakespeare had been equal to the meritoroius task of restoring the glare of melpomenes dagger and perfecting the polish on the mirror of thalia when we consider that the theater in ten years in the hands of shakespeare attained all that perfection which it had lost for more than two thousand and boasted additional perfection never known to it before in the course of the world it is impossible to contemplate the character of this great man with a degree of wonder equal to its value which i consider as the highest climax of panegyric and yet these considerations are never afforded and all we can learn from writers whose geniuses would be complimented by the possession of a capacity to comprehend the genius of shakespeare gives us no more than permission to assert that he was an extraordinary man when it was admitted that he had received but an indifferent education and that though there were passages in his works of great and wonderful beauty there were nevertheless numerous faults which never ought to be permitted  as to the faults i shall speak of them more particularly hereafter when i think it will not be very difficult to prove that they are not so numerous not of such magnitude as the world is taught to believe by the critics i do not care much what they themselves believe on the subject though i hope for the sake of common sense and their own reputation they do not believe half they assert as to the beauties they are too indelibly impressed on the heart of every one who has heard or read them to need explanation  but a few words as to the education of shakespeare for though i am not writing his life i have a great pride in being the historian of his mind he received the common advantages of learning in what is called a grammar school that is to say a place where a boy of any tolerable genius may learn all that the master is capable of teaching him in six months and where boys in general study for years and at last know nothing  whether shakespeare learned little or much at this school makes nothing either for or against my argument i can very willingly suppose that the scholar was very soon able to teach the master it was not in this grammar school where he received that education which has wrought his celebrity it was in the school of nature who condescended to be his instructress the lady fell in love with him was captivated he was her adonis her endymion and both her beauty and her chastity yielded to the irresistible impulse while he with all the gallantry yet the delicacy of an honorable lover and a faithful knight consecrated his life to the service of his mistress pleaded her cause redressed her wrongs and with the truest constancy and most ardent gratitude made her beauty the perpetual theme of his panegyric  if aeschylus when god knows grammar schools had nothing to do with learning but when men were called wise because they used first so many words as served simply to express such ideas as nature taught them and good because their minds adopted no ideas but what tended to promote general morality if aeschylus studying in the school of nature represented the great actions and glorious achievements of his countrymen and felt emulously and meritoriously that by that means he should render greece and human nature a benefit why should we deny the same merit to shakespeare more than two thousand years afterward when grammar schools actually flourished but it would wrong my cause to waste too much anxiety about it and nothing but a necessity for strong and incontrovertible argument to cope with the opinions of men certainly great and reputable except in their charitable warning to the world of faults in another which are not yet however generally discovered and after all not of the magnitude of their own would have induced me to dwell so minutely on a theme that with men of fair and candid discrimination recommends itself and speaks its own eulogium  the general merit of shakespeare manifests itself in a thousand various ways take any one of the passions which he has molded at will to serve the general purpose of instruction and amusement and see to what an astonishing pitch he has affected the human heart by a critical and interesting display of it  is the passion love see how he has followed it through all its vicissitudes the delicate tenderness the fond impatience the impetuous ardour the noble constancy of romeo and juliet perhaps has not a parallel in language to youthful love every thing is possible and the exquisite nonsense that shakespeare has put into the mouth of the doting enamoured yet delicate juliet is full of poetic beauty so boundlessly so extravagant and yet so truly natural that we are equally captivated with her love and her innocence  the love of romeo is no less admirably drawn it is impetuous thoughtless and rash yet manly noble and generous but its characteristic is nature he leaps the orchard wall and braves the resentment of juliets relations out of love yet presently out of this very love he becomes a coward and puts up with an insult from of those relations nor is he roused out of this apathy till called upon to revenge the death of his friend  in the garden scene surely nothing can be so beautiful as the enchanted yet respectful manner in which he listens to the unaffected tenderness the timid honesty the techy impatience of juliet his love profound and awful recedes from his tongue to his heart here is inconsiderate and volatile flies from her heart to her tongue till at length impelled to reply to her fond confession which disdains all hypocrisy and derides all subterfuge they join in interchanging vows tender and affectionate on her part manly and honorable on his  absence only renders more amiable the noble and exalted minds of those lovers his despair at hearing the sentence of banishment his horror at the news of juliets death and his solemn determination to follow her and her resigned compliance with the friars stratagem her awful manner of executing it and her destroying herself after every hope has failed her are masterly pictures of exquisite love mercier was so charmed with romeo and juliet and so distressed that the lovers should become victims to the unjust and unreasonable enmity of their families that he has given the plot a new turn the play never was performed but it has all the delicacy finesse and truth of that admirable author benvolio having long foreseen the consequence of this family hatred does his utmost to excite the love of romeo and juliet in order to bring about a reconciliation he finds both the families averse to his project and therefore connives at a private marriage every thing happens as in shakespeares play benvolio however in the place of the friar having from his infancy studied chemistry administers a potion to juliet and contriving that romeo should be informed of the death furnishes him with another romeo opens the tomb and finding juliet apparently dead drinks the potion and falls down at her side in the mean benvolio having alarmed the two fathers they presently behold their two children in this state after reading to them a severe lecture and reproaching them for their conduct and the dreadful consequences of their mutual enmity he honestly confesses that he has wrought all this tel them that this seeming death of these lovers is but a sleep that he alone however knows the charm to revive them and that if they will discard their unjust anger and vow perpetual amity their children shall wake and revive the double pleasure of being restored to life and to the arms of their parents but that if they hesitate it will be too late in that case he knows he shall be considered as their murderer but that he would rather die than witness a rancour so dishonorable to themselves and such a scandal to human nature the result is obvious the lovers revive and their affection is crowned with the approbation and blessing of their fathers i shall only add that the frenchman merely alters the story he does not attempt to improve upon shakespeare whose genius he reverences and to whose productions he had upon all occasions most willingly paid a warm tribute of admiration   were i to go on investigating the various ways in which shakespeare has treated this one passion i should greatly exceed the limits i am obliged to prescribe for myself i shall therefore for the present pass by the noble and persevering constancy of imogen the patient and endearing tenderness of desdemona the generous and enterprizing affection of rosalind the silent and devouring passion of viola and all those great and unexampled proofs of consummate strength of mind and profound judgment of the human heart in which shakespeare though he may have been in one instance now and then equalled by a particular author taking his writings on the passion of love in their full and comprehensive sense he has clearly excelled every author  but let us instance this passion further together with jealousy and the other branches of it as well as all those different affections of the mind which he bared to the sight and penetrated with a critical nicety that always appealed directly to the heart by an examination of his different works in which that i may get into no controversy about a matter perfectly immaterial to the reputation of shakespeare or the information of the world i shall suppose his plays to have been written in that chronological order which is generally admitted to be correct though i cannot help confessing that i have seen no authority by which i am convinced that it is so  chap iii shakespeares plays titus andronicus is said by the regulation before alluded to to have been shakespeares first play and printed in      but performed in      to show how easy it is to cavil i shall instance a circumstance here which though of so little moment that to mention it as a thing of consequence would be almost as absurd as to get involved in the cobweb enquiries of his commentators will show that it is impossible that shakespeares first play could have been produced in      for in that very year in the mayoralty of heart a thing extremely easy to ascertain players of all descriptions were absolutely put down upon the application of that magistrate to the lord treasurer we see however that immediately after that year playhouses were created as by magic and as there can be no doubt but all this arose from the extraordinary and unexpected excellence of the writings of shakespeare it is more proper though it is a pityful contention to fix the appearance of his first play one year if not two years later in which case what becomes of that authority which though i cannot bow to i shall adopt merely because a year sooner or later in the production of a thing will not alter the sterling merit of the thing itself  all this may be possible but the general accounts of it say that it was performed in      by the servants of lord pembroke lord derby and lord essex much has been said to prove that this play was not written by our great poet the arguments however to prove this are rather nugatory ravenscroft who altered it and called it a tragedy of his own might very naturally have had personal reasons for inducing the world to think that it was not shakespeares but his argument that it was brought to the theater and touched up by shakespeare is too ridiculous for he was at that time only an actor and could not have taken the manager upon him to this degree  if those who reject this play as shakespeares think it inferior to the rest of his productions the doubt is easily cleared by recollecting that it was his first effort there are certainly some things in it equal to his happiest sallies and as we know those are superior to the writings of any man who ever lived the question to be asked is and this will perpetually occur if shakespeare did not write titus andronicus who did  theobald who after all is the most pardonable of all shakespeares commentators has taken this play into his edition as genuine and notwithstanding this opinion of his has been lustily combated by later conjecture that backed by the strong writings the discrimination of character and those peculiar marks of genius which were worn so indelibly by shakespeare and which appear not always but very frequently in this play i shall not hesitate to believe and therefore assert that it is written by that great man with whom nature a proud distinction complimented this country  loves labor lost performed at least we will so conclude in      has as well as titus andronicus been rejected as a genuine play of shakespeare the cabal against it however has not run so high and therefore all his editors poor shakespeare oh that admiration and pity should belong to the same man have concurred right or wrong to admit it into their collections  as titus andronicus was shakespeares first tragedy so loves labor lost was his first comedy and thus the whole mystery appears to be solved these plays are full of irregularities owing clearly to the inexperience of the author the prejudices he had to combat and the taste he had to create when hercules cleared the augean stable it was very unlikely that he came out clean himself why will not men be candid why not say at once that it is not in nature to attain perfection in a moment if at all if they would lament instead of condemn and extol instead of commend it would be the true criticism due to shakespeare  loves labor lost abounds with beauties the character of biron considered as so early an effort is inimitable the admirable brilliancy which pervades the dialogue has no fault but playful redundancy and though it has been objected to by dr johnson as obscene and vulgar and improper to have been performed before a maiden queen who by the way had been accustomed to listen to much worse obscenity and vulgarity for the obscenity of shakespeare is purity compared to those who wrote before him yet this great admirer of truth and sentiment is compelled to allow that there is no play that has more evident marks of the hand of shakespeare  in the same year shakespeare is said to have produced the first part of henry the sixth and in the following year the second and third parts of the same play and as there is a continuation of the story of that unhappy prince i shall consider them under one head  shakespeare had hitherto indulged his propensity for dramatic writing by treating subjects with which his principles as a patriot were not concerned he had only consulted his feelings as a poet if from design the election was judicious if from impulse nature was working in him that maturity necessary to atchieve the great designs she was meditating for him for now the time arrived when he was destined to prove himself the english aeschylus when the fancied prowess of foreign or imaginary heroes was to yield to the actual exploits of his own countrymen to be handed down by him as a faithful record of all the virtues and vices of the english nation for the imitation or abhorrence of posterity  no pen but that of shakespeare was competent to undertake this masterly task to become the dramatic historian of his own country became peculiarly his province and there are more traits of real history at this moment remembered by the enlish through the medium of his plays than all that library of contradiction and absurdity which as an ingenius author says some have been facetiously pleased to call the history of england  these three plays contain most wonderful proofs of shakespeares great and extraordinary genius the characters are drawn with correct truth and prodigious force the timid henry led about by his turbulent queen the bold warwick the subtle gloucester whose different ambitions and the means of attaining their end exhibit a most commanding and masterly judgment in the manner of throwing over that passion the different shadows necessary to relieve it are so many confirmations of his grasping at all minds and at all motives  the philosophy and resignation of henry is uncommonly admirable the distinction between goodness and greatness one the perfection of nature and an emulation of the deity the other a mixture of artificial wants interwoven into our dedesires and actions by restless and ambitious struggles for superiority are exhibited masterly and happily in the contrast between henry and margaret both of whom are in nature and yet both out of their sphere if shakespeare had written nothing but that wonderful soliloquy uttered by the timid henry while he sits upon the hill contemplating the dreadful effects of that battle he has not the courage to witness posterity would have pointed out the page as a master piece of beauty and sublimity  but to dwell upon the separate merits of these plays would be to write a treatise instead of a history it would require an examination into all those nice points of discrimination in which nature taught shakespeare to develope the motives of the human heart i shall content myself therefore with noticing that shakespeare having thus far shown in what way the affections of the mind may be meritoriously wrought on to stimulate men to good and great actions and instanced these truths by portraying manners at home the stage began to grow important the characters in common life as well as those of kings and heroes became familiar by passing in review and the conduct of mankind imbibed new dignity from an attention to the lessons of shakespeare  pericles was as we are told performed in      it would be as difficult to pronounce that this play was wholly written by shakespeare as that it was not that he had not a hand in it or as heywood calls it at least a main finger will hardly be asserted for it has those marks of peculiar felicity which i cannot think any mind enjoyed in the same degree as that of shakespeare but as it is more natural that he should assist the labors of another than condescend to permit another to assist him and as at the time of pericles there is not the same excuse of inexperience as at the time of titus andronicus it is certainly seasible to join with the major part of those who have been so solicitous to establish a fact not however very material and allow that the opinion that pericles is not entirely the production of shakespeare has certainly probability on its side there is one way of reconciling the mind to a belief of shakespeares having produced this play without the assistance of any author then living the story is very ancient and had been treated frequently before and it is possible especially as it must have been very hastily written shakespeare having in the same year brought forward his second and third parts of henry the sixth that he merely dramatized the story from one or more of its historians and by throwing in his own excellent ingredients gave it in some measure that peculiar relish so delicious to the taste of those who love to banquet the mind with the wholesome and nutrious food furnished by nature and prepared by reason   loerine produced in      has still fewer pretentions to be considered as a genuine play of shakespeare than pericles indeed it has scarcely any vestiges by which it appears to have the advantages of his assistance some however there certainly are for in the edition of it published in      the title announces that it was overseen and corrected by william shakespeare and this very unaffectedly establishes a proof that it must have been the production of some author of that time who was glad enough to benefit himself by such able assistance  the two gentlemen of verona made its appearance in the same year this piece displays a prodigious variety of those beauties which belonged only to shakespeare the plot which is taken from a novel as far as it relates to the management of the scenery is certainly very intricate and almost inexplicable but considered merely as a story it has great simplicity and nature the characters are drawn with strength and truth and it is remarkable that in this play we have the first idea of what has been since called genteel comedy the elegance yet the contrast in valentine and protheus is a very striking picture not only of the etiquette but the perfidy of polite life for protheus is more corrupted by education than nature of which his remorse and his contrition are proofs while valentine has a mind so correctly inclined to rectitude that fashion and folly cannot corrupt it  but this is not all the two servants lance and speed who are the foils of their masters make the whole a complete resemblance of that sort of play which is the foundation of almost all the comedies of both the spaniards and the french and as these plays did not obtain with them at least in this perfect form till calderon who was cotemporary with corneille shakespeare may be said to have been the founder of this species of comedy we must admit at the same time that the germ was in the spaniards but his mind was the only soil which could expand and bring it to perfection  the chronological order which i pursue right or wrong in this accout of shakespeares productions even if it should he deficient in veracity has certainly the appearance of good sense in its favor for it seems to lay before the reader that sort of rotation in which a well wisher to his reputation would desire that he had written them the redundant luxuriance in which in the wilds of shakespeares abundant and productive imagination one cannot sometimes see the wood for trees begins as he goes on to be more and more got under the underwood is better cleared out and the plants intended to swell and enlarge have more room and better air to accelerate their approach to maturity  the two gentlemen of verona abounds with poetical beauties such as we have not before been able to discover even in shakespeare his towering fancy in this particular piece playfully ascends to those sublime heights dangerous to others but always familiar to him sometimes hazardous but never alarming often trackless yet always astonishing  the winters tale was performed in      when the grand objection in this play is got over which is the very long period of time it embraces and the different countries it traverses we turn our thoughts to the numerous and inimitable beauties in contains which whether considered on the side of character or language are in the best style of shakespeare this play has been very judiciously separated into two dramatic pieces and viewed in this advantageous light it has very few faults of any description the subject of that which garrick brought forward as a tragedy in three acts under its original title and in which to do him justice he sacredly steered clear of mutilation as he did also in his alteration of romeo and juliet is great natural and affecting  jealousy of which turbulent passion shakespeare has so often evinced a most critical judgment for he has always given it a different motive and a different discrimination is most pathetically depicted in the character of leontes and gives a lively and noble opportunity of bringing forward contrast the life of the drama by the honorable and conscious rectitude in the justification of hermione the loves of florizel and perdita which form the other piece are so simple so pastoral so tender and so delicate that their force and their language are the description of an amiable and meritorious passion belonging to all ranks and equally a blessing to the peasant and the prince in short love and its vicissitudes mark the various merits of this admirable piece which shakespeare here as every where else has explored at will and turned to advantage at pleasure  a midsummers nights dream came out in      shakespeare having ranged so far through the fields of nature began now to feel an inclination to explore the regions of fancy which he did to so good a purpose that all the critics even the most sarcastic have agreed that in this wild and beautiful play if the fairies do not speak the language of common nature no one can pronounce that they do not speak their own  every writer equal to the task compliments his country by displaying all the poetic fare of which his genius is capable here has shakespeare in one instance paid his country this compliment common tradition had fanciliarized the idea of fairies and many a ballad and poem had made them the lares of the english his fertile and creative fancy therefore could not to show its extent and variety have been better employed spenser had trod the ground before him with prodigious felicity and sterling excellence but shakespeare born to soar above all others represented what his great predecessor only narrated  we come now to consider shakespeare every moment in a superior light for great and admirable as his talents have hitherto appeared they are yet growing considerably into much more strength and improvement  romeo and juliet his next play which was produced also in      is a wonderful performance and how we can possibly understand that so soon after his mind had been entangled in the labyrinths of enchantment and his fancy frolicking over the imaginary beauties of fairy land he could calmly set down exquisitely to describe literal nature will be difficult if not impossible  this play which is founded on real history is so constantly in the mouths of its various spectators and readers that to describe particularly the tenderness of the lovers the rooted animosity of their parents the different effects of resentment in their relations in short the piety of the friar the loquacity of the nurse the wit of mercutio or those other points that constitute its beauty and make up its collective merit is certainly unnecessary but as every opportunity of paying a tribute of respect to the admirable genius of its incomparable author is with me irresistible i shall speak of some things which have not probably yet been noticed  romeo and juliet is best known by that copy of it which is generally performed and in which garrick has very judiciously done little more than make shakespeare alter his own play fitting the catastrophe to the original invention of the novelist the two grand points that garrick by the advice of his friends has insisted on are the expunging the idea of rosalind and romeos sudden inconstancy on the first impression of juliets superior beauty and heightening the catastrophe by romeos first swallowing the poison then in the extacy of finding juliet survive forgetting the desperate act he had committed and flattering himself with a delusive hope of future happiness and again the astonishment and delight of juliet at recovering her lover all which is instantly damped by a discovery that her sallacious hopes are to be but momentary  it must be confessed these alterations are more admissible by common auditors than the incidents as they originally stood not that they were forced or unnatural before for violent love breeds with it inconstancy because it is always inconsiderate or as juliet sweetly expresses it too rash too unadvised too like the lightening which does cease to be ere one can say it lightens    but this does not seem to be all that shakespeare intended in romeos amorous apostasy he has appeared to insist upon this incident to give an awful grandeur to his plot the great drift of which is and this has been but little considered the solemn warning to montague and capulet by the dreadful sacrifice of their children and in them to all other parents of the horrid effects of domestic enmity  to bring about this great and important end is romeo made inconstant is juliet who had been taught all her life to hate the montagues made as suddenly to fall in love with her mortal enemy or as she describes it her only love sprung from her only hate these circumstances discover a depth a solidity of which shakespeare is oftener capable than suspected this love so born he contrives with the pen of a poet and the hand of a master in various ways and by various degrees to warm and encourage till he makes even the friar consent to the union of the lovers which it was positively his duty not to do from a reflection that providence from this fortunate event might so open the eyes of the parents to the folly and injustice of their mutual and longexisting animosity to turn their houses rancour to pure love  this very catastrophe has even been attempted but never with success for it could not be so impressive nor so tragic i have shown in the plot of mercier of how much it is capable but shakespeare did not look so supersicially meritorious punishment has been clearly with him his decided drift even the lovers tender delicate and honorable as they are merit punishment for their conduct is thoughtlessly a deviation from the very principles they profess it is born of imprudence and nursed by deceit and in this point of view it is better that romeo should have been inconstant and juliet at least capricious  nay the imprudence of the friar with all his wisdom and sagacity is most admirably thrown in having in one instance from the best motives in the world done a positive wrong he is obliged to persist still comforting himself with the purity of his intentions he becomes the honorable pander of the lovers he leagues with a chattering and perfidious servant whose honesty he fears and whose servility he ought to distrust instead of wisely attempting to apply a solid remedy instead of manfully stepping forward and avowing the marriage of romeo and juliet at the moment she is menaced with the hand of paris and attempting through the mediation of the prince to bring about a reconciliation between the two families he timid irresolute and one would almost think vain of his judgment in the conduct of intrigue advises a desperate and unwise means not to bring about any wished for end but to procastinate and put off the evil day at the hazard of accumulated mischief  the sum of his danger is by this time so ascertained that he has cut off his own retreat he therefore makes another confident in friar john employs him to carry a letter which miscarrying he seizes his iron crow and romantically undertakes himself to release juliet from the vault of her ancestors all this folly is he guilty of and yet you pity and almost admire him from beginning to end but remember it is impossible to commend him and this is the nice distinction shakespeare has so well drawn pointing out that in the best and the wisest a single deviation from the path of rectitude must lead to remorse and may perhaps to punishment  as to the character of mercutio concerning which so much has been said and written shakespeare has certainly introduced it to give fresh force to the coloring his main design he represents this young officer as an elegant man a complete gentleman and an accomplished wit and that the characters in the play and the spectators at it may look with additional horror at the family disputes of the montagues and the capulets he is lost to one at a time of life when his brilliant talents and engaging manners are at their height and therefore ardently cherished by his friends and to the other at the moment he has become their delight and admiration  in the face of dryden whose great talents i shall have hereafter plenty of opportunity to show how sincerely i reverence i look upon this to have been shakespeares sole motive for killing mercutio so early in the play it had been said by the critics that shakespeare had so surpassed his own expectation in the character of mercutio that he killed him in the third act lest had be continued him he should have been killed by him and this dryden has affected to smile at under an idea that he was no such formidable person for that he might have lived through the play and died in his bed without any danger to a poet  this tradition and this declaration are equally wrong the trait of mercutios death in the manner we witness it is for the reasons i have given above a most affecting circumstance and that shakespeare could not have carried on this character to the end of ten plays with the same force and spirit is ridiculous to assert on the other hand that dryden who was all candor and full of judgment should think so indifferently of the wit of mercutio is not very easily understood even with dr johnsons mode of accounting for it who says that in this remark dryden was not in quest of truth and that the sallies of mercutio were beyond his reach for no man searched more after truth than dryden and he has given sufficient proof in his own admirable writings that the higher the sallies of any wit were elevated they would the more easily come in contact with his genius  but to put aside the curious question of whether or not shakespeare created a personage and then was so terrified at his formidable appearance that he watched an opportunity and gave him an unlucky blow under romeos arm for fear of worse consequences to himself that great judge of nature who violated propriety much seldomer than has been generally admitted had a motive for bringing about this premature death which does not seem to have been noticed  romeo having killed tibalt it would have been manifest injustice in the duke not to have taken the forfeit life of romeo had he not qualified his sentence of banishment with describing tibalts crime to have been worse than romeos shakespeare therefore makes mercutio the dukes relation who as his blood had issued from mercutios wounds whose life romeo endeavored to save sees the crime in a much more heinous light in tibalt than in romeo and therefore when montague pleads for his son saying that he but took the forfeit life of tibalt the discrimination of banishment is correctly consistent thus in perfect consonance to dramatic construction a subordinate character is disposed of to give better opportunity of keeping a principal character in the fore ground and this i believe is a rational way of accounting for this mighty circumstance which has created so much cavil than to suppose admirable as the character of mercutio is that shakespeare was at all afraid of continuing it to the end with increased warmth had propriety warranted this necessity  before we leave romeo and juliet we must not forget to notice the nurse a sort of character in which shakespeare took particular delight because he delighted in every thing that was natural he has made this talkative old woman full of self importance and therefore she is permitted to take liberties which no other description of servants would dare to do but having given her all the low and corrupted cunning of a thorough paced mercenary domestic from her own depravity of mind and liquorish vanity she endeavors to seduce that beauty and innocence which is the constant theme of her praise and having persuaded her into something more than imprudence in her marriage with romeo to avert the consequences she does not hesitate to devise an infamous method of compounding the business by her marriage nevertheless with paris  thus she is possessed of cunning which is counteracted by her ignorance thus she insinuates herself into the secrets of her young lady to gain over her an insolent ascendancy and thus a stranger to the gratitude due to her benefactors she abuses that indulgence and betrays that confidence of which they themselves ought to have known her unworthy  there cannot be a properer lesson to parents and children than this half perhaps nine tenths of the various instances of family misery happen through the improper confidence placed in servants and thus shakespeare has made this nurse who after all may be in great measure excused on the score of pampered indulgence which she ignorantly takes to herself as her right and implicit reliance which gives her a reprehensible importance an instrument to show by what natural degrees the smallest neglect of prudence in parents may produce the most fatal consequences to their children and how a diviation of prudence in children may prove a source of misery and regret to their parents  thus it is impossible to blame any thing in the conduct or construction of this play it is in vain to say that tragedy and comedy are unnaturally blended together for the reverse is the fact the story is purely domestic and familiar circumstances however productive in the end of distress and misery ought not to be treated otherwise than as shakespeare has treated them nay in this play particularly he has managed the comic part with a most happy judgment for as the play advances and the interest it is intended to create becomes more and more important the comic characters drop off and leave the mind at leisure without mixture or interruption to attend to the plot as it approaches to perhaps the most interesting catastrophe ever represented to an audience and here we have another proof of the great propriety of shakespeares killing mercutio in the third act  the comedy of errors was produced the year after romeo and juliet the objections that have been made to this play are that it outrages probability that the mistakes are repeated till they tire and that the catastrophe is foreseen in the first act  certainly probability is a good deal stretched of the idea that the twin masters and the twin servants should be so remarkably alike and this is all for it is clearly possible and if the audience were only presented with one of those gemini no man could have cavilled at it i am glad however that shakespeare gave us two though not strictly within the bounds of propriety for the abundant opportunity it has given him of indulging that true vein of comic humor he possessed in such an extraordinary degree overcomes liberally taken all objection  the mistakes are very frequently repeated and at length they as certainly tire but this is more owing to the impossibility of properly representing the play than the want of variety in its author could we get two antipoluses and two dromios exactly alike the audience would be equally deceived with the characters and the equivoque would be complete  as to the anticipation of the catastrophe my objection is not so strong to that as that the catastrophe itself is a kind of vehicle a kind of underpart to set off the detached scenes but i do not much in the present case mind this i know of eminent painters who are best known by their sketches let us therefore consider the comedy of errors though by the way there is a wonderful deal of fine pencelling in it as a sketch and let us not because every thing that comes from the hand of a great master cannot always be perfect criticize ourselves in our examination of this play out of the irresistible pleasure it constantly affords us both on the stage and in the closet  if the objections of the critics to the comedy of errors require so strong a defense what must be the critical fate of hamlet which with all its transcendant beauties its prodigious strength its fascinating charms its rivetting interest and its extraordinary variety has more faults than the critics have time to tell or breath to give utterance  hamlet was brought out in      and when we consider that this wonderful production worth the reputation of twenty celebrated authors and i should not be fearful of naming them was written together with the four last plays we have received in two years what words can the best ingenuity supply us with equal to the description of the astonishing talents of this incomparable writer  i know not if the objections to this play excite most ones pity or ones indignation i will admit at once all the faults but justice truth common sense forbid that this mist of faults should obscure in any liberal mind the splendor they are ignorantly said to hide i will admit the tardiness of hamlet i will admit that the ghost is not revenged because the instrument of the revenge falls in accomplishing the death of the adulterer and the murderer i will admit that the death of the unoffending ophelia is revolting and unnecessary that the amiable laertes practicing against the life of hamlet by the treachery is unbecoming and even ignoble  i will even admit with mr voltaire who abused this play and afterward stole it that the grave diggers ought not to jest in the parish churchyard of the palace as he is pleased to call it that a little curiosity in pollonius was not a crime of magnitude enough to deserve death and that the king certainly bids the cannon sound before the invention of gunpowder i will admit all these foils that the diamond may appear more brilliant but when i have done so will the sourest critic who has malignantly enjoyed this discovery lay his hand on his heart nay would voltaire himself with his hundred and twenty volumes were he alive and say that he would not rather be known by the tragedy of hamlet alone with all its faults than his own productions with all their perfections  i will not undertake to say in a general sense that this is a fair way of arguing have the faults or perfections of other men any thing to do with this particular object of discussion and if i admit they exist how can i who profess myself a warm admirer of shakespeare for as to an advocate he needs none get rid of an established fact i do not want to get rid of it i even blazoned it here to show its insignificance to show how much oftener it has been mentioned than it ought and how greatly it has been magnified when the other fact one would think more worthy their attention as candid and sound critics of the inumerable and exquisite beauties this faulty piece contains obtains their acknowledgment in so painful and labored a manner that every extorted confession gives them a heart burn and chokes their faint praise in its utterance  perhaps these gentlemen were charitable enough to notice the blemishes of shakespeare because an enumeration of his perfections was unnecessary it must be so for otherwise what a stain to their truth and what a drawback on their reputation it must have been that while men of competent talents the lawgivers of literature pass over such excellence it would be known felt and understood by every other man in the kingdom however illiterate let us then imitate their charity and suppose this to be the case and then a criterion will be established rather an irish one to be sure that that the best way of finding out a mans merit is to search for his defects  for my own part i am so content to take things as find them and have so much pleasure in repeating over and over again what i like that against all president i shall not scruple to revive in my mind by an examination of hamlet that delight i have so frequently and so warmly enjoyed all men agree on the value of a guinea the beauty of a fine day the odor of a rose nor does a repetition of the enjoyment resulting from their admiration abate for it rather increases the grateful satisfaction upon this principle i shall undertake a very welcome task nor shall i because my guinea may be a little short of weight my day obscured by a passing cloud or my rose armed with a few thorns deduct from the real value of either but fairly revel in all the pleasures their best qualities are capable of affording me  in the conduct of hamlet shakespeare seems more to have treated a subject than to have constructed a play nothing can be finer more moral more interesting than the general design and in the choice of it is evinced a great mind a strong discrimination and a correct classical judgment the ground work is that first of all moral obligations silial piety and the feelings belonging to that passion known to all hearts and understood by all ranks are roused by every situation in which the most fertile imagination and the most consummate art could have placed them  hamlet finding his father prematurely cut off by the hand of death a father dear to his family beloved by his subjects and an honor to humanity would in reason and religion have found a consolation and have reconciled himself to this loss dreadful and irreparable as it was as a natural casualty and the will of that being in whose hands are the lives of us all did not a secret admonition warn him that all was not right but this suspicion difficult to be cherished in a noble mind requires strong circumstances to confirm it his mothers wedding with his uncle that followed so hard upon the death of his father though it excites his horror does not exhibit sufficient proof of a crime which seems too abominable for belief and this credulity on the side of virtue is the most beautiful feature in the character of hamlet  under the influence of this conflict is hamlet most judiciously introduced as the only mourner in his uncles splendid court with this grief the mother is made unfeelingly to reproach him hypocritically representing it as the breach of a religious duty which had she been sincere would have been a fact hamlet though not persuaded is overruled and in this state he is left alone to examine his mind and out of charity if possible to find a motive for the strange and unnatural conduct of his mother  though no man ever threw action into such strong situations as shakespeare his soliloquys are unquestionably the finest part of his writings and the finest of his soliloquys are the deliberations of hamlet being left alone and feeling himself impelled to explore the business of his fathers cruel death and his mothers sudden and incestuous marriage his mind sinks under the impending trial and he wishes for annihilation rather than to undertake the awful task  oh that this too too solid flesh etc  he next goes into his mothers conduct for which he cannot find either motive or excuse he describes her fondness for his father recollects that she would hang on him as if desire increased by seeding that she followed him to the grave like niobe all tears and yet in a little month she married his uncle my fathers brother says he but no more like my father than i to hercules the result of this deliberation is that it cannot come to good and while he is involved in a consideration of all the dreadful consequences likely to be showered on the heads of this wicked pair the fittest mood for the poets purpose horatio and marcellus come to inform him that they have seen his fathers ghost  nothing can be better prepared nor conducted than this scene horatio who wants gradually to open his awful commission begins by telling hamlet in answer to his enquiries that he came to see his fathers burial the prince big with the consequences replies that he should rather have thought it was to see his mothers wedding this introduces a comment and at length an eulogium from horatio on hamlets father on which the pious son is roused into that famous reply he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again  this is the moment for horatio to divulge the awful secret nor can any thing be more interesting than the remainder of this scene the cautious enquiries of hamlet his eagerness his tenderness for his father making horatio repeat over and over again how he looked whether he was armed and other fond circumstances full of duty and respect are in the best style of dramatic management till at length having ascertained the fact and felt the whole force of its importance he exclaims  i will watch to night perchance twill walk again  and then  if it assume my noble fathers shape  i will speak to it though hell itself should gape  and bid me hold my peace    it now becomes a matter of business he dispatches his friends to wait for him his suspicions when alone grow stronger and stronger he meets the ghost he is urged to revenge the nature of his fathers death is explained and the powerful climax which this natural and gradual developement of so material a circumstance was meant to attain comes out in the expression  o my prophetic soul my uncle  and shows that from the moment of his fathers death his suspicions which owing to his own nobleness of heart he had unwillingly entertained were influenced by feelings which human nature could not control  as to the scene of the ghost i shall not at present enquire into the propriety of introducing a ghost at all nor examine the objections that have been made against it by the critics with mr voltaire at their head who nevertheless was not content with bringing forward the ghost of ninus in his semiramis but he made him stalk forth at noon day i shall only say that for the sake of literature to which this character is a shining ornament i am in common with many thousands very happy that shakespeare gave us this sample of his incomparable abilities  taking it for granted that the scene between hamlet and the ghost is as natural as any thing else i shall venture a word as to its drift and operation when the awful novelty of his fathers reappearance has a little subsided when fascinating terror has given way to manly resolution and the ghost finds hamlet apt the horrid story comes out and he is told that if he has nature in him not to bear it this he most solemnly vows and declares that for the purpose of entertaining and practicing revenge he shall wipe away from his brain all trivial fond records  this seems to be his motive which is said to be a shallow one for his conduct to ophelia it does not however deserve so much reprehension as it has received the business of hamlet is to be thought mad which disposition as he calls it he puts on that he may the better ask those sort of odd questions which by being satirically thrown in may obtain for him by their shrewdness and ambiguity such answers as may corroborate the intelligence he has received from the ghost and what can so substantially confirm the opinion of those around him that he is mad as outrageous behavior to her he most loves a thing generally understood as a critetion of infanity  in fact from the milkiness of his disposition and that strong sense of his moral duty that every where mark his character he pants for better proofs than those he has already received through the means of a supernatural agent and when he finds that chance has thrown in his way an opportunity through the medium of the players of searching the matter to the quick his mind is materially relieved from his fears lest he should have listened to a fiend who came to practice on his melancholy and tempt him on to damn himself and to clear up this doubt he is determined to have grounds more relative  in his progress to this point how astonishingly has the poet in hamlets different soliloquys in his scenes with polonius with rosencraus and guildenstern and with the players indulged himself in all that beauty and exquisite variety of which he alone was capable is there any thing in the ancients or the moderns equal to mary things in in these scenes is there any thing in plato equal to the soliloquy beginning with the words to be or not to be is there any thing in the style of virgil equal to the style of shakespeare or in the piety of aeneas to the piety of hamlet  solid sober convincing argument shrewd sensible and keen observation and noble elevated and sublime sentiments every where mark the commanding genius of this wonderful man the deepest and most philosophical truths are sent home to every comprehension by being dressed in the most perspicuous simplicity how astonishingly written is the speech beginning why what a piece of work is man what variety and accuteness is there in the examination of real and feigned grief in his observations of the actors commiseration for hecuba nay his advice to the actors as to the manner of performing their parts which every actor of good sense has ever since cherished as a treasure shows that his judgment and penetration embraced every thing there is nothing strained in his expression nothing that a child might not extemporaneously utter yet can any thing so intimately touch the heart or so impressively interest the mind  the play acted before the king the closet scene between hamlet and his mother said by some to be the best thing in shakespeare and a variety of passages give abundant proof of the truth of this assertion all which i could with pleasure dwell upon were i less circumscribed as it is i shall content myself with saying that though i allow the plot gets tame after the death of polonius that the mad scenes of ophelia beautiful as they are and her premature destruction might poetically speaking have been spared laertes having without them sufficient provocation to rouse his resentment though i wish in common with others that the catastrophe had been more happily conducted and agree that the grave diggers are extraneous yet the prodigious variety of characters and incidents the warmth and strength with which they are discriminated the truth the observation the force the wit in which piety ambition capriciousness fidelity vanity officiousness are set up as objects of imitation or contempt are so numerous in this piece and produced in such a rapid succession that it is difficult to lay the finger upon a fault without the danger of expunging a beauty  chap iv shakespeares plays continued king john one of those plays which have largely contributed to the general celebrity of shakespeare was produced in      there is a boldness and a strength in this tragedy which has served to hand down the character of the times both faithfully and meritoriously and shown how greatly the dramatic historian through the vehicle of representation has the advantage of him who merely narrates  john himself is portrayed in a most masterly and commanding manner and will ever remain a striking lesson to all monarchs how to steer between the extremes of weakness and wickedness the scene with hubert has often been considered as one of the finest ornaments of the english language indeed it is difficult to say what part of its conduct most demands our admiration the tampering with the half villain hubert the dread that the crime has been actually committed and at length laying the blame upon the instrument and even catching at the excuse of having seen the assasin in his look are powerful strokes  the gallant noble and careless faucombridge is a most happy portrait and speaks for itself as a true likeness of richard coeur de lion that mixture of courage and levity which is so faithfully the character of the soldier no one ever knew how to depict like shakespeare and notwithstanding the critics we have here a proof that he would have found no difficulty in continuing mercutio to the last act who is perfectly fauconbridge except the roughness and the blunt honesty this is a discrimination that we always find most critically attended to in shakespeare honor and honesty essentially mean the same thing the offense of both consists in shunnng meanness and every other contemptible quality but there is a peculiar frankness belonging to honesty with which honor may dispense and here is an erect dignity in honor which honesty is unconscious of in short honesty is plain and honor pshed this is the distinction so happily hit in the characters of mercutio and fauconbridge both are honest both are honorable but let the mind choose the appropriate epithet to distinguish them singly and we shall give honestly to fauconbridge and honor to mercutio   the other characters in this play are well sustained and shakespeare merits the thanks of posterity for bringing us intimately acquainted with that weak and wicked monarch from whose vice and folly as light issues out of darkness or a calm becomes more lovely from a contemplation of the storm that preceded it originated magna charta and the bill of rights  richard the second was performed in      this play is suspected to have been only revised by shakespeare certainly we cannot trace in it his usual force either as to the characters or the language the probability is that it was written in a hurry which by the way is no excuse and as the circumstances are wholly taken from the historians and chroniclers of that day many passages may have been literally transplanted from the history to the play this having been done the subject was found so unproductive that the author never thought it worth his while to finish it and then the utmost we can say is that shakespeare was to blame for letting a play come forward unworthy of his reputation  alterations of this play have been frequently attempted but always without success one of these was by theobald who dedicated his piece to the earl of orrery from whom he received a hundred pounds in a handsome snuff box thus moths live upon books if men can write why dont they produce books themselves  that shakespeare took very little pains with richard the second is the more probable from his having produced richard the third in the same year a bold and most extraordinary production perhaps there never was so prominent a character produced as this nor one thrown into such a variety of positions every one calculated to accomplish the end of truth and justice by warning the spectators against the dreadful effects of inordinate pride and lawless ambition  richard masters all hearts and controuls all minds working to his purpose the passions and foibles of mankind at his pleasure he administers to the pride of buckingham and not only by that means accomplish his ends but makes him an instrument in his own downfall he so avails himself of the vanity of lady ann that she consents to do the very thing she dreads and what she knows must prove her destruction what can be such a master piece as this scene on the very spot where she accompanies her husband toward his grave she consents to marry his murderer and yet is this extraordinary change wrought in so artful a manner that the most fastidious critic will not venture to pronounce it unnatural well may he exclaim  so mourned the dame of ephesus her love    in this manner off or on the scene is he throughout the play present to the imagination till at length having like the devil he serves left all those to that fate to which his craft has lured them he becomes the worst tool in his own miserable plot the feeling at the fall of the rest being pity that at his fall execration  throughout these and other instances with which this play is replete has shakespeare most artfully warned his spectators not only against villainly itself but also the risk and danger of conniving at it many of the instruments of richard deceived by his hypocrisy are tempted to swerve from rectitude in hopes to work his conversion here has our poet shown himself a master in his art the best motive in the world is no excuse for committing a positive wrong but the play is known and repeated by heart and it is a fact notorious to every one that there is no instance upon record of any thing which has so forcibly operated with the english nation to create a rooted aversion to tyranny as this very tragedy  having noticed the production of richard the second and so extraordinary a play as richard the third in the same year will it not appear astonishing that it should also produce the first part of henry the fourth a play be it for character situation writing conduct or any other dramatic requisite that cannot be sufficiently extolled it is full of beautiful and rich nature from the beginning to the end where except in shakespeare have met together so many characters so correctly natural so strongly colored and so judiciously contrasted  the bold yet apprehensive henry who in plausibly maintaining the crown he had usurped fancies that it totters on his head his volatile son who seems to be the scourge of his fathers crime but who has native honor enough in the end to correct the levity and folly of the prince of wales in the dignity and honor of the king of england and france the noble natured hotspur meditating revenge against the man whom he had raised to a throne and who ungratefully spurns those offers of assistance he no longer needs a serious lesson to those who even from the best motives support a wrong cause these as strong and warm written characters have a high and meritorious title to admiration  what then shall we say when we come to speak of falstaff the most inimitable character that ever was produced shall we any longer say that shakespeare could not have pursued the character of mercutio let us stay and see whether that can be possibly be our opinion when we have followed the humourous knight through the braggart in this play the moralist in the second part of henry the fourth the lover in the merry wives of windsor and the knave in them all the wit of falstaff or rather the broad humor which contains something better than wit is so true so striking so irresistible that the severest cynic must laugh and must approve  the scrapes he lies him into and afterward lies himself out of castigate the folly of lying by laughing at it to the highest pitch of perfection but this humor known so well by all and so difficult to be described by any is every where electrical from the two men in buckram onward to the description of the ragged regiment and finishing by the giving hotspur a new wound in his thigh  nym and bardolph and poins are also admirably drawn so is the hostess the incidents are perfectly probable and extremely natural and the quelling hotspurs rebellion makes out as a historical play a very interesting catastrophe  the merchant of venice came out the following year and most claims our attention which the more we give it the more we shall have cause for admiration for the characters are perfectly natural and draw in a masterly manner the writing is full of rare beauty and exquisite truth and the conduct is correct and judicious for the virtue it protects is rewarded and the rancour and revenge it exposes are disappointed and punished  the characters are drawn in the most glowing colors the jew is astonishingly bold and vivid his turbulent and unsatisfied passions are thrown into a conflicted tumult in every way of which they are susceptible and it is difficult to say where they are best agitated whether in the meditated revenge on antonio and his crafty bargain in the scene with tubal chequered with alternate joy and vexation or the trial where his sanguinary hopes are lifted to the highest climax of expectation to be suddenly damped by disappointment and dismay  portia is most highly finished generosity native dignity and greatness of mind are every where consistently seen in her from the caskets to the decision against shylock and these qualities are brought forward through the medium of unaffected sprightliness neat wit and captivating eloquence the other characters all rank respectably but the judgment of the author is particularly conspicuous in their gradually declining in consequence the better to bring forward portia and the jew  the writing of this play is full of beauty and sweetness wit and humor strength and force the casket scene is charmingly written so is the trial scene in which the celebrated eulogium on mercy is so admirably introduced stamping by a single trait as it happens so very frequently in shakespeare the fame of a poet nor can we conceive any think sweeter than the garden scene of lorenzo and jessica in which the charms of music are so eloquently described another standing quotation  the words uttered by the jew are throughout the whole play astonishingly appropriate it is one of those many instances in shakespeare where every auditor even of the meanest intellectual intelligence becomes a correct critic and decides at once that the character brought before him could not have said any more nor any thing else  the comic part consists of that playfulness in which shakespeare delighted to wanton and relieves the interest at intervals throughout the piece from the sprightly gratiano to the trifling gobbos and thus the language is a natural and easy succession of every thing that can interest please and divert  as to the conduct of the merchant of venice we are willing not to look at it too critically because if we did we should lose much of our pleasure the cruelty of the jew is a bold and for the sake of humanity let us hope an unnatural circumstance but it is surely possible i dont argue particularly in a jew for we are actually told how far truly i do not pretend to say that it really happened in a christian but true or false natural or unnatural if we agree to admit it there is an end to objection  it has also been complained of that time and place are violated and that the proper moment for the catastrophe is at the end of the trial and this last objection has some weight but the conduct of this piece has one perfection which perhaps never was so happily wrought before nor since i mean the union of the two stories blended so consistently and brought about so naly that the trifling  committed against time and place is much more than atoned for by this most judicious attention to action the unity shakespeare seldom violated which is infinitely more material than both the others put together  though i could every where dwell on the inestimable value of shakespeares writings yet as his pieces like those of every other author are of course unequal it gives me pleasure to examine more minutely such as are in the highest estimation though any candidate for dramatic fame might be content to subsist his reputation on the gleanings  as all is well that ends well was one of three some say four plays of which the merchant of venice was the first that came out in the same year it is not wonderful that it cannot rank with that admirable production this however is in great measure owing to its unfortunate plot the answer to which is that shakespeare out to have chosen a better there are however most charming passages in this play and some strong and highly wrought circumstances the character of parolles which seems to have supplied the hint for bobadil is in our delightful poets best style of humor and from the mouth of helen we hear many of those beautiful and fascinating passages which in him spring from a source inexhaustible  sir john oldcastle is certainly not worthy to be ranked among the works of shakespeare and it is with great propriety that it has been generally rejected it has however evident marks in places of strong and similar genius which might have arisen from his having improved it but even then they appear to be the shadow of his writing rather than the writing itself  this seems to be strongly confirmed by his bringing out in the same year the second part of henry the fourth a play replete with wonderful writing in this respect the character of falstaff is even improved for though he is full of rich and luxurious humor in the former part of this subject his observations here have a pointed and deep subtilty which seems to have been improved by keener and maturer observation in short he is a thief in the first part and a swindler in the second characters that require very different qualifications though they are the same in principle  the situations also that he is thrown into are stronger and richer the scene with doll tearsheet is highly wrought so is that with shallow and silence from his dry examination of the recruits onward to his art in borrowing the thousand pounds and at last his exstacy at receiving from pislol the news of the kings death  all the companions of falstaff are also greatly heightened in this play which is every where warm with incidents of the happiest invention and full of characters both interesting and entertaining showing not more the fertility than the judgment with which shakespeares astonishing mind was fraught and through which he delineated the features of human nature at pleasure  in the following year came out henry the fifth another wonderful production but indeed every thing is wonderful in shakespeare to recompense the auditor for the loss of falstaff the author has introduced fluellen whose mixture of pride quaintness and courage it is impossible not to respect and laugh at pistol is in this play a first rate part and indeed all the characters and incidents in the comic part are in the truest vein of pleasantry  the volatile prince who has ripened into the prudent king is a character of the most brilliant cast he is every where great noble and admirable cautious yet resolved before the fight modest and unassuming after it ever the soldier the man and the philosopher upon the whole this piece creates so much real interest that it proved upon standing the test the most  shakespeares historical plays this was conmed when  brought forward the coronation at which  henry the f  rmed at least three times oftener than any other given play proper to introduce that spectacle  much has been said of the lines put into the mouth of the chorus and in particular that they are unnecessary and one facetious gentleman has said they prove that shakespeare new nothing of the ancient chorus the answer to the first is that these lines are some of those unnecessary good things which every man of taste will rejoice that shakespeare thought proper to write and to the other that he varied from the ancient chorus to improve upon it for how could he be ignorant of what they insist he attempted to imitate  the puritan produced in   00 stands exactly upon the same ground as sir john oldcastle and whatever hand shakespeare might have had in it as it is far from a bad play he very probably left it unfinished from his impatience to work at the two admirable productions that followed  much ado about nothing came out in the same year this play is so witty so playful so abundant in strong writing and rich humor that it has always attracted universal applause the beauties it contains are innumerable they are a cluster and are set so thick that they scarcely afford one another relief and yet the best critic would find it difficult to say which of them ought to be displaced  benedick and beatrice have created the leading characters in fifty comedies and yet have never been excelled not even by congreve their friendly sparring consists of that extemporaneous repartee which is better than wit because it is not studied and better than humor because it is not gross in short what was genuine in shakespeare by others has only been imitated and there is one circumstance relative to these characters which boasts considerable preeminence because all this wit while its imitations have been introduced in general only to add a liveliness to the scene is here the very pith and marrow of the plot for it is the vehicle through which benedick and beatrice who had separately sworn to live single are actually made to fall in love with each other  the critics however who cannot help nibbling have endeavored to represent this wit are too licentious in benedick and too light in beatrice in their squeamish conscientiousness however they forget that when the rein is thrown over the neck of wit it will be playful but so it be not vicious its curvettings ought to be pardoned in the present case so little is there of vice in the pleasantries of benedick and beatrice that they exhibit as exalted a picture of every quality that can constitute honor generosity and the noble nature of love and friendship as perhaps the records of literature can furnish  there is not simply conversation in these characters there is action the best action that which is intended to serve truth and recommend morality beatrices friendship to her cousin and benedicks challenging claudio are among the grandest and noblest incidents the dramatic art has to boast of the circumstance of laying the same trap both for benedick and beatrice has been censured with some color of truth but it is materially varied and after all not worth a single cavil  all the circumstances of the plot have relation to one another even dogberry and his watch whose natural humor arises from an affectation of using phrases he does not understand which has been played upon by so many authors from that time to this are absolutely necessary in the construction of the piece for without them don johns plot could not have been defeated in short this comedy displays a fund of beauty which has never failed to give unceasing delight to all ranks of auditors and if it has faults so has nature to whom shakespeare was so faithful and in whom the notable critics if they took it in their heads would undertake to discover as many imperfections as they have affected to find in her favorite  as you like it produced in the same year differs at all points except general merit from much ado about nothing it is as full of wit of beauty of sweetness and of moral but the style of the characters the conveyance of the matter and the scene of action are the difference and serve to show that shakespeare could create interest with equal facility in a court or a forest  as you like it boasts one unrivalled merit for it is a model for dramatic pastorals and in vain do we place by the side of it the best productions of tasso and guarini this gives the wit with all its brilliancy a melancholy and grave air for it does not consist of sallies in consequence of reflections in manners that actually pass before you but rather of moralizing on those which have passed and from which you are distant both as to time and place  to the reputation of an author therefore i know not if this species of writing be not the truer advantage there appears to be more mind and more effort in producing it not however in shakespeare for his writings seem every where to have produced themselves the sensible and strong observation in the sweet prattle of rosalind the beauty and good sense in the reflections of jaques and the dry humor and true honesty in the faithful touchstone could not have been shown to advantage in any other situations  how many passages in this play are known by heart and considered of that memorable description that i have had such frequent occasion to notice quotations from the mouths of rosalind and touchstone are in the recollection of every one and that celebrated speech known by the name of shakespeares seven ages has been time out of mind bawled by men and lisped by children  as to the plot of the play it has by some been considered as romantic but this certainly constitutes its essence for without it we should lose the heroic friendship of caelia and the blunt fidelity of toushstone besides if the characters are thrown into extraordinary situations it has not arisen from choice but compulsion and therefore they do not enjoy fanciful pleasure absurdly chosen by themselves they make the best of their unfortunate situations and endeavor to turn that trouble that has been forced upon them into pleasure  in this light nothing can be more interesting nor affecting than the plot of as you like it the very circumstance of the ladies so suddenly giving away their hearts which doctor johnson does not seem to approve is by no means for such a plot improper they want protectors besides there is a parity in the fortunes of orlando and rosalind that begets a very natural sympathy and renders the incident beautiful and affecting i will agree however with the doctor that it would have been a most admirable advantage to literature if shakespeare had taken an opportunity of exerting his extraordinary powers by writing a scene between the hermit and the usurper  the next play we shall have to examine will be the merry wives of windsor which came out in   0  this piece take it as fair unadulterated nature consisting exactly of the very materials which constitute the best species of true comedy must be so pronounced at least equal to any thing in the english language such a variety of characters all true unexaggerated nature without quaintness without affectation speaking in the manner and to the very letter of real life every one as necessary to the plot as the various compartments of a building just in proportion essential in utility never better united together  the plot is natural simple and interesting and though an episode grows out of it which begets much perplexity and true legitimate equivoque nothing from first to last can be more perspicuous jealousy has never been so strongly depicted nor so happily exposed to ridicule the very blindness of ford in being gulled out of his money and his senses by falstaff is in the happiest extreme of true comedy and though we have seen complaints that the situations of the scenes might be transposed and that the play might have been ended almost at any part of it yet it is impossible to say that this could have been done with effect because the repetition of the supposed provocation is the very paroxysm in which the fever finds a cure for itself for otherwise in shakespeares own words in another place it would but skin and film the ulcerous part  we have also been told of fords absurdity in considering falstaff as an object of jealousy but who that knows the blindness of that passion will not consider this as the cunning of the scene mrs fords ground is secure she places a confidence in a valuable and approving friend and the more loosely her conduct appears to her husband the stronger is sure to be his remorse when he finds an amiable wise has condescended to go such lengths to cure him of his ungrateful suspicions  as to the episode in which all the subordinate characters are concerned it is strongly interwoven with all the main design and the incidents that grow out of it are truly pleasant and at the same time hold out a wholesome moral  as to the characters the most prominent of course is falstaff though there is no saying for the utility in their situations to which to give the preference falstaff is most happily hit even in the difficult light in which he is placed we are told that queen elizabeth commanded shakespeare to make faistaff in love it has been well observed by doctor johnson that a man does not with great facility write to the ideas of another and that love was not in falstaffs nature shakespeare has however from his gross vanity from his avarice from his cunning conjured up something much better than love in falstaff for he has made him fancy mrs ford in love with him which is truer comedy this his abuse of what he fancies confidence in her and his administering to the pleasure of ford under the name of brook employ all the passions proper to falstaff and at last make him the grossest dupe in his own plot  this is the very essence of comedy and as it serves to throw falstaff into all those situations which call forth his peculiar humor may be considered in a most felicitous light who can resist the description of his being soused in the thames his reading the letter and various other circumstances his luscious ideas his voluptuous mind his sensual passions are all displayed in the highest coloring which shows in a most extraordinary manner the wonderful resources that were to be met with in the genius of shakespeare  ford is a jealous character distinctly different from any other in shakespeare othello is provoked to by a villain and from the consciousness of his own unworthiness iachimo from absence and fictitious testimony troilus from a conviction that his wife was a wanton and the rest from other motives but ford is jealous through pride and from a belief that a most unworthy object is preferred to him this as there is nothing so mean as jealousy though nothing so much to be pitied puts him upon shifts which make him almost as contemptible as his rivial and under the tricks played him by the merry wives as they are called perfectly laudable whereas were there not this strong provocation mr fords conduct would be reprehensible if not unpardonable in short shakespeare knew that this was the only species of jealousy that could possibly be laughed at and therefore with that knowledge of human nature that has every where distinguished him he has made it the ground work of so entertaining and laudable a plot that no portrait of jealousy has since been drawn but this comedy has sitten for some of the features  i could with great pleasure go over the partilar merits of the other characters they are so various and so admirable but it would only be describing what every body knows both in their own forms and in the imitations of them that have pervaded so many other productions it has been observed that shakespeare seems to have been original in characters that are particularly marked by foreign and provincial pronunciation but that the merit of such characters is in the actor and not in the writer this is the strangest of all assertions and i should not have noticed it had not the authority been respectable the actor can do nothing if nothing is given him welchmen may sputter irishmen speak the brogue and frenchmen clip english to all eternity but this is not enough it is the wit and humor conveyed by this vehicle and not the vehicle itself that begets attention and though i have often seen actors who can from their excellent merit make a little go a great way i never yet saw one who could make a great deal out of nothing  i shall therefore apologize for every word i have written on the subject of this admirable play because every word in truth in reason in public opinion and in notoriety is totally unnecessary so well does the heart know how to despise criticism where the auditor has only to hear and admire  henry the eighth was also performed in   0  and gives us another proof that there was nothing too mighty for the grasp of our poets genius this is the last of shakespeares historical plays and is evidently written in compliment to queen elizabeth i cannot be of doctor johnsons opinion that the genius of shakespeare in this play comes in and goes out with katherine and that every other part may be easily conceived and easily written the specimen of the true and interesting pathetic which shakespeare has given us in the character of katherine is peculiarly admirable and among the best efforts of his inimitable talents but are wolsey and henry only common characters or are they what they have been universally allowed strong powerful and dramatic does buckingham go for nothing and are such exquisite lines as he utters when he is led to execution easily conceived i wish they were if for no other reason than that we might comprehend that secret of writing with which nature entrusted our delicious poet but the lines which in another place the doctor has applied to dryden that in a pointed sentence more regard is commonly had to the words than the thought seem to hit him here particularly hard but as i mean hereafter to examine this gentleman as one of the critics of shakespeare i shall content myself at present with saying that the world and doctor johnson are of different opinions  cromwell is one of those plays rejected as shakespeares and certainly with great reason for it has upon the whole less of those marks of his genius and judgment than any of those pieces that have been merely attributed to him that he had some concern in it however cannot be doubted the foot of hercules can belong only to hercules i shall anticipate a ridicule here which will be too obvious to escape wlings who considering this declaration as a defense of shakespeare will be apt to say that with all my cautious care of his character i cannot help acknowledging that he put his foot in it a circumstance and expression i should disdain to notice were it not to show how easy it is to ridicule   troilus and cressida the last play shakespeare produced in the reign of elizabeth came out in   0  a great deal has been said to prove that this was written after chapman produced his version of homer a fact by no means however substantiated or indeed if it were would it materially alter the question for shakespeare and chapman were not exactly of equal merit i think it pretty nearly amounts to a proof that shakespeare knew the trojan war before chapmans homer by many passages in his works for one instance he makes pistol say shall i sir pandarus of troy become   shakespeare must some how certainly have read the history of the trojan war perhaps from caxton and became intimately acquainted with the various qualities of the grecian generals for he has drawn their characters with full as much beauty and truth as homer and one is apt to think that he only read the history and knew nothing of homers particular manner of treating it for though the characters are the same and may be known through the portraiture of both authors as likenesses there is a dignity and a sublimity in the manner of their expressing their sentiments in this play beyond any thing of that nature in the iliad and is so much better at any rate than a translation that without grecisms the characters are critically greeks a discrimination that shakespeare understood better than any author that ever lived  as to the other merits of this play they are various but they are irregular and hastily put together cressida and pandarus are characters violently drawn but they beget that sovereign and ineffable detestation of vice which it is the peculiar duty of the dramatic poet to excite the brutality of thersites is well thrown in to mortify the wanton cressida and the conduct in isoiluss detection of her falsehood and wickedness is masterly  with this play i shall at present take leave of shakespeare to look after his cotemporaries lamenting my inability to do him justice except in my feelings and my wishes yet grateful for an opportunity of expatiating on a theme which affords me the pleasure of paying a tribute of respect and admiration to great and extraordinary talents  chap v jonson in the list of those dramatic poets who were celebrated in the reigns of elizabeth and james the first jonson claims immediate rank after shakespeare and it is but fair to say that the strong sense and sober regularity of his writings were of infinite consequence to those other authors of that time whose pens unlike the pen of shakespeare which never ventured in vain required a masterly criterion for their regulation such as jonson knew how to set up  of this use was this schoolmaster in literature whose pupils very often would have run riot had he not held up the rod of criticism perpetually in terrorem not that jonson did not know nature as well as erudition for we have many striking proofs in his dramatic writings that he did but it was awkward nature dry nature sententious nature nature in stilts and trammels and though faithful to truth as truth is to perfection the proper proportion of amusement and instruction was mistaken and the force of improvement was unsounded in that tasteless and often nauseous vehicle through which it was meant to be conveyed  it might be invidious to place jonson by the side of shakespeare because the loss to him in the comparison would be infinite it is indispensible however to notice because it is a historical fact that he had the experience of nine years during which time shakespeare was licking the stage into form before he brought forward a single piece and this premised whatever the world in general may think of the matter shakespeare must have been the preceptor of jonson  we are told indeed that shakespeare fostered him and his works and with some difficulty so wrought his iron that at last it became maleable and assumed something like form and we are also told that he was very ungrateful in return for this kindness which circumstance if true carries with it a proof of that remark which may invariably be ventured that genius is naturally allied to liberality and pedantry to envy  indeed the whole life of jonson seems to have been a series of pride meanness sourness insolence and discontent how arrogantly ungrateful was his message to charles the first who advanced him as poet laureat and frequently loaded him with benefits one of which a hundred pounds is acknowledged in an epigram the king sent him ten guineas upon hearing that he was poor his majesty said jonson to the bearer he sent me ten guineas because i am poor and live in an alley tell him his soul lives in an alley  turbulence threw him into the army restlessness made him quit the army for the stage brutality hurried him to take away the life of a fellow creature and capriciousness induced him to change his religion all which circumstances are mentioned however here only to corroborate what has been before asserted that the different features in the mind of the man often operate upon the labors of the writer  jonson was educated at westminster school under the celebrated camden but the narrow ideas of his fatherinlaw who was a bricklayer and who saw no further use for instruction than the level and the square induced him to take jonson from that learning which he is said to have imbibed with great avidity to teach him his own trade that he thought would build him a more solid fortune than the trade of poetry the young gentleman however who had more taste for building castles in the air than houses upon terra firma treated this intended kindness with great contempt and leaving his family went into the army in flanders  the study of literature was more congenial to the feelings of jonson than the study of military tactics he therefore took an early opportunity of leaving the army and repaired to cambridge where it should appear that he made no great stay owing to the narrowness of his finances for we soon find him an actor at the curtain theater shoreditch here following the steps of shakespeare he tried his hand at writing plays in which occupation however he appears for a time to have been unsuccessful at length he wrote every man in his humor a comedy beyond doubt of much sterling excellence and from that time his reputation began to be established  jonson was perpetually squabbling with all mankind and among the rest with shakespeare who in his own words might have replied with perfect indifference till thou can rail the seal from off the bond these probably might have been his sentiments for we do not find that he condescended to notice a slander that was born of ingratitude and nursed by envy jonson did not every where however fare so well for some of his malice drew on him a quarrel which finished by his killing a man in a duel for which he was imprisoned but he procured his release by changing his religion and thus he exhibited that picture which whatever merit it might have had was not even in the least degree like true genius for it was wisdom dressed like folly knowledge hid by vanity and talents obliterated by arrogance presenting at once a mind powerful mean offensive overbearing and accommodating  the different pieces which jonson produced amount to about fiftythree in number besides one or two which are attributed to him but among these are only two tragedies and ten comedies the rest being either masks or comic satires or else sketches written to serve some temporary purpose and this statement alone may serve to show how completely the works of jonson kick the beam when poised against those of shakespeare  yet was his merit great and extensive and he shall be allowed it to the letter for it is not in his want of sufficient talents for one man that we discover the disparity it is in his rivals possessing the talents of twenty men  as to tragedy jonson is absolutely an english seneca but a much better writer sejanus has great virile strength and sound sterling merit but it is heavy dull and declamatory and lest any school boy should be mistaken as to its origin the author has been honest enough to show in what way he has quoted the ancients even to setting down all his authorities so that the fall of sejanus whatever it may be as a promptbook cannot be denied the merit of an excellent schoolbook  the same faults pervade catiline the scenes are long the speeches are full of declamation the action is retarded and the audience must sleep nevertheless it is full of all that merit which correct regularity and sound erudition can give it but stilts are uneasy things and the mind has no more objection to shake off weight than the shoulders this is something like dutch beauty and puts me in mind of the man who wrote to his friend to say that they had many fine women in holland but that madam slaughenbroe was handsomer than mrs van breaustaut by half a ton  and it is upon this account that though every man who has a taste for literature will find in these scenes much pleasure on reflection yet to read them a first time is an effort a second a task and a third impossible the admirers of jonson may answer this if they will in the same manner as the orator did his friend he entreated him to read a speech he had composed and give him his opinion of it why said the frend out of kindness to you i have read it three times indeed said the other well and how do you like it why said the friend the first time i found  admirable the second but indfferent and the third damnable well never mind it said the orator it will do for it will only be heard but once   some of the comedies of jonson however have distinguished merit every man in his humor is admirably constructed well managed and full of those characters which are the properest objects of comedy i will not invidiously say that the outline of many of the parts may easily be traced the braggart the jealous man the simpleton and the plain dealer are fair and obvious game and one poet has as great a right to pursue them as another it must be confessed that kitely and boboadil in this play are masterly characters and the means taken to cure the folly of the one and and punish the cowardice of the other are well pursued  the subordinate characters through a very natural episode in which they are themselves concerned contribute to bring about the catastrophe in which necessary business the proteus brainworm is very active this rounds the conduct so artfully that no personage even to cob and tib is foisted in but all contribute very poetically to aid the double plot  these are the merits of this play to which indeed may be added the adroit manner in which jonson has fitted a foreign subject to the english stage for the original plot is italian which may very easily be discerned by the conduct of the intriguing brainworm as it is managed however here nothing can be more vernacular than the humor the manners and the intrigue and yet with all these advantages it has been with the utmost difficulty that this play has been able to keep ground nor would it ever have held a reputable situation on the stage had it not occasionally revived through a union of uncommon talents  the reason of this is obvious perfect wit and chaste humor as they are called may be natural but they cannot be general and nothing but what is general can universally please the public do not want an author to write a play as if every sentence obnoxious to criticism was a wound in his reputation they would rather that he greatly succeeded in places even though he sometimes relaxed and why because this is human nature of which a a play ought to be the faithful representative and it is on this account that the hard dry though natural humor of jonson and the refined and polished wit of congreve though they beget particular admiration never attract general applause  every man in his humor is a chimerical instance of jonsons eccentricity as a playwright it has in it some admirable writing and the characters are well drawn but it is conveyed to the audience through the medium of a grex or set of supposed auditors who sit on the stage and explain what if it were properly written ought to explain itself by this means the personages smack off the old moralities and become passions rather than characters and thus jonson instead of bringing the stage forward has rather endeavored to throw it behind hand and given one proof among many that though he has much merit of every description yet it consists rather of distracted and separate parts than a sober and harmonious whole  as sejanus and these two comedies were all the dramatic pieces except some of his masks that jonson produced before the reign of james the first by which time shakespeare had brought out twentyfour regular plays i shall defer any farther mention of this author till i have brought his cotemporaries up to that period and a general account of the stage itself and every regulation concerning it  chap vi chapman thomas heywood marloe and others chapman in his way was a most extraordinary character i shall not in relation to this author or any other exhibit any particular anxiety as to the town where he first drew his breath the college that boasted the honor of his education or any other of those adventitious circumstances which by some biographers are considered as of much greater moment than whether they credited the place of their birth or the seminary where they were educated  chapman whoever were his ancestors or wherever he was born was a great credit to literature as far as correct classical knowledge can render an author celebrated he was born seven years before shakespeare and began as a scholar to be in full reputation very early in life his first play however did not make its appearance till the very year jonson brought out every man in his humor therefore i can only notice in this place that which was called the blind beggar of alexandria and another produced the following year under the title of the humerores days mirth as the third dramatic effort of this author did not make its appearance till two years after the death of elizabeth  i shall however before i speak of his plays claim a right to mention chapman generally as an author and it is not because i have in another place insisted that he is greatly inferior to shakespeare for indeed who is not that i am to afford him only a niggardly portion of praise for he was a formidable rival to jonson who took him by the hand as a friend the more securely to do him every possible kind of injury one instance of this is apparent in the play of eastward hoe which was thought when it came forward to be the sole production of chapman jonson however is known to have assisted him in it and to have introduced some sarcastic passages against the scots which operating as he wished and expected upon james produced the downfall of chapman at court where he had great expectations through the influence of the prince of wales and the earl of somerset not had he any opportunity of reinstating himself through any explanation for the prince soon after died and the earl was disgraced   chapman was certainly both a correct and an elegant scholar his manners wee polished he enjoyed the countenance and protection of the great and was the intimate friend of men of the most finished wit and ingenuity of that time his plays have considerable merit and some of his other works are by no means a draw back on his fame but his best efforts are his translations particularly those from homer which were a great help at that period to erudition  the two comedies that regularly fall under our notice in this place are the most indifferent of this authors works being neither divided into acts nor having any regular damatic construction the utmost therefore that can be said of them is that they bore marks of genius and nature in the writing and gave expectation of better productions which were to follow  thomas heywood who has been already mentioned and who like his cotemporaries hardy in france and lopez de vega in spain seems to have derived all his merit from the number instead of the quality of his dramatic works demands some mention here though no more than two of his plays at least that we know of appeared during the life of elizabeth  this man by some of the biographers has been greatly extolled as a writer without any great appearance however of either truth or justice for the prodigious quantity he wrote for which he ransacked the ancients without mercy whatever might have been his real merit had he taken time to correct and polish his works rendered it impossible for him to turn any thing out of hand likely to secure him a solid reputation and thus we have a list of twentyfour pieces out of two hundred and twenty which he himself says he either wrote or was concerned in little more known at this moment than by their titles  heywood was certainly a good classical scholar and as an actor he was pretty celebrated indeed the pursuing this occupation and his being perpetually in company for we are ridiculously told that he wrote his plays upon the backs of tavern bills must have left him but little opportunity to complete the difficult task of writing plays especially such an immense number as are attributed to him  marloe who brought out his first play in    0 probably for the reasons before given the very year when shakespeare also produced his first piece was celebrated as an actor and well esteemed as a writer heywood calls him the best of poets not recollecting perhaps that shakespeare was in existence he deservedly however possessed considerable reputation and with all the ponderous merit of jonsons tragedy writing i should rather think the efforts of marloe either in themselves or the assistance they have afforded to others will have a longer and a better claim to the approbation of the public than those of the theatrical lawgiver  marloe wrote no comedy and his two tragedies of tamberlane the great and his edward the second are all that properly came before us here the latter however did not make its appearance till      during which lapse as shakespeare brought out seven historical plays he clearly made it his study to derive every possible advantage from so advantageous a circumstance and it must be confessed that edward the second is by no means a bad play the subject is well chosen and the piece displays the troublesome events of that monarchs reign particularly the fall of gaveston in very lively colors  marloe would very probably have ensured to himself a much greater degree of reputation had he not been led away by george peele and that se already spoken of who gave into all manner of licentiousness and were little better than atheists the weakness of marloes mind made him a prey to the folly and wickedness of these abominable doctrines and in his progate moments he wrote several tracts the manifest drift of which was to prove our savior an impostor and to show that the scriptures were full of idle stories and that religion was only policy and priest craft  thse paroxysms of folly have prevailed on certain restless individuals in all ages and have constlly excited some curiosity from their novelty and as constantly dwindled into just contempt and eecation it seems to have proceeded in marloe from fits of drunken phrenzy for in one of these he attempted to kill a footman whom he suspected of having been too kindly received by one of his dulcineas when the man in self defense diveed the direction of the weapon which entering into marloes head killed him upon the spot  this sudden death was considered as a judgment from heaven for his impiety and those who had before the weakness to admire his writings going to the opposite extreme now abhorred him and blamed themselves for then wickedness and credulity  marston who wrote two plays during the reign of elizabeth was considered as an eminent poet his particular merit was the purity and elegance of his style in which he carefully shunned all kind of ribaldry grossness and obscenity so much so says an author that whatsoever even in the spring of his years he presented upon the private and public theater in his autumn and declining age he needed not to be ashamed of  he had however more merit than this which would be pretty evident had we not the testimony of his writings from the boiling envy it excited in jonson who peaceable as marston was drew on himself by his repeatedly provoking conduct a large share of that poets literary castigation they were a long time friends and marston dedicated his play of the malcontent to jonson in warm and handsome terms envious however of his rising same as we have seen in the case of chapman and which was the case indeed with most of his cotemporaries jonson soon forfeited all pretensions to friendship and violently broke through every tie of honor and gratitude holding up the man who loaded him with carresses to contempt and ridicule  marston provoked to the utermost retorted upon jonson and in his epistle prefixed to his tragedy of sophonisba most successfully ridiculed the pedantic oppery in his works and detected those thefts from the ancients with which he had stuffed sejanus and catiline marston produced eight plays which are now indeed but little known but some of them have served as the ground work for the writings of succeeding authors  decker another poet for a time in friendship with jonson and afterward most severely satirized by that drawcancer in literature produced two plays before the reign of james what was the particular cause of the quarrel cannot now be known but it is universally agreed that jonsons envy and rancour not being able to bear a rival near the throne was its origin we may collect a very faithful idea of it from the dispute between pope and cibber which having originated in rancour on the side of pope every stroke he aimed at his adversary recoiled upon himself  in jonsons poetaster the dunciad of that time decker under the title of crispinus is most severely handled this literary hawk however so very fond of annoying small birds had better in this instance have soared on without having attempted to pounce upon decker for as it happens with other hawks that the very sparrows who are afraid of them on the ground attack them successfully in the open air so the light and agile decker pegged away at the clumsy and unweildy jonson to so good a purpose that he not only made his feathers fly but he galled him all over  this he effected by writing a play called the satyromastix or the untrussing the humerous poet here under the name of young horace he has made jonson the hero of the piece the public were charmed with the circumstance and the play did wonders nay this was the foundation of deckers reputation whose writings were certainly not of the first rate kind yet after his pride had been roused by the favorable turn this controversy took he made up by assiduity what he wanted in talents and having become a good judge of dramatic effect he enjoyed a considerable degree of reputable success  old fortunatus which perhaps originally roused the hornet jonson for extravagant as the story is the piece has great merit and satyromastix are all the plays of this author that come under our notice here he wrote single eight others several in conjunction with webster day and other poets and three or four besides are attributed to him  to middleton very little more has been attributed but that he wrote in conjunction at times with jonson fletcher massinger and others and this has been quoted as a proof that he could not be destitute of merit a better proof however are his own plays some of which are now in print and well known among these are a mad world my masters the mayor of queenborough etc and they rank his reputation about upon a par with deckers  from the production of shakespeares first play to the death of queen elizabeth who it should be mentioned translated one of the tragedies of euripides few known authors except those here enumerated wrote for the stage eedes is said to have written several plays but we know not even their titles we are told that he wrote them in his youth that they were mostly tragedies and that becoming in maturer years a grave divine a prebendary and chaplain to the queen he stuck altogether to the duties of his profession and perhaps upon this account he would not suffer his plays to be published  yarrington wrote one play so did porter so did brandon and bernard translated the comedies of terence besides these there were about thirty plays written by anonymous authors so that during a period of fourteen years more than seventy plays were produced only forty of them legitimately owned and out of those forty twentyfive were certainly from the pen of shakespeare and four others were attributed to him  it will be seen by this what complete possession he had of the stage during the latter end of elizabeths reign and that in the short period of fourteen years he brought it to a degree of perfection beyond which it has not since gone nor can it ever go i shall now by a review of the playhouses and and actors show the prodigious disadvantages under which all this arduous task was attempted and in spite of which it was so completely accomplished  chap vi play houses and actors we have already seen that noblemen retained players in their service and that no others were regularly tolerated but that even this was not sufficient to restrain their licentiousness and therefore in      the year in which shakespeare is said to have produced his first play a circumstance on this very account highly improbable players were altogether silenced till further notice  whether the influence of shakespeare revoked this mandate very suddenly or not it will be difficult to say it is certain however that his first play reduced the theatrical state to such order that playhouses began from that moment to multiply and we find that during the life time of this extraordinary man no fewer than seventeen were known among these were st pauls singing school the globe on the bankside southwark the swan the hope both also in southwark the fortune between white cross street and golden lane the red bull in st johns street the cross keys in grace church street the tuns the theater the curtain the nursery in barbican the playhouse in blackfriars the playhouse in whitefriars the playhouse in salisbury court the cock pit and the phoenix  we have here only sixteen it is insisted upon however that there was another a matter however of no great moment nor ought we to understand that though all these were built during the life time of shakespeare they were therefore built on his account for the fortune the theater and the curtain were erected between    0 and    0 the fortune according to several writers being the first regular english theater though it is much more probable to suppose it was the theater from its name which seems to suppose that it was the only theater  the term regular theater used here is vague enough for theaters could not be called regular till they had scenes an advantage none of hese asted though there cannot be a doubt but they had at times some sort of decorations for these even at the time of the mysteries are particularly described to us and as to the masks which were performed at public weddings and at court there is no doubt but the first architects and painters were employed to decorate them  it is however certain that matted walls or tapestry at best were all the decorations then of the theater and these the audience were to fancy gardens towns palaces or whatever else the poet might think proper besides which the performances were by day light another drawback on stage effect the necessary deception of which was of course by this circumstance materially injured  but the grand disadvantage which must have been a considerable check to the genius of shakespeare was that womens characters were performed by men it is evident that from this circumstance he kept many of his female characters in the back ground and even the performance of those which from their consequence in the piece were obliged to be prominent must have been necessarily inferior to what they would have been had they been represented by women  it will be said that this objection holds good as to other authors as well as to shakespeare and this is true but when in justice we are obliged to allow his great superiority in point of merit it will operate on that very account in a much stronger degree to his disadvantage than any other  the public were certainly glad enough to take things as they found them and the rage must have been very high indeed at that time for dramatic entertainments when so many theaters so ill furnished with every requisite but good plays could find means to exist  as to actors they must have been numerous indeed and upon consideration we cannot help crediting they were performers of merit for as they as well as the authors must have found their disadvantages in rafters for ornamented ceilings plastered walls for woods rocks and palaces and sometimes neither ceilings nor walls at all for in the innyards they performed in the open air there must certainly have been a great deal of the true roscian stuff about the english actors at that time for the less they had to help them out the more they had to describe  this merit will be the more easily allowed when we recollect that the english authors like the grecian were also actors and that shakespeare jonson marston and marloe enforced the effect of their writings by personating those characters they delineated we know not their exact merits upon the stage and we have been told by way of detraction that shakespeare never attained a higher rank than the performance of the ghost in his own hamlet and this may be a very good argument with those who estimate parts by their length i have seen garrick perform the ghost in hamlet and i should not think it an unfair argument to suppose had garricks merit preponderated on the side of his writing which posterity may know instead of his acting which it cannot that this very circumstance would be cited to prove the english roscius a very mediocre actor so careful are we before we allow men too much merit  this consideration does not weigh a feather in the argument i cannot say that shakespeare was a capital actor nor can any one demonstrate to me that he was a bad one his lesson to the prayers in hamlet shows pretty clearly that he knew what acting was and it is not very likely that be would be either so ignorant or so vain as unconsciously to write in this lesson a satire against himself at any  it is impossible but that the assistance of the writers themselves must have added material weight to the celebrity of their pieces and really one cannot but be charmed even in the acting of the present day admirable as it is supposed to be when one sees now and then a gleam of sense laboring to make its way through a congregation of vapors by means of which film authors are misrepresented nature tortured into every shape but her own and ease and simplicity distorted into affectation and caricature  it will not be easily credited as these authors were also actors that the profession of a dramatic performer was not in great estimation at that time nay it is not clear to me but that it was then in much greater repute than it is now or ever will be again and the reason is there was more gratitude in the treatment they received and a higher admiration of men that the public considered in possession of talents superior to their own  on this account as it has often happened in other countries men of the first abilities and in the highest situations did not disdain to become actors for no tolerated profession is disgraful unless the members themselves disgrace it those of this description who had talents themselves readily embraced it those who had not readily encouraged talents in others sir thomas more did not disdain to turn actor so little did he fear that the disrepute of the profession could injure the morality of the man and tarleton who was really a licentious character was nevertheless on account of his merit admired and even honored till his profligacy shut him out of that society exactly as it must have done out of any other  there is another reason why the actors of that time must have been deservedly celebrated good writeing requires good acting and when have we witnessed such good writing as that of shakespeare in him we have come to the perfection of the art have we had any thing since that demands the exertion necessary for the performance of richard lear hamlet othello macbeth and many other parts that the reader will point out to me do not nineteen out of twenty actors choose a character for their first appearance from shakespeare why because the merit of the author assists the reputation of the actor and thus we are obliged to go back to the matter of that time before we can show what the exertions of actors at that time required  we are told by various writers decidedly and without reserve that acting has gradually declined from the time of shakespeare and that the art is lost burbage who was the original richard the third lowin the first hamlet and henry the eighth and kempe who was inimitable in the clowns are positively said to have as much surpassed heart lacy mohun shatteral and clun who succeeded as they did betterton and that set  if this be true which however it is extremely difficult to vouch the merit of an actor must have been supposed to consist at that time of all the force and power necessary to be assumed in order to give effect to the representation of great characters unassisted by those decorations which now frequently attract the public without acting at all and this admitted it was the acting of roscius of aesop of those mimes of whose action alone we are told such prodigious things  in this case the english stage possessed the best merit of the grecian and the best merit of the roman for it was supported by actors of both sorts shakespeare and the other authors gave to acting a grecian polish following the steps of aeschylus and burbage lowin and the rest made it a profession singly and emulated the roman perfection of roscius and aesop  besides these as so many theaters existed at that time the number of actors must have been immense but as a minute enquiry into this would lead us only into conjecture for though a lamentable one it is a certain fact that posterity cares but little for that merit which does not substantiate itself i shall leave this subject till it can be better elucidated by a description of those plays and their representation which to an astonishing number did great credit to the reign of james the first during the life of shakespeare  chap viii state of literature at the death of elizabeth as it always happens that while improvement in any one study is going forward a sensible sympathy is felt in all the collateral parts so it will be found in the present instance that while shakespeare was improving the stage the relative arts were every where verging nearer to perfection  poetry painting and music in the reign of elizabeth began as if by general consent to throw off barbarism and though their various merits manifested themselves in different parts of europe the general effect was electric and while the muses separately chose residences the influence of all was diffused from people to people  italy however was the ida there the arts which had been fostered under the auspices of leo the tenth now began to gain decided preeminence painting however which had reached to a sublime height and music which had acquired polish and refinement seemed to keep their ground firmer than the stand made by literature which after the wonderful tasso and the charming guarini yielded to the influence of the splendid talents and great genius possessed by poets of other nations  the spaniards with cervantes at their head began to grow very conspicuous in literature malherbe about this time taught the french how to write poetry mambrun gave their language every polish that it could require from critical and grammatical excellence and these poets malherbe in particular stamped a regulation and a criterion which overcame all the gothic barbarism into which french erudition had been plunged and refined it into that elegance and neat point for which it has been since so justly celebrated  english erudition at no time calculated for that which is light and superficial but always for that which is solid and true had imbibed nothing more of italian flight of french point of spanish sarcasm than served the purpose of enforcing the necessary end to which the argument in question tended imagery it had wide and comprehensive as the imaginations that produced it but the flowers were not born to decay but to illustrate truth and picture nature by the beauty of their coloring and the sweetness of their odor  should any one doubt this let him range with spencers fairy queen through all the wilds of fancy the labyrinths of allegory and the mazes of enchantment and as each new slight of imagination surprises him into wonder and astonishment let it also convince him into virtue and truth  there would be no more difficulty by a review of the shepherds calender to pronounce spencer a superior pastoral poet to guarini or any other writer back to theocritus than to prove shakespeare superior to any other dramatic author pastoral poetry has but one character and whether we resort to virgil to mambrun his imitator or onward to any or all of those various penners of self evident truths who have written of hills and dales and fondly fancied themselves poets the objects must be obvious simple and natural and those who have been so fortunate or rather ingenious to blend interest inculcate moral and afford pleasure without insipidity dullness or puerility a charge in which many eminent pastoral poets are unfortunately involved are certainly the best writers of this description and therefore i shall not hesitate to pronounce spencers shepherds calender and shakespeares as you like it the best specimens in their different characters of this species of writing i know of nothing that has begot more controversy than this subject a hundred instances may be cited every one as ridiculous as the dispute between phillips and pope in which the latter gentleman with his usual arrogant modesty pretends to praise his rival that the world may extol him at the same time when gays pastorals which were better than those of either pope or phillips were little heeded and all to prove that readers in general are taken in by stark nonsense and the most offensive puerility merely because the ingle of the rhyme captivates the ear the famou ballad of shenstone who if he had imitated spencer as closely in every thing else as he did in the schoolmistress would have held a higher reputation has a poorer recommendation to public favor than any thing which ever obtained it and this is saying a great deal witness the following parody on my banks are all furnished with bees which is just as good and not a whit more ridiculous than the original my hives are all furnished with bees quickset hedges my fences adorn my woods are all crowded with trees and my fields yellow over with corn i seldom have found any tares of such use are my harrow and plough in my orchard grow apples and pears in my dairy there is milk from the cow   had the ballad of which this is part of a parody never been published these lines might have stood with nine readers out of ten for good pastoral poetry for the images are as true as appropriate and as interesting as in the original but as unfortunately they contain only a representation of well known objects merely noticed and not wrought upon nobody cares a halspenny for the shepherds picturesque retreat and the poetry sinks into quaintness and puerility if he had shown how he trafficked with his honey and that with the money it produced he brought up a growing family or solaced an aged parent how his fences served to describe him a worthy member of social life by parting off his possessions from those of his neighbor and therefore preventing depredations on either side how his trees yielded him firing and timber for use and profit and kindly formed a shade when fatigue courted him to repose had he in short shown the comforts derived from his little harvest the fruit of his industry the advantage of his harrow and plough and other agricultural inventions the cider the perry the butter the cheese and other blessings springing from the produce of his orchard and his dairy then would the feigned character of the peasant have spoken the beauty of the poet and given the simplest of these objects a valuable interest but this is seldom the case even with the best writers and for readers it is inconceivable how the correctest understandings are too often deceived into admiration by mere sound a gentleman of strong genius finished education and true poetic fancy who has long given up writing for no other reason than because after taking unwearied pains he could not meet with a liberal bookseller wrote a burlesque pastoral which is stark nonsense from beginning to end and yet it has been greatly admired as excellent poetry i have heard several persons whole understandings rank high in the opinion of the world speak in rapture of the following lines but hark what odours whisper in the wind does sol descend or is my daelia kind avoid her look there is magic in her eye take heed ye mountains if ye gaze ye die   these whispering odours falling suns gazing mountains are a very small specimen of the false images this poem contains and yet there is scarcely an ted beauty in pastoral poetry from theocritus to shenstone that it does not successfully ridicule     we have seen under the auspices of buckhurst berners sir thomas more and others onward to sir philip sidney what strenuous efforts were made to encourage literature in all its branches divinity had its advocate in hales who was a sound moralist and a good poet who was loved and followed in his life time and whose works were published after his death under the title of golden remains of mr john hales king whose pulpit orations were of that sensible and convincing kind that graced the doctrine they recommended was also a very populous churchman king james used to call him the prince of preachers and lord coke is said to have been so charmed with his oratory that he both declared him the best speaker he ever heard and made his manner the model of his own imitation  hall who was a very accomplished poet as well as a learned and sensible divine served not only the cause of the church but literature in general for while his writings under the title of meditations improved the mind enlarged the understanding inculcated the duties of religion and described the beauty of virtue proving that modesty meekness and piety which he practiced his satires which are full of admirable point enlivened the imagination and exposed the deformity of vice to the derision and contempt in which he himself held it  overall who is said to have been the best scholastic divine this country ever produced was a most strenuous and successful champion for this great cause and that he might prove his utility as a citizen as well as a scholar he has earnestly attempted in his convocation book to show that our duty to temporal government springs out of our duty to spiritual government a position that a divine has surely a right to maintain for an union between social and religious obligation is certainly the most laudable thing that can be generally recommended because out of the spirit of that opinion issues the best consequences attendant on society  many other learned and elegant writers treated this great theme at that period with the becoming dignity and profound knowledge it demanded and their abilities were properly called into action at this particular moment when so many bigots and casuists joined to decry the protestant religion that had been so nobly though so recently established the disciples of bonnor and mary had yet their advocates and the embers of those fires so alarming to goodness and so shocking to humanity that had been kindled in smithfield seemed now and then to emit a faint warning that without circumspection the flames might again revive  as a government established on the firm basis of a mild and tolerant religion seemed best calculated for a rational and moderate people which the english in this reign became the protection of property of course began to be more equitably regulated many extraordinary men lent their assistance to complete a work so essentially necessary to the benefit of society and many difficulties were got over and much obscurity cleared up in the old laws as well as many admirable amendments introduced in the new  cowell born the same year with shakespeare whose study was not confined to the ecclesiastical laws which branch he particularly professed very meritoriously attempted at a simplification of them all which when we consider that the laws are inexplicable at this day must have been a pretty arduous task he wrote a book called the interpreter wherein he pointed out the signification of all law terms that had been used or authorized previous to that time and he wrote a book of institutes in the manner of justinian which was considered as a work of great merit  sir john davies was another law luminary of considerable celebrity who wrote sound arguments on jurisprudence and good poetry two pursuits that have seldom united in one man his oratory seems to have been of that clear convincing sort for which lord mansfield was so properly admired and indeed the chief justiceship of the kings bench would have been the appropriate vehicle for the exercise of his talents but unfortunately soon after his appointment to that high station he died suddenly  lord coke whose great name stands so high in estimation for law learning enlightened the reign of elizabeth he was so indefatigable in the pursuit of his labors which were eminent and meritorious it might be said of him as of caesar that he thought nothing done while there was any thing left to do his learned and laborious works on the laws says a writer will be admired by judicious posterity while fame has a trumpet or any breath to blow therein his labors however various and extraordinary as they were in no way fell short of the variety and singularity of his fortunes which were an alternate rotation of power and disgrace not so much in the reign of elizabeth whom he calls the fountain of justice and the life of the law but afterward when james came to the throne who used to say so well did coke manage to repair ill fortune that he always fell on his legs like a cat  other great men whose eminent abilities added luster to the laws of their country in this reign might with great propriety be here enumerated their merit indeed wants no other criterion to prove it than its being able to keep a respectable stand at the time when bacon dignified human nature  this wonderful character whose eulogium every body has attempted and nobody has been competent to effect seems to have been born to give a precise and accurate distinction to the high office of lord chancellor his expanded ideas his penetrating judgment and his critical knowledge of causes and effects gave him an innate and fixed comprehension of general equity his competency to discern the errors he cancelled or corrected in questions of philosophy and all those other subjects which his great genius so universally embraced taught him with the same accuracy to determine between decision and redress that difficult distinction which cannot be made but by a sound head and an upright heart  in my province i can only speak generally of bacon otherwise i should have unfeigned pleasure in paying my feeble tribute of admiration due to the talents of so exalted a genius fortunately the world would anticipate every syllable were it ever so true or ever so strong that i could possibly write on this great subject his works that grace the libraries of the learned will be the best test of his high reputation which are allowed by the literati of all europe to the everlasting honor of this nation to have stamped him the first and most extraordinary universal genius the world has produced  history that mirror of the lives and actions of good and bad men set up as the object of imitation or detestation of the wise and virtuous was as industriously and as learnedly treated as divinity or law during the reign of elizabeth speed with great judgment and unwearied application detected the errors of his predecessors and exposed the futile and fanciful conjectures of geofrey of monmouth and william of malmsbury in a most sensible and happy manner his opinions also concerning other historians are given with no less good sense than deference and for the materials he was able to collect and considering the uncertainty of events of which at that time nothing but a very imperfect account could be obtained his chronicles of england contain a fund of information which from circumstances and on comparison bear strong resemblance to authenticity  stow has done more than speed he took up history in a very interesting way for besides his chronicles of england which traverse a large field his survey of london has rendered his historical intelligence more interesting by confining the subject to its proper scene of action his researches into antiquity have turned out very valuable materials for other authors to work upon and yet those authors have had so little candor or gratitude that i have seen the works of some of them who instead of allowing the merit of those they were glad to imitate have only deplored that the antiquary stow and the historian speed were both tailors  daniel poet laureat to queen elizabeth was the first who began to give history a proper polish as well as a necessary perspicuity daniel had a good deal of the poet in him and the actions of the great and good are best delivered from a poetic mind his relations of facts are brief and pointed and his observations both political and moral inform and entertain  but these however as well as others had boasted a preceptor in history of wonderful talents and endowments a man whose clearness force and natural elegance had long given luster to erudition this will be acknowledged what i say that i mean buchanan that mixture of sallust and livy who united brevity and perspicuity with grace and politeness and whom daniel seems to have copied on this account  buchanan was much honored in other countries as well as in scotland where he was born and even melvil his cotemporary and rival who espoused opposite opinions who was the firm and faithful adherent of mary queen of scots which misguided woman had not her weakness led her to listen to the advice of less able and less honorable counselors might have escaped all her misfortunes was not averse to do every justice to the fame and talents of buchanan  added to all the other admirable qualities possessed by buchanan he was celebrated for the charms of his conversation in which he seems to have emulated the greeks for his observations were short nervous and pointed full of truth knowledge and experience and might had they been collected have made a complete string of apothegms his simplicity however and deference led him into an attention to others more artful than himself who imposed upon his credulity especially in religious matters  by this means though his fidelity remained unshaken he relied at last in his writings too much on the opinions of others and these having been advanced too frequently to injure his reputation he subscribed to the diminution of his own consequence little suspecting he was the dupe of an imposition which he himself would have disdained to practice  this and his popularity lowered him deservedly in the judgment of the learned for he grew careless and adopted any vulgar opinion so it served to procure him temporary admiration showing that difficult as it is to attain fame it is much more difficult to preserve it the most unfriendly however of his flatterers who poisoned the chalice of praise they held up to him for his refreshment and the most inveterate of his more honest because more open enemies have never either by refined insinuation or envious assertion been able to withhold from him the impartial award of posterity which has confirmed him a firm philosopher an elegant historian a perfect moralist and a good man  but if those already mentioned beget our warmest praise and demand the admiration of posterity what shall we say when we consider that this age also boasted the advantage of hookers incomparable merit that exquisite improver of the english language of whom pope clement the eighth said this man indeed deserves the praise of an author his books will get reverence by age for there is in them such seeds of eternity that they will continue till the last fire shall devour all learning  again commanded by justice and truth we cannot pass by sir walter raleigh that great man no less extraordinary for his eminent talents than his unmeritted misfortunes who in proportion as he enlightened and instructed the world experienced its ingratitude he defeated the spanish armada discovered a new country and as a warrior and a statesman did his nation the most singular and important services and in return was stripped of his preferment loaded with ignominy and condemned to die as a traitor  the delight of his life being the good of his fellow creatures he employed his time in the tower where after being reprieved which was a sufficient indication of his innocence he was many years confined in exploring the deepest recesses of literature all subjects were alike to him epistles poetry war navigation geography politics philosophy and history came with new luster from his descriptive pen  at length his philanthropic and meritorious services having been felt and acknowledged and the times demanding a more active exercise of such brilliant talents he was called again into action when with the benignity and forgetfulness of injury only native in a great mind he lost his anger in his patriotism and rushed to succor his country he achieved wonders assisted by his son who had the melancholy glory of losing his life like another marcus sighting gallantly by the side of his father  but the more brilliant his career the more the sun of his glory engendered the venom of malignity were the circumstance not upon record it would not be believed that a nation so full of splendid reputation so celebrated for impartial justice should so deface the monuments of its fame as to sacrifice the hero who reared them sir walter rareigh being complained of to a weak king by an insidious foe was given up to injustice for having served his country and when nothing could touch his life upon this unworthy accusation that the measure of his injuries might be full and the slanderous and envious might be glutted and gratified he was beheaded for that former supposed crime of which his innocence had been honorably manifested by a full pardon and which pardon had been confirmed and ratified by an important and dignified command in the service of his country it is very material to the reputation of elizabeth to notice that this ignominous and disgraceful stain to real dignity did not happen in her reign raleigh was not the only great character whose reputation that had been suffered under her genial influence chilled into night and winter when the sun of her patronage went down and the indelible disgrace of putting this extraordinary man undeservedly to death is only one reproachful  among many that attached to james and that sunk the arts into gradual inaction   i cannot wind up my account of historians at this period without mentioning the celebrated camden who we may remember was preceptor to jonson and who seems to have slogged into him all that learning and ill nature for which he was so remarkable britannia is deservedly a work of great reputation the origin manners and laws of the ancient britons are there well described and sensibly commented on  this english pausanius as he has been called took unwearied pains to celebrate all that was worthy valiant and great in the annals of his country and at the same time that he excited emulation in young minds he formed them for great undertakings for he was master of westminster school whence have issued so many divines lawyers warriors and statesmen his opinions were proudly looked up to and his learning his judgment his universal knowledge and the discharge of his professional duties procured him the protection of his sovereign the association of the great and the admiration of the literati who dignified him by the appellation of the great camden  going on i might instance george carew earl of totness who wrote the history of the wars in ireland besides collecting several chronologies letters charters and monuments in four large manuscript volumes which are still in the bodleian library at oxford and sir george carew brother to lord totness who was employed on embassies from england to the courts of poland and france whence he collected many historical particulars which he introduced into a work addressed to james the first though written and published originally in the reign of elizabeth called a relation of the state of france with the characters of henry the fourth and the principal persons of that court  but to wave all those branches of literature for instance philosophy in which beside those mentioned and many others adamson conspicuously shone who was to the philosophers of france what newton was afterward to descartes he escaped the massacre of paris on the feast of st bartholomew by miracle having been concealed in a house the master of which was thrown into the street and dashed to pieces for having sheltered the protestants adamson was archbishop of st andrews and a great promoter of the works of lindsay with whom he was joined in an important commission so that the enmity among the churchmen that lindsay drew down on him by his satirical writings was in no respect imputable to or convived at by adamson  putting by physic rhetoric the mathematics and all the relative literary studies i shall finish this subject by briefly touching on poetry of which speaking generally of the subject i know not if spencer was not king at any rate he felt himself a monarch but being no more than poetically so and therefore not able literally to command any subjects he was determined figuratively to reign over more than all the monarchs of the earth thus whole legions of fairies goblins and monsters appeared and disappeared at a stroke of that poetic scepter his pen palaces temples and enchanted castles were built in the compass of a distich and to make the empire large enough for its inhabitants the whole regions of fancy were chosen for his scenes of action these with great felicity he wrought to the wisest and best of purposes and in the rewards and punishments of his different subjects according to their virtues and vices he has given a system of morality that will ever be an ornament to posterity this moralily is particularly advantageous by being conveyed in a style of the most brilliant fancy and most perfect truth  his genius has been the admiration of all those who can feel and discriminate and what defects may be found in him were attributable only to the early times he wrote in all that barbarism having not yet been cleared away in which they were found by his predecessor chaucer in whose steps he trod but being possessed of more exalted abilities he showed the great distinction of genius by improving upon mind rather than manner for spencer manifested all the great soul of chaucer without deigning servilely to confine himself to the contracted and narrow limits to which that great man had submitted though perhaps more from necessity than inclination  the fortunes of spencer were truly poetical they resembled an april day and were alternately chequered by clouds and sunshine it is true he wore a laurel crown but it was so barren that it did not bear for a considerable time a single leaf and when his affairs mended it was more owing to the solicitations of those individuals to whom he he was deservedly dear than to his own personal merit  queen elizabeth who accorded him his withering laurel at length by many solicitations accorded him also what enabled him for a time to live comfortably of this however this king was dispossessed and died in all the grief of low fortune and disappointment he has left however queen who so sweetly sings his departed merits that the mists of prejudice being now removed his same will live when those who have since attempted to endanger it by vexations cavilling are forgotten  shakespeares talents having been almost wholly confined to dramatic poetry it will be unnecessary to insist on them in this digressive part of the work their influence claiming full notice in its body of which they compose the vitals jonson also and the rest of the dramatic writers for reasons something akin to these need not be mentioned and it would be repetition to speak of daniel raleigh sidney or fairfax i shall therefore content myself with winding up the subject of literature in general by remarking that taking it in all points of view i do not say the annals of the world cannot produce an era in which existed so much collective merit but i think it out of doubt that no other age can boast three such men as bacon shakespeare and spencer  chap ix painting this art which is said to have arisen among the egyptians and which as in almost every other instance the greeks carried to perfection was known later in england to any extent or degree of excellence than in any other civilized country  it is doubful whether we can with any propriety pin our faith on the accounts of the very ancient painters if we were to take implicitly what we are told to believe we should place apelles and xeuxes by the side of corrigio raphael and reynolds it is ridiulous to think of wha has been said of the ancient painters poussin used to say that raphael was an angel compared to the modern painters but an a compared to the ancients in the first place the asserion must be fal and contemptible but were it true neither poussin nor any other could possibly produce any proof of it for what did they or do we know of the ancients by whom they mean apelles zeuxis and the rest but by hearsay sculpture reaching further into posterity may be known phidias and praxiteles we perhaps have some vestiges of stone and marble do not change color and they grow perfect among children of gusto by being mutilated but what amateur however invulnerable to imposition can show us a painting in high preservation for that is the cant of the same early date  but this is impossible the very colors could have flatly contradicted so absurd a belief besides as painting is the very art which can never attain complete perfection nature being inimitable it cannot possibly be that in the barbarous age in which alexander massacred so many peaceable strangers whose territories he laid in ruins and whose comfort he destroyed to gratify a frantic and useless ambition that painting which is a sober studious art and which can only thrive in civilized soil could have attained any perfection in spite of the story of the birds and the curtain or the famous saying that there were two alexanders one invincible sprung from the loins of philip and the other inimitable produced from the pencil of apelles  this cannot be better confirmed than by what actually happened in italy where previous to the incursions of the barbarians painting flourished to perhaps a higher degree of reputation than poetry in the latter times of the republic and under the first emperors rome had considerable masters but when the barbarians with almost as much ferocity as alexander and his army inundated italy painting so far from boasting a single apelles shrunk into nothing and was reduced to its primitive elements  in the age of julius the second and leo the tenth it began again to revive and this revolution has given rise to the distinction of ancient and modern painting the first comprehending the greek and roman painters and the other that set who formed themselves into schools and from whom alone to say the truth we have a right to date the perfection of this art so that the usual mode of expressing ourselves according to this is a perversion of the original meaning for we consider the painters who began to flourish under leo the tenth as the ancients which is in point of fact perfectly right for however the art might before have been exercised to the admiration of those who were not civilized enough to judge of so elegant a study and however it might have branced into partial streams in greece and rome there was no source no fountain head till it collected itself in italy  cimabue in the thirteenth century with infinite diligence collected the materials of painting the very idea of which had then shrunk into obscurity and the difficulty with which he obtained a very slight knowledge of what the art had been in greece is quite enough to show that what we pretend to know of it at present is built upon a shallow foundation indeed  some florentines seconded the labors of cimabue and to so good a purpose that though rude in the profession themselves they knew so well the elements of it that their scholars soon became celebrated the perfection of painting therefore may be dated from the latter part of the fifteenth century at which time andrea perocchio was the master of leonarda de vinci pietro perugino of raphael urbin and ghirlandaio of michael angelo  soon after this as all the world knows painting took such strides toward perfection that owing to the schools these great men established angelo having set up his at florence raphael at rome and vinci at milan it was carried to a pitch of excellence from which connoiseurs insist it has ever since been on the decline  certainly the talents of leonarda de vinci whose study was to diffuse that merit he so eminently possessed who was the painters preceptor and the favorite of kings by this time had made their rightful impression michael angelo who was considered as the greatest designer that ever existed and acknowledged to know anatomy more perfectly than any man in the world who sought perfection in solitude and of whom it was said that painting was jealous and required the whole man to herself by this time had added wonder to curiosity  it is extraordinary that this great man was equally remarkable in painting sculpture and architecture and besides was a good poet his statues though few were however admirable his paintings were numerous and are so well known that it would be an insult to his memory and the taste of the conoscenti to describe their beauties and his fame as an architect will remain while there is any vestage of st peters at rome i must here give another proof how very indefinite all assertions are as to historical facts able authors insist that michael angelo built st peters at rome at the same time that they as positively insist it was built by raphael at the express command of leo the tenth perhaps my wisest way would have been to have funk both assertions but i thought it the fairest conduct to let them go as they are that my reaters may judge for themselves  st johns at florence the capitol the farnese palace or his own house  raphael who deserves perhaps even stronger praise than his great cotemporaries had also to the other various perfections of painting added the graces he has been styled the prince of painters and the divine raphael  du fresnoy says speaking of this wonderful man that he surpassed all modern painters still adhering to the old distinction of making the greeks the ancients because he possessed more of the excellent parts of painting than any other and it is believed that he equalled the ancients excepting that he designed not naked bodies with so much learning as michael angelo but his gusto of design is purer and much better he painted with not so good so full and so graceful a manner as corregio nor has he any thing of the contrast of the lights and shadows or so strong and free a coloring as titian but he had without comparison a better disposition in his pieces than either titian corregio michael angelo or all the rest of the succeeding painters to our days his choice of attitudes of heads of ornaments the suitableness of his drapery his manner of designing his varieties his contrasts his expressions were beautiful in perfection but above all he possessed the graces in so advantageous a manner that he has never since been equalled by any other  the school of these three great masters confirmed the reign of painting so completely that it could not but be diffused for ever through the world for exclusive of the great number of pupils they turned out those schools at length grew into a systematic establishment under the caracci who added to their own respective merits have rendered their names illustrious by complimenting the world with such painters as guido domenechino and lanfranco thus continuing the study of painting in its most finished and perfect style almost up to the present time  the influence of this art by this time was felt in remoter countries albert durer began to astonish germany holbens or holbein switzerland and lucas holland france and flanders had their painters and england felt a reflected glow from this warmth that diffused itself through the continent which kindled soon into a fire under the influence of sir thomas more who introduced holbein to henry the eighth this introduction was very striking and exhibits a certain proof that before that time painting had arrived to no perpection in england sir thomas more invited the king to an entertainment and in the great hall of his house hung up all the favorite pictures of holbein disposed in the most advantageous situations they could be placed the king was so delighted with the pictures that he requested to know if the artist was alive and if any money would tempt him to reside in his court this was the effect sir thomas wished the pictures to produce holbein was introduced to the king who took him into his service and recommended him to the nobility and thus it is that we have so many original paintings of holbein in this country   after the arrival of holbein painting began to be better known in england and during the reign of elizabeth the names and productions of hemskirk who studied at rome and modelled himself upon the italian school and who though not very deservedly was called the raphael of holland and breugel whose drawings are said to be so correct that they cannot be copied began to be known  elsheimer whose pictures are generlly small landscapes histories or candlelight pieces with figures and which are so remarkable for the prodigious labors and pains he bestowed upon them that they are so highly esteemed as only to be found in the cabinets of princes was also a name that found its way into the court of elizabeth  but otho venius the master of rubens brought the taste of the english for painting much forwarder than it has been before he studied at rome particularly under zuchero and afterward returned to antwerp where he ornamented the principal churches with his paintings he had many tempting offers both from france and england to leave his native country but could never be prevailed upon they were therefore obliged to be content with his pictures which it may be easily conceived as they formed rubens were admirable objects of imitation for the painters of a country in which the art was yet in its infancy as to its native artists  that it was known however and that very universally cannot be doubted for we are generally given to understand that no less than fifteen thousand flemish artists of different descriptions were settled in london at the death of henry the eighth and as at the head of the painters we have seen holbein the principal support at that time of the flemish school it is impossible but the art of painting must have been greatly admired and of course imitated  this importation of flemish artists continued throughout the whole reign of elizabeth and by this means at second hand the english had the satisfaction of becoming acquainted with the works of guido titian julio romano and corregio and as many noblemen and ambassadors had also imported pictures from italy neither raphael nor his cotemporaries were altogether unknown in england  chap x music having already taking up the subject of guido aretine with a view to show that his discoveries were the improvement not the invention of music i shall now speak of that theme on which i always dwell with so much pleasure by watching its progress onward from that period to the death of of elizabeth there are four great men of the name of aretine the first guido is this inventor of music as he has been called the second leonard was celebrated for eloquence and had these words for an epitaph since the death of leonard history is in mourning eloquence is become mute the greek and latin muses cannot forbear shedding tears the third francis was a great teacher and such an expounder of law that he was called the prince of subtilties he had such a vivacity of genius that his wit became a proverb the fourth peter was famous for his satirical writings he was so bold as to venture invectives against kings and it was on this account that he got the title of the scourge of princes he picqued himself on his lampoons and said that they did more good to the world than sermons and this judgment as his satire kept morality in view obtained but it at last led him into licentiousness which proved fatal to him and thus his enemies gained a complete triumph over him for being delighted with some obscene and immoral conversation he was seized with such a violent fit of laughter that overturning the chair on which he sat he fell upon his head and received such a blow that he died upon the spot   i have shown already that music is very ancient in this country but that there may be no contest as to what it was any where before aretine or in what manner its influence was conveyed to the heart i shall now only take it up from his time and keep to this spot except any allusions should be necessary to throw a light on the subject  christianity introduced music into england in tracing the progress of choral music in this country says bid it is worthy of remark that as it was first established in the cathedral of canteraury when the first of the roman singers settled on the conversion of the english to christianity so that choir for a series of years produced a succession of men distinguished for their excellence in it among these theodore the archbishop and adrian the abott his friend and coadjutor are particularly noted  thus music gained onward to william the conqueror for this original establishment of music at canterbury was in the eighth century in the reign of that monarch lived a man named osbern though bale places him a century backwarder to whom is attributed as much as to aretine nay this author says that aretine was only his follower this man was much favored by lanfranc bishop of canterbury and is spoken of as one profoundly skilled in the science of music he left behind him a treatise which has thrown many new lights on harmony but it is so crude indigested and abstruse that like many other things on that subject it were better that it had never been written  there can be no doubt however that except the native and wild melodies which were the characteric of the national music here as they were every where else that what was called music scientifically was little more than the gregorian chant so often mentioned and which certainly made up the essence of the recitative of lully  st bernard who lived in the twelfth century has endeavored to simplify this species of music and as he calls it correct the folly of those who depart from the rules of melody he complains as any man of taste would do who lives at this day of the foppery and irregularity of teachers who promulgate absurdity and consecrate error but says he they say it is done by a kind of musical license what sort of license is this which walking in the region of dissimilitude introduces confusion and uncertainty the mother of presumption and the refuge of error i say what is this liberty which joins opposites and goes beyond natural land marks and which as it imposes an inelegance on the composition offers an insult to nature  this man who knew and felt that nothing seconds devotion like music did not wish that the priests should introduce schisms for the ears any more than for mind indeed his labors were indefatigable to root out imposition in both neither however succeeded to his wish though in both he wrought some reform but imposition is the essence of professors of sciences as well as of religion and while by deception money may be got little conscience will be made of passing off fallacy for truth and art for nature  music was in the thirteenth century so favorite a topic that it employed the pens of many eminent authors walter monk of evesham a man as well of lively wit as of sincere devotion for these qualities are certainly not incompatible wrote a sensible work which he called of the speculation of music the celebrated roger bacon who was complimented on account of his extaaordinary talents with the title of magician under a general belief that his transcendant abilities must have been supernatural and whose brazen head has so often infused terror into the minds of the ignorant that he might leave no science untreated wrote a work which he called de valor musices  simon tailler a dominican and a scotchman johannes pediasimus and several others were also at this period musical writers but it would be trivial to notice more than that it was a part of the clerical duty to know the principles of harmony and this clearly proves in what manner the clerks who exhibited at clerkenwell came to be qualified to represent the mysteries which consisted of singing as well as dialogue  but this is not all music was not only known to the laity but taught them by the churchmen who very sensibly and properly softened the more rigorous duties of religious worship by permitting innocent relaxations of this kind especially among the youthful part of both sexes who very naturally and laudably indulged in that vivacity which softened their labor and taught them to know content  thus such songs and ballads as suited their situations and talents in england as in every other country became the delight and the solace of the wretched the luxury of the indolent and the relaxation of the thrifty all which were proof necessary might be traced back to very remote times but we have no time nor occasion for the search  to show however that nothing could be more common and familiar than music it made up the delight of the people in the fourteenth century the carpenters wife in chaucers millers tale is courted to the music of the sautrie by her lover nicholas the scholar of oxford her other lover absolon the parish clerk sings to his geterne and his ribible all this has been remarked by an ingenious author who says if so many arts were necessary to win the heart of a carpenters wife what musical accomplishments must be requisite to gain the affections of females in higher life  camden speaks of the music of these times and notices that the poetry which was evidently comic and which he calls bobbing rhimes though they were levelled at the vices of the clergy were written by clergymen he tells us of walter de masses and says that though in the reign of henry the second he filled all england with his meriments he was archdeacon of oxford so that poets of all descriptions very sensibly contributed to the public amusement by courting the best possible assistance their writings could profit by  in the fifteenth century these ditties were multiplied into a prodigious number chaucers ballads of which he composed many were in great vogue as were also those of lydgate and other writers john shirley in the year    0 made a large collection of these which were published under the title of a book cleped the abstracte brevyaire compyled of diverse ballades roundels virilays tragedyes envoys complaints moralityes stories practysed and eke devysed and ymagined as it shows here following collected by john shirley  it is imagined that the tunes of these songs are all lost but i cannot be induced to believe it and i should not wonder on the contrary if many of them were familiar to us at this moment who knows the origin derry down oh ponder well and many others which will never be forgot we know that in some of the madrigals which were composed in this and the following century the italian school in its highest prosperity never produced any thing either for melody or harmony more beautiful  the earliest authority it is acknowledged that we have of a positive tune and the name of its composer is to a song of chaucer beginning i have a lady it was composed by cornysh in the reign of henry the eighth but this weighs nothing with me when i consider that one of the sweetest combinations of melody and harmony that ever adorned the sweetest of all studies was composed as nearly as possible to that very time i cannot be awake and believe that music even in that reign was not in the highest perfection or at least that there were not composers that unconsciously excelled the productions of italy for it is impossible to deny that it is a higher compliment to the reputation of a composer to be known by how merrily we live the glee that i allude to than by the most abstruse church composition that ever was composed  it is not therefore certain because we know of no tunes written down and handed forward that we are not in possession of them there cannot be a doubt but nurses and other common people have learned them of one another from time immemorial and by the same token when the beautiful melodies which are now our favorites shall be sung familiarily and with pleasure two hundred years hence by all those who have hearts and ears it will be little conjectured that they owe the delight they receive to purcell arne and boyce  according to this i dont care for what is treasured up i care for what is universally known and my reason particularly is that what is treasured up is scientific and what is universally known is natural one is ingenuity and the other genius one art and the other nature and thus upon the same principle that oral tradition has done much more for history than record so memory must infallibly have done more for music than notation and if i am asked having no chronicled proof of this assertion how i can maintain it i shall answer that the fact is as unerring as any orher fixed criterion in nature and that though i did not see the sun shine two hundred years ago i can with safety insist that his beams were as radiant and his career as glorious as at this moment  at the same time i do not blame the diligence of those who have taken pains to ascertain what vestiges there are of ancient music in this country and one of my reasons is that in so doing they may fall in the way of materials that might shame the music of any other country i have given one strong instance of this and shall by and by produce other instances in the mean time that i may not get too forward i shall make some remarks on music in the fourteenth century  it has been well noticed by an ingenious and elegant writer that nothing has given so complete an insight into the character of music at this remote period as the writings of boccace and chaucer the ten tales of boccace contained in his decameron are not only entirely dramatic but of that particular species that might be immediately formed into operas so are the canterbury tales of chaucer the materials are perfectly adapted for music and to show how nearly poetry and music are allied and in their nature bear the same locality the subjects boccace has chosen are elegant and refined such would best suit italian music at that time regular and scientific and those of chaucer common and natural such as suited the plain simplicity of english music in which last character by the bye is sometimes contained a sublimity beyond science  after a plague at florence boccace makes seven ladies of noble birth and honorable principles propose to retire to a distance for fear of infection and to deplore the misfortunes of the times but lest they should too rigidly indulge their melancholy they determine to invite three gentlemen also of birth and honor to accomprny them the scheme is put into execution their little retreat becomes a perfect paradise and among other things to beguile the time they each relate a story  but this is not all we are told that this company sung danced and played upon various instruments and we are given to understand that they introduced the story of palamon and arcite which we may remember so delighted queen elizareth and other novels and that they even called in their servants to personate the clowns and under parts who accompanied themselves with the bagpipe while others played the lute and the viol hence we have clearly the origin of the italian opera  chaucer who went for simplicity as boccace did for elegance chose a more common and more homely vehicle he supposes twentynine persons of both sexes of as different employments and characters as the most fertile imagination could suggest together with himself making in all thirty who set out from the tabarde inn in the borough this inn was formerly the lodging of the abbot of hyde near winchester the sign was a tarbarde a word signifying a short jacket or sleeveless coat whole before open on both sides with a square collar and hanging sleeves stow tells us that from the wearing of this garment some of those on the foundation at queens college are called aberdarii the servants of their respective masters walked in coats of this form in procession from the middle temple to westminster hall at the general call of sergeants in      the host of this inn at the time of chaucer was named baillie his character is admirably drawn and the humor of it greatly heightened by his having a termagant for his wife dryden delights in this idea and says that from the truth and variety thrown into the different descriptions of chaucers characters he was enabled to form an idea of the humors the features nay the very dress of the pilgrims as distinctly as if he had supped with them at the tabarde at southwark  on a pilgrimage to the shrine of st thomas a becket at canterbury among these are a squire his son and his servant a prioress a nun a monk a merchant a clerk of oxford a sergeant at law a haberdasher a carpenter a weaver a dyer a cook a ploughman a miller and other characters equally well contrasted  each of these characters is to tell two tales in the way to canterbury and two on their return they cast lots who shall begin and the first lot falls on the knight who tells the story of palamon and arcite from which edwards took his play which has been already noticed having mentioned drydens own opinion of chaucer it may not be amiss to relate what he says of cowley who never could bear the idea of that great poet with as much wonder as pity dryden says i have often heard the late earl of leicester say that mr cowley was of opinion that chaucer was a dry old fashioned wit not worth receiving and that having read him over at my lords request he declared he had no taste of him perhaps cowley would have liked him if he had introduced a few more expletives the author whose work has put me in mind of this remark of dryden speaks of another circumstance equally as extraordinary which is that handel make no scruple of declaring himself insensible as to the music of purcell that purcell very often rd above handel is a truth but that handel did not taste what he loved and studed cannot be truth perhaps envy represented chaucer to cowley through the veil of affectation and quaintness and purcell to handel through the fog of fugue and counterpoint   in those tales not only the music of those times is particularly described but the names of the instruments are enumerated on which the performers were accustomed to play the lure the rote the fiddle the sautrie the bagpipe the getron the ribible the citole and the flute were instruments in common use spght supposes the rote to signify an instrument used in wals but it has been contended that spght has mistaken the word for cota or crowd d johnson however with the assistance of spencer has let the matter right by showing that it means a harp spencers words are worthy of great ppebus rote the triumph of phlgrean j he wrote that all the go is admired his lofty note   the sautrie is evidently a corruption from psaltery and getron is the cittern and the citole is unquestionably the dulcimer    and from many lines in the prologues to the different stories we learn by what sort of persons these instruments were played upon the prologue to the squires tale says he could songs make and well endite just justs were tilts and tournaments  and eke dance protray and well write so that we find the son of a knight educated in a manner suitable to his birth was able to write dance portray and make verses nay and to add music to his verses if the term to make songs may be so understood and so of the rest it may not be unentertaining to notices that the manner of the time in which chaucer lived are well delineated in these tales we learn from them that a haberdasher a carpenter a weaver a dyer and a maker of tapestry were in the rank of such citizens as had expectation of becoming lord mayor of london and that their wives in consequence were called madams that cooks were great cheats and would dress the same meat more than once that the masters of ships were pirates and made it no case of conscience to steal the wine out of the vessels of their chapmen while they lay asleep that physicians to appear more wise and more incomprehensible made astrology a part of their study that weaving of cloth was a very profitable trade and that there was a manufactory of that kind near bath and that bigotry was so prevalent that even the wife of a weaver would not scruple to make a pilgrimage to rome or jerusalem  but many other instruments were used at that time as may be seen by the following list of performers who attended edward the third five trompettes one cyteler five pipers one tabrete one mabre two clarions one fedeller three waightes  this will be sufficient to show that music in its native simplicity and therefore in its truest beauty was known and admired in the fourteenth century and that in proportion as poetry became familiar it of course called for the assistance of this its auxiliary thus there can be no doubt but we should at this moment be able to ascertain the very airs sung in common from edward the third to henry the eighth many of which i have no doubt we know but are unconscious of their dates were it not that notation was rendered obsolete by the reformation which as it destroyed every vestige of the manuscriptural church music at the dissolution of the monastaries so of course it had no more mercy upon the laical  indeed many other reasons concurred to render ancient notation useless printing though it had gone a very extensive length toward embellishing literature had not yet extended to music every character used for the purpose of rendering sound upon paper had been borrowed from the roman ritual and circulated in manuscript types now set the matter to rights and as every inventor is fond of illustrating his discoveries as amply and variously as possible what wonder of notation should be conveyed with increasing elegance till at last it arrived to the form in which we now see it  on this account those compositions for which english composers have been so celebrated and particularly their madrigals were not made known till early in the sixteenth century that is to say in such a form as to be transmitted on to us for that they were common and in high estimation is indubitable but being written in odd parts without bars and with ligatures it is impossible for us to fix on them so precise a character as to form any judgment of the melodies or the relation the parts have to each other  in this case though we must implicitly give credit to that genius and that knowledge which were as completely known in that early period in england as every where else yet no certainty as to their particular operation can attach to our assertions till henry the eighth who by destroying the convents and with them the books and manuscripts found there obliged music to shift for itself which being a child of nature acquired strength and beauty from that emancipation  we shall be led however by this means to some certainty as to composers in the fifteenth century for not only the madrigals that were invented after the new notation were at that time printed but many of the old ones were made to assume this more perfect form and therefore are preserved even to this day  sumer is icumen a celebrated madrigal for six voices the manuscript of which is now in the british museum was composed about    0 skeleton in the reign of henry the seventh wrote songs which were composed in parts by cornish and many others might be mentioned  franchinus who wrote a work which was printed at milan gives some of the first examples for the improvement of musical notation but these characters were cut out in blocks the germans however improved upon this practice and that art seems to have arrived to something like perfection about the year   00 so that this improvement seemed ready for the use it was put to afterward in england but it came to no perfection till about    0 when a very industrious man of the name of john day published the church service in four and three parts his labors were a good deal accelerated by sterhold and hopkins who in addition to the novelty of introducing their new version of the psalms brought forth the cantiones of tallis and bird two names of sufficient consequence to show the reputation of music at that time their anthems at this moment being held very highly in esteem as to their ingenuity admitted among the common cathedral stock and as well known as the works of any other church composers the history of psalmody at that time sets us perfectly clear as to the nature of the melodies then known and admired in england the psalm tunes or at least many of them came from the germans and when sternhold and hopkins published their version with the tunes set forth in types they from them and from the english composers got together a great number of those tunes these up to this moment fix the criterion of that melody which is the most simple the most impressive and the most sublime because it consists of a few notes and nothing can be advanced to invalidate the antiquity of those tunes because the best in the collection the hundredth psalm was composed by martin luther and is literally a melody derived from inspiration and clogged with no extraneous harmony but merely assisted by such modulation as the melody itself dictated so that as far as it goes we see the utmost of musical perfection in luther for i will venture to say that we might name fifty musicians and some that we have heard praised too whose works altogether in point of intrinsic merit are not equal in value to the hundredth psalm luther died in        this day most industriously and laudably together with another printer of the name of vautrollier brought to public view whatever could be found of value and therefore i should not wonder though the fact cannot be ascertained that many of the madrigals ascribed to the composers of that time are in fact of a much earlier date  day and vautrollier were succeeded by thomas este who for some reason or other changed his name to snodham bird and morley were afterward granted a patent as sole and exclusive printers of music this patent was assigned to others but printed music came to no perfection except merely as to the form of the notes till it was stamped and engraved the art of printing music with metal types obtained in italy about      and was carried to some perfection by otiavio de petricci and in france it was improved by pierre ballard the germans however were no doubt the inventors of types although music had been long printed in italy with blocks which after all gives the truest idea of music as it is now printed   gathering assistance from printing writers on music were now better enabled to exemplify their arguments and in consequence we became more familiar with them and their works musicians took their degrees at the universities and their merit was known and decided german and italian productions spread over europe and it became then a positive and fixed point as it has ever since remained that italy was the school for vocal music and germany the school for instrumental music  england in addition to its own native melodies which like the minds of its inhabitants facinate by their open and unaffected manner of appealing to the heart adopted whatever might serve to assist music from foreign aid and it has ever been a rule with all real musical judges that the vocal music of this country has received advantage from the italian school and the instrumental from the german and that whenever the contrary has been attempted which has happened but too often to the creation of schisms and controversies out of number taste has been vitiated and nature and the heart have been sacrificed at the shrine of affectation and caprice  the works of aron ramis agricola and other german writers have dived into all the perplexity of harmony agricola in particular so lost himself in his own labyrinth that in the republication of his famous work called musica instrumentales he confesses to a friend that the first edition was so difficult to be understood that few could read it to any advantage and yet this author is said to have written for young beginners he would not however have apologized to his friend if he had lived in these times for the practice still prevails and young beginners are set down to study what nobody can understand without any apology at all but the best part of the story is that this abstruse treatise published for the use of young beginners which the author confesses that few could understand is written in verse it is a pity while he was about it but he had set it to music and so joined impossible precept with impracticable example  the italians who were celebrated in the sixteenth century have left behind them several works of considerable reputation zarlino palestrina marenzio nanino and anerio are among this number and to show that the fascinating power of music can level all distinctions the prince di venosa was musical rival and competitor to sethus calvisius the son of a peasant salinas and morales though both spaniards as they knew nothing but what they imbibed from the italian school ought properly speaking to be classed with the italian writers  zarlino who was born in    0 was intended by his parents for some learned profession and by nature for any study of which the human mind is capable but music bounded his ambition he was maestro di capella of st marks church and composed several celebrated things and in particular the rejoicings at venice upon the defeat of the turks at lepanto  by having possessed much good sense and treasured up a fund of general knowledge zarlino feit himself more competent to speak on the subject of music than any writer of his time and this is clearly proved by what he has given to the world for he has entered into no pityful controversies but gone at large into his theme he at once traces music back to the greeks and from the greeks to nature its original parent and thus while he shows as much competency to argue as boethius and all the other latin and italian writers he adds arguments of his own to show that the dignity of music is derived from its simplicity  galilei the pupil so zarlino set himself up against his master calling him the corrupter of music and zarlino answered galilei in a strain of cool irony in which he calls him his loving disciple the question in dispute was concerning the division of tones which it would be both improper and unnecessary to explain here the essence of the argument was that zarlino was an advocate for nature and his pupil for art and it is remarkable that the partisans on each side have settled the question in favor of music and zarlino one by the strength and the other by the weakness of their arguments the first of which has obtained to this day and the latter long sunk into oblivion  salinas whose soul was music wrote very warmly on his favorite theme the misfortune is that music is so extensive an expression that you may apply it to any thing and thus by stretching the qualities it really possesses its admirers out of zeal attempt to fit them to what they cannot embrace thus at length they quit music for proportion and at last proportion for calculation so that sound without which there cannot be music is put out of the question and the argument becomes a mere wrangle upon paper  salinas was blind and he gives this as the reason for devoting himself to music his own words are from my very infancy i devoted myself to to the study of music for as i had sucked in blindness from the infected milk of my nurse and there remaining not the least hope that i should ever recover my sight my parents could think of no employment so proper for me as that which was now suitable to my situation as the learning necessary for it might be acquired by the sense of hearing that other best servant of a soul endued with reason  palestrina took a likely career to become a good musician not for scholars but for the world for he studied under a singer in the pontifical chapel who established a school for vocal music and thus having originally imbibed melody he made it the ground work of all his studies  this great genius says an italian author guided by a peculiar faculty the gift of god adopted a style of harmony so elegant so noble so learned so easy and so pleasing both to the connoiseur and the ignorant that in a mass comcomposed on purpose sung before pope marcellus cervinus and the sacred college of cardinals he made that pontiff alter the intention he had of enforcing the bull of john the twentysecond which abolished entirely church music under the penalty of excommunication this ingenious man by his astonishing skill and the divine melody of that mass was appointed by paul the fourth perpetual composer and director in the pontifical chapel a dignity which has been vacant ever since his death this mass was now and ever will be performed as long as there is a world in the sacred temples at rome and at all other places where they have been so fortunate as to procure the compositions of such a wonderful genius whose works breathe divine harmony and enable us to sing in a style so truly sublime the praises of our maker  palestrina no doubt carried into better effect the idea of zarlino taking simplicity and nature for his guide and i think there can be but little doubt that from this period the italian and german schools adopted the studies which have since separately distinguished them palestrina having in his works cured the italians of obstruseness by exposing the corrupt errors of the germans who having little genius substituted art for nature and they conscious of their inability having quietly acquiesced in the decision and contented themselves with phlegmatic harmonies squared and calculated divested of melody and therefore like a body without a soul while rich melody and the simple and dignified harmony that naturally belongs to it marked the productions of the italians  nanino was a fellow student of palestrina they between them established a school for the study of music which was frequented by many eminent professors and particularly by a younger brother of nanino who distinguished himself as a wonderful genius nanino the elder published some very fine madrigals  anerio a disciple of nanino was the immediate successor of palestrina as composer to the pontifical chapel the office of director having died with its exclusive possessor his professional character stood very high and he as well as velettri pontio vecchi and others produced many musical compositions of great celebrity  but of all the italian composers in the sixteenth century marenzio is most generally known to us many of whose madrigals were adapted to english words and published by thomas watson in      in a work called musica transalpina among these are farewell cruel and unkind what does my pretty darling sweet singing amaryllis and i must depart all hapless with marenzio i shall finish this summary account of the italian and german schools although there are are more than ninety other names behind of much celebrity  it is remarkable that except italy germany flanders and england music had made no considerable progress in the sixteenth century spain had produced only morales and salinas and these were fairly of the italian school and in france we hear of de prez mouton crequillon and claude but nothing is known of them worthy of being recorded  in england tie bird bull and dowland were long in such high estimation that it has been contended they were equal to the best musicians of any country marbeck however was the earliest of the english composers of any considerable eminence who after having narrowly escaped the stake for heresy or according to fox after having actually suffered he became indesatigable to reform music with religion indeed the cathedral musical service of the church of england was originally framed by marbeck and the notes of the preces suffrages and responses as they are at this day were of his composition  tie was brought up in the chapel royal and musical preceptor to the children of henry the eighth he was a man of learning and after taking the degree of doctor in music at cambridge was incorporated a member of the university of oxford he was afterward organist to the chapel royal of elizabeth and was the first who composed anthems  this was occasioned by a kind of accident he set the acts of the apostles to music but the subject being principally narrative and relation it clearly had nothing to do with music and therefore did not succeed correcting his error he then turned his thoughts to such words in scripture as might answer his purpose and recollecting that the psalms of david are full of that thanksgiving and that ebullition of the heart which music is so particularly calculated to express he made some essays in this way which were not only received with great encomiums by their hearers but they have served ever since as a model for the imitation of composers in that style  wood speaking of tie says his music was antiquated and of very little value but boyce with the true liberality of a real genius refutes this calumny in the best possible way by publishing one of his anthems i will exalt thee which for melody harmony expression contrivance and general effect is a perfect model of church composition  tallis followed tie he composed wholly for the church indeed he has been called the father of the cathedral style and considered by some as a better composer than palestrina who as we have seen was his cotemporary this however must not be allowed no man could be more original than tallis as we are told but this is not the proper expression unless originality may be defined an improvement on the labors of others for tallis built his music upon the foundation of the old english cathedral composers and the germans all of whom he excelled but this cannot be considered as that sort of originality which palestrinas biographer properly calls the gift of god and thus it is that while tallis was lost in the ancient modes designated by euclid and ptolemy which are now exploded palestrina was inspired with the melody of nature which will last for ever  bird in the earlier part of his life wholly composed church music but when madrigals became to be so greatly in vogue that no person was esteemed fashionable who could not take a part in them at sight morley in his introduction makes a scholar give this reason for learning music being at a banquet says he supper being ended and music books according to custom being brought on the table the mistress of the house presented me with a part and earnestly requested me to sing but when after many excuses i protested unfeignedly that i could not every one began to wonder yea some whispered to others demanding how i was brought up so that for shame of mine ignorance i now go to seek mine old friend master gnorimus to make myself his scholar  he conformed to the taste of the times to confirm this the first of his publications was called psalms songs and sonets of sadness and piety and his last songs and sonets some solemn others joyful formed to the life of the words  besides madrigals and merry sonnets bird seems to have been the first who composed lessons for the virginals which consisted of nothing more than variations on well known country dances so that the modern practice of composers who adopt the melodies of others because they have no invention themselves have done nothing new in palming this second hand ware upon their scholars  it was meritorious enough however in bird for his business at that early time was to bring simple melodies into fashion and thus we see ladies of quality patronizing familiar music till by and by it grew so simplified that many of those beautiful airs which we now admire in the beggars opera fixed the criterion of the english taste  in a collection of these lessons which were dedicated to lady neville and composed for her use and which we are told though produced at that early period are very difficult to execute he has rung the changes on st ledger or as it is commonly called sellengers round have with you to walsingham the world runs on wheels packington pound and some others all which together with his two celebrated madrigals la verginella e simile un rosa and this sweet and merry month of may show that bird must have done a great deal toward polishing the general taste for music  after all however church music and works of the learned cast were principally the favorite study of bird though except in a few instances posterity will have more obligations to him for his lighter compositions notwithstanding many learned opinions to the contrary his service which with a diligence honorable to himself and his profession was preserved by boyce and some other compositions are greatly creditable to this composer  but the production that has established the reputation of bird i hope upon a right foundation is the famous canon non nobis domine the italians positively say that it is the composition of palestrina it is allowed on all hands that it has been long deposited in the vatican library and those who argue on this side of the question maintain their position by saying that the subject was wrought into a concerto and published at amsterdam by carlo ricciotti with a note mentioning that the fugue is taken from a canon of palestrina now unfortunately this concerto is extant and the fugue is worked from non nobis domine and if the general ideas of an ingenious man may be adduced as evidence in his favor the composition of palestrina beginning sicut cervus desiderat and the canon in question seem to have emanated from the same mind  on the side of bird it is argued that hilton has positively published this canon as his and dr pepusch whose researches certainly were very diligent and useful has ascribed it to him in a very unqualified manner and besides this collateral proof has been brought that it was the natural bent of birds disposition and that though he did now and then make variations upon country dances to oblige lady neville church music and compositions of the more serious kind were his best delight and what he was most qualified for they are however obliged to allow that it was never published in any of his works which as it is so admirable a composition is not only unfortunate but rather extraordinary and thus it remains a moot point whether bird or palestrina was the composer of non nobis domine  i shall next mention ferabosco who though of italian parents was born in england morley speaks very highly of his merit and says that he and bird had many friendly trials of skill in music in two instances ferabosco bore away the palm one of these begins with the words the nightingale so pleasant and so gay and the other i saw my lady weeping  indeed english music has many obligations to this man his son and another of his family many of our best melodies which pepush so judiciously selected for the beggars opera are supposed to have arisen from that source and those in the minuet style in particular have so simple and pure an elegance that as long as there is a world as palestrinas panegyrist says that world will be delighted with them  blitheman whom stow in his survey not only has thought it worth his while to mention by name but of whom he has printed the epitaph at length was also celebrated at this time but more as a teacher than a composer the whitest feather however in his wing was his being preceptor to dr bull whose christian name by the bye was john he was a celebrated musician admitted first as bachelor of music at oxford afterward as doctor at cambridge and at length appointed organist of the queens chapel  bull was the first gresham professor of music being however as his christian name bespeaks him a plain englishman he was unable to read his lectures in latin the queen therefore gave him an especial permission to deliver them in english for which she has been ridiculed under an absurd idea that if he did not know latin he could not know music  john still like a true englishman traveled for improvement and having heard of a famous musician at st omers he placed himself under him as a novice but he soon found as is generally the truth in such cases that he knew more than his master among other proofs of this the musician showed him a song that he had composed in forty parts telling him at the same time that he would defy all the world to produce any person capable of adding another part to his composition bull desired to be left alone and to be indulged for a short time with pen and ink and in less than three hours added forty parts more to this song upon which the frenchman swore in a great extacy that he must be either the devil or john bull  whether the musician had heard of the story of erasmus and sir thomas more or whether as it has happened in many other cases he felt the influence of john bulls superiority has not exactly been ascertained but the historian insists that though a priest upon bulls making himself known he actually fell down and adored him  dowland of whom shakespeare speaks in one of his poems was a good composer and a famous player on the lute he was a great traveller and his passion being music he brought back the taste of other countries into this and thus added some variety to the lighter compositions which were then the delight of all societies  peter philips who because he studied abroad italianized his name into pietro philippi was considered as an admirable musician he certainly improved the english taste by sending over airs from italy indeed england was greatly obliged to these ramblers for by importing now and then a little of the italian taste they better guarded their countrymen against the incursions of the germans whose arithmetical music sometimes gained ground to the corruption of that truth and nature which in this country was at that time really felt and understood  morley who was a pupil of bird wrote a treatise on music through which we get a good deal at the professors and admirers of that art and their abilities and taste it is written dialoguewise and in the course of the conversations between the interlocutors many particulars occur relative to the times which clearly show the merit of music and the estimation it was then held in  morley intends this treatise for reproof as well as instruction for knowing the inconvenience of studying scientifically as it is called how much it bewilders the imagination and makes that a toil which only ought to be a pleasure he warns his scholars against venturing too far what would you learn says the master the scholar says he has heard a friend of his who is the best descanter in the world and begs he may be taught descant the master answers that it will require time and patience that the word is hardly defined and in short does what he can to dissuade him from it but to no purpose descant was the foppery of music then just as cadence and the falcetto are now and nothing will satisfy the scholar but descant  what occasioned this treatise was the madrigal which was held in such estimation that it was a reproach as we have seen before not to know how to take a part in it cards and games of chance were at that time totally unknown and without reproach to the present day music was certainly a very inoffensive substitute at least thus innumerable collections of these madrigals were given to the world by their respective authors and this emulation in the very way that was likely to make music generally known and admired fixed its reputation  morley is very properly severe on all those innovators who conscious of their own ignorance endeavor to prevent the true and natural operation of music thus they go on says he giving true definitions and false examples the example still importing the contrary to that which was said in the definition but this is the world every one will take upon him to write and teach others none having more need of teaching than himself he finishes his treatise with an account of thirtynine different composers who had flourished before and at the time of the reformation  after these which i have mentioned followed other musicians of eminence bathe wrote a treatise in which he did good toward the measurement of music weeks and mundy composed mandrigals which are yet known farnaby was a composer of some credit and milton the father of our celebrated epic poet was from nature a musician there are many things extant of his composition among the rest the celebrated psalm tune called the york the melody of which is so well known that half the nurses in the kingdom says an author have constantly used it as a lullaby and the chimes of many country churches have played it from time immemorial  bateson wylbie bennet farmer and about thirteen others also composed and published madrigals at the head of which set ought to be placed orlando gibbons and michael este whose particular merits may be resorted to by a perusal of several collections of madrigals and in particular the triumphs of oriana which was published in   0   chap xi scotch and irish music having so far digressed to speak of english music i shall i hope be pardoned if i take this opportunity of saying something on the subject of scotch and irish music in which i shall take up as briefly as possible some of these arguments which have been held out with a view to ascertain their origin and add the best conjectures i have been able myself to form on the subject  the common opinion as to the music of scotland is that it was brought over from italy by rizzio this cannot be altogether true and yet i can see nothing to convince me that it is altogether false those who write in favor of this argument say that rizzio being retained in the service of the unfortunate mary as a musician and finding the music of the country capable of improvement he set himself down to give it polish and refinement keeping still in view as far as he could without trenching on the rules of art that immethodical and crude melody which he found in the country  against this it has been urged that the authority for the above assertion rests merely on tradition and that there is much written proof to refute it that sir james melvil who knew rizzio personally says he was nothing more than a merry fellow and a good musician that he was drawn in sometimes to sing with the valets of the queen and on that account when her french secretary retired to france rizzio was appointed secretary in his place  melvil is obliged to allow however that rizzio engrossed the favor of the queen that he was suspected of being a pensioner to the pope and that by the part he took in all public transactions he gave rise to the troubles of scotland and precipitated the ruin of his mistress  buchanan confirms all this and indeed goes more at large into the subject and from these premises it is inferred that the ambitious and intriguing spirit of rizzio left him neither inclination nor opportunity for study and therefore that it was very unlikely he should attempt a reformation or improvement of the scotch music especially as he had only two years to perform the task in  to answer these arguments as far as they have gone it must be confessed there is nothing yet advanced to show that rizzio did not improve the music of scotland if melvil who speaking of his superficial character finds him only a merry fellow and a good musician is obliged to allow that he had this intriguing spirit that he was a pensioner of the pope and that he in great measure occasioned the troubles of scotland is it very unlikely that his command over the queen arose from the opportunities he had of administering to her pleasures one of which was music buchanan says that he became absorbed in the intrigues of the court and rose to the highest degree of favor and confidence in the management of which power he behaved with such arrogance and contempt as to render himself odious to all about him  during all this time however we do not find that he quitted his favorite lure which little agreed with favor confidence and power he was still a singer of madrigals and scotch songs and he was even at this employment when he was dragged from the queen and assasinated  but to go further with this examination it is insisted on that the origin of the scotch melodies are to be derived from a higher source than rizzio without having recourse to the italians at all i shall tread this ground a little though i fancy we shall not find it very firm for the first position in which we shall be obliged to stand will be rather awkward and what is worse dangerous  we are told to believe an italian writer who roundly asserts that some of the finest vocal music this country can boast of owes its merit in a great measure to its affinity with that of scotland he might have added and vice versa because none but exotic beauties are ever transplanted this argument is sustained by a relation that john the archchanter from rome settled among the northumbrians and the propensity of that people to music whose sequestered situation and the little intercourse they must be supposed to have held with the adjacent countries will account for a style of music perfectly original and which might in process of time extend itself to the neighboring kingdom  thus an italian archchanter who never in his life had heard a note of scotch music comes midway between england and scotland delights the sequestered inhabitants with a new kind of music he had brought with him italian of course and we are desired from this very clear account given also by an italian to believe that not only the music he taught was natively scotch but that it spread itself into england and improved the music there  the real fact is evident and stares us in the face this archchanter to whom both nations are very much obliged perfect in the principles of zarlino and palestrino improved both the native melodies of the english and the scotch which sufficiently required it and which could not take a brighter polish than from the italian school  a higher and more rational authority makes james stuart the first of his name and the hundred and second in the list of the kings of scotland author and composer of scotch songs buchanan says that he was skilled in music more than was necessary or fitting for a king for there was no instrument on which he could not play so well as to contend with the greatest masters of the art in those days  that james was a poet is universally agreed and among many other authorities alessandro tassoni has this passage in a work of his upon various subjects we may reckon among the modern musicians james king of scotland who not only composed sacred poems set to music but also of himself invented a new melancholy and plaintive kind of music different from all other in which he has been imitated by carlo gesualdo prince of venosa who in these our times has improved music with new and admirable compositions  now here is fairly a reciprocal intercourse between the scotch and the italian music even back to the middle of the fifteenth century when this polished king could not be unknown to the family of medicis or they to him what does all this say but that music as well as every other study is originally vernacular every where but like intelligence of every kind it acquires perfection by intercourse  james did not invent scotch music nor did the archchanter nor did rizzio that is to say the music which we at this moment call scotch the original music in scotland has been simply but practically defined by every master who has by way of a trick taught his scholar to hop over the sharps and the slats of a harpsichord the accidental wildness with which this experiment impresses you i have no doubt gives a tolerably correct idea of the state of the scotch music as it was found by james who having natural taste and an intercourse with courts refined it in some degree after him comes john the archchanter who rubs off a few more of the hardnesses and at length rizzio who was an italian musician and the son of an italian musician and he adds a new foreign polish in compliment to a queen who loved every thing that was foreign and who was at that moment intriguing with foreign courts  thus i come to my first position that the assertion of rizzios have brought what is called scotch music from italy is not altogether true nor altogether false the tunes which are best acknowledged and most admired are clearly a mixture of scotch and italian have tweed side or lass of paties mill any thing in them of skipping from sharps to flats nothing at all they are simple beautiful flowing melodies that though grounded on the scotch character are treated in the italian style which has benefited music all over the world and will be ever the regulation for elegance in the hands of composers but of those alone who know to make use of italian principles and not destroy the native character of music in their own country  as to the irish music there is no doubt but its native wildness has been in the same manner corrected by the introduction of italian improvement which it seems to receive in even a more congenial manner than the scotch lango lee and the dargle are as melodies perhaps equal to any thing in the world but no one will assert that any thing so beautifully perfect so satisfactory to the mind can possibly be natively irish crude and indigested yet the irish character is so evident that without it all the true beauty of the air would be lost  it would be extremely easy to show by instancing a number of airs how the english and scotch style have been mixed together the scotch and irish the irish and the english and sometimes all three and with the same facility might it be made evident that the italian style has pervaded them all but the attempt has hardly ever been undertaken by any man of real genius  thus having by way of illustrating my primary subject a trespass for which i hope i shall be pardoned shown the state of the arts in england at the death of elizabeth when science commerce and legislation were at their highest pitch of grandeur when divinity borrowed luster from toleration when law underwent regulation when history adopted perspicuity when poetry was the result of genius when philosophy acquired sublimity when painting fled to england as to an asylum and music humbly tendered its mite to make up this weight of perfection in short when such men as bacon shakespeare spencer coke and raleigh dignified their country i shall next proceed to show how far this accumulation of extraordinary talents served for an example to dramatic writers in the succeeding reign  end of the fifth book book vi from the death of elizabeth to the death of james chap i beaumont and fletcher having seen how completely shakespeare soared above all competition while he had only jonson chapman marloe marston and the rest to encounter in the reign of elizabeth let us see how well he kept his ground when in addition to these he had to cope with beaumont and fletcher massinger and other authors who were candidates for dramatic fame during thirteen years of the reign of james the first at the end of which time the world had the misfortune to lose our incomparable bard a calamity which would have been irreparable had not posterity lain its proud claim to his wonderful productions  beaumont and fletcher with many fair pretensions to theatrical reputation never could fix a foundation solid enough to establish that sort of fame which commands legitimate suffiage upon the spot and challenges the award of posterity they were rather amateurs than writers rather gentlemen than professors yet has the stage many obligations to them which shall be faithfully enumerated  beaumont who was well born and educated was certainly a man of great talents and sound judgment which however would have been more manifest in his works had not his career been all speed without rest he died in      a year before the world lost shakespeare at which time he had not attained his thirtieth year and yet between   0  and that time a space of only eight years he was concerned as we are told with fletcher in fiftythree plays  fletcher was also well born and educated he was ten years older than beaumont and lived ten years longer but he does not seem to have written any thing material either before or after his literary connection with that gentleman for in all we know of the works of these partners in fame only a single piece was written by each that by beaumont was called the masque of grays inn and that by fletcher the faithful shepherdess  the share each took in their joint labors has been pretty well ascertained beaumont who though the youngest man had the soundest judgment formed and digested the plots wrote the more interesting and serious parts and pruned the luxuriancies of which there seems to have been sufficient need for even at this moment when a revival of one of their plays is attempted it is obliged to be cut even to mutilation there is a well known anecdote which proves that fletcher had sometimes a hand in forming their plots as well as beaumont having concerted the plan of a tragedy over a bottle they settled which part of the play they should respectively take which being perfectly adjusted well said fletcher it shall be so you manage the rest and i will undertake to kill the king these words being overheard by the waiter they were presently surrounded and made prisoners but their characters being well known and their having it in their power easily to prove that they only meditated the assasination of a theatrical monarch the whole went off as a jest   taken as dramatic productions the works of beaumont and fletcher can only be considered as having a partial claim to reputation they have strong particular merit but taking them altogether there is scarcely a play but is extravagant wild and ill managed most of the plots are spanish and seems as if they thought that when they had lopped off part of the luxuriance of lopez de vega they had done enough whereas they should not have left a twig but have let the new shoots have gained their strength by springing at once from the stock  this however was not the case fletcher not only added to the extravagance of the spaniard wild and excentric wit of his own but perpetually tinctured it with obscenity and the operation has been that whenever the manners at any period since that time have been loose and profligate beaumont and fletcher have been the reigning favorites witness the estimation in which they were held in the reign of charles the second when an indelible disgrace to that monarch and his court they obtained even to the exclusion of shakespeare but let us take a cursory review of their works  the woman hater a comedy which appeared in   0  is a play of some merit it is strange that two writers should start with a piece the principal character in which if it is not ought to be out of nature beaumont is supposed to have been almost wholly the author of this production it was pretty successful both when it came out and afterward when it was revived by sir william davenant  the knight of the burning pestle a strange play which has some beauties and a thousand defects was produced in      its grand fault is that like jonson every man out of his humor it was conveyed to the audience through the medium of a grex this play was revived after the restoration with a new prologue spoken by nel gwyn at which time licentiousness was a strong recommendation to public favor but it had never any material success  cupids revenge a tragedy performed by the children of the revels contained some very good poetry but the plot and machinery were so absurd and ridiculous that it had but very indifferent success  the scornful lady a comedy brought out in      is a production of some merit and has more regularity than is generally found in the plays of these authors there is something however very inartificial in the management of the plot and particularly the conversion of morecraft the usurer which is certainly forced and unnatural  king and no king a tragedy performed in      has been variously criticized rymer has handled it very severely for which taking it altogether as a play he had but too much reason dryden has been however less harsh and indeed the general objections against the plays of beaumont and fletcher being the extraneous matter and humor introduced into their plots and the licentiousness of their wit which dryden was obliged a good deal to conform to might occasion him to be as merciful as possible and to separate the moralist from the critic lest in castigating them he should whip himself while rymer who was bound by no such consideration reprobated what was unworthy without hesitation  the maids tragedy produced in      its success both then and since has been reputable it has however so much of that extravagance and irregularity for which these authors are remarkable that it has been a stranger to the stage for many years  thierry and theodoret performed in      this is one of these hetrogeneous compositions of which there are too many in the works of these authors it has ten blemishes for one beauty and upon the whole is poorly constructed and but indifferently written  philaster this tragedy came out in      and added considerably to the reputation of these authors indeed it has always been justly esteemed a work of considerable merit and by many has been thought the best in all the catalogue of their works on this account it has been revived with alterations by the bye at various periods dryden wrote a prologue when it was performed wholly by women at lincoln inn fields and settle rewrote the two last acts and brought it out in      but the best opportunity philaster had for fame and success was when colman altered it to bring forward powell and mrs yates the particulars of which we shall hereafter go into with all these advantages however philaster from its own merit has never been able to keep the stage for reasons of a piece with all the rest because it is full of beauties and defects because there is not one regular simple grand interest excited and because it is ingeniously made up of pieces instead of being one general whole  the two noble kinsmen this play is said to have been written by shakespeare and fletcher a circumstance which the editor of beaumont and fletcher seems to be greatly concerned about probably out of tenderness for the reputation of fletcher but he need not have made himself in the smallest degree uneasy for the play itself sufficiently proves that shakespeare had no hand in it indeed there is not much reputation to be claimed by any body for the story is chaucer s knights tale which we have seen already treated by edwards to the great delight of queen elizabeth there is something however gaudy and fine in it and like most of the works of beaumont and fletcher it resembles a parterre appearing so full of colors that form and symetry are not once thought of this play is said to have been originally produced in      an incongruity that is not very easily reconcilable because beaumont died in      and fletcher in      and yet it is as difficult to believe that the plays produced by these associates were performed during the life time of beaumont or even of fletcher being fiftythree in number and the term for the performance of them being only eight years in the first instance and but eighteen in the last i shall set down the dates however according to the best authorities and these i take to be when they were first published not when they were first performed  the elder brother the date      this play which is originally spanish is strangely and wildly treated by beaumont and fletcher and indeed would have sunk long ago into oblivion had not cibber taken it for one of the plots of his love makes a man a play we shall hereafter examine the ground work is good but the whole merit is due to the original writer  monsieur thomas the date      here we have some clue to set us right as to the time the pieces of beaumont and fletcher were performed but we cannot much rely on any thing we learn of these authors for first we are told that they wrote conjointly all the plays published in their works except the masque of grays inn and the faithful shepherdess we are afterward told that they were assisted by shakespeare by jonson by middleton and other writers and even this play fletcher is said to have written after the death of beaumont there is nothing however in the present instance worth contending for it is a very indifferent play and though published with great care by broom after fletchers death who dedicated it to cotton a great admirer of the author and afterward altered and got up by durfey under the title of trick for trick it never had success my drift is that as this piece was originally brought out after the death of fletcher so very probably many of the other productions were also and this would a good deal invalidate the assertion that beaumont was concerned in so many of those plays writing as they did very often for the moment and being both of them the sort of character not very likely to lay in a store of materials this conjecture however we shall have opportunity more closely to examine as we go on  wit without money the date      this comedy being written with less extravagance and closer to nature than the pieces of these authors in general it has longer kept the stage there is however a flimziness in it that has always prevented it from being attractive the comic muse that presided over the labors of these writers seems to have been one of those ladies who are for ever either sad or in hysterics she seems to be unacquainted with a smile the result of feeling and the recommendation of the heart she is either muzzed with a vapid simper or convulsed with a broad grin and under this influence when these gentlemen have attempted at mere nature they have not been able to preserve the milk in its native state their asperity having turned it by which means their humor is either hard like the curd or mawkish like the whey this play is a proof of it which is well conceived and full of nature but the circumstances are not wrought high enough nor do the characters sufficiently come out of the canvass  rollo duke of normandy the date    0 this tragedy is said to have been received with very great applause when it first appeared it has however been long consigned to oblivion and indeed justly for it is a turgid imitation of seneca and jonson without fancy or spirit or indeed any thing but heavy declamatory dialogue unassisted by force or interest  rule a wife and have a wife the date    0 this play is well known being one of the very few of those written by beaumont and fletcher which are now upon the theatrical stock list intrinsically however this piece is no great acquisition to the theater and it is at the risk of a thin house that it is ever performed unless bolstered up with a new leon or an estifania the plot of this play though admirably imagined is poorly treated there is something very well if it went no further in reclaiming a vain coquette by placing her in the hands of a brave and manly husband but margueretta is an avowed wanton whom it would have been a disgrace to a man of such a description to have married and after all leons claim to these noble qualities is very ill grounded for he is the brother of his wifes waiting maid and he tricks marguerette into the marriage by personating an idiot an art which a man of his spirit and honor would have disdained this has evidently thrown the authors into an unpleasant predicament toward the end of the play for finding it impossible to excuse themselves naturally they try to hush up both the infamy of their heroine and their own want of judgment in a summary way thus after marguetta has played a hundred indecent tricks and endeavored to make her husbands house a brothel with all the forgiving good nature in the world he takes her up and wears her next his heart  the scenes of the copper captain and estifania have a better claim to praise they are highly comic and the equivoque of the house which mixes the episode with the main design is the happiest thing in the piece it is impossible to pass over this article without uniting some degree of pity with contempt at the fond idea of these authors who in caccafogo imagined they had outdone falstaff  the mad lover this play as well as rule a wife and have a wife and all the rest that will now follow were collected into an edition and published in      so that it will be impossible to know when they actually made their first appearance nor is it material  the mad lover which play sir aston cockain has highly commended in a copy of verses is nevertheless a work of but mediocre merit we know but little of its success and indeed it does not appear to have been at any time very familiar with the stage it is partly borrowed from mundus and paulina in josephus  the spanish curate this play is a hetrogeneous jumble in the same style of many others in this collection it has been pruned altered and amended and fitted to the stage frequently by different authors but never with any thing like success and yet there are good materials in it it is taken from the don john and the spanish curate of gerardo  the little french lawyer this comedy is a mixture of the spanish rogue and don lewis de castro and don roderigo de montalva which scarron has also treated in his fruitless precaution and the complaisant companion but this could not have been early enough to have been of any use as some imagine to beaumont and fletcher beaumont having died when scarron was only five years old  the custom of the country this tragiccomedy as it is called has assisted other authors but never did any thing for its own cibber used part of it for love makes a man and charles johnson formed out of it his country lasses it is a strange wild thing but full of good materials its great fault is obscenity dryden says in one of his prefaces by way of answer to those who accused him of indecency there is more baudry in one play of fletcher called the custom of the country than in all ours together yet this has often been acted on the stage in my remembrance  chap ii continuation of beaumont and fletcher the noble gentleman this comedy was little known till it was revived by durfey under the title of the three dukes of dunstable and then it was only stirred up to make its stench more intolerable sir george etheridge in a letter to the duke of buckingham says by my last packet from england among a heap of nauseous trash i received the three dukes of dunstable which is really so monstrous and insipid that i am sorry lapland or livonia had not the honor of producing it but if i did penance in reading it i rejoice to hear that it was solemnly interred to the tune of cat calls  the captain a comedy of very slender merit has been sometimes attempted on the stage but the effort was always so unsuccessful that it has long been lain by as unfit for service  beggars bush what success this play had originally is not known it was altered and brought out under the title of the royal merchant by norris the comedian in   0  and in that state occasionally performed in      it was made into an opera by mr hull the music by mr linley it had no great success but the words and music of some of the songs were again brought forward and introduced into the camp an entertainment performed with great success in      and attributed to mr sheridan but that every bird of parnassus may be allowed his own plumage the songs above mentioned which were considered as indifferently written at covent garden in the royal merchant were found admirable afterward at drury lane in the camp are not the production of mr sheridan but of mr hull  the coxcomb this comedy may rank with the captain its revival has been attempted but to no purpose  the false one this tragedy is founded on cleopatras inconstancy to julius caesar in egypt and taken from suetonius plutarch and other authors who wrote of those times it has some strong writing but upon the whole it is a bad play  the chances this is a comedy borrowed from the lady cornelia of cervantes and has been by various authors altered and brought on the theater the duke of buckinghams alteration was a very judicious one he kept the hurry and perplexity of the plot much more clear than it had been originally but after all it has much more to beget curiosity than to create interest and the indelicacy that pervades the piece and the libertinism throughout the whole character of don john render it a most improper and reprehensible subject for the stage nor could garkicks incomparable performance of this character though he had again weeded it scarcely justify our attention to it  the loyal subject this tragedy is a poor production it would not be worth while to examine it and indeed it has lain so long asleep that it were pity to awake it the laws of candy a tragicomedy by these authors has been a great while in the same situation and so let it remain the lovers progress has no better pretension to our notice it is taken from a french romance called lysander and calista written by daudiguier and to the same peaceful oblivion we may also consign the island princess  the humouous lieutenant this play has been performed at different times with some success the principal part of the plot is taken from plutarchs life of demetrius and the lieutenants refusing to fight after he has been cured of his wounds i the story of luculluss soldier related by horace this is a play of that flighty kind which these authors so frequently produced and is neither full enough of interest or regularity to claim a permanent situation in the theater  nice valor or the passionate madman this comedy is one of the worst pieces in the whole catalogue  the maid in the mill this play has been sometimes revived but its success has never repaid the pains of those who have brought it forward the plot of antonio ismenia and aminta is borrowed from girardo and otrante seizing florimel the supposed daughter of the miller is taken from an italian novel written by bandello which was afterward translated into french there is much good writing in this piece but there is something so radically wrong in its construction that instead of mending it the author as the chairman said to pope had better had made two new ones  the prophetess this tragical history as it is called is founded on the well known story of diociesian to whom it was foretold by a prophetess that he should be emperor of rome when he should have killed a mighty boar which prediction was fulfilled by his putting to death the tyrant aper this extraordinary production has been brought on the stage in a variety of shapes and in particular in the form of an opera by betterton in    0 embellished by purcells music but it has always been sound so undramatic and so little interesting that upon these occasions all the expense has been thrown away  bonduca this queen of icene who was indifferently called by historians bonduca or boadicea has been frequently the subject of a play this of beaumont and pletcher is the earliest and upon the whole the best for it is full of pithy nervous writing and good interest the misfortunes of that ill fated princess being remarkably touching and well calculated for the stage it however has never done any thing material even when it has been judiciously altered mr colman with great judgment and a proper tenderness for the reputation of these authors brought it out on his theater in the haymarket in      but it has been seldom resumed and it is now lain by with but little prospect of being brought forward again  the sea voyage the design of this comedy is borrowed from shakespeares tempest and has in it some good things not good enough however to cope with the original and as if the failure was not disgraceful enough to the authors durfey revived it with alterations which made it ten times worse  the double marriage is a very indifferent play it has been frequently revived but though dufrey lent a hand to spoil it nothing resulted from the attempt but disappointment  the pilgrim this excentric comedy has a great deal of merit it originally received great applause and has been often successfully revived in   00 sir john vanbrugh brought it out at drury lane theater with a prologue and drydens secular masque which was the last of that great poets works but which for what it is abounds with brilliant poetry it was revived again at drury lane without success but about the year      it was brought out at covent garden with considerable reputation since that time it has been very seldom repeated  the womans prize or the tamer tamed this play which is said to have been written by fletcher alone after the death of beaumont so that the reader will see how weak all the authorities are upon this subject is intended as a sequel to shakespeares taming of the shrew catherine being dead petruchio is married to a young woman of a mild and gentle disposition who in conjunction with some female companions determine to break the temper of her husband which is at length effected in consequence of which he blindly submits himself to her will and she rules him as she thinks proper  nothing is so easy as to see that a play cannot be framed upon worse principles the conduct of petruchio though violent is laudable because reasonable submission is not only the duty but ensures the comfort of a wife and therefore a proper subject for a poet to treat blind submission in a husband which must render him ridiculous to his friends and an object of contempt even to his wife is upon the same principle very improper matter for the stage besides the author of this play has wholly mistaken the character of petruchio so far from being of a tyrannical temper he is generous and noble his violence is all put on all assumed and from the moment he has carried his point and restored catherine to herself to him and to her family he doffs the lordly husband time however who as shakespeare says tries all old offenders has settled the dispute for while the tamer tamed lies quietly interred with many of the family catherine and petruchio lives to afford us instruction and amusement  an honest mans fortune part of which is taken from heywoods history of women loves cure and the knight of malta are pieces which help to fill up the catalogue of these authors but though there is some good writing in each of them they have very little claim to dramatic merit to these may be added the queen of corinth which stands in the same predicament  women pleased the subject of this play has employed the pens of many authors three of the different novels of boccace having something to do with it but the ground work is in chaucers wife of baths tale which voltaire has successfully treated under the title of ce qui plait aux dames this was afterward brought on the french stage by favart and called la fee urgelle and and at length taken by garrick for the subject of subject of his christmas tale this is certainly a piece of merit but as the subject has been frequently tried and never to any effect without the auxiliary assistance of scenery and music and indeed romantic and fanciful tales are not at all calculated for comedy which should depict true fair and natural manners women pleased in the state it came out of the hands of beaumont and fletcher has never been fortunate enough to please an audience  a wife for a month this tragicomedy a description which always implies something hetrogeneous has some good traits it is partly borrowed from the history of sancho the eighth of leon the misfortune of this sort of production is that the two plots are so distinct they cannot lend one another interest and take them singly they have not strength enough to support themselves therefore let them be written ever so well they cannot have the effect of a play upon a subject in which if any thing is introduced it is kept subordinate and so constructed as to assist the general design unfortunately this does not happen to be the merit of this play nor indeed scarcely any tragicomedy written by these authors  the fair maid of the inn is a tragicomedy and stands in something like the same predicament as a wife for a month  wit at several weapons in which there is some whim did very little itself but has served as materials for other plays particularly for sir william davenant who borrowed a good deal of it for his play called the wits  valentinian this is a tragedy a species of performance in which beaumont and fletcher have been least successful this tragedy however is said to have been well received when it first came out it has been revived and in particular by lord rochester but it never met with sufficient applause to warrant a repetition of it  loves pilgrimage this comedy partly borrowed from the two damsels of cervantes and partly from the new inn a play of jonson which was damned has some merit with all this assistance however though it has often been brought forward the revivers only awaked it that it might sleep the faster  four plays in one these four pieces the two first of which may be called tragicomedies the third a tragedy and the fourth an opera are principally taken from boccace and are supposed to be performed before manuel king of portugal and his queen isabella at the celebration of their nuptials the court being introduced as spectators and the king and queen making remarks on the representation it is however most probable that this curious medley was never performed at all  the wild goose chase this play has considerable merit but it is like the rest ill conducted the materials however have been found very useful farquhar has borrowed almost four acts of the inconstant from it  these plays the widow the jeweller of amsterdam the faithful friend a right woman and the history of mador king of britain are all said to have been written by these wits either singly together or in conjunction with others but how they were actually employed on them remains a secret which will be probably never divulged nor is it very material whether it be or not  i shall yet employ however a few words upon the subject of these authors whose labors though they may have failed as to regularity and have been weak on the side of judgment are notwithstanding meritorious and breathe in various instances spirit and genius the mistake seems to have been an endeavor to soar beyond what nature qualified them for the genius of shakespeare being extensive enough to grasp at real and imaginary worlds they vainly conceived they might endeavor at the same track but in their fond ness they were ixions and in their presumption phaetons  beaumont is said to have possessed the correctest judgment of the two and fletcher the strongest genius and we are even told that jonson used to submit his works to the opinion and correction of beaumont this however after what we have witnessed of chapman decker and others whom this hard cynic envied and abused it is extremely difficult to believe for if beaumont had such consummate judgment he certainly would have used it in the construction of his own plays the plots of which are the crudest and most indigested that can be possibly be conceived and as to the judgment of jonson it is but justice to say that it was his greatest merit and that there is more good sense in the construction of every man in his humor than in that of all the works of beaumont and fletcher put together  all that is necessary to say on the subject may be comprised in this the industry with which beaumont and fletcher explored the works of the spaniards and others for dramatic materials has been of such benefit to the english stage that it not only lent material assistance toward bringing it into great forwardness but served as a ground work for others who have since derived much of their success from having had recourse to their labors  as to their particular merits they were both good writers and would have been better had they not perpetually tried to go beyond the bounds that nature and genius prescribed them had they not written too hastily had they not given into an unbridled wit which grew to licentiousness and destroyed the legitimate drift of their productions had they not in short arrogated a false consequence and ridiculously fancied themselves superior to a man whom they might have been proud to have followed at an humble distance  as to the share they had respectively in those productions which are published with their joint names i have already shown that whatever has been conjectured on the subject seems to have a very falacious air that beaumont could have been concerned in fifty three plays in eight years appears to be impossible it is as certainly impossible that so large a number could have been brought out during that time and it is very unlikely that beaumont left behind him he who was a writer for the moment materials for the greatest part of these plays but as we have no proof that what has been asserted on this subject is false though it is a little contradictory we are compelled so far to acquiesce as to give our verdict according to the evidence  one proud fact however the labors of these writers and their cotemporaries have ascertained all this contention for preeminence that was manifested all these valuable dramatic materials that were produced and all this rapid improvement to which the stage had arisen had been confirmed before the french theater that has always arrogantly affected to lead ours boasted a single line from the great corneille or any one of his satelites and before moliere and racine were born who then can deny that having so perfect a model before them as the english stage they made it an object of their imitation but that there may be no cavil this shall hereafter be incontestibly proved  chap iii massinger if in beaumont and fletcher we lament that authors sometimes attempt too much in massinger we have a proof that they may do too little this very charming writer has seldom been allowed the merit he possessed perhaps because he was a stranger to presumption vanity and those other qualities which often procure for an author more fame than he deserves posterity however generally sets the matter right which in the opinions of all judges of genius and taste has placed massinger very little behind jonson and far before beaumont and fletcher  massinger by the patronage of the earl of montgomery under whom his father had an honorable employ and afterward the earl of pembroke was encouraged in his youth to pursue polite literature which coming in consonance with a beautiful and refined genius which he inherited from nature he soon possessed all the qualities for a writer of correct taste and brilliant fancy  the stage attracted his attention and was indeed the very field for the exercise of his abilities he had invention and ingenuity he knew nature and character his style while it was warm and servid was nevertheless pure and decorous and even went beyond the times in which he wrote for polish and refinement for he was as strong as jonson without being dull and as elegant as waller without being mawkish but to give the proudest proof of the genius of massinger you see a great deal of the mind of shakespeare in him though he has never servilely imitated him nor arrogantly attempted to soar after him to those heights which his genius alone could reach but let us examine his plays  the virgin martyr this play was first acted as we are told in      at which time massinger was thirtyeight years old he was assisted by decker in this production which perhaps might better have been let alone but his modesty too often prevented him from feeling his own consequence the virgin martyr is taken from the martylogies of the persecution in the time of dioclesian and though there is some fine writing in it it is evidently a work of inexperience and therefore had no great success  the duke of milan here our author had fairer play for his genius this tragedy was performed in      with good success the scene where instructions are given by sforza to his favorite francisco for the murder of marcelia is wrought up very masterly and i have no doubt but this very play has assisted the various mariamnes of the french stage from tristan to voltaire that story from the history of the jews having been the foundation of the duke of milan indeed the circumstances are so similar that mr cumberberland very laudably was induced to blend this play and fentons mariamne together but probably from his unwillingness to encroach upon the writing of either of these authors it appeared not to be of a piece and therefore did not succeed  the bondsman acted at the cock pit drury lane      this is a tragedy of great merit the plot is full of truth and consistency and the writing is strong and nervous the incident of bringing back the rebellious slaves to their duty with whips is in the truest spirit of the drama and is here used to great advantage the bondsman has been frequently revived and particularly by mr cumberland in      at covent garden theater this was certainly a very judicious alteration and it was highly spoken of by the critics but it did not succeed to the degree that was reasonably expected  the roman actor was performed at black friars in      it was massingers greatest favorite among all his works and the writers of that time were so far of the same opinion that no less than six copies of commendatory verses were prefixed to it indeed its success was very decided both originally and when it was revived by betterton who rendered himself very celebrated in the principal character there is certainly a dignity in the conduct of the piece and the language is charming  the renegado this is a tragicomedy and was performed in    0 at drury lane this play was recommended by complimentary verses like the former and certainly has much merit but it has the fault of all tragicomedies the plots hang incongruously together and therefore each deprives the other of the approbation that would else be due to them  the picture performed in    0 at the globe and black friars this admirable production which is called a tragicomedy ought to be denominated a play for it consists of a plot and an episode that have immediate relation to each other there are objections to this piece one of which cannot be got over because it is particularly wrong to call in magic to assist what ought to be a representation of nature batistas reading therefore in natures hidden secrets and having thereby formed a portrait of sophia which appears to the eyes of mathias beautiful or deformed according as she is loyal or disloyal is certainly revolting and inadmissible but it has this admirable effect the poet by placing his characters in so forcible a situation is obliged to give them a language adequate to it and thus the passion of jealousy acquires a peculiar kind of turbulence and agitation which from mere conjectural proofs could not have belonged to it  of this difficult and delicate task massinger has acquitted himself wonderfully so that if you can bring yourself to pardon the deception it will increase your admiration of the author novelty was probably his excuse and he has so availed himself of it that perhaps there cannot in language be found any thing stronger than the effect it has produced  it is impossible here to go into the different merits of this piece but whether you take it for conduct for character or any other requisite but especially for language a few spots excepted it is certainly a constellation in literature  the emperor of the east was performed in      this is a tragicomedy and taken from the life of the younger theodocius we should have known more at present perhaps of this piece in its original form had not lee that mad but beautiful writer taken some of the most forcible parts of it for his tragedy of theodocius  the maid of honor performed in      is a work of considerable merit it has been revived and particularly within a few years at drury lane theater but productions by men of such eminence as massinger should never be touched but by authors of first rate abilities in its original state the maid of honor could not now be produced to advantage but it had better have remained in its original state than have appeared as it did at drury lane theater  the fatal dowry which was brought out in      is a tragedy and would probably have possessed more merit if massinger had not been assisted by field it has however enough to have materially assisted both row and voltaire for it has furnished the most material parts of the fair penitent and the character of nerestan in zara i shall say the less of this play because i like massinger best when he stands upon his own ground  a new way to pay old debts is a comedy full of admirable materials it came out in      and was prefaced by two copies of commendatory verses one by sir henry moody and the other by sir thomas jay this play has been considered by most of the critics as the best in all the works of massinger it is difficult to say this but it is certainly drawn with great nature and force and written with strength and nerve the overreaching of sir giles overreach both a lion and a fox in his proceedings is masterly and the dismissal of his creature marrall is moral and poetic there are many other parts of this play full of sterling merit it has been several times revived particularly at drury lane and since at covent garden to assist henderson who performed sir giles overreach with judgment but injudicious pruning always wounds a good tree and this kind of stab did the reputation of massinger sustain in both this case and in other cases  the great duke of florence this piece like the guardian is called a comical history it had great success and is recommended by verses written by done and ford the story of edgar and elfrida is said to have been taken from this play and certainly the circumstance of sannasarros giving the count a false account of lydias beauty has a resemblance to that part of it but that story was known before massinger therefore rymer who took his materials from william of malmesbury ravenscroft who profitted of both and hill whose athelwold and also masons elfrida were taken from history could not have had the least necessity to resort to the duke of florence for assistance  the unnatural combat performed in      is a tragedy of very great merit this merit however lies more in the astonishing manner in which the author has treated this strange subject than in the conduct of the piece itself to fancy revolting circumstances which it is dreadful to admit may be natural and operate upon them as if they were generally so is begging the question and cannot be excused however forcibly it may speak the merit of that author who can write well upon such extraordinary occasions  the mutual accusations of the father and son which are the cause of the combat the artful manner in which the elder malefort imposes upon the count by acting the brutus and the delicate yet determined tone of the younger who accuses his father of an incestuous crime which he scarcely dares to hint is executed with such sound judgment such shrewd art and such consummate address that i cannot think there is any thing in language to rval it but though these have been considered from aeschylus to us as the proper subjects to excite terror and so they are in one sense i never will allow they are the legitimate fair objects of the drama  at any rate let there be qualification the incest of hamlets father caused by ambition is an admissible subject for an author the incest of maleforts father without a motive but barely wickedness is not admissible and under these circumstances much as the writing of the unnatural combat may captivate i believe no real well wisher to the interest of the drama will wish to see it brought forward on the stage  the guardian performed in      is a comedy of very great merit and two or three trifling particulars excepted i see nothing to prevent its holding a regular rank on the stage it is full of well managed equivoque which is judiciously heightened at the end of the third act and naturally developed at the finish of the play the writing is of that fluent and easy kind that nevertheless has strength and force and that gives to manliness and greatness of mind the unaffected expression of nature but this is the peculiar beauty of massinger who let his subjects be ever so common never descends  the bashful lover a tragicomedy which was produced at the private theater at black friars in      deserves mention only on account of many beauties that are scattered up and down in different parts of it for it is not constructed with the usual correctness of massinger nor is the drift of the plots so interesting as any of his other pieces  the very woman is another tragicomedy it was performed also in      and has merit but neither that nor sir aston cockaines obstinate lady from which it is borrowed has a good claim to any material reputation the more you read massinger the more you admire him and therefore even in this play we trace a true genius and an elegant writer but it is nevertheless unequal to many of his other productions  the old law a comedy brought out in      is by no means a good play though parts of it are admirable massinger was here assisted by middleton and rowley perhaps it would have better if he had been let alone certainly neither of these writers was by any means equal to massinger  the city madam produced in      this comedy which has a most laudable drift is worked up with great art and address the folly of the children of industry and sobriety who spurn at that happiness they legitimately possess and that stable consequence by which they are the support of the commercial interest of the kingdom and therefore the basis of its wealth for the transitory and frivolous pleasures of the court has been properly considered by the dramatist as the best materials for the exercise of his genius  massinger here has handled this subject in a masterly style his portraits are faithful to nature his manners are correctly appropriate and his discrimination is nice and critical  haughty puffed up beauty full of vanity and ambition is as natural as it is contemptible grovling ideas and riches wrested from the unsuspecting and necessitous are inseparable and a distinction between folly and crime weakness and wickedness is in these circumstances the duty of an author thus has massinger made his city madam and her daughters arrogant and overbearing to be severely punished and afterward pardoned and thus he has made that fostered snake the dependant brother the instrument of temporary punishment to others whose crimes were within the limits of pardon till at last his arts recoil upon himself and he is confounded in that ruin he had meditated for others  this is the grand outline of the play and very fine it is there are subordinate particulars however which might have been better managed sir john lacy and plenty might have been more judiciously disguised and have come with a more probable tale considering the consummate art of the man they had to deal with and the magic at last after the disrepute poor stargaze had thrown it into is a poor contrivance to awe a libertine and an unbeliever and even if it had been in other respects admissible it is a blameable vehicle for a dramatic plot but particularly for a comedy we pass over a ghost in a tragedy we are even charmed with a spectre in a romance and we have no objection to changing of the wives in the devil to pay because it is a farce though none of these are critically right but producing orpheus cerberus charon and twenty other fantastic spirits in a sober citizens house would not have imposed upon luke nor ought it to have imposed upon the audience  the faults however in this comedy after all are but trivial and were they judiciously removed and the denouement brought about by a more natural means there are few pieces on the stage that could challenge a fairer claim to reputation  besides the play already mentioned there were others written by massinger of which we have different accounts of these the noble choice the judge or believe as you list the spanish viceroy minervas sacrifice the tyrant philenzo and hippolita antonio and vallia and fast and welcome were lost to the world by the carelessness of a servant belonging to mr warburton the somersetshire herald  three others under the titles of the wandering lovers the italian night piece and the prisoner were performed but never printed these therefore that have been here enumerated with a slight account of their different merits may be considered as the theater of massinger and here it is impossible to help noticing that i cannot in my conscience agree to the dates of these plays which i have set down by the concurrent authorities of various writers exactly as i found them  to set up any criterion of my own founded only on probable circumstances as to the dates would be to combat errors which to a monstrous number are considered as dramatic gospel common sense will not permit us to credit the date of any play between      and the restoration for prynn and puritanism so attacked the stage that though it lifted its head for a short time its own ruin was involved at length in the ruin of the constitution this prynn who was a barrister of lincolns inn and an enthusiastic puritan published in      a work which he called histrio mastix or players scourge this was a most absurd illiberal and wanton abuse of plays players and all who favored them it was answered judiciously enough by a publication of as many old plays as could be sound the drift of which did not appear to be of that immoral tendency that prynn had represented other circumstances concurred also to render this bigot unpopular he says in his book that princes dancing in their own persons was the cause of their untimely ends that our english ladies shorn and frizzled madams had lost their modesty that plays were the chief delight of the devil and all that frequented them were damned this was considered as a reflection on the king and queen who publicly frequented plays he vents his antipathy to music in terms as unqualified and in particular he calls church music the bleating of brute beasts and says the choiristers bellow the tenor as if they were oxen bark a counterpoint like a kennel of hounds roar a treble as if they were a bulls and grunt out a base like a parcel of hogs the first of these passages reflecting upon the king and nobles and the other on the church it was deemed an infamous libel on every branch of the state and ordered to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman and in addition to this his own sentence was to be put from the bar to be excluded the society of lincolns inn and degraded by the university of oxford to stand in the pillory in westmister and cheapside to lose an ear at each place and stand with a paper in his hand ing his offense to be a libel against both their majes and the government to be fined five thousand pounds and to suffer perpetual imprisonment the whole of which sentence was put into execution to the letter   it is on this account that although in this book i have limited myself to the death of james the first i have nevertheless gone through the whole life of massinger and i shall do the same by jonson because it keeps the whole subject under the readers eye and within the scope of recollection besides it is within possibility that in doing this i have committed no error for in the accounts of massingers death scarcely two of them are alike nay some make him live twenty years longer than others do and some say he died in affluence while others insist that he died in penury  but to leave that which in this author is uncertain to dwell a little on what is not in his various merits he still lives and will long continue to do so to the honor of genius of taste of elegance of judgment of truth of nature and of morality  chap iv chapman heywood decker marston and others i shall now go into all that it will be necessary to say on the subject of chapman and other writers who though they were considered as a subordinate class were nevertheless men of abilities and having done this and also noticed what more i may conceive myself bound to say of jonson i shall pursue the willing task of dwelling a little more on the plays of shakespeare  before james the first chapman produced two plays in   0  he brought out a comedy called all fools which was taken from terence and which received considerable applause eastward hoe performed in the same year is more celebrated for the predicament into which it plunged its supposed authors chapman jonson and marston as the reader will recollect than for any merit the piece itself contained hogarth however took from it the plan of his idle and industrious apprentices and it was revived many years since as a proper substitute on lord mayors day for that disgrace to the stage the london cuckolds tate again brought it forward and called it the cuckolds haven and mrs lenox also brought it out with alterations under the title of old city manners  the gentleman usher a comedy produced in   0  had its partisans but it is indifferently spoken of and there is a doubt whether it was ever acted monsieur dolive performed in the same year received some praise and we are told was performed with success  bussy dambois made its appearance in   0  it was the first tragedy produced by chapman and thought by some to be the best of his works it kept the stage for a time with considerable reputation but at length that eternal mutilater of good authors durfey laid his iron hand on it from which time it became so crampt that it has ever since been laid aside  casar and pompey was performed in the same year with some success the conspiracy and tragedy of charles duke of byron marshal of france came out in   0  and consists of two plays which relate to the history of france in the time of henry the fourth  may day a comedy was brought out at black friars in      there is nothing material known of this piece but the widows tears produced in      is well spoken of the subject is evidently the ephesian matron but in the other parts there are some well wrought scenes and several affecting and interesting incidents chapman is every where a man of learning but he has in this play shown himself a writer of taste and genius  the revenge of bussy dambois is a bad attempt at following up a good subject for it is not so close to history as the former play nor does it create so much interest the masque of the middle temple and lincolns inn this was no more than a temporary piece to celebrate the marriage of the count palatine of the rhine with the princess elizabeth it was performed before the royal family at whitehall and cost the societies of these courts two thousand four hundred pounds the machinery and decorations were designed and conducted by inigo jones  two wise men and all the rest fools it is doubtful whether this curious piece was written by chapman but as it has never been ascribed to any other author we always find it in his catalogue it was performed or perhaps only printed in      and is remarkable for having a prologue and epilogue in prose and for its being extended to seven acts but as these are inovations of no kind of consequence the intelligent reader would have been better satisfied if an account had been preserved of its merits as to character incident and situation  revenge for honor the fatal love the tragedy of a yorkshire gentlewoman and her son and the second maidens tragedy are also from the pen of chapman but they do not appear to have been printed and therefore it is impossible to say any thing of their merits with certainty what we do know of this author who was as is universally admitted a man of sound erudition in the character of a dramatist is at least honorable to his fame which cannot perhaps receive a stronger proof than his being considered a respectable cotemporary writer with shakespeare and an object of envy to jonson  heywoods dramatic works after the death of elizabeth next claim our attention if you know not me you know nobody was performed in   0  this production consists of two parts and relates to circumstances which happened during the reign of elizabeth but how the building of the royal exchange can be dramatized is really more than one can ordinarily conceive upon the whole it was a strange incomprehensible thing which the author allows but he shields himself from censure by a declaration that it was printed without his consent and to prove that this copy which is full of irregularity and not even divided into acts might be modified and amended he produced what he conceived a perfect piece on the same subject which however met as bad a fate as the original  the fair maid of the exchange of which mention is only made of the title the golden age and the silver age two pieces crammed full of circumstances from the heathen mythology without order or coherence as is also his next piece called the brazen age and the four apprentices of london with the conquest of jerusalem which is taken from the exploits of godfrey of bollogne a most romantic subject for a play are also among heywoods dramatic productions  after this we met with a woman killed with kindness a piece though upon a most extravagant and overstrained subject certainly written in a strong and masterly style the incidents are perplexed owing to their number but the relation they bear to one another is perfectly dramatic except the quarrel of montford and acton which had better have been out of the piece there is something revolting in the conduct of mrs frankford but her contrition and the consciousness of her not deserving that lenity which her forgiving husband in consequence of her repentence humanely shows her and which produces the remorse that is the cause of her death exhibits a most forcible moral it seems to reprobate by anticipation the dangerous doctrines of lord chesterfield and is in fact whether designedly or not the ground work of mr pratts admirable production the pupil of pleasure these are the worthiest purposes to which the stage can be applied and if this play were well modernized and well acted it could not fail of brilliant success as i conceive it a duty to lift the english stage wherever i properly may into consequence i shall never omit any material proof that it has been of service to foreigners i have no doubt but dodsleys twelve volumes of old plays have created half the reputation of the german theater it is a pity however that the german authors constantly pervert the morality of these plays for upon the sooting that their stage is now constructed their characters are any thing but natural and moral which may be proved in many instances i shall only however adduce one proof which i do upon fair and liberal ground conceiving it a positive duty i owe the public to warn them against the introduction of false taste the proof i mean is the stranger a play recently performed at drury lane which is evidently taken from a woman killed with kindness with this difference that in the first the husband receives an adultress to his bed a thing which an audience ought not to tolerate and in the other however the imbecility of nature may plead for the guilty wife the husband true to his own honor nay to her honor to the honor of his children for there are children in both plays solemnly allots her a situation worthy of his wife where she may repent at leisure but resolves to have no further intercourse with her all which she beautifully calls a mild sentence there since nothing but death can obliterate her crime her remorse and his complicated kindness put an end to her existence and why has the poet done this that the wife may be forgiven and pitied that the husbands honor may be restored and that the children taught by so solemn an example may walk in the paths of virtue this is moral and poetic but would any of these ends be attained were the husband forgetful of himself and of social and moral duty to pardon her frailty to consecrate adultery and to imprint on the young minds of his children that happiness is to be earned by infamy these are facts and i shall make no further comment on them than to say that such perverted exhibitions are traps for virtue and that the better they are written the more they will prove seductive  i cannot resist transcribing a short scene to show how exquisitely natural yet difficult the conduct of the husband is  after she has said fearing her husbands just anger that she deserves a thousand deaths but entreats that for the sake of her sex to which she was once an ornament but then a reproach he would not deform her nor wound her but let her body go perfect to her grave he answers fran my god with patience arm me rise nay rise and i will debate with thee was it for want thou plaidst the strumpet was it thou not supplied with every pleasure fashion and new toy nay even beyond my calling  anne i was  fran was it then disability in me  anne o no  fran did not i lodge thee in my bosom wear thee in my heart  anne you did  fran i did indeed witness my tears i did go bring my infants hither o nan o nan if neither fear nor shame regard of honor the blemish of my house nor my dear love could have withheld thee from so lewd a fact yet for these infants these young harmless souls on whose white brows thy shame is charactered and grows in greatness as they wax in years look but on them and melt away in tears away with them lest as her spotted body has stained their names with stripe of bastardy so her adulterous breath may blast their spirits with her infectious thoughts away with them    thus we see that almost two hundred years ago the english stage was in a state of greater perfection than the german stage is at this moment     the rape of lucrene this true roman tragedy as it is called and indeed very properly for it is a complete farago of declaiming miming and singing is very ill calculated for the english stage and therefore it was poorly received this is however by no means a general rule and mores the pity  the fair maid of the west a comedy in two parts had considerable success its subject may be found in dancer who wrought these two pieces into a novel called the english lovers  the iron age these fanciful kind of pieces are very ill calculated for the stage but now and then incongruities please best the iron age was produced in two parts the first of which contains no less than the rape of helen the siege of troy the combat between hector and ajax the deaths of troilus and hector the death of achilles the contention of ajax and ulysses the death of ajax and many other circumstances  the second part goes on and describes the deaths of agamennon menelaus clytemnestra helen orestes egisthus pylades and in short all the rest of the personages at any time or in any way concerned in the trojan war to thersites so that we have homer and all the other of the classical writers on this curious subject crammed into two plays or rather narratives in dialogue which are brought forward without the least regard to any species of dramatic propriety this curious medley however as well as the three ages before spoken of brought crowded audiences which in general consoles an author for any drawback on reputation  the english traveller a tragicomedy is partly taken from plautus and partly from an actual fact it traveled however a very little way either toward dramatic fame or public favor a maidenhead well lost lost itself for there is no trace to be found of it  the lancashire witches in which brom assisted and which was afterward altered into a more regular piece by shadwell neither in its original or its altered state did much party spirit conjured up for it of course adherents and enemies and the papists were horridly provoked against teague odivelly whose tricks and ingenuity probably they envied  loves mistress this is a masque which was performed before the royal family several times it is taken from apuliuss golden ass and is indebted to the decorations of inigo jones for the greatest part of its success this play the challenge for beauty the royal king and loyal subject taken from fletchers loyal subject the wise woman of hogsdon which was printed with a copy of commendatory verses before it and fortune by sea and land in which rowley assisted are all the dramatic productions we know of out of the prodigious number which heywood like hardy is said and perhaps with equal truth to have written  of these pieces few will be found regular taking them by any denomination a woman killed with kindness is beyond measure the best production of this author and yet there is much good writing and there are many beauties in some of his other productions but they were upon such strange fanciful subjects that they could come into no class and as to the immense labor he is said to have bestowed on them his great merit seems to have been a good memory for he has so thrown together what he had conned at school that instead of being original himself he was little more than the amanuensis of the ancients  decker after the death of queen elizabeth produced the following pieces the honest  performed in   0  the different opinions concerning this play show how little we know with any certainty of the works of authors at that period a biographer tells us confidently that neither this play nor the sequel to it is divided into acts but this is so far from the truth that dodsley has printed it in his collection of old plays where it not only appears in a very regular state but gives good proof that decker had considerable merit the second part appears to have been a number of scenes thrown together but it was never digested into a regular play  westward hoe this play was brought on in   0  webster assisted in the writing of it as he did of northward hoe and we are told they had both success probably more owing to the titles caught from the eastward hoe which we have seen so popular in consequence of having involved its authors in such disgrace  the whore of babylon written expressly in compliment to queen elizabeth with a view to expose the designs of the jesuits and set forth their dangerous plots from which the queen escaped was printed in   0  but it is most probable it never was performed the queen is represented under the character of titiana which name spencer originally gave her and which was adopted by shakespeare in his midsummer nights dream there were other characters of that time personified all tending to describe and illustrate the virtues of elizabeth a proper tribute to her exalted merit and a laudable mode of stimulating the loyalty of the people  if it be not good the devils in it this play is founded on machiavals marriage of belphegor and is a poor attempt at wit from the title to the last word the title indeed is so contemptible a quibble that as the devil is actually in the play so the author gives it under his hand that it is not good this flimzy stuff has however been frequently copied and once most miserably under the title of a comic opera at drury lane  match me in london to this play the different writers have given different merits but as it is impossible that it should be excellent poor tolerable and good at the same time which words i copy we may fairly take it that it had merit and defects  these are all the dramatic works the world gives to decker he is said however to have written in conjunction with day the jew of venice not printed guy earl of warwick of which various writers have conjectured a good deal but have known nothing gustavus king of swithland of which the world is nearly as ignorant and the tale of jocondo and astolpho taken probably from the same stock as la fontaines joconde a circumstance not however to be ascertained this play having been destroyed together with so many others by warburtons servant  upon the whole decker cannot be ranked with chapman and heywood and it is very probable that he would not have been half so well respected as he was had not the envy of jonson who had he possessed an atom of good sense would have smiled and passed by him listed him into a consequence not only fancied by him but credited by the world  marston who wrote in all but eight plays produced six of them after the death of elizabeth the insatiate countess performed in   0  is one of them and contains under feigned titles the history of joan the first queen of jerusalem naples and sicily whose story had been pretty well handled before both for the stage and as a novel the reader will remember that berenger de parasols was poisoned for making free with this ladys character and this queen is intended by anne duchess of ulme in gods revenge against adultery very little is known as to the real merit of this play  the malcontent produced in   0  this is the play which marston as we have seen dedicated with such warmth to jonson with whom he had afterward so severe a quarrel some of marstons enemies endeavored to induce a general belief that this piece was intended as a satire on particular characters which invidious report jonson is supposed secretly to have seconded and the probability is that this gave rise to the dispute which made the breach between these authors there does not appear however the smallest ground for this imputation for by several writers but particularly langbaine we are assured the malcontent was a fair manly general satire besides we are capable of ascertaining this ourselves and so far we must vouch in favor of the author whose piece certainly goes to the times both then and now but this does not preclude the possibility that particular persons sat for their portraits for satire was certainly the vein of marston and it is impossible to be critically satirical without fitting the cap somewhere  the dutch curtizan this comedy is full of the intrigue of those times and must certainly have had success for the revenge or a match in newgate which is attributed to betterton and which possesses a great deal of whim and pleasantry though in other respects it is a strange excentric thing is nothing more than an alteration of marstons play which again was wrought into a farce that at one time greatly succeeded under the title of the the vintner tricked  parisitaster or the fawn performed in   0  is taken partly from the decameron of boccace and partly from ovid it has particular merit but is not so good a play as any other of the productions of marston  the wonder of women or sophonisba produced in   0  this play is rather imitated than copied from history for the author himself says that he has not labored in it to tie himself to relate every thing as a historian but to enlarge every thing as a poet  what you will a comedy was brought out in   0  this piece which did but little itself has provided materials for other dramatic productions since it appears to be taken from plautus but the equivoque of mistaking one person for another cannot properly be said to belong to any particular author it has been used in all times and by all writers and so the circumstances vary it may be considered always as a novelty  marston having consulted regularity and correctness in the conduct of his plays and besides having written them naturally and both with humor and pathos must rank before decker and essentially upon a par with chapman and heywood especially when we are told that his poems rendered him still more celebrated than his plays being however a severe satirist his cotemporaries were not willing to allow him his due portion of praise and posterity cannot properly judge of his whole merit what we know of him however ranks him very respectfully as a writer  marloe in the reign of james the first wrote the massacre of paris a subject which has employed the pens of so many able writers lee wrought it into a play but without some interesting private story the subject is too shocking for an audience mercier in his bishop of lisieux has hit upon exactly the method to give it effect he supposes a protestant family protected by a catholic bishop who risks his situation and his life for their succor in consequence of which the soldiery revolt from their inexorable duty and the ravages of charles the ninth and his prostigate court are put a stop to neither marloe nor lee did any thing like this and therefore this play is little known  the tragical history of dr faustus is spoken of in such vague terms that though it is necessary to say there was such a play it is useless to say more the jew of malta was ushered into the world by heywood and is said to have been greatly received lusts dominion was well received at first and was afterward altered by mrs behn a circumstance all in the ladys way we shall examine it hereafter under the title of abdelazar or the moors revenge  these with dido and the shepherds holiday in the first of which he joined nash and in the other day are all we know of marloe it is very probable he wrote more and that he could have written better but with a mind divided by prostigacy and debauchery from that necessary study and necessary rectitude by the bye for the meritorious task of inculcating morality indispensible in a dramatic writer it is wonderful we have so much to praise in his public character from which his private conduct obliges us so largely to deduct  middleton who produced one play in the reign of elizabeth wrote sixteen dramatic productions afterward and in six more he was concerned with jonson fletcher rowley and others  the phoenix a tragi comedy performed in   0  is well spoken of the plot is taken from a spanish novel called the force of love michaelmas term is a mere undigested sketch looking over a langbaine which i bought at lackingtons because it contains some few marginal notes in the hand writing as i suppose of some former possessor against this article which langbaine says he can give no account of through the imperfection of his only copy i find this remark i have a copy printed as newly corrected london    0  your five gallants was printed but probably never performed the family of love all we know of this play is that shirley makes one of his characters speak of it in his lady of pleasure a trick to cheat the old one performed in   0  this comedy was a great favorite when it first came out and is esteemed among those who are in possession of old plays as a piece of considerable merit  a mad world my masters performed in   0  was also a popular play it is certainly a strange thing but it has a great deal of whim and humor of that broad latitude that though it may not be correctly chaste is nevertheless provokingly laughable mrs behn however had no objection to this rich vein of humor and has borrowed some of the most luscious parts of it for her city heiress and charles johnson who however was contented with that part which was less offensive availed himself of a part of the plot for his country lasses other authors have also gone to this source for materials  the inner temple masque was one of those temporary things which were at that time performed upon some public occasion it has been supposed to have furnished the hint of comus how truly it is difficult to say  the game of chess this was any thing you please but a play it was symbolical of a dispute between the church of england and the church of rome wherein of course the former was conqueror it was a stupid impolitic business and ended though in other respects it was very successful in the authors losing the game for he was sent to prison in a copy of this play in the possession of thomas pearson esquire is the following memorandum in an old hand after nine days wherein i have heard some of the actors say they took fifteen hundred pounds the spanish fashion being prevalent got it suppressed and the author mr thomas middleton committed to prison where he lay some time and at last got out upon this petition to king james  a harmless game coined only for delight  was played betwixt the black house and the white  the white house won yet still the black does brag  they had the power to put me in the bag  use but your royal hand twll set me free  it is but removing of a man that is me thomas middleton   a chaste maid in cheapside appeared and was soon forgotton no wit no help like a womans is a play of which there is no trace but the title woman beware woman this is a tragedy and has for its date      which is eight years after the restoration it must however have been originally performed in    0 at latest and it was probably revived      by sir william davenant whose restoration of the stage has no doubt caused so many mistakes his copies only being extant which writers have taken for originals at this time it was known and greatly received what was its original success cannot be known richards a writer in the reign of charles the second speaks in the highest terms but in curious language by the bye of this play in a poem he had written expressly to praise it he finishes thus i that have seent can say having just cause never tragedy came off with more applause now though this is bad poetry it may be good truth and if literally so this play must have been popular for he does not pledge himself but the audience   more dissemblers besides women this play is extant but no author pretends to say any thing about its success any thing for a quiet life from this play of which we know nothing but that it was printed in      i shall take a hint and content myself once for all with setting down dates and leaving the reader to consider of the probability of whether the plays they are prefixed to were originally performed at that time or not  before i take my leave of this subject however i shall briefly reiterate that no date from about      to the restoration can be relied on and i leave it in all cases as well as the present to the good sense of those who may think this an object of any material consequence as my friends the advertisers call it to read and compare in which case i expect to be acquitted of intentional error whenever i set down any thing that nobody can possibly believe such as that middleton produced one play in the fortythird year of elizabeths reign and another in the fourteenth year of the reign of charles the second but the spirit of this will be easily given me when we consider middleton as a cotemporary of shakespeare and not of dryden in this particular instance langbaine bears me out who thinks all middletons plays were performed before the civil wars  and so no doubt were massingers  particularly any thing for a quiet life and the reason he gives for this opinion is that it was published as well as the phooenix the game of chess and the family of love by kirkman who knew so much of the plays performed at that time and was so careful to attribute each to its proper owner  the pieces in which middleton was joined by other writers are the roaring girl the fair quarrel the widow the changling the spanish gipsey and the old law all which except the changling which we are told met with considerable applause are very little spoken of by the various writers on the drama  there are other things attributed to middleton but with nothing like certainty and in particular that in a piece called the witch he furnished shakespeare with the hint of his witches in macbeth but when we recollect how very poorly jonson imitated them we can hardly suppose our great poet in his own particular province where he upon every occasion so completely left all the world behind him stood in need of a cue from middleton who though he was a respectable writer and made no mean stand as a dramatist had nothing in his genius that could furnish instruction to shakespeare  chap v webster rowley and the inferior dramatic poets it will yet be necessary to mention a third class of dramatic poets which though inferior to those noticed already were considered as men of talents  webster who frequently wrote in conjunction with decker marston and rowley ventured now and then to go alone there are six plays published with his name to them under the titles of the white devil the devils law case the duchess of malfy appius and virginia there is a play called appius and virginia entered in the books of the stationers company by richard jonnes in      the title page of which describes the conduct of virginia as a rare example of the virtue of chastity in wishing rather to be slain by her own fathers hand than to be deflowered by the wicked judge appius we have also seen this subject very early among the french moralities  the thracian wonder and a cure for a cuckold  the first of these plays we have no particular account of the second which is partly borrowed from the story of phaereus jason in velerius maximus and partly from the histoires admirable of gaulart met with applause the third taken from lopez de vega goulart and bondello had also success the fourth was revived and altered by betterton and the fifth and sixth in which some say rowley had a hand were both received with applause webster however does not appear at any time to so much advantage as in those pieces wherein he labored with others his best knack being more to find out materials for his associates than to give form to them for he was a parish clerk and an assistant at a school neither of which occupations seems very much calculated to give his genius scope whatever talents he might possess  rowley was an actor as well as an author he was very much esteemed and in his manners and being intimately acquainted with all the wits of his time and carressed by persons of the first fashion he a good deal resembled the french actor raisin of whom i have already spoken and to whom for his wit for his elegance and for his gentlemanly qualities i could find a finished likeness in an actor now living whose abilities would honor any merit and whose intimacy would throw a luster upon any rank  it is very probable that the advice and assistance of rowley were of the utmost service to the inferior authors of that day his part of their conjunctive task being of course to fit the work to the stage of which department he may be supposed to have had a better judgment than them  those plays in which he was connected with others have been mentioned already there are however six which he is said to have written without assistance their titles are new wonder or a woman never vexed all is lost by lust a match at midnight a shoemaker is a gentleman the birth of merlin and the witch of edmonton  in most of these plays there are diverting circumstances they are generally taken from old novels which he seems to have been well able to dramatize dodsley has printed the match at midnight in his old plays which is full of very pleasant intrigue and in the birth of merlin shakespeare is said to have lent rowley assistance which though the opinion is not ill supported seems very unlikely the suspicion however is greatly honorable to rowley if it was begotten by a perusal of his writings but even then it depends upon who were the judges for till the world at large give their never failing decision upon occasions of such nice discrimination the conoscente are too often miserably gulled out of their reason by their own consent a lamentable truth of which we have had recent proof  day who appears to have been well educated had a hand in some of the plays produced early in the reign of james the first with decker rowley and others particularly the travels of three english brothers guy earl of warwick and the maidens holiday he also wrote unasisted the isle of gulls which is taken from sir philip sidneys arcadia and had success humor out of breath of which we know nothing but the title law tricks which one author calls an admirable play though no other appears able to give any account of it the parliament of bees which was nothing more than conversations between twelve personages something in the style of the moralities and the blind beggar of bethnel green from which dodsley took the materials for his ballad farce under the same title  lord stirling rose by his merit from obscurity to a coronet during the minority of james the sixth of scotland he improved by a polite and elegant education those brilliant parts he inherited from nature he obtained the patronage of the earl of argyle whose favor he won in quality of tutor while they were abroad and this introducing him to court he was carressed admired and consulted by the first ranks till by able conduct great merit and a series of fortunate circumstances he was made secretary of state created afterward a viscount and at length an earl his dramatic works are darius craesus the alexandrian tragedy and julius caesar  the first of these tragedies was a mere juvenile effort and can never be considered in a perfect light as it was full of scottisms and by no means calculated for the stage the second has a much better claim to attention but it is wholly borrowed from herodotus and indeed all the works of this author are an imitation of the ancients and particularly of the phlegmatic seneca the third in which the ghost of alexander is the principal part and which is founded upon the differences that arose among the chiefs of alexander as to who was to succeed him is still more extravagant when he bequeathed his crown to the most worthy perhaps he had it in view to perplex the world as much after his death as he had done while living he succeeded at any rate with this author for the subject is so complicate for a play that with a great deal of good writing aed much classical knowledge it was not in his power to bring the council of meleager and perdicias to any rational conclusion  the fourth piece julius caesar is a subject so familiar to every reader that it is unnecessary to say more than that lord stirling has shown in it a competent knowledge of the roman history and commented on that part of it with sound judgment but this play is not more regular nor better constructed than any one of the others and indeed the author seems not to have gone so much for perfect dramatic pieces as for mere erudite productions for he calls them very emphatically four monarchic tragedies and his bringing in the chorus between the acts and dressing up the matter in all the heavy and turgid pomp of seneca shows that it was his ambition more to be admired in the closet than on the stage  sir fulk greville lord brook whose life may be read at large in fullers british worthies who was born the same year with sir philip sidney who was a great favorite of queen elizabeth by whom he was created a lord and who was distinguished by his learning and his courage has a claim to notice here in consequence of his having written two tragedies called alaham and mustapha they were however never acted being upon the model of those of lord stirling full of declamation and explained by choruses lord brook however if he was not witty himself was the cause of wit in others for like his friend he was a most liberal patron and benefactor to the dramatic writers  this amiable and celebrated character was murdered at the age of seventyfour by one of his dependants named haywood who not thinking his services sufficiently requited mortally stabbed his master and afterward to avoid an ignominious death destroyed himself this was in brook house holborn where brook street now stands on his monument in warwick church lord brook is styled servant to queen elizabeth counselor to king james and friend to sir philip sidney  field of whom a good deal is conjectured because but little is known wrote two plays called women is a weathercock and amends for the ladies these plays langbaine tells us will still bear reading i rather think however it must be by those who are endowed with patience they have nevertheless good materials but are full of strange irregularities  the first is dedicated to any woman who is not a weathercock by which the author means quaintly to insinuate that it is dedicated to nobody it is warmly commended by chapman the second is an apology or as the author calls it an amends to the fair sex for having written a satyr against them in his first play it is imitated from the curious impertinent in don quixote which has been since treated on the french stage both by brosse and destouches and is also the subject of the city night cap the amorous prince and the curious husband  it is not settled whether field the author and field the actor were the same person we hear of a letter written by roberts the actor to pope wherein he asserts that the field in question was the same whose name is always joined with hemmings burbage and condel and the rest of that company placed before the folio edition of shakespeares works and also in the dramatis personae prefixed to the cynthias revels of jonson but say those who quote this authority it is more probable that the field who was a fellow of new college oxford was the author this however does not with me clear up the point at all a good education being no more an impediment to good acting than to good writing  ford was one of the associates of rowley and the rest he also wrote eleven plays without their assistance one of which  it is a pity she is a whore dodsley has printed in his collection of old plays and which of course is the best as no man knew how to select with more judgment he has however chosen it no doubt for the writing which is in many parts strong and poetical for nothing can be more revolting than the subject and therefore the warmer and more glowing the pictures of love are worked up the more reprehensible is the author because the deeper is the wound given to honor and to decorum  but say the critics the title bears out the the author and the catastrophe is so shocking that that all those who may be inclined to practice such monstrous crimes will be warned by it nothing can be more false than such argument no warning no catastrophe can deter such wretches as are here described and as to the title is annabella merely a strumpet no she is the strumpet of her brother and is she to be pitied for that such reasoning is equally monstrous ridiculous and supererogate and of course reprehensible for it is not the province of a dramatic writer to seek for monsters and to record prodigies is it his duty to reprobate such vices as are commonly known and often practiced in which catalogue for the honor of human nature incest without a motive has no place but if it had it ought to be introduced as a deed of darkness which could not be pleaded for or argued on even by the wretches themselves therefore all we can say in favor of ford is to wish be had employed his beautiful writing to a more laudable purpose  the lovers melancholy this was a tragi comedy and we find it highly commended by verses from different friends the most remarkable circumstance concerning it however was its success and its consequence it came out in the same week that jonson produced his new inn and was received warmly while the other was damned both owing in great measure to the enemies that jonson had conjured up as we shall see by and by more particularly this cynical pedantic churl who could not bear such success in a young author for it was fords first play among other ridiculous conduct charged him with having stolen his materials from shakespeares papers with the connivance of hemmings and condel and this together with other forenesses brought about jonsons ears a thousand squibs one of which was called old bens light heart made heavy by young johns melancholy lover  loves sacrifice the broken heart perkin warbeck the fancies chaste and noble and the ladies trial are spoken of as having had success they were well patronized and highly commended by different poets who were perhaps as happy to see the envious jonson nettled as the modest unassuming ford carressed beauty in a trance the royal combat an ill beginning has a good end and the london merchant are also said to have succeeded but they are lost to the world through the same carelessness of mr warburtons servant by which we were deprived of so many of massengers plays  daniel had his dramatic writings being equal to his historic would have claimed a forwarder place in this work he was born two years before shakespeare and embellished the reign of elizabeth as we have seen by giving to history a polish which till then was unknown to it the accounts concerning him are very contradictory some averring that he only lived fiftyseven years and others eighty these are points however which i always steer clear of investigating fearing to imitate those who are anxious to tell their readers how long an author lived rather than to show whether he lived to any good purpose  the dramatic pieces of daniel are six in number among which cleopatra was esteemed a well written production but not well calculated for representation the queens arcadia a compliment to queen anne consort of james the first is said to have been borrowed from quinaults comedy sans comedies and randolphs amyntas which is so far from the truth that at the time this play came out randolph was in his cradle and quinault was not born till nearly seventy years afterward tethys festival was a thing merely written in honor of the unfortunate charles when he was created prince of wales hymens triumph was also an occasional thing on the nuptials of lord roxborough and the vision of the twelve goddesses was again complimentary daniel having written it as an allegorical representation of the blessings of peace enjoyed under james the first so that it is plain he wrote his dramatic pieces in quality of poet laureat and that he worked hard for his but of sack  this indeed is the worst trait in the character of daniel for the subjects of his productions were little worthy the verses bestowed upon them and indeed were we to take all we know of history we should find upon a comparison that the worst vices of bad men have been often glossed over by good poets while the best virtues of good men have passed unrecorded and the reason is evident vice needs the ablest talents to defend it virtue is its own advocate and thus it is only that by a collective review of various exertions characters are accorded legitimate fame  the other play of daniel called philotas is said to have very nearly jostled him out of his seat as poet laureat on account of a report supposed to have been connived at by jonson who succeeded to that honorable post after him this report was that daniel in the character of philotas had brought forward the unfortunate earl of essex a subject certainly of too tender a nature to touch on at that time and the consequences became so serious that he was under the necessity of vindicating himself in an apology printed at the end of the play  the fact of this report having been propagated there can be no doubt of but the ground on which it is supposed that jonson connived at it is not firm for it is presumed upon under an idea that the play made its first appearance in   0  which is the period admitted by every writer that i have looked into but it has not the least probability to support it i have no doubt the mistake has arisen from a supposition that daniel was only laureat to james the first whereas he succeeded to that situation at the death of spencer four years before the death of elizabeth during which time no doubt he brought out this play hence the predicament into which his enemies attempted to plunge him and this speaks for itself for what did james care about the earl of essex  i do not however mean to say that this exculpates jonson whose envy was no doubt as tingling in the reign of elizabeth as in the reign of james and the hateful bent of whose private character needs not this trait to magnify its deformity my intention is only to give an added proof how little dates are to be relied upon and to rectify false ipse dixits by detecting them through circumstances the fact upon this principle as to daniels plays is that philotas which is allowed on all hands to be his first he wrote in the reign of elizabeth and having had a taste of that danger he was likely to run among his enemies at court he deferred his other dramatic writings till the next reign when in order to keep on the safe side of the post he went into the other extreme and quitted satire for adulation  brewer has been considered by all authors as a dramatic writer and by many as a man of talents nearly equal to shakespeare and yet some of them give him credit but for two plays of which they suspect one was written by somebody else from such materials as these are writers obliged to collect history  as the particulars of this dispute are a little extraordinary i shall go into them in some degree by way of a lesson to credulous readers brewer is said by those who are willing to allow him perhaps more than the full extent of his merit to have written six plays under the titles of landgartha loves dominion loves loadstone lingua the country girl and the love sick king and those who accord him this portion of fame if it be any among whom are winstanley and phillips say also that he was a man of most extraordinary genius which is recorded in a poem called steps to parnassus where he is supposed to have the magic power of calling in the muses to his assistance thus becoming to shakespeare that sort of rival that hesiod is said to have been to homer  langbaine jacob gildon and others however allow him to have been author of only the last two and langbaine suspects one of these not to have belonged to him because it was published with the initials t b whereas had it been brewers it must have been a b which conjecture certainly has probability enough to support it  the rest who have been at some pains to ascertain the truth in this business congratulate themselves upon having dodsleys positive authority that in addition to these two plays brewer wrote lingua now this happens not to be the truth for dodsley gives no positive opinion on the subject but says merely that winstanley has given this play to brewer but that langbaine will not allow it to belong to him which is all perfecly right in dodsley his business being to collect old plays belong to whom they might he therefore pledges himself to none of these opinions but on the contrary says that cromwell having performed at cambridge the part of tactus in the play which is a contention among the senses for a crown it has been foolishly said by winstanley langbaine and the rest to have inspired him with ambition as this anecdote is rather curious and has found its way into most of the accounts of this author improbable as it is it may not be amiss to notice that the part of tactus or touch which was allotted to cromwell has in it this extraordinary speech roses and bays pack hence this crown and robes my brows and body circles and invests how gallantly it fits me  sure the slave measured my head that wrought this coronet  they lie that say complexions cannot change my bloods enobled and i am transformed unto the sacred temper of a king methinks i hear my noble parasites stiling me caesar or great alexander licking my feet etc    this he is said to have spoken and felt with such force and energy that it bred in him the first ideas of that sanguinary ambition which began with blood was supported by terror and which at length calmed into melioration     to show the reader however how far this author merits so much contention and to what a degree he was so dangerous a rival to shakespeare lingua though it has some good writing is little better than one of the moralties the country girl is not known enough for any author to give a description of it and the love sick king was only preserved to be altered into a very poor piece called the perjured nun and as to the other three plays the very same authors who insist they were written by brewer give landgartha to burrell loves dominion to flecknoe and as to loves loadstone it has so lost its attraction if it ever had any they have not been able to find it at all so completely have they deserted the same of their their favorite and their own consistency which that it may be all of a piece has been so correct that they do not even know when brewer wrote for they make oliver cromwell act originally in lingua who must have been but eight years old when that play if it may be called so was published  of these authors i have perhaps given a more particular account than their merits or my limits warranted i had a mind however to notice as much of their celebrity as would serve to strengthen the reputation which the stage held in this early yet remarkable era but there were many other dramatic writers some of whom i shall slightly mention  barnes who was the son of a bishop and served in the army under the celebrated and unfortunate earl of essex wrote a play called the devilss charter in which he has endeavored to hand down to execration that most contemptible of all characters pope alexander the sixth he has framed his play upon the model of pericles prince of tire for having taken his story from guicciardini he makes him his interlocutor exactly as the other author conjures up gower the old english bard for the same purpose  to basker of whom we have little certain intelligence is attributed a play called the bloody banquet but with very little propriety perhaps because the initials j d are prefixed to it belchier drawbridgecourt wrote or translated a strange thing called hans beer pots invisible comedy so uncertain however is all the intelligence we procure concerning such authors particularly as they get more insignificant that this piece has been ascribed to nash  brown whose works were collected and published something more than twenty years ago wrote in      a dramatic piece called the inner temple masque campion a physician in the reign of james the first was author of two complimentary pieces in the style of those written by daniel cook wrote a comedy which dodsley has thought it worth his while to publish in his old plays it was called greens tu quoque and written in compliment to an actor who had a method of jeering or as it is called at this day of quizzing his friends by uttering comically those words heywood in his preface to the play gives this actor the following character there was not an actor of his nature in his time of better ability in his performance of what he undertook more applauded by the audience of better grace at court or of more general love in the city on the back of the title is this distich which shows that the actor as well as the author was then dead how fast bleak autumn changes floras dye what yesterday was green now is fear and dry    tailor wrote the hog has lost his pearl a strange comedy that dodsley has however to give an idea of the contrast between different early writers published also in his twelve volumes tomkis certainly wrote well and probably more than was attributed to him we can point to nothing however but albumazar from which dryden has accused jonson of having pilsered his alchymist this fact has been warmly disputed upon the old rotten ground of relying upon dates which in most of the writers substantiate that the alchymist was performed four years before albumazar but we have seen how vague these sort of authorities generally are and it is very unlikely that dryden should commit himself upon this subject without being perfectly satisfied of what he asserted  mason wrote a tragedy called meleastes the turk of which nothing is noticed but that the author had a better opinion of it than it deserved machin whose name has been rescued from oblivion by dodsley who published his comedy called the dumb knight hardly deserved that compliment for it is one of the worst in the collection sharpman is scarcely known and the poor glimmering of his merit that has reached us is through a borrowed light in the shape of a comedy called the fliere which he stole from marstons parasitaster  gosson wrote three pieces one of which was a morality they were not printed and what we know of them from report is vague and unimportant tourneur also wrote three pieces which we know as little about a cotemporary has of him this notable remark his fame unto that pitch was only raised as not to be despised nor over praised   wilkins wrote a piece called the miseries of enforced marriage which was very little celebrated although mrs behn thought it worth while to steal from it the plot of her comedy called the town fop leg wrote two plays which were performed at cambridge where he was twice vice chancellor so there can be but little doubt of their having succeeded they were not printed however nor can any account be given of them  these authors dymock barry and others make up all who during the time of shakespeare and jonson were publicly known as dramatic writers but there were anonymous plays produced to the number of about thirty besides those already mentioned some of which are now known and two or three of them are in dodsleys collection and now having pretty well cleared my ground i shall have better opportunity of giving fair play to jonson a review of the remainder of whose works await the readers attention  chap vi jonson resumed i shall now proceed to a final examination of the works of jonson who after the death of elizabeth produced one tragedy and nine comedies besides a great variety of occasional complimentary masks principally in quality of poet laureat  volpone or the fox was performed in   0  and has been generally considered as jonsons best production certainly the plot is upon a very meritorous principal and the characters are forcibly drawn a knave who feigns illness in order to impose upon knaves and cheat them of their money by working up their credulity into a belief that each shall become his heir is one of the boldest ideas of a character that can be conceived and yet moral justice is rendered more complete by making that knave imposed upon by another of yet superior cunning showing that the machinations of the wicked be they ever so subtle are constantly counteracted by the same devil that inspired them  the groop of characters that are introduced to work up those materials are full of contrast strength and nature would not one think it therefore very extraordinary that this piece even supported by admirable acting has never greatly succeeded nothing considered supersicially can be so unaccountable but when the subject is fairly investigated nothing can be more clearly comprehended quaint dry studied correctness unsupported by quickness spirit and fire can never satisfy the author in this piece conducts us into a uniform and protionable building presents us with an entertainment and introduces us to company but the apartments are cheerless vaults the viands are carved marble and the guests are statues  the same objections lie against the silent woman though upon the whole perhaps it is a better play for general approbation but it must not be denied that with the same faults it possesses at least the same perfections this piece is partly taken from ovid partly from juvenal and partly from plautus and therefore possesses the merit of an excellent imitation a quality jonson was better acquainted with than invention dryden has gone at large into an examination of this play but nothing can prove that it has that sterling attraction which begets for a dramatic production universal satisfaction not even that judicious and sensible alteration of it by colman which was brought out yet not with very warm success in      at drury lane  the case is altered performed in   0  is one of the poorest of this authors productions it is in some respects borrowed from plautus but does no great credit either to the original or the imitator in short it is one of those instances which we notice through all his works how bounded and contracted jonsons talents were which seldom reached to nature or her best imitators the greeks but were satisfied with copying those clumsy apes of them the romans what should we say of a sculptor who contentedly made michael angelo admirable as he was the exclusive model of his imitation forgetting or perhaps not knowing that such an artist ever existed as phidias  the alchymist was performed in    0 this comedy which was laudably written to ridicule a prevailing folly must no doubt have been greatly successful originally since we have seen it very much followed and admired during the time garrick ornamented the stage his incomparable performance however of abel drugger was a considerable drawback from the proper reputation of the author and in great measure the cause of the success of the play at the same time it must be confessed that the best acting can do nothing without good materials with which certainly the alchymist abounds  jonsons best position as the foundation of his plays has been the old proverb when knaves fall out honest men come by their own and this he has often successfully played upon in the present instance his knaves by not being very great rogues and by employing their art only to work upon credulity beget an uncommon interest and the audience almost applaud the waggery of face and the dry humor of subtle upon principle the alchymist however will probably never again be celebrated but this is more owing to the subject which of course grows every day in a greater degree obsolete than to any deficiency in its dramatic requisites although the insuperable objection to jonson in a degree prevails here as well as every where else for though his comic characters do not actually wear the buskin yet the sock has such high heels and is made of such stiff materials that the characters stalk instead of trip and thus we have quaintness for nature affectation for grace and awkwardness for ease the farther we search the more we shall have reason to support dryden in his opinion that the characters of the alchymist was borrowed from albumazar langbaine chooses to be neuter upon this subject but he does resort to the silly doctrine of dates to defend either opinion after all however we cannot doubt but dryden would never have made so positively and in such unqualified terms an assertion of this kind without the clearest proof but if there were any material doubt coxeter pretty well settles it by showing that albumazar was written at a very early period but that it was common on account of the manuscript being kept unprinted in the hands of the actors to date a play from the time it first made its way into the world from the press instead of the period when it was originally performed especially the productions of obscure authors and this easily finishes the business for tomkis being very little known found it difficult to get his play published while jonson took care no doubt to bring forward his productions not only immediately on their first appearance but with all possible pomp the lines in drydens prologue are these subtle was got by our albumazer that alchymist by that astrologer here he was fashioned and we may suppose he liked the fashion well who wore the clothes    bartholomew fair performed in      this strange play out of which might be framed the humor of half a dozen farces is fuller perhaps of comic characters than any thing that ever appeared on the stage we are given to understand that jonson wrote it purposely to ridicule the age in which he lived for the prevalent preference given to low wit instead of polished and refined writing if this was his motive he has outwitted himself for there is more nature in bartholomew fair than in any one of his other works but yet being as it is crammed full of extraneous and hetrogeneous incidents he has as much overshot the mark as he had come short of it in his cataline which this play was written purposely to defend that tragedy having nothing interesting in it on account of its dullness and declamation and this comedy on account of its wildness and extravagance  the devils an ass produced in      this comedy is not mentioned by any writer as having had extraordinary reputation the circumstance of giving the cloak to the husband for permission to make love to the wise is taken from boccace which has been since used in the magnifique and from thence borrowed by mrs centlivre parts of this play may be read with pleasure but no talents however able could give it a form that might entitle it to success on the stage  the staple of news this comedy which according to the date appeared originally in      was very probably soon discontinued for it has the fault of every man out of his humor and is conveyed to the audience through the medium of a grex there is in it what will be found every where in jonson found sense and shrewd observation but it is sense and observation couched in terms which though they may be written will never be spoken and it is this eternal objection to the pieces of this author that will ever keep them aloof from the theater  the new inn or the light heart this comedy made its appearance in      and was so ill received that jonson whose merit great as it was fell upon all occasions short of his insolence instead of wisely pocketing the affront and mending his errors whether in judgment or in calculation for the future printed his play with a libel against its actors and its auditors at its head the trait is curious and therefore i shall transcribe the title  the new inn or a light heart a comedy never acted but most negligently played by some of the kings servants and more squeamishly beheld and censured by others the kings subjects      now at last set at liberty to the readers his majestys servants and subjects to be judged  were not this a fact to which the world has borne testimony it could not be credited that a man of talents should be so contemptibly arrogant so pitifully vain so grossly ignorant of sound sense and decorous propriety as to erect himself into a despotic dictator in the empire of poetry and impudently announce that men ought to think and feel when and how he should think proper to give them leave or else like peters fiat in the tale of the tub be damned they and theirs to all eternity and yet this state strong as it may appear is not a particle short of the real truth for not content with the above pompous title by which one would think he forbad any reasonable being to read his play he prefixed to it a fort of anathema by way of an ode which i shall transcribe that my readers may judge him by his own words it is addressed to that god of his idolatry himself come leave the loathed stage and the more loathsome age where pride and impudence in fashion knit usurp the chair of wit inditing and arrainging every day something they call a play let their fastidious vain commission of the brain run on and rage sweat censure and condemn they were not made for thee less thou for them say that thou pourst them wheat and they will acorns eat twere simple fury still thyself to waste on such as have no taste to offer them a surfeit of pure bread whose appetites are dead no give them grains their fill husks draff to drink and swill if they love lees and leave the lusty wine envy them not their palate with the swine this accusation can never at any time nor upon any occasion obtain the taste of the town is frequently corrupted and vitiated and perhaps like a confirmed scrofula cannot be cured from some remaining scurvy taint fashion whim patronage or whatever administers to the reigning folly will do all this but it is always partial and like other alloys in life sets off the returning pleasure to newer advantage to brand therefore a whole kingdom for gross ignorance corrupt taste and the want of all feeling for which the head and heart are best distinguished and that because a single audience condemned a play be its merits what it might is a trait of superlative insolence that for the honor of genius certainly never was conceived nor executed but by the malignant mind and the caustic pen of jonson  no doubt some moldy tale like pericles this arrow was of course intended to glance at shakespeare and across the burning envy which lugged him into this folly a very left handed judgment induced him to point out the weakest play of his great rival but ben with all his anticipation of fame had no prescience indeed how should he look into time whose vanity hoodwinked him every hour he lived otherwise he would have seen that the weakest works of shakespeare were more calculated for the approbation of posterity than his strongest  and stale as the shrieves crusts and nasty as his fish  scraps out of every dish thrown forth and raked into the commontub may keep up the play club there sweepings do as well as the best ordered meal for who the relish of these guests will fit needs set them but the almesbasket of wit and much good do it you then brave plush and velvet men can feed on orts and safe in your stage clothes dare quit upon your oaths the stagers and the stagewrights too your peers of larding your large ears with their foul conne socks wrought upon twenty blocks which if they are torn and turned and patched enough the gamesters share your guilt and you their stuff leave things so prostitute and take the alcaeick lute or thine own horace or anacreons lyre warm thee by pindars fire and though thy nerves be shrunk and blood be cold ere years have made thee old strike that disdainful heat throughout to their defeat as curious fools and envious of thy strain may blushing swear no palseys in thy brain but when they hear thee sing the glories of thy king his zeal to god and his just awe over men they may blood shaken then feel such fleshquake to possess their powers as they shall cry like ours in sound of peace or wars no harp ere hit the stars in tuning forth the acts of his sweet reign and raising charles his chariot bove his wain at the end of the last stanza but one jonson though he has exhausted all the gall in his ink seems to shrink from his own cause and therefore shelters himself under the wings of monarchy in that which follows by which means in this damning ode where he so comfortably conceives he has eclipsed pindar and fulminated a fiat forbidding all poets to write from that moment he has emulated the bellman at christmas or rather the town crier who when he has cried down a runaway wife or apprentice whom he warns the world not to trust vociferates god save the king but however laudable upon proper occasions it may be for poets whether laureat or not to manifest their loyalty the poet in the present instance would have given the public a better idea of his confidence in his own cause if he had kept his eulogium for his next birth day ode    having written this ode jonson seems to have sit down contentedly under the blind idea that he had corrected the age and indeed so he had in one respect for he had convinced that public who had showered down numerous savours on him that he was unworthy so generous a protection in the idea however that what he had done was unanswerable he was so deceived that feltham an inferior poet produced a sort of parody on his ode or rather an answer to every article of it that threw him and his insolent pretensions most completely into ridicule attend to feltham come leave this saucy way of baiting those that pay dear for the fight of your declining wit it is known it is not fit that a sale poet just contempt once thrown should cry up thus his own i wonder by what dower or patent you had power from all to rape a judgment let us suffice had you been modest yad been granted wise it is known you can do well and that you do excel as a translator but when things require a genius and a fire not kindled heretofore by others pains as often you have wanted brains and art to strike the white as you have levelled right yet if men vouch not things apochryphal you bellow rave and spatter round your gall jugg pierce peek fly these were names by which jonson in his different satires meant to distinguish dramatic writers or performers  and all your jests so nominal are things so far beneath an able brain as they do throw a stain through all the unlikely plot and do displease as deep as pericles where yet there is not laid before a chambermaid discourse so weighed this hit is very neat and ridicules very aptly the absurdity of jonson who in the new inn makes a character address a chambermaid in language which has all the logic and subtilty of the schools as might have served of old for schools when they of love and valor told why rage then when the show should judgment be and know  this break is purposely made by feltham to ridicule ben for having done the same thing in the third stanza of his ode  ledge there in plush who scorns to drudge for stages yet can judge not only poets looser lines but wits and all their perquisites a gift as rich as high is noble posie yet tho in sport it be for kings a play it is next mechanics when it works for pay alcaeus lute had none nor loose anacreon ere taught so bold assuming of the bays when they deserved no praise to rail men into approbation is new to yours alone and prospers not for know fame is as coy as you can be disdainful and who dares to prove a rape on her shall gather scorn not love leave then this humor vain and this more humourous strain where selfconceit and choler of the blood eclipse what else is good then if you please those raptures high to touch whereof you boast so much and but forbear your crown till the world puts it on no doubt from all you may amazement draw since braver theme no phoebus ever saw   besides feltham there was scarcely a wit of that day who had not some some sling at this king log we have seen in the business of ford how many lampoons were levelled at him but nothing galled him more severely than sucklings session of poets in which this fashionable young but neat writer most successfully ridicules him for his presuming to be the pedagogue of his cotemporaries the following distich will serve as a specimen of the pleasantry that runs throughout the whole of the strictures he says ben broke silence  and told them plainly that he deserved the bays  for that his were called works while others were but plays   in this contest jonson deprecated his untoward fate for the blows he received were followed up so successfully that he never produced any thing afterward but the literary hue and cry was raised against him and he was brought forward to receive critical justice  the magnetic lady his next play scarcely made its appearance but the wits began to tear it to pieces like so many crows about a putrid carcass doctor gill master of st pauls school and ben pen in hand had a pitched battle in which the doctor though a man of no genius slogged his antagonist like a very schoolboy in the dispute as it always happens in these cases the public at first interested themselves but getting cool the merit of the piece for it had some sell unnoticed in the general indifference  a tale of a tub the last piece written by jonson escaped criticism in great measure by its insignificance writers however were not wanting to charitably deplore that falling off evidently manifested in the humor of this piece which exhibits nothing better than spirits drained to the very lees and which dryden calls the dotages of jonson some charitable friend should by this time have admonished this debilitated wit to have lain down a weapon which he was no longer able to wield but perhaps such counsel was wisely withheld lest the adviser and the advised should have acted the scene of gil blas and the bishop when macklin performed macbeth at the age of seventyfive shuter was asked in the green room what he thought of it to which this child of humor dryly answered sir the time has been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end   the various masks written by jonson in some of which we find sound poetry and good imagery were generally complimentary and in number about thirtyfour some of which however were mere trifles and others written solely for the amusement of the queen and her ladies who performed in them the subjects are generally political and servilely foisted in to keep him steady in his seat of laureat and as they were generally represented through the medium of superb decorations designed by inigo jones they can be considered taking them generally as nothing more than a vehicle to set off his ingenuity  thus have we seen in the works of jonson the prototype of the man they were full of fancied pomp weight and dignity affected justice truth and persuasion disguised rancour malice and envy and real meanness servility and adulation as a member of society he was haughty rude and overbearing as a friend mistrustful treacherous and unsafe and as a foe dark revengeful and dastardly  he was one of those who having no virtue in themselves hate virtue in others for he never could bear to be upon terms with any but those whom he despised while he flattered and who sucked in the nutriment for their vanity through his prostituted pen  manly open candid communication with mankind he disdained his repulsive mind could embrace nothing kind nothing fair nothing rational thus we see among all his connections he neither deserved nor kept a single friend and whether we mark him by his rank ingratitude to shakespeare who fostered him and licked his bearlike genius into form his poor and cowardly fears of decker marston chapman heywood ford and the rest his unprovoked insolence to cardinal perron who showed him so much civility in france his artful intrigues against daniel his unjust and wanton ridicule of inigo jones jonson could not bear that inigo jones should receive his share of fame for the decorations which indeed constituted the principal beauty of the masks and therefore ridiculed him in his bartholomew fair under the appelation of sir lanthern leatherhead  to whom he owed some of his best reputation his insolent and undutiful slander of his sovereign who had loaded him with benefits or by any other similar brand if these are a fair title to fame an honorable insignia of renown a legitimate claim on the gratitude of posterity if these exhibit a single construction of wise great good or rare let us quote his eulogium from his tomb and cry  o rare ben jonson we are told that even the burying of jonson in westminster abbey was obtained through a trick for that conscious of his slight pretentions to notice from mankind after his decease  exacted a promise before his death of a piece of ground twenty inches square for his resting place this done he ordered that his remains should be placed upright in the hole made of that dimensions with a stone bearing the inscription o rare ben jonson it is pretty evident that there is nothing of literal truth in this it is every word of it however figurative truth and admirably depicts the heart of a man who conscious of his own unworthiness and attaching to his fellow creatures that meanness rancour and suspicion which he found in his own mind endeavored to wrest from posterity by a miserable shift that fame to which genius and worth denied him an honorable claim   chap vii shakespeare resumed with the same pleasure that men return from exercising the common business of life to whatever object they consider as the reward of their toil do i now shake off less interesting pursuits in this labor to return to shakespeare the remainder of whose works i shall examine and notice such collateral circumstances relative to them as may best serve to show the foundation of their claim to that immortal rank they hold in the records of posterity  the first play according to the accepted dates that shakespeare produced after the death of elizabeth was measure for measure in which there are many and various traits of those inimitable beauties that pervade the writings of this boast of literature nothing can be managed with more art and understanding than the conduct of the deputed angelo who proud of his authority overstrides that very power of which he himself incurs the penalty  how beautiful is the scene where isabella pleads for her brother can any thing go beyond this ang your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words  isab alas alas why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have taken found out the remedy  and again oh it is excellent to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant    angelos soliloquy in which he deplores that he is caught in the same snare of the man whom he had condemned to die is admirable and shows with what judgment the duke pitches upon this weak irresolute and fallible character to rouse the sleeping laws of vienna while he himself stands by to prevent any serious mischief showing that when he shall come to exercise those laws himself how many strong motives will cry out in favor of lenity  angelos second scene with isabella where he unmasks under the idea that if she should refuse him and even proclaim his infamy the sanctity of his character will shield him with the world from all disagreeable consequences is again masterly  the dukes scene with claudio in which is the celebrated speech on the insignificance of life unmatchable but in shakespeare is remarkable for good conduct especially as it gives the duke an opportunity of listening to the conversation between isabella and her brother where she opens her heavenly mind in the language of angels especially in her defiance of that weak and irresolute brother for whom upon principles of honor she had pleaded where but in shakespeare shall we find such language as this is it not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sisters shame    but this is a vein more agreeable than proper to indulge for we must not here go into a dissertation on the beauties of shakespeare i shall therefore consider this circumscribed privilege rather as a favor than a right and use it as sparingly as possible and if i should sometimes catch myself at making too free with it i hope i shall be excused on account of the temptation  doctor johnson who has sometimes though not here manifested sound sense in his judgment of shakeshears plays says that the serious language of measure for measure has more labor than elegance if he looked in his own dictionary for the etymology of elegance which is there defined to be beauty without grandeur he is right for this language is sweetly beautiful and unaffectedly grand the noble virtue the true greatness and the feminine honor of isabella are every where conveyed through sentiments of responsive eloquence and the great and commanding justice of the duke who learns the temper of his subjects to govern them and who chooses for a wife the most amiable of those subjects are dressed in language no less consonant this surely is grandeur of language and therefore according to the doctor not elegance i hope he was aware of the compliment this negative praise would pay shakespeare to show how little credit is to be attached to the ipse dixits of great characters beauty is here by the doctor applied to language and in his dictionary he applies it only to objects thus to prove that there is no such thing as human infallibility celebrated opinions are perpetually at variance with general acceptations thus do lord chancellors reverse their own decrees and thus does even doctor johnson contradict his own authority being in this instance if we quote himself wrong in the application of two common words   he also says the plot is more intricate than artful this is surely a contradiction in terms can there be intricacy without art and is not a dramatic poets best art to keep his plot intricate but these are the criticisms of those who deal in epithets who weigh instead of feel and who in a fancied consideration of what they are unequal to themselves set up an imaginary standard of excellence for men whose genius is superior to their comprehension  the plot of measure for measure is admirable both as a public and a private moral the language is beautiful in the serious parts and easy and full of vicacity in the comic the characters are perfectly natural and well constructed and were the unity of time correctly observed a matter however in the present case of no moment it would be at all points a complete dramatic production  cymbeline performed in   0  against this wonderful production has the pen of doctor johnson blurted out a most unqualified and thoughtless denunciation his words are to remark the folly of the fiction the absurdity of the conduct the confusion of the names and manners of the different times and the impossibility of the events in any system of life were to waste criticism upon unresisting imbecility upon faults too evident for detection and too gross for aggravation  how much easier it is to say this than to defend it and how much more do these sour hasty envious strictures speak the snarling cynic than the candid critic suppose every word of this charitable declaration to be truth ought a man to be tried only by his faults will doctor johnson submit to this ordeal are there no beauties in cymbeline did not doctor johnson know that when garrick performed posthumus and for some years afterward particularly when powell came forward that it was the delight of the public and will samuel johnson so far imitate his exemplar ben as to say the public are a set of stupid idiots because they do not admit the infallibility of his ipse dixit but let us see if the facts to which these assertions relate will bear the doctor out  the characteristic of that fiction which serves the best purposes of morality which teaches suffering innocence to wait patiently its recompense which punishes vice and rewards virtue is not folly that conduct by which these ends are accomplished is not absurdity those events on which that conduct is founded are not impossibilities therefore so far the doctor is unsupported by truth nothing can be more moral more interesting more possible than the plot of cymbeline  if the punishment of the presumptuous iachimo the fool cloten and the wicked stepmother queen the reward of the sweetly enduring imogen and the generously mistaken posthumus the restoration of the disguised princes to their father who had been deceived and misled and the kingdom to peace and to happiness is not moral and truly those very circumstances which constitute the best purposes of the drama what is  such events as these may be conducted by means too intricate and i am the first to confess that these are the faults of this play but to say that they are so gross so unpardonable as we are taught by doctor johnson to believe and that cymbeline is therefore a mass of unresisting imbecility would be to write a libel upon the whole kingdom many of whom have the story bad as it is rivetted in their memories and can repeat numberless of the most beautiful passages in it by heart even voltaire is obliged to allow this why will not doctor johnson  the story of cymbeline is uncommonly dramatic and after all the cavilling in the world the utmost that can be said about it is that though the play has but one plot it has several episodes the outline of the plot however is perfectly simple and attempts at no more than what shakespeare has accomplished in his measure for measure and other plays the restoration of private happiness and public tranquillity  the tree it must be granted has many branches and yet it is extremely difficult to know where to lop lest not only deformity should succeed smyetry but that some vital part should be wounded pruning therefore was all that could be found practicable and this was so well done by garrick in a consultation of his friends that i believe it would be a difficulty to find a play on the stage that now as well as at the time doctor johnson saw it could be entitled to a greater degree of reputation lest i should unequivocally commit myself as one of those englishmen who according to voltaire can admire nothing but processions boxing and bullbaiting and who in particular on the stage are for daggers skulls ghosts and other objects of horror or they sleep i beg leave to say that though i may have pleasure now and then in baiting a bear or chastising a monkey i am an inveterate enemy to all auxiliary helps and think the stage poluted by such monstrous and unnecessary introductions and i have no objection to say that i am so fond of real dignity and simple greatness that were it not in places unnecessarily tame i should consider zara as a perfect model for correct tragedy but is this a reason that because there are subjects in their nature complex they are entirely to be thrust from the stage on the contrary if plots are not inexplicable where grandeur is intended no matter how much the author goes for an expansion of the mind and this is not a proof that the phlegmatic tempers of the english require to be roused by affecting objects but that their minds are capacious enough to admit whatever is interesting and grand instead of being satisfied with vapidity and refinement   the london prodigal performed in   0  as this play has with one voice been voted not to have been written by shakespeare my ipse dixit could be of little consequence were i to give a contrary opinion which however no man can do who takes the trouble to peruse it  it has been remarked that two things are extraordinary relative to this play one that it should be publicly acted at shakespeares own theater with his name affixed to it and the other that he should be so negligent of his fame as to suffer such an imputation to pass unnoticed the first if true would be extraordinary enough but there is no material proof of its truth and against mere report which i have frequently shown has been seldom upon these occasions to be relied on we have the positive evidence of our senses that it would be impossible for shakespeare to have admitted of a spurious piece that would either risk or assist his reputation the splendour of his talents and the rectitude of his conduct giving the lie completely to such a supposition and for the last if it was only imagined by the world in general to have been written by shakespeare it would have been an impeachment of those talents and that rectitude had he for a single moment thought it worth his while to refute the calumny  king lear produced in   0  to dwell upon beauties that all the world knows and feels is neither novel nor necessary as it is however impossible to withhold ones admiration of any thing singularly meritorious we are not only entitled to pardon but thanks for endeavoring by fresh observation to revive a subject that has given and will for ever give universal delight  upon this principal if we only bring to public recollection those beauties in this astonishing play on which they have so often dwelt and with so much pleasure offering the same prospects yet altering the lights and the shadows the merit of the subject may recommend the portrait to notice  in king lear the three grand ends of tragedy are completely effected pity terror and delight have an equal share of this admirable composition and sometimes one sometimes another and often all of these passions are excited in a manner masterly even to astonishment  can pity be more beautifully awakened than in the sufferings of the loyal and venerable gloucester the miseries unnaturally inflicted on the tender credulous choleric but noble lear or the unavailing filial piety of the angelic cordelia can terror be more tremendously roused than by the wickedness of goneril and regan or the blind adoption of edmund by gloucester can delight be more legitimately gratified than by the conquest of struggling virtue over inordinate vice  if these passions are called forth with all this vehemence with all this art and with all this truth how much must we admire the judgment with which they are applied it is not in tragedy who dies but who dies lamented and who execrated here are a knot of virtues best votaries of honors truest advocates they live to behold the discomfiture of their enemies but it is then too late to repair that ruin of which their imprudence had been the cause on the other hand the infamous set who had dared to put nature honor and decency at defiance fall execrated even by one another  lear in mind an angel in temper a man hopes by exercising an act of unparalleled generosity to be thanked and admired by all the world and in particular by those on whom he has conferred this extraordinary benefit he finds himself disappointed at setting out by the obstinacy of that daughter whom most he loved and from whom he expected the most unequivocal obedience he is naturally choleric and from that moment to the end of his life meeting with nothing but contradiction and provocation which is wound up to a paroxysm at losing cordelia whose duty he had just recognized and who comes to deliver him from his enemies life becomes a torment and his death is inevitable and conveys in a most solemn moral how much mischief may be caused by one single act of imprudence gloucester is in the same predicament  the rapidity yet the collectedness with which the mind accompanies the author from one situation to another is resistless and the conduct of the action is so correct and spirited that it does not sink for a single moment as for the discrimination the single circumstance of the distinction between the feigned madness of edgar and the real madness of lear is enough to stamp the judgment of the poet with superlative reputation  but what pen shall do justice to the language none but his own nor can any thing but quotations from shakespeare ever illustrate him when lear corrects his hastiness and flatters himself that cornwalls reason for not seeing him is indisposition not arrogance how charming are these lines may be he is not well infirmity does still neglect all office whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves when nature being oppressed commands the mind to suffer with the body    the epithet commands is exquisite how greatly majestic is the language of lear in the storm how grand are the first six words blow winds and crack your cheeks    the image conveyed in calling the flashes of lightening in the same speech vantcouriers to oakrending thunderbolts  is greatly poetic the next speech in which he deprecates the elements yet accuses them with joining with his daughters against a head so old and white as his is facinating as well as the beautiful transition no i will be the pattern of all patience i will say nothing    further on where he dares the guilty to face the storm and bear the admonitions of their own gnawing consciences is another happy and bold object in the groupe which again changes most felicitously to a consciousness of his own rectitude in the words i am a man more sinned against than sinning    as the reflections are more and more enduced by the objects of horror that surround him they become more and more poignant noble and profound what for simplicity for truth for grandeur and for conviction can exceed this filial ingratitude is it not as this mouth should tear this hand for lifting food to it  and then how melting is the following exclamation in such a night to shut me out  afterward upon the approach of another miserable object in edgar how natural and affecting is the question what have his daughters brought him to this pass  and upon kents saying he has no daughters death traitor nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters    what wonderful flights has this happy author hit off on the madness of lear what variety and wild truth is there in that speech with which he breaks in upon glosters saying is it not the king  lear ay every inch a king when i do stare see how my subjects tremble    having heated his ideas in the rest of his speech against adultery the transition give me an ounce of civit good apothecary to sweeten my imagination  is wonderfully happy after this says gloucester oh let me kiss that hand  lear let me wipe it first it smells of mortality    these are a very few of the beauties of lear a play that might erect a monument of fame not only for the author himself but for the country in which he wrote in short the faults of this play are trivial the merits are magnificent and the fair judgment on it may be reduced to this it is as its stands equal to any thing for the closet for even the fool though he retards the action is full of exquisite wit and with a very few judicious alterations it would make a most complete tragedy for the stage the piece however is certainly injured by the admitted alteration by tate because it takes away from the grandeur of the original plot and the justice of the catastrophe colman brought out at covent garden a better alteration but the idea of seeing the play end happily which is from the purpose of tragedy has now obtained and tate having the voice of the public in his favor it is very unlikely that any other alteration will be attempted  macbeth brought forward in   0  when we look at the many the extraordinary the exquisite beauties of lear it is something more than wonderful that on the following year shakespeare could produce macbeth a tragedy so well invented so greatly conducted and so inimitably written lear unites many interests and interests many passions macbeth illustrates one passion alone from which many interests issue and in this it is superior to lear because the single moral enforced is never absent from the mind  where shall we find ambition its terrible and destructive consequences and its dreadful and headlong downfall so vividly described here indeed is terror laudably and strongly excited it is little to say that there is nothing in literature equal to it we have seen monsters in nature going from one ferocity to another deface countries depopulate nations and stand like insatiate tigers grinning over their trembling prey but it was reserved for shakespeare to mould a man who had bought golden opinions of the world into a monster and gradually plunge him into such iniquity that his example one should think would banish ambition from the world for ever  thus the principal character in the picture is constantly held up to you always in a different attitude and each attitude more terrific than that which went before it when macbeth returned from the field where he had gloriously justified his sovereign and preserved his country his mind was occupied with reflections too noble to have hailed the honors that were thickening about him otherwise than by their fair and legitimate title nor till the devil in the shape of the weird sisters tempted him to his ruin and inspired his wife to forward their infernal purpose did he in the smallest degree shrink from his fealty  how beautifully manifest is this in his conflicts with himself he is first timid then wavering then determined then guilty and what is masterly even to wonder he neither sees his actual danger nor questions the ambiguity of his tempters till he has achieved the end of his ambition thus he hurries from desperation to desperation yet still retaining some faint color of his original nature through his numerous and sanguinary villainies he deplores his wickedness with philosophy and holds his courage to the last  as to keep up the constant excitement of terror and to warn the spectator into virtue is the great object of this tragedy so the means to attain that object are as astonishingly pursued as they are various and material the prophesy of the witches on the barren heath the temptation of lady macbeth the appearance of banquos ghost lady macbeths confessing her crimes in her sleep the deception of the witches in the cavern which opens his mind to the folly of his trusting the devil that had deceived him are the steps that gradually lead to that height of despair from which he can neither advance nor retreat and the few grains of pity at his fall which are mixed with universal execration make the example more terrible for they remind us that this fiend was a human creature  as to the language of macbeth take it for nature for truth for grandeur for pathos or indeed for any other particular excellence to read it is to rivet the attention and to taste it to compliment the understanding it would take a volume to describe its beauties and when the willing task were performed it would be as vain and as useless as to describe daylight  the imputed fault of this play is that its author has called in supernatural agents but though there are some writers that had better avoid this i believe all readers of taste will pardon it in shakespeare certainly credulity might have been played on through the medium of dreams and various other means but shakespeare has in macbeth given us a scottish story and therefore introduced us to people who had a strong belief in witches second sight and who indulged themselves in other superstitious whims besides to warn the weak and credulous against illusive predictions was here most laudable and this even doctor johnson defends who says shakespeare was right to do this though some parts of this expedient may now seem improbable this is not the only place where the doctor has inclined toward a belief of the real existence of supernatural beings and their influence over mankind in his prince of abyssinia and his tour to the hebrides it is pretty manifest and indeed however he may in different places have abused admissible and sometimes beautiful passages in shakespeare he has generally forgiven his slights to fairy land and those truly happy creations which though in doctrine they inculcate illusion in writing please and astonish the fancy   but let me be forgiven for indulging myself in a few quotations i shall not follow any chain but take them at random macbeth thus argues with himself he is here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself besides this duncan has borne his faculties so meek has been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpet tongued against the deep damnation of his taking off    this hesitation induces lady macbeth to fortify his mind with most diabolical firmness she reminds him of his oath and says i have given suck and know how tender it is to love the babe that milks me i would while it was smiling in my face have plucked the nipple from its boneless gums and dashed the brains out had i but so sworn    how wonderfully admirable is the epithet in the second line the babe that milks me nor must we forget the speech of lady macbeth in which are these words look like the innocent flower but be the serpent under it    after he has committed the murder how awfully beautiful are these words methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care the death of each days life sore labors bath balm of hurt minds great natures second course chief nourisher in lifes feast    when macbeth reflects how much more happy are the murdered innocent than the living murderer he says better be with the dead whom we to gain their place have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless extacy duncan is in his grave after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done its worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further    in the fifth act when macbeth driven to the toil and hopeless begins to feel the approaches of despair and looks every where in vain for a resource he deplores his misspent life in these words my may of life is fallen into the fear the yellow leaf and that which should accompany old age as honor love obedience troops of friends i must look to have    and afterward to the doctor can thou minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff that weighs upon the heart    then this reflection when the queen is dead tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing    upon his hearing of the approach of birnan forest he utters in despair if thou speak false upon the next tree shall thou hang alive till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth i care not if thou do for me as much i pull in resolution and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lied like truth    i shall here restrain my pleasure and leave these passages from macbeth warm with the reader to speak its commendation  after so much violent exercise of the mind no wonder shakespeare should in his next production feel himself inclined to treat a comic subject the taming of the shrew came out the same year as macbeth on which comedy i shall have the less to say having already described its merits when i spoke of it in opposition to fletchers play of the womans prize it has great merit as the world can witness for me but its grand fault is that there are in it two plots instead of a plot and an episode and therefore the whole play never had brilliant success the comedy however which we know under the title of catherine and petruchio and which is an alteration by garrick from shakespeare is perfect in all its parts and will no doubt be constantly a favorite with the public as long as true humor is considered as a requisite in comedy  of julius caesar which play shakespeare produced the following year the critics have complained because that warriors death did not make up the catastrophe of the piece had this been the case however the author must have used in every respect different materials and have wrought his piece upon an entirely different plan for it was not his intention merely to show the workings of the conspiracy till its meditated consummation and there leave it but to display the consequences of that assasination  as these however are fairly wrought up and productive of great interest and variety i believe there are few who regret that shakespeare took this course for one thing it would have been a pity to have lost the speeches of brutus and antony over the body of caesar which contain perhaps some of the most sterling oratory to be found in any language not excepting the contention of ajax and ulysses for the armor of achilles  it must be confessed the unities are all broken and there is much extraneous matter brought into the piece but the inimitable beauties that so thickly pervade it spring out of these circumstances nor do we so much incline to cavil at this inconguity since we see through it treason discomfitted and the death of caesar revenged  but if upon the whole the features of this tragedy are more massed than shaped we are greatly recompensed by peculiar beauties however extraneous the scene of brutus and portia though it comes to nothing is very fine so is that of caesar and calphurnia and perhaps there never was a grander picture of the infirmity of human nature than the quarrel and reconciliation of brutus and and cassius the very ghost of caesar is awful in the extreme and so intimidates the army of the conspirators that it may properly be said caesar is his own avenger  upon the whole consider this play as a regular tragedy it is faulty in many points consider it as historical it is supportable but consider it as an effort of genius and it is incomparable  a yorkshire tragedy produced in   0  is by some attributed to shakespeare as however all his commentators except mr steevens have agreed to reject it to avoid unnecessary cavil we will agree so far with them as to say that it seems to stand in a predicament something between pericles and locrine for though there are evidently many images which appear to have emanated from the mind of shakespeare those passages seem rather to have been written for the assistance of another than that the whole belonged to himself let the belief however rest either way the merit of it cannot assist any more than the imperfections of it can diminish his reputation  anthony and cleopatra was performed   0  this play from which was formed the materials for drydens all for love a tragedy of most inimitable beauty in many instances however transcends it and would never probably have been touched by that exquisite poet had not the unities been so ill pursued in shakespeare that the mind cannot accommodate itself to such a stretch of probability  shakespeares play takes in part of the life of fulvia her death anthonys return to rome his marriage with octavia his return to cleopatra the battle of actium anthonys death and cleopatras captivity and death and if the question had been for an author to have wrought interest out of complexity shakespeare has greatly accomplished this end for in the words of doctor jonson the continual hurry of the action the variety of incidents and the quick succession of one personage to another call the mind forward without intermission from the first act to the last  it must however be confessed this interest is more extraneous than collected or rather there are a number of broken interests which spring more from novelty than reflection thus though there are many great and admirable particular beauties the conduct is disjointed and the pleasure we receive it distracted by perpetual interruption  the characters of the piece are well drawn you see in antony in rome the same artful orator that stirred the romans against the assassins of caesar and in egypt the fond the doting the credulous lover that lost his world by gazing the imbecility of lepidus is as powerfully drawn and so is the cunning of octavius caesar who deposes lepidus at pleasure and makes the injuries of his sister a pretense to destroy his more noble but infatuated rival  cleopatra is drawn in a yet more masterly style and lest we should sail to lose her enticing image for a moment the description of antonys meeting her upon the river cydnos speaks a history of her and all such voluptuous sirens the burnished gold that burnt on the water the flutes that kept time to the oars the purple sails the silk tackling she reclining in her pavillion the boys like smiling cupids fanning her her nymphs like nereides the incense that perfumed the air all combine to conquer the conqueror antony  this is her first stroke of art afterward by how many matchless graces does she enslave him and unfortunately every way for antony his first wife was ugly and his second he married merely to patch up a truce with octavius caesar who afterward consolidated the empire in himself and acquired the title of augustus by working on the different weaknesses of antony and lepidus  the whole of cleopatras conduct is consistently worked up the same ingredients are every where infused and ardent love quick jealousy unconquerable pride conscious dignity and conscious levity are evident in every look word and motion and therefore her language is made to consist of rapture reproach haughtiness eloquence and blandishment this portrait of her we receive at the hands of shakespeare and whether we see her parting from antony studying to endure his absence receiving the news of his second marriage greeting him on his return provoking him to fight by sea at actium consoling him on his defeat playing him false with caesars ambassador luring him into security helping him on with his armor congratulating him on his victory by land enduring his death resolving her own each scene each speech has a share of these and other corresponding qualities  there are some admirable subordinate points most nobly introduced among these are caesars cool reception of those friends who have fallen off from antony the apostasy and compunction of enobarbus and that exquisite trait of honor in pompey who when he is persuaded by menas aboard the galley to dispose of antony caesar and lepidus and be conqueror of the world greatly rejects the offer because they are his guests in these words all this those should have done and not have spoke of it in me it is villainy in thee it had been good service    but those who would know the admirable and various beauties of this greatly meritorious production must read it and it will then be found that whatever general faults it may have in its component parts as one piece it has particular excellence enough to furnish materials for the whole reputation of any reasonable author  coriolanus performed in   0  men of extraordinary genius choose sometimes unproductive subjects to work upon in order to show with what art and management they can conquer the most irreconcilable difficulties to reduce the history of coriolanus into a play was one of those labors which our dramatic hercules has achieved in a most wonderful manner but after all the labor is scarcely worth the pains for except the singularly noble character of coriolanus there is nothing correctly great in the piece  the high spirit of volumnia is neither greatness nor dignity it is merely loftiness she conceives herself a spartan mother and would sacrifice every thing to her sons honor and she persuades him to debase himself by flattering the people to obtain the consulship and when upon nobly disdaining to follow such unworthy advice he is banished that country which he had preserved and driven by its ingratitude to take up arms against it she once more tries her influence over him by which means a slavish peace is patched up for rome which terminates in the triumph of his enemies and the accomplishment of his death by the ungrateful volcians whom he had imprudently served  thus there is nothing effectual nor justifiable taken upon poetic ground in the catastrophe menenius with all his friendship and good nature is set down where he was taken up he neither does good nor harm the tribunes sicinius and brutus who deserve more the tarpeian death than coriolanus does banishment instead of being punished live and are happy and volumnia virgilia and her children exist to deplore the death of the son the husband and the father and the folly of having intruded on him their officious weak and unavailing virtue  if shakespeare had departed from history this play with a very little trouble to him would have been complete even to perfection who does not see that if the volcians had bravely resisted the calumny of aufidius punished him for his perfidy and made the restoration of coriolanus to his country the terms of a lasting and honorable peace the catastrophe would have been correctly poetical and that a most patriotic moral would have been inculcated  as it is however one very strong lesson is enforced that it is impossible to serve the ungrateful and that the punishment of the wicked may be safely trusted to the hands of fate  for the language the beauties of shakespeare are always resplendant and his diction always appropriate which we shall constantly find in this play whether we trace the mind of the truly noble coriolanus the fondly proud volmunia the dastardly envious aufidius the simply honest menenius or the rascally artful tribunes whose base minds never could forgive such taunts as these your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favors swims with fins of lead and hews down oak with rushes    but i shall not have space for extracts and must therefore refer the reader to the play  we have next in timon of athens which was brought out in    0 a kind of coriolanus of another species as fortunately handled and more happily conceived because private and domestic virtue is more a subject for the heart than public and patriotic the ingratitude of which coriolanus has to complain is from his country that of timon is from his friends one subject therefore is grand the other pathetic one great the other interesting  it is on this account that timon of athens arrests the attention to a degree of facination and yet timon is not so much pitied as that ingratitude is deplored for there is a degree of oftentation annexed to his character and therefore his liberality has a species of prodigality in it and his generosity is rather splendor than munificence  all these shades of distinction shakespeare has most beautifully preserved and indeed it seems every where to have been his darling study rather to warn men against imprudence which may be avoided or at least remedied than the vices issuing from it which when once committed are hopeless and without remedy  timon gives but we hear nothing of his relieving the distresses of honest poverty necessitous virtue or unrewarded merit and therefore he is not munificent he is vulnerable to flattery and pays the price of it he gives to those who have enough already he lavishes till his coffers are empty and his lands mortgaged to pamper those he knows to be undeserving this is not munificence  but this is not all he is aware of the ruin he seeks he falls by choice nor is it necessary his follies are so glaring so palpable so known to himself that his amiable and friendly steward should persuade him or the blunt apemantus rail him out of his imprudence  this however does not palliate the infamy of their ingratitude who pampered and enriched by his bounty desert him in his distress the stamp of their apostasy of their villainy of their meanness is indelible they are as timon himself styles them courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears trencher friends times flies cap and knee slaves vapors and minute jacks  thus all the punishments and rewards are equitable timon suffers for his imprudence he is ruined by prodigality and folly and requited by vexation and disappointment the athenians are scourged and are sunk into shame and remorse at the recollection of their ingratitude to timon and alcibiades the destruction of whose mutual enemies is insisted on as the guarantee of peace with athens nay even their own gold which they had penuriously hid is made the instrument of their chastisement at the very hands of those they had wronged for it is found by timon and applied to encourage the army of alcibiades  the warmth and spirit of the language in many places has no parallel even in shakespeare but its great beauty is its consistency timon always in extremes execrates the whole human race for ingratitude he has experienced only from the athenians while apemantus constitutionally a misanthrope makes no distinction between timon in prosperity or adversity but rails at his folly in both situations and tells him rude but honest truths  when timon in the first act tells him he is proud he says he is proud of nothing so much as that he is not like timon when he asks him to dine no says he i eat not lords and afterward to the poet speaking of timon he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy labor he that loves to be flattered is worthy of the flatterer he says to timon at the dinner i scorn thy meat twould choke me for i should never flatter thee  and then for proof of his sincerity he thus aprostrophizes o you gods what a number of men eat timon and he sees them not it grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one mans blood and all the madness is he cheers them up too    when he meets timon in the woods how severely but how truly does he rate him this is in thee a nature but affected a poor unmanly melancholy sprung from change of fortune why this spade this place this slavelike habit and those looks of care thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft hug their diseased perfumes and have forgot that ever timon was    the language of timon is all blandishment in prosperity all execration in adversity and shakespeare has done well in making apemantus say to him the middle of humanity thou never knew  at the banquet while his own heart is open and he strives in bounty to outdo friendship he says to those who as apemantus properly remarks are eating him up i have told more of you to myself than you can in modesty speak in your behalf what need of friends if we should have no use for them they are the most needless things living and would resemble sweet instruments hung up in their cases that keep their sounds to themselves  in adversity he is altogether serocious and pursue him from his denunciation of the athenians to the digging of his grave we find the same consistent steady hate equally headstrong equally falacious and equally indiscriminate  his disappointment when he is digging for roots and finds gold is greatly conceived and his extravagant exclamation in consequence of it is admirably fine he says as he digs there is nothing level in our cursed natures but direct villainy himself timon disdains destruction fang mankind earth yield me roots who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate with thy most operant poison what is here gold yellow glittering precious gold no gods i am no idle votarist roots you clear heavens thus much of this will make black white soul fair wrong wright base noble old young coward valiant ha ye gods why this what this ye gods why this will lug your priests and servants from your sides will knit and break religions bless the accursed make the hoar leprosy adored    next in the scene with alcibiades to whom he is thankless though his wrongs are one motive of his revenge warrest thou against athens  alcib ay timon and have cause  tim the gods confound them all in thy conquest and thee after when thou have conquered  alc why me timon  tim that by killing of villains thou wast born to conquer my country  here is gold go on be as a planetary plague when jove will over some high viced city hang his poison in the sick air    the whole of this scene is wonderfully written being left alone he says as he resumes his digging that nature being sick of mans unkindness should yet be hungry common mother thou whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast teems and feeds all whose self same mettle whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puffed engenders the black toad the adder blue the gilded newt and eyless venomed worm with all the abhorred births below crisp heaven whereon hyperions quickening fires does shine yield him who all thy human sons does hate from out thy plenteous bosom one poor root    numberless traits of this nature may be sound in this admirable piece of exquisite writing with one more of which i must content myself when timon through the representation of his steward finds himself reduced to ruin he exclaims with astonishment to lacedemon did my land extend    to which he receives from the steward this affectionate reproof oh my good lord the world is but a world were it all yours to give it in a breath how quickly were it gone    we come next to the best play upon the whole of shakespeare and saying this it naturally follows that it is the best the world can produce othello was performed in      works of great merit which carry with them the criterion of excellence soar so far above praise that the ablest pens and the warmest inclinations are inadequate to do them justice and even doctor johnson has handsomely allowed that the beauties of this play impress themselves so strongly upon the reader that they draw no aid from critical illustration  the more resplendant however great and astonishing objects are and the admiration of them is diffused and general the more do they extort from us involuntary praise they are like our common salutations on the blessings of health and the beauty of the weather which though they are simple and self evident are always eloquent because they are sincere and heartfelt  to describe the noble vivid and honest mind of the honorable and abused othello violent in his love slow in his suspicious and terrible in his revenge must be done invariably by every writer in the same language for there cannot be two ways of explaining what every body have agreed upon  the subtle fullen studied villainy of the cold blooded iago insensible to honor friendship and gratitude who laughs at conscience spurns at generosity and wounds virtue and the sweetly innocent desdemona who having in the choice of her husband given proof of boundless confidence and disinterestness and therefore cannot conceive the posibility in nature of her being suspected are known and acknowledged for characters as critically natural and as warmly interesting as they are masterly drawn  even the subordinate characters are full of interest the brave and generous cassio who little suspects any ill effects from the confidence he unwarily places in an insidious villain is made subservient to the malignant plot against othellos peace of mind in which roderigo is the plyant tool that his credulity and vanity completely fit him for nor is aemilia without a considerable share of consequence in the groupe for without her the infamous purposes of her diabolical husband would not be completed nor his detection accomplished  in short for truth of character knowledge of human nature interest gradually developed and greatly wrought up that continually varies occupies and attracts and that leaves the mind satisfied and the judgment convinced there never has been among all the critics worth notice more than one voice upon the subject of this play and the utmost that has been advanced at all against it is the infraction of the unities which it is agreed would have been sufficiently remedied if the scene had been lain in cyprus for my own part and i believe i am not singular in my opinion as the scene of othello and desdemona before the senate contains interest and language which has been the delight and wonder of all hearers and readers i am very well content that the unities in othello broken as they are should remain as we find them in shakespeare  as for the language i dare not trust myself with an examination of it for fear of getting into unwarrantable length those who wish to know and feel its merit must read the whole play for there is scarcely a passage in it that has not some remarkable beauty i shall however be excused perhaps for noticing a few of the most admired scenes  the scene of the senate where othello delivers his round unvarnished tale is for declamation one of the finest things in the world which might easily be proved by a comparison with the ancients but that it would be too elaborate for my purpose those who wish to make the experiment will when the task is accomplished range on my side and to go to the fountain head for truth for glow for strength for nature they will not find a cause so pleaded throughout the whole iliad admirable as that poem is and this admitted what a glorious thing it would have been for literature had shakespeare written an epic poem in blank verse  shakespeare in this scene does not blink the question he admits the strange improbability that a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself  should fall in love with what she feared to look on    thus it is not wonderful brabantio should conceive that othello had practiced witchcraft upon her but when with honest unaffected truth he has related that he won her by an artless tale of the danger he had past which she said was pitiful was wondrous pitiful and the duke instantly exclaims i think this tale would win my daughter too    with perfect good sense he utters these words if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man    but when desdemona in most unqualified terms confesses that she loves othello that her heart was subdued even to the very quality of her lord that she saw othellos visage in his mind and that to his honors and his valiants parts she consecrated her soul and fortune no circumstance of objection remains  this however is the foundation of what is to follow nothing can get over a degree of capriciousness in the conduct of desdemona for says iago what delight can she have to look upon the devil and it is impossible but a consciousness of a disparity between them must often occur to othello who though not easily jealous by trifles light as air that are confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ is at length perplexed in the extreme a prescience of all this brabantio seems to have had when he parts from them look to her moor have a quick eye to see she has deceived her father and may thee    these words are spoken in the presence not only of othello but iago who afterward makes a a notable use of them and though othello answers my life upon her faith    yet that they sink into his mind and remain latent there till they come in contact and are called into action by iagos arts is evident for when iago remarks that in her not affecting many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural othello after having struggled with his suspicions exclaims why did i marry so that in this play shakespeare has again inculcated that grand lesson for human nature to beware of imprudence  never was any thing managed with such art and nicety as the circumstances which create the jealousy of othello shakespeare knew he had a noble mind to overthrow and he has managed it by artful gradual and natural means cassio is pitched upon by iago as the principal tool to whom roderigo and aemilia are subordinate  cassio is noble generous brave and handsome he was privy to the loves of othello and desdemona and has outstept iago in promotion who then so proper to be the instrument of his interest his hatred and his revenge but this were not enough if roderigo did not provoke him to quarrel and aemilia to steal the handkerchief upon these confirmed facts iago ventures to assert others till at length the moor perplexed in the extreme like the base judean throws a pearl away richer than all his tribe  when he sees cassio steal away from desdemona out of conscious shame for the fault that he was betrayed into by iago the artful villain exclaims i like not that and this first rouses the suspicions of oehello who is unconsciously from that moment jealous the quick progress of which passion he strongly feels in his notice that iago echoes him by heaven he echoes me as if there was some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown thou did mean something i heard thee say but now thou likdst not that when cassio left my wife what did not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed and did contract and purse thy brow together as if thou had shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit    how well immediately afterward does the noble unsuspecting nature of othello burst forth as he describes unconsciously both what iago is and what he thinks him i know thou art full of honesty and weighst thy words before thou givst them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom    iago takes this very hint and lest he should be taken for such a knave which knave he is though othello cannot suspect him to be so he says perhaps his thoughts are vile that he is vicious in his guess and that it is his natures plague to to spy into abuses therefore says he it were not for your quiet nor for your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts    he next to show how tenderly reputation ought to be handled exclaims who steals my purse steals trash it is something nothing twas mine it is his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed    wrapped up in his best securitys othellos good opinion he cautions him to beware of jealousy and having at length set him upon the rack appears as if put to the torture himself to be wrought upon by his friendship to a reluctant confession of what it was all along his aim to make othello draw from him he then opens his pretended suspicions hints his doubts of cassio bids othello remember quoting brabantios words that desdemona had deceived her father marrying him and when by these and other infidious arguments he has shook the whole soul of the brave moor he most artfully utters with affected simplicity and compassion i see this has a little dashed your spirits    to which his heart bursting he answers with constrained coolness not a jot not a jot    the whole scene is wrought up in the same masterly manner till iago has made such an inroad to othellos heart that it is vulnerable every where and trifles light as air corrode and burrow in it the succession of circumstances that gradually heighten the plot from this moment are management itself othello is confirmed in every thing but the truth iago is a fellow of exceeding honesty and desdemonas to be whistled off and let down the wind to prey at fortune she comes and he exclaims that if she be false heaven mocks itself  next he is on the rack and vents his fury against iago who at least he thinks officious what sense had i of her stolen hours of lust i found not cassios kisses on her lips he that is robbed not knowing what is stolen let him not know it he is not robbed at all    and again in despair oh now for ever farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue    then the transition from despair to extacy  villain be sure you prove my love a whore make me to see it or at least to prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life  in this paroxysm he rages higher and higher till iago knowing his right cue undertakes to give him the proof he requires and the dream and the disposition of the handkerchief work him to such a pitch that against cassio he exclaims oh that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge    this calls up an apostrophe to vengeance and the conclusion is that iago undertakes the death of cassio and othello goes apart to furnish himself with some swift means of death for the fair devil    previously however conferring on iago the first symptom of his reward by making him his lieutenant  if we go on to the scene where othello taxes desdemona with the loss of her handkerchief this circumstance has been frequently attempted to be ridiculed but no man in sense or reason can condemn it for the use shakespeare has made of it is full of art and management the business was apparently to make desdemona give cassio some present and the merit lay in its being a trifle for any thing of more consequence would have brought on a serious refutation there is an anecdote which has been told in support of those who are disposed to treat this circumstance lightly two frenchmen were at drury lane to see barry in othello and when he spoke in this scene with desdemona the following words which he did most admirably there is magic in the web of it a sybil that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sewed the work the worms were hallowed that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserved of maidens hearts    one of the frenchmen asked the other whether he could discover what had put the actor in such an extacy the other who just understood english enough to know the circumstance but not to taste the application replied  mais mon dieu monsieur il a perdue son mouchoir  ah ha said the other with great gravity  cest bien dommage upon spectators as ignorant of the drift of this admirable circumstance as these frenchmen it might be thrown away but had they known for what purpose it was introduced they would have been forward to have acknowledged its propriety for the happiest effects on the french theater are all produced by trifles light as air taking it however at the best for these cavillers their anecdote is of very little use in this case for had it meant nothing more than simply the losing the handkerchief the exclamation might have still been strongly in point for as frenchmen all take snuff such a loss must naturally be considered by them as a serious misfortune    she perpetually reiterating the restoration of cassio and he demanding his present which he says was given to his mother by an egyptian who told her that while she kept it it would make her amiable and subdue her husband entirely to her love but that if she lost it or made a gift of it his eye should hold her loathly we shall still see the same art and management again in the next scene with iago where he is wrought into a frenzy after this comes the scene with lodovico when he reads the letter from venice which calls him home and deputes cassio in his stead a cunning stroke in the author for it gives desdemona a fresh opportunity of soliciting their reconciliation this he cannot bear he struggles with the conflict till provoked beyond his reason he strikes her her meekness duty and resignation enrage him still more and the speeches uttered in broken sentences where he is stung to death at her fancied infidelity and cassios real advancement though at the same time he strives to keep down his lively feelings leave him an object of astonishment to the characters of pity to the spectators and of horror to himself  says lodovico is this the noble nature whom passion could not shake    the next scene with desdemona is greatly managed he is now every way wrought up and and it is impossible though his interview is for the purpose of knowing the truth that she can dress it in language to be believed aemilia has just said if any wretch has put this in your head let heaven requite him with the serpents curse for if she be not honest chaste and true there is no man happy    but it is too late what answers othello to this she says enough yet she is a simple bawd that cannot say as much    after this of what avail can be all the protestations of the poor unhappy devoted creature herself it is this which makes the scene so warmly interesting we know that it is not in rhetoric to move him and that the more truth stares him in the face the more the phantom that haunts him dresses it in the garb of falsehood and yet we flatter ourselves that he will be undeceived  innocence consciousness and rectitude weigh nothing he deplores the falsehood he believes and will not see the verity that solicits him he is distracted at the ingenuous sweetness he fancies she puts on and is confirmed in his rooted suspicions by the very courage with which she meets his unmerited ingratitude his nature suffers but a false pride tempts him to false justice and nothing can now prevent her fate  desdemonas scene with aemilia and afterward with the inexorable villain iago are beautifully tender and irresistibly melting her sweet lamentations are exquisite iagos hypocrisy is happy and aemilias quick resentment in which shakespeare has most fortunately blended the amiable in the virago is truly the ebulition of an honest enraged feminine heart  she says that some eternal villain has devised the slander to which iago replies if any such there be heaven pardon him  aemil a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones the moors abused by some villainous knave o heaven that such companions thoudst unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascal naked through the world    we are now ripe for the catastrophe which if it has any fault is too shocking desdemonas ordering her wedding sheets to be put on the bed is mournfully moving and the laboring of othellos swelling heart while he meditates the murder is awful to astonishment it is the cause my soul i will not shed her blood yet she must die put out the light and the consequent remarks upon these broken phrases are highly interesting  desdemonas waking her inviting othello to bed her gradual apprehensions and at length her reading her fate in his eyes which she says are fatal when they roll are full of dread and terror these sensations increase as her justification of herself induces her to call for cassio to undeceive him for this brings to the recollection of othello the orders he had given iago des what is he dead  oath had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all  des alas he is betrayed and i undone    nothing upon earth can breathe the language of an innocent and injured mind more than this last line but how can the tortured soul of othello see this out strumpet weepst thou for him to my face    her fate is now inevitable his rage is at its utmost and the dreadful consequence follows  in the next scene with emilia which is requisite to the detection of iago a strong interest is still kept up the faithful creature hurt to death at the scene before is all heart and when othello confesses that iago set him on she exclaims my husband say that she was false  oath thy husband honest honest iago  aem if he say so may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart she was too fond of her most filthy bargain    all the rhapsody that follows is equally warm vivid and forcible the other characters are attracted by the alarm the credulous moor is undeceived and the detested iago doomed to the torture othellos death is but too necessary and he falls admired censured and lamented or in his own better words an honorable murderer  there are yet two plays of shakespeare to be examined the tempest which appeared in      and twelfth night produced in      the first is a fresh instance of the creative fancy of this incomparable writer and the other a fair and most humourous description of natual manners  perhaps nothing can be superior to the great diversity extensive variety the opposition of intelligent to vulgar characters acriel to earthly the admirable judgment the philosophic grandeur and the strong justice that mark the tempest or the elegant nature the true humor the whimsical equivoque the neat point the irresistible pleasantry that characterize twelfth night  in the tempest the noble revenge of prospero the fallen ambition of alonzo and antonio and the union of ferdinand and miranda are strong circumstances and as greatly treated as they are poetically conceived the magic is of that kind which in shakespeare we are impelled to call natural and the distinction between the sprite ariel and the monster caliban could originae from no other mind upon the whole there is such a mixture of grandeur pathos nature pleasantry and interest that at the same time every curiosity is on tip toe every wish is gratified  as to the language i could with much pleasure and without any difficulty get myself into the same scrape as i did in the examination of othello but i must put a curb on my inclination not however without noticing that from this play the critics have very judiciously selected the properest speech in the works of shakespeare or indeed in the empire of letters to serve for his epitaph as i wish as much that the errors of shakespeare when they appear to be material or have generally been considered so should meet investigation as to have his beauties were it possible enumerated i think it highly necessary to notice here the censure that has been past on his ignorance of nautical terms as they are applied in this play which censure has been played off as unsparingly as ignorantly i agree that drydens sea terms are much more correct and even more poetical than those of shakespeare and whoever reads his annus mirabiles must acknowledge that he even exceeds in many places the celebrated poem of the shipwreck by falconer not however without having run himself into quaintness but navigation was a very different thing at the time of dryden and of shakespeare in that interval we had been taught in great measure nautical tactics by the french which again we had improved upon and i very much question whether a young post captain made at this time though in every respect an admirable seaman would be able to describe in what manner sir walter raleigh maneuvered a fleet if this be true it will be extremely difficult to to detect inaccuracy in mere techenical words which in every profession are perpetually varying we are told that shakespeare talks of the masters whistle although there is a boatswain aboard but there is not so much impropriety in this upon examination for as there are different grades in the army from the ensign to the colonel and the sergeant to the major so there are in the navy from the midshipman to the admiral and the under mates of different descriptions to the master and to prove the immediate connection between the master and the boatswain the french have no other term for boatswain but contremaitre thus the whistle is effectively the whistle of the master since it is as much used by his command as the drum is by the command of the major when he takes out the battalion and to which we may add that different nations have different modes the vessel in question belonged to naples and it is known that there we find brigantines schooners xebecs bilanders galliots and others that go in the catalogue for ships and that they have different sails and consequently different officers this apparent mistake therefore however it might shock the ears of a midshipman of the present day might for ought we know to the contrary be both figuratively and literally right at the time of shakespeare for the rest of his phrases though not fashionable are easily understood take in the topsail is a very good phrase especially as the wind increases and it is a good preparation for down with the topmast which is the next word of command he might to be sure have said which topsail and which topmast but this is mere cavil for he says immediately afterward bring her to try under maincourse now bring her to try the situation being a storm is an admirable phrase and under maincourse means without doubt under the mainsail for the lower sails are the courses and to prove that he not only is correct but that he understood pretty well what was to be done with a vessel in such a situation having set the mainsail after the topsail is lowered the next command is lay her a hold which is what we understand now to be keep a good hold of the land but instantly upon finding this difficult the orders are suddenly altered to set the two courses off to sea again lay her off confirming the fourth speech in the play blow till thou burst thy wind if room enough which by the way is a sailors constant observation and these two courses show she was not a ship but some vessel of two masts immediately after this maneuver the mariners cry all is lost and the ship instantly sinks and thus she is clearly broached to or brought by the lee the violence of the storm having rendered all their endeavors to save her impracticable so that if shakespeare did not know how to sink a ship secundem artem chance did a great deal for him in this regular and probable progress most of the cavil against shakespeare having arisen from his use of phrases which have become obsolete and sea phrases being more likely than any others to become so in consequence of their perpetual corruption through an intercourse with all nations let us good naturedly allow him a little judgment of this subject who knew so incomparably every other   as for twelfth night if in the violent love of orsino for olivia her sudden attachment to viola the marriage under the likenesses she bears to her brother sebastian and he to her huddled up with more speed than prudence and at last orsinos willingness to forego his former passion and wed viola we find more perplexity than art more creation than nature we are abundantly recompensed by some of the finest strokes of humor the stage has produced in the scenes between sir toby sir andrew aguecheek and the rest  the trick played by this set upon malvolio is most happily comic and though perfectly natural is so singularly whimsical that shakespeare himself is constrained to make fabian say if this were played upon a stage now i would condemn it as an impossible fiction  the language of twelfth night is full of beauty judgment and maturity and we are taught by it to regret the prodigious literary treasure which would have been the further boast of this kingdom had shakespeare been blessed with longer life and continued to labor for the advantage and amusement of mankind the speech she never told her love etc is in every bodys mouth and many other admirable passages are all well remembered  with this play which finished the brilliant career of shakespeare i have brought up my account of that assemblage of dramatic talents that ornamented the reign of james the first an era notwithstanding all that has been said against it which certainly has no parallel and when we take in the consideration of the short time the theater had emancipated from the rudest barbarism and arrived to a degree of perfection it never knew before throughout the world and which i am afraid it will never know again and also that this perfection was solely and entirely owing to shakespeare the proud conclusion for the honor of this country is too decided to need an observation when i come to examine the wits of charles the second i shall fulfill an unwilling duty by showing how unjustly shakespeare and his cotemporaries are aspersed to set off the dramatic writings of that time when general poetry had certainly advanced into great reputation but dramatic poetry had proportionably fallen off dryden who in this instance lost sight of all candor and liberality caluminated what he could not equal for he was hardly ever great without rhyme which however it might have been agreeable to charles the second who was just arrived from france and rapt up in corneille and the rest is not the language of nature and this proves that it is one thing to be a poet and another thing to be a dramatic poet   in short though there are many faults which attach to every writer of that time these are faults magnified by a comparison with shakespeares more resplendant abilities more dramatic poets wrote then and their various perfections were more universally felt than since but they were planets and their satelites to which shakespeare was the sun jonson wrote for the learned beaumont and fletcher for the fashionable massinger for the elegant but shakespeare wrote for all the world  chap ix playhouses and actors i have shown that about seventy plays were produced in the interval between      and   0  from that time to the death of james the first a period of twenty two years there were probably about one hundred and ninety pieces brought out which were acknowledged by their authors and about thirty of which the authors were concealed indeed we have accounts of a larger number but i think the remainder amounting to about twentyfive were performed between the death of james and the commencement of the troubles of charles the first  we may however set down fairly that ten plays on an average besides two or perhaps three masks in a year during that period were presented to the public and this induces us fully to believe that theaters multiplied very fast owing to the various contentions of so many authors but it is not therefore to be taken for granted that they had all regular companies or that plays were acted in them all at one time but rather that they were some of them subordinate to the rest or that the companies of performers shifted about occasionally to them as it might from various causes suit their convenience  we hear of no regular license under the privy seal to any person or set of persons except that granted in the first year of james to shakespeare fletcher burbage hemmings condel and others and as this authorized them not only to exhibit plays at their usual house the globe on the bank side but wherever else they thought proper it is possible for they were not then encumbered with scenes that they might perform at different places for the better accommodation of those who lived in the vicinities of the respectives theaters  we know that shakespeares company occupied the globe and blackfriers and also a winter and summer house at either of which when they performed they were called the kings servants so that here are four houses belonginging to one concern the company at the phoenix in drury lane were called the queens servants and the private theater in salisbury court were called the princes servants but there is nothing that leads us to a knowledge of who the actors were that made up these two companies whereas almost the whole of shakespeares company are not only known by name but we have already seen a good deal of their respective merits  these six theaters the red bull in st johns street and the fortune near white cross street seem to have attracted the principal notice at the time of which we are speaking the first being appropriated for the reception of genteel companies and the latter for citizens and the inferior description of persons it is possible the curtain and the theater which had been built a great many years before were at this time shut up and what induces us to believe this is that alleyn when he became manager of the fortune was obliged to take it down and rebuild it at which time he is said to have discovered that treasure with which he erected and endowed dulwich hospital  this ridiculous report has been credited on no other ground than that it is not easy in any rational way to account for alleyns having amassed the very large riches he is said to have possessed which had they amounted to no more than the eight hundred a year the endowment of dulwich would have been at that time an immense fortune for a person in his situation he is said to have been an excellent actor and to have been very successful but who was at that time so successful as shakespeare and yet he died in no state though the world subscribes to his prudence to keep his family above mediocrity much less to build and endow an hospital  alleyns fortune no doubt proceeded partly from marrying three wives each of whom brought a handsome portion partly from the success of his theater partly from his being keeper of the kings wild beasts and master of the royal bear garden and partly from his being a most rigid and penurious economist which character he so strictly enjoined himself that he was the first pensioner in his own charity probably in imitation of rahere who founded as we have seen st bartholomews priory in which he became the first prior however alleyn procured his fortune and whatever were his motive for building his hospital he deserves for ever the thanks of his own fraternity for perpetuating a trait that reflects the highest honor on that profession which fools only have considered as dishonorable his influence must have been very great for he obtained liberty to endow his charity notwithstanding the representation of the great chancellor bacon who wrote upon this occasion the following letter to the marquis of buckingham  i now write to give the king an account of a patent i have stayed at the seal it is of license to give in mortmain eight hundred pound land though it be of tenure in chief to allen that was a player for an hospital i like well that allen plays the last act of his life so well but if his majesty give away thus to amortize his tenures his court of wards will decay which i had well hoped should improve but that which moved me chiefly is that his majesty now lately did absolutely deny sir henry savile for two hundred pounds and sir edward sandys for one hundred pounds to the perpetuating of two lectures the one in oxford the other in cambridge foundations of singular honor to his majesty and of which there is great want whereas hospitals abound and beggars abound never a whit the less if his majesty do like to pass the book at all yet if he would be pleased to abride the eight hundred pounds to five hundred pounds and then give way to the other two books for the university it were a princely work and i would make an humble suit to the king and desire your lordship to join it that it might be so   these reasons were certainly very cogent but he received orders revertheless to affix the great seal to the patent and alleyn d the first stone of his hospital on the thirteenth of september         the fortune theater did very well but it was only frequented as we have seen by those who could afford to pay low prices and in other respects could not be in such repute as those places over which shakespeare presided for none of the plays in great estimation were brought out there but on the contrary they were all performed either at the globe or blackfriers or at the phoenix and as we hear very little of any of the other theaters by which we can describe their success and the nature of their entertainments by any established criterion i do not think it improbable if they were not used occasionally by the established company that they were either appropriated to the acting of plays for the amusement of noblemen who kept their respective actors or else their amusements consisted like sadlers wells of something inferior to those of the regular theaters especially as masks were so much the fashion in those times  this is however mere conjecture and we have one proof a strange one to be sure that regular plays were acted at the fortune at least for we are solemnly told that alleyn performing a demon with six others in one of shakespeares plays was in the midst of the play surprised by an apparation of the devil this so worked upon his fancy that he made a vow which he performed by building dulwich hospital there is something very curious in this anecdote why the devil who is not in general supposed to be a very charitable character should be so anxious to frighten a man into building an hospital is not very easy to be understood why he should particularly pitch upon alleyn for this philanthropic purpose is altogether as extraordinary but it is still more extraordinary that their devil should have so left them in the lurch as not to have suggested a more probable vehicle for the propagation of this fact for throughout all the great and unbounded variety in the works of shakespeare there is not a single play in which we find seven dancing devil   however all this may have been alleyn seems to have challenged and received the highest respect from all ranks he was indeed the roscius of his time for says fuller he was a youth of excellent capacity a cheerful temper a tenacious memory a sweet elocution and in his person of a stately port and aspect  fuller however with that vulgar contempt and ignorant prejudice with which the profession of of an actor is too often treated congratulates alleyns father on having withheld from him a liberal education which he thinks would only have fitted him for a more serious course of life by which if alleyn had the extraordinary talents we are taught to allow him he without intention pays him a compliment for it is sometimes better that nature should furnish an education than the schools but if he would intimate that the instruction promulgated from the stage is so superficial and immaterial as to require only slender and uninformed talents every man of liberal intelligence must hold his opinion in sovereign contempt  heywood compares alleyn to proteus for change and to roscius for eloquence he is said to have performed originally the principal characters in shakespeares and jonsons plays but we have never been told what those characters were and indeed the fact does not seem to be confirmed at least as to his having performed them originally for not one of those plays came out at his theater and as we have plenty of corroboration that burbage was the original richard the third lowin the first hamlet and other facts of the same complexion there is suffiencient reason to believe that alleyns performance of shakespeares and jonsons characters was at second hand he was however greatly extolled and there can be no doubt but his merit was very considerable even though it is but fair to conceive that the talents of the actor might be magnified by being seen through the munificence of the man jonson was the constant panegyrist of alleyn and what is very extraordinary we have no instance upon record of his having quarrelled with him the following epigram has been frequently quoted where ben however as may be seen by the two last lines in his distinterestedness seem to have introduced an iricism all for you and a little for myself honey if rome so great and in her wisest age feared not to boast the glories of her stage a skilful roscius and great aesop men yet crowned with honors as with riches then who had no less a trumpet to their name than cicero whose very breath was fame how can so great example die in me that alleyn i should pause to publish thee who both their graces in thyself have more outstripd than they did all who went before and present worth in all do so contract as others spoke but only thou do act wear this renown it is just that who did give so many poets life by one should live    as it will shortly be very material to take up this subject again and pursue it to the restoration to which period or very near it most of the celebrated actors at the time of shakespeare lived an account of whom will then make a very interesting feature in the theatrical history of this country i shall for the present drop the stage itself to examine in a summary manner the state of those arts which are calculated to lend it collateral assistance  chap x close of james the first though the arts from the close of henry the eighths reign had been making a progress toward perfection though every encouragement was given to genius and talents by elizabeth and to the best possible purpose and effect as we have seen yet when the kingdom lost her energy in ruling many pursuits of ingenuity relaxed  james from principle and the prejudice of education considered his right to rule as transmitted from heaven and under this abuse of the idea that the king can do no wrong which is a beautiful fact taken in its right sense he considered himself as infallible as a pope and thus throughout his whole reign there were constant struggles between the priveleges of the people and the prerogative of the king  the protestant religion having drawn aside that veil of superstition in which mens minds had been entangled and inveloped the people began to think for themselves and though they were willing to allow every honor and respect due to the chief magistrate that had by legitimate right been permitted to rule over them yet they scouted the idea of his being next to a sacred missionary and heavens vicegerent  the was completely owing to the folly of their ruler they never dreamt of this with elizabeth their obedience to her though insisted on was neither exacted nor enforced it was necessary representation on her side and wholesome compliance on the theirs thus her reign being conducted with equal wisdom and resolution became admired and popular and she was permitted to possess prerogative to its utmost stretch because she was not so unwise as to let it trench on the priveleges of the people  in this critical juncture when it required in a sovereign strong determination on one side and strict impartiality on the other nothing could be so difficult as to reign in england without great strenuous and decided talents these james unfortunately did not possess he did not even know the character of the people whom he came to govern and seeing this they were determined to know themselves and create their own resources  this instantly cleft the kingdom in two and privelege and prerogative which like the right hand and the left were formed for the assistance of each other became the signal of so much schism and disunion that there can be no doubt but every measure during this reign in which was conceived the notorious gunpowder plot in which the upright overbury was poisoned in which the gallant raleigh was unjustly executed and in which the great bacon was cashiered for bribery was some act of preparation for erecting the scaffold where the unfortunate charles lost his head  every period in which a kingdom is involved in disquiet and turbulence is naturally unfavourable to the arts and the monarch who neglects the fortunes of wife and noble counselors accustomed under his predecessors to deserve by great and able conduct the affection and countenance of their fellow subjects will never be looked up to as the patron of the ingenious and the enlightened  james selected his favorites from low situations they were weak ignorant and illiterate and possessed minds congenial to his own these men were employed to execute measures and conduct expeditions of which they were incapable such were ill calculated to encourage merit and thus it happened that the rest of europe in general literature and in many of the arts infinite outstript england  it cannot however be said that they laid more than dormont study was preparing them for that celebrity which patronage was afterward to confirm in the mean time general poetry waited for cowley and milton and painting for rubens and vandyke music and dramatic poetry were nevertheless in full reputation and this was owing to the gallantry introduced at court by the kings favorites  the court of james was full of every species of dramatic recreation an indulgence the people were willing enough to take advantage of who while jonson invading daniels province provided those superficial entertainments at court under the title of masks the principal merit of which was owing to the ingenuity of inigo jones followed the more rational pursuits of receiving ininstruction and amusement from the labors of shakespeare and those admirable poets whose merits we have already examined  these masks however were particularly favorable to the cause of music which being thus unrestrained received very fast particular countenance and protection the great camden whose mandate the schools of every description were glad enough to obey had from his infancy made music his favorite study for he was originally a choirister at magdalen college oxford  camden thus partial to music and determined to give it every advantage in his power made a resolution to revive a lectureship at oxford that had been founded by alfred for this purpose he sent a musical friend of the name of heyther with the deed of endowment for which he had obtained permission to doctor piers who was then vice chancellor and who was so pleased with the circumstance as well as to have an opportunity of obliging camden that he obtained the degree of docor in music for heyther and orlando gibbons who were both created by that title on the eigthteenth of may      the writers in general assert that gibbons never took the degree of doctor in music but the following letter from doctor piers the vice chancellor to camden will show that they are completely mistaken worthy sir the university returns her humble thanks to you with this letter we pray for your health and long life that you may see the fruits of your bounty we have made mr heyther a doctor in music so that now he is no more master but doctor heyther the like honor for your sake we have conferred upon mr orlando gibbons and made him a doctor too to accompany dr heyther we have paid mr dr heythers charges for his journey and likewise have given him the oxford courtesy a pair of gloves for himself and another for his wife your honor is far above all these things and so desiring the continuance of your loving favor to the university and to me your servant i take my leave  yours ever to be commanded william piers oxon    may          besides these advantages which music boasted from the consequence and the merit of its professors it had every possible encouragement under the patronage of the great and the protection of the king whose children were all instructed in that art by the ablest masters prince charles was a scholar of coperario of whom he learnt the viol da gambo playford speaks as follows of the musical taste of charles nor was his late sacred majesty and blessed martyr king charles the first behind any of his predecessors in the love and promotion of this science especially in the service of almighty god and with much zeal he would hear reverently performed and often appointed the service and anthems himself especially that sharp service composed by dr william child being by his knowledge in music a competent judge therein and would play his part exactly well on the bassvioll especially of those incomparable fancies of mr coperario to the organ  prince henry also learnt music and was a warm patron of musicians he had fifteen musicians on his household establishment among whom were doctor bull cutting a good player on the lute was at that time considered as a great acquisition the fame of cutting reached to the ears of christian the fourth king of denmark who having been forsaken by douland whom he had invited to his court after hearing him in england felt himself so disgraced at being without a good lutenist that he entreated lady arabella stuart in whose service cutting was before he was retained by henry to spare him that celebrated performer there were some letters which are among the harleian collection that passed upon the occasion and after a great deal of ceremony and consultation the lute player went to fill up this chasm in christians court he however liked the situation no better than douland had for in a very few years afterward we find him in the service of prince henry  the famous lutenist jones and angelo  it does not appear however that sacred music was so much encouraged at that time as familiar and light airs particularly such as promoted dancing an amusement in which james so delighted that he was more anxious for his children to learn it than any thing in the world there is extant a letter to his sons where he enjoins them to keep up their dancing even though they should be obliged to whistle and sing to one another for music  this taste however did service to the cause of music for it accustomed the ear to familiar melody that required only to be methodized by laws and purcell to stamp it with that character which is known by the term true english music a species of sound that so effects the mind and so appeals to the heart that the meanest hearer with feeling and sensibility will be as capable of tasting its beauty and deciding upon its merit as the most learned critic  by these means public amusements became a matter of singular consequence the people tired of fruitless controversy were glad enough to taste so rational a relaxation as the theater afforded them and james by shows and spectacles hugged himself under an idea that he was hiding his own frivolous folly ingratiating himself with his nobles and throwing out a tub to the popular whale  thus animosity and mutual recrimination were laughed off and forgotten through the medium of a comedy or a masque and while the people contented themselves with adopting modest yet manly means to support their own privileges the court was so full of fantastic sports and romantic diversions that it at length actually became like an enchanted castle whence charles as a knight and buckingham this was the famous buckingham who was afterward assassinated by felton his conduct in spain was stark madness and if he had wished to create the eternal enmity of that nation to his royal master he could not have managed it more adroitly besides adventures intrigues serenades duels and every other insult likely to exasperate so jealous and so grave a people nothing could satisfy him but making open love to the duchess of olivarez and affronting her husband the match was in consequence broken off and it was a great proof of the good sense and moderation of the spanish court that they required no serious retribution  as his squire sallied forth to gain the affections of a princess at the court of spain but charles having fallen in love with the princess henrietta of france whom he afterward married and who did so much injury to this country by instilling the principles of popery into her children they overturned their whole scheme and came home in disgrace  in the mean time the imbecility of the king of england was at least matched by that of the king of france the great henry had scarcely been assassinated by raviliac tue conduct of daubigny seems to have been very doubtful in this business who when confronted by raviliac denied having had any conversation with him indeed it appears by many circumstances particularly the false and contradictory accounts the assassin gave of those things that were sound in his pocket that he was a dupe to the jesuits on whose absolution probably he relied and for one very strong circumstance to prove that he had accomplices the provost of pluviers had openly declared at six miles distance from paris on the day the murder happened this day the king will be either slain or dangerously wounded he was on this account sent prisoner to paris but before he could be examined he hanged himself  which murder in the opinion of many historians notwithstanding he confessed nothing was committed either at the instance of some of the nobles who envied the virtues of henry or by the emissaries of spain  when the duke of sully resigned and the queen regent gave the government of the kingdom into the hands of an italian chambermaid whose husband conchini soon afterward created marshal dancre was presently made the victim to her absurd and unbecoming ambition for as soon as the king assumed the government which he did at the age of fourteen first having married anne of austria fearing that as the power of this man had been derived from one assassination he might wish to increase it by another employed vitry who was afterward made marshal of france to dispose of his enemy he was murdered by hirelings and his limbs given up to the fury of that populace who were but too justly incensed against him  in this state was the court of louis a monarch timid weak and illiterate when charles married the princess henrietta for though richlieu then bishop of lucon had reconciled the king and his mother and began to imagine all those advantages for the kingdom which were so well planned and carried into execution afterward yet nothing but senseless folly and fantastic intriguing characterized court manners  we have seen richelieu a great dramatic patron and this fancy might perhaps have arisen from the necessity at the time of louis the thirteenth of giving into some weaknesses in order to get hold of more substantial power children cannot be cured entirely by severity but it is curious that he who originally merely permitted lighter amusements should at length grow so inordinately fond of them as to admire them more than any other pursuit  it had been the fashion to dedicate dramatic pieces and troterel bertrand fauconier de la grange and many others insignificant writers by the bye had already chosen their separate protectors not forgetting billard who wrote a tragedy called henri le grand which he dedicated to the queen regent  thus did the two courts vie with each other in dramatic amusements and this is the moment to prove which may be done in a few words that the celebrity of the english stage for celebrity surely is more legitimately due to intrinsic merit than to show and spectacle was as decidedly superior to that of france as an animal is to a vegetable or a piece of mechanism one had passive life the other active one was wound up and set a going the other went of itself  a reperusal of the fifth number of this work will confirm this fact for we shall there find that except jodelle garnier and hardi the french stage had boasted no name of celebrity before corneille whose first play melite came out in the very year in which james the first died  this proves that the emancipation of the english from those mists of opinion which had begun and been encouraged in the reign of elizabeth and had gradually strengthened and been confirmed throughout the life of james yielded most rationally to the best relaxation that could recreate the fancy without injury to the mind and this solid sense and found judgment taught them to cherish in shakespeare the greatest genius the world has produced for in the midst of the squabbles and bickerings during his life in which there is nothing arrogant bold or aspiring he possessed that admiration he never courted and received every testimony of grateful respect from his fellow creatures whom he had taught and delighted not the leader of a party or the minion of a court but the advocate of virtue and the favorite of human nature  from all these premises i gather this conclusion that as the meritorious labors of the drama received very little support but from the people as the stage had not known the great variety of advantages introduced to it afterward as all the collateral arts were in a supine state and in short as it was obliged to stand or fall by its own intrinsic and individual merit the number of admirable tragedies and comedies that were produced at that time for these are its true criterion give dramatic fame beyond calculation a decided superiority over every thing it ever boasted either before or since  the end of the third volume
