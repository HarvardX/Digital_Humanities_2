correspondence and miscellaneous writings              thomas jefferson aug         george washington to the president of the united states d s mss  aug         th jefferson has the honor to inclose to the president the letter of the national assembly to him of dec       its most distinct object seems to have been to thank the us for their succours to st domingo it glances blindly however at commercial arrangements and on the   th of feb the same assembly passed the decree putting our commerce in their dominions on the footing of natives  directing their executive council to treat with us on the subject on this the following questions arise   would the president chuse to answer the letter acknoleging its receipt thanking them in turn for the favors to our commerce and promising to consult the constitutional powers the senate on the subject of the treaty proposed   would he rather chuse to make no reply to the   letter but that mr morris be instructed to negociate a renewal of mr genets powers to treat to his successor   or would he chuse that nothing be said on the subject to any body if the president would in his judgment be for a treaty on the principles of the decree or any modification of them the  st or  d measure will be to be adopted if he is against a treaty on those principles or any modification of them the  d measure seems to be the proper one thomas jefferson august         philadelphia gouverneur morris to the u s minister to france gouverneur morris j mss  philadelphia august         dear sir— the letter of the   th instant with its documents accompanying this will sufficiently inform you of the transactions which have taken place between mr genet the minister of france and the government here and of the painful necessity they have brought on of desiring his recall the letter has been prepared in the view of being itself with its documents laid before the executive of the french government you will therefore be pleased to lay it before them doing everything which can be done on your part to procure it a friendly and dispassionate reception and consideration the president would indeed think it greatly unfortunate were they to take it in any other light and therefore charges you very particularly with the case of presenting this proceeding in the most soothing   view and as the result of an unavoidable necessity on his part mr genet soon after his arrival communicated the decree of the national convention of february         authorizing their executive to propose a treaty with us on liberal principles such as might strengthen the bonds of good will which unite the two nations and informed us in a letter of may    that he was authorized to treat accordingly the senate being then in recess and not to meet again till fall i apprized mr genet that the participation in matters of treaty given by the constitution to that branch of our government would of course delay any definitive answer to his friendly proposition as he was sensible of this circumstance the matter has been understood to lie over till the meeting of senate you will be pleased therefore to explain to the executive of france this delay which has prevented as yet our formal accession to their proposition to treat to assure them that the president will meet them with the most friendly dispositions on the grounds of treaty proposed by the nationial convention as soon as he can do it in the forms of the constitution and you will of course suggest for this purpose that the powers of mr genet be renewed to his successor thomas jefferson aug   d      cabinet opinions on recall of genet j mss  aug   d      at a meeting of the heads of departments and the attorney general at the presidents on the  st and    d of august      on a review of the whole of mr genets correspondence and conduct it was unanimously agreed that a letter should be written to the minister of the united states at paris stating the same to him resuming the points of difference which had arisen between the government of the united states and mr genet assigning the reasons for the opinions of the former and desiring the recall of the latter and that this letter with those which have passed between mr genet and the secretary of state and other necessary documents shall be laid by mr morris before the executive of the french government at a meeting of the same at the presidents august   th the rough draft of the said letter having been prepared by the secretary of state was read for consideration and it was agreed that the secretary of the treasury should take measures for obtaining a vessel either by hire or purchase to be sent to france express with the dispatches when ready at a meeting of the same at the presidents august  0th said

that appeal to the public  risking that disgust which i had so much wished should have been avoided the indications from different parts of the continent are already sufficient to shew that the mass of the republican interest has no hesitation to disapprove of this intermeddling by a foreigner  the more readily as his object was evidently contrary to his professions to force us into the war i am not certain whether some of the more furious republicans may not schismatize with him the following arrangements are established sept  0 the pr sets out for mt vernon  will be here again the  0th oct

aug         cabinet opinion on privateers and prizes w mss  aug         at a meeting of the heads of departments  attorney general at the presidents on the   st day of aug      a letter from mr gore to mr lear dated boston aug    was read stating that the roland a privateer fitted out at boston  furnished with a commission under the government of france had sent a prize into that port which being arrested by the marshal of the district by process from a court of justice was rescued from his possession by m du plaine consul of france with an armed force from one of the ships of his nation it is the opinion that the attorney of the district be instructed to institute such prosecution as the laws will authorize against the said du plaine and to furnish to the government of the u s authentic evidence of the facts before mentioned whereon if it shall appear that the rescue was made by the sd du plaine or his order it is the opinion that his exequetur should be revoked—also that the attorney of the district be desired to furnish copies of his applications or other correspondence with the governor of massachusetts relative to the several privateers  prizes which have been the subjects of his letters to mr lear a letter from mr maury consul for the u s at liverpool dated july        was read covering an inauthenticated copy of certain additional instructions from the court of st jamess to the commanders of their ships of war dated june        permitting them to stop the vessels of neutral nations   laden with corn flour or meal  bound to any port of france  to send them into british ports from whence they are not to be permitted to proceed to the port of any country not in amity with gr britain whereupon it is the opinion that mr pinckney be provisionally instructed to make representations to the british ministry on the sd instruction as contrary to the rights of neutral nations and to urge a revocation of the same and full indemnification to any individuals citizens of these states who may in the mean time suffer loss in consequence of the sd instruction also that explanations be desired by mr pinckney of the reasons of the distinction made in the  d article of the sd instructions between the vessels of denmark  sweden  those of the u s attempting to enter blockaded ports information having been also received thro the public papers of a decree passed by the national assembly of france revoking the principle of free ships making free goods  enemy ships enemy goods and making it lawful to seize neutral vessels bound with provisions to another country  to carry them into the ports of france there to be landed  paid for  also of another decree excepting the vessels of the u s from the operation of the preceding decrees it is the opinion that mr morris be provisionally instructed in case the first mentioned decrees have passed  not the exceptions to make representations thereon to the french government as contrary to the treaty existing between the two countries  the decree relative to provisions contrary also to the law of nations  to require a revocation  0 thereof and full indemnification to any citizen of these states who may in the mean time have suffered loss therefrom and also in case the sd decrees  the exceptions were both passed that then a like indemnification be made for losses intervening between the dates of the sd decrees  exceptions  a letter from the governor of georgia of the    instant covering the proceedings of a council of war relatively to an expedition against certain towns of the creek nation was communicated for consideration it is the opinion that the governor of georgia be informed that the president disapproves the measure as unauthorised by law as contrary to the present state of affairs and to the instructions heretofore given and expects that it will not be proceeded in that requiring the previous consideration of congress it will be submitted to them at their ensuing session if circumstances shall not then render it unnecessary or improper that the governor of south carolina be also informed that the cooperation desired of him by the governor of georgia is not to be afforded and that the agent for procuring supplies of provisions for the service of the united states in georgia be instructed that no provisions are to be furnished on their account for the purpose of the said expedition    thomas jefferson sep      james madison to james madison mad mss  sep      my last was of the   th since that i have received yours of the  0th and col ms of the   st nothing further has passed with mr genet but one of his consuls has committed a pretty serious deed at boston by going with an armed force taken from a french frigate in the harbor and rescuing a vessel out of the hands of the marshal who had arrested her by process from a court of justice in another instance he kept off the marshal by an armed force from serving a process on a vessel he is ordered consequently to be arrested himself prosecuted  punished for the rescue and his exequatur will be revoked—you will see in the newspapers the attack made on our commerce by the british king in his additional instructions of june   tho we have only newspaper information of it provisional instructions are going to mr pinckney to require a revocation of them and indemnification for all losses which individuals sustain by them in the meantime of the revocation i have not the least expectation i shall therefore be for laying the whole business respecting both nations before congress while i think it impossible they should not approve of what has been done disagreeable to the friendly nation it will be in their power to soothe them by strong commercial retaliations against the hostile one pinching their commerce will be just against themselves advantageous to us and conciliatory towards our friends of the hard necessities into which their agent has driven us his conduct has given room for the enemies of    liberty  of france to come forward in a stile of acrimony against that nation which they never would have dared to have done the disapprobation of the agent mingles with the reprehension of his nation  gives a toleration to that which it never had before he has still some defenders in freneau  greenleafs papers who they are i know not for even hutcheson  dallas give him up i enclose you a boston paper which will give you a specimen of what all the papers are now filled with you will recognize mr a— under the signature of camillus he writes in every weeks paper now  generally under different signatures this is the first in which he has omitted some furious incartade against me hutcheson says that genet has totally overturned the republican interest in philadelphia however the people going right themselves if they always see their republican advocates with them an accidental meeting with the monocrats will not be a coalescence—you will see much said  again said about gs threat to appeal to the people i can assure you it is a fact—i received yesterday the ms you mentioned to me from f—n i have only got a dozen pages into it and never was more charmed with anything profound arguments presented in the simplest point of view entitle him really to his antient signature in the papers received from you i have seen nothing which ought to be changed except a part of one sentence not necessary for its object  running foul of something of which you were not apprized a malignant fever has been generated in the filth of water street which gives great alarm about  0 people had died    of it two days ago  as many more were ill of it it has now got into most parts of the city  is considerably infectious at first   out of   died now about   out of   it comes on with a pain in the head sick stomach then a little chill fever black vomiting and stools and death from the  d to the  th day everybody who can is flying from the city and the panic of the country people is likely to add famine to the disease tho becoming less mortal it is still spreading and the heat of the weather is very unpropitious i have withdrawn my daughter from the city but am obliged to go to it every day myself—my threshing machine is arrived at new york mr pinckney writes me word that the original from which this model is copied threshes   0 bushels of wheat in   hours with   horses and   men it may be moved either by water or horses fortunately the workman who made it a millwright is come in the same vessel to settle in america i have written to persuade him to go on immediately to richmd offering him the use of my model to exhibit and to give him letters to get him into immediate employ in making them i expect an answer before i write to you again i understand that the model is made mostly in brass  in the simple form in which it was first ordered to be worked by horses it was to have cost   guineas but mr pinckney having afterwards directed it to be accommodated to water movement also it has made it more complicated and costs    guineas it will thresh any grain from the windsor bean down to the smallest adieu ps the market was the last winter from    to     0 per cent higher than it was in the winter preceding it is now got to from  0 to  00 per cent higher i think by the winter it will be generally  00 per cent on the prices of    0 european goods are also much risen of course you must expect a rise in the boarding houses compounded of these two in the mean time the produce of the farmer say wheat rice tobacco has not risen a copper the redundancy of paper then in the cities is palpably a tax on the distant farmer ps sep   i have made great progress into the ms and still with the same pleasure i have no doubt it must produce great effect but that this may be the greatest possible its coming out should be timed to the best advantage it should come out just so many days before the meeting of congress as will prevent suspicions of its coming with them yet so as to be a new thing when they arrive ready to get into their hands while yet unoccupied before the panic of the culprit shall be over or any measures for defeating its first effect may be taken i will direct it to appear a fortnight before their meeting unless you order otherwise it might as well be thrown into a churchyard as come out now thomas jefferson sepr        philadelphia christopher gore to the u s attorney for massachusetts christopher gore j mss  philadelphia sepr        sir— the president is informed through the channel of a letter from yourself to mr lear that m du plaine consul of france at boston has lately with    an armed force seized  rescued a vessel from the officer of a court of justice by process from which she was under arrest in his custody and that he has in like manner with an armed force opposed  prevented the officer charged with process from a court against another vessel from serving that process this daring violation of the laws requires the more attention as it is by a foreigner clothed with a public character arrogating an unfounded right to admiralty jurisdiction and probably meaning to assert it by this act of force you know that by the law of nations consuls are not diplomatic characters and have no immunities whatever against the laws of the land to put this altogether out of dispute a clause was inserted in our consular convention with france making them amenable to the laws of the land as other inhabitants consequently m du plaine is liable to arrest imprisonment  other punishments even capital as other foreign subjects resident here the president therefore desires that you will immediately institute such a prosecution against him as the laws will warrant if there be any doubt as to the character of his offence whether of a higher or lower grade it will be best to prosecute for that which will admit the least doubt because an acquittal though it might be founded merely on the opinion that the grade of offence with which he is charged is higher than his act would support yet it might be construed by the uninformed to be a judiciary decision against his amenability to the law or perhaps in favor of the jurisdiction these consuls are assuming the process therefore should be of    the surest kind and all the proceedings well grounded in particular if an arrest as is probable be the first step it should be so managed as to leave room neither for escape nor rescue it should be attended with every mark of respect consistent with safe custody and his confinement as mild  comfortable also as that would permit these are the distinctions to which a consul is entitled that is to say of a particular decorum of deportment towards him indicative of respect to the sovereign whose officer he is the president also desires you will immediately obtain the best evidence it shall be in your power to procure under oath or affirmation of the transaction stated in your letter and that in this you consider yourself as acting as much on behalf of m du plaine as the public the candid truth of the case being exactly that which is desired as it may be the foundation of an act the justice of which should be beyond all question this evidence i shall be glad to receive within as few days or even hours of delay as possible i am also instructed to ask the favor of you to communicate copies of any memorials representations or other written correspondence which may have passed between the governor  yourself with respect to the privateers  prizes which have been the subject of your letters to mr lear thomas jefferson september        philadelphia thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss  philadelphia september        dear sir— i wrote to you on the   th ult since which i have received yours of the   th ult maria    is well and is with me on the schuylkill a malignant fever has been generated in the filth of the docks of philadelphia which has given great alarm it is considerably infectious at  st   out of   died at present not more than one out of three several days ago my latest information about  0 had died and about that number were ill of it it is called commonly a yellow fever but by the physicians typhus gravior begins with a pain in the head sickness in the stomach with a slight rigor fever black vomitings and fæces and death from the  nd to the  th day at first it was confined to water street but is now in many parts of the city it is still spreading tho become less mortal everybody who can is flying from the city and the country people being afraid to come to the market there is fear of a want of supplies tho there is some degree of danger yet as is usual there is much more alarm than danger and knowing it to be usual also to magnify these accounts in proportion to distance i have given you the particulars that you may know exactly what the case is—my threshing machine is arrived at new york and will be here this week mr pinckney writes me that the model from which my model is taken gets out   0 bushels of wheat in   hours with   horses and   men it will thresh any grain from the windsorbean to the milled and may be moved by horses or water it happens that the workman who made it a millwright is come over in the same vessel i have written to advise him to go to virginia and commence building these machines offering him the use of my model to exhibit    in richmond if he chuses in order to get himself into work—your letter of the   th does not mention the receipt of any of mine on the subject of sending on the horse still however presuming some of them will have got to hand illegible tarquin so that he will arrive at georgetown the day after tomorrow he has orders to wait there a week if necessary—the character you give giovannini is a just one he is sober industrious and honest he lived with me as a gardener some time before i went to europe however i shall find it necessary to have a gardener constantly at his business and think to teach a negro at once our last accounts from france are of a very mixed complexion the combined armies had made no progress the insurgents of brittany had obtained a signal victory and had afterwards been more signally defeated but not suppressed—my love to my dear martha and am dear sir yours affectionately and constantly thomas jefferson september        philadelphia george hammond to the british minister  george hammond j mss  philadelphia september        sir— i am honored with yours of august  0th mine of the  th of that month assured you that    measures were taking for excluding from all further asylum in our ports vessels armed in them to cruise on nations with which we are at peace and for the restoration of the prizes the lovely lass prince william henry and the jane of dublin and that should the measures for restitution fail in their effect the president considers it as incumbent on the united states to make compensation for the vessels we are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations by all the means in our power to protect and defend their vessels and effects in our ports or waters or in the seas near our shores and to recover and restore the same to the right owners when taken from them if all the means in our power are used and fail in their effect we are not bound by our treaties with those nations to make compensation though we have no similar treaty with great britain it was the opinion of the president that we should use towards that nation the same rule which under this article was to govern us with the other nations and even to extend it to captures made on the high seas and brought into our ports if done by vessels which had been armed within them having for particular reasons forborne to use all the measures in our power for the restitution of the  0 three vessels mentioned in my letter of august  th the president thought it incumbent on the united states to make compensation for them and though nothing was said in that letter of other vessels taken under like circumstances and brought in after the  th of june and before the date of that letter yet where the same forbearance had taken place it was and is his opinion that compensation would be equally due as to prizes made under the same circumstances and brought in after the date of that letter the president determined that all the means in our power should be used for their restitution if these fail us as we should not be bound by our treaties to make compensation to the other powers in the analogous case he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to great britain but still if any cases shall arise subsequent to that date the circumstances of which shall place them on similar ground with those before it the president would think compensation equally incumbent on the united states instructions are given to the governors of the different states to use all the means in their power for restoring prizes of this last description found within their ports though they will of course take measures to be informed of them and the general government has given them the aid of the custom house officers for this purpose yet you will be sensible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as shall depend on yourself or any person under your direction in order that the governors may use the means in their power for making restitution without knowledge    of the capture they cannot restore it it will always be best to give the notice to them directly but any information which you shall be pleased to send to me also at any time shall be forwarded to them as quickly as the distance will permit hence you will perceive sir that the president contemplates restitution or compensation in the cases before the seventh of august and after that date restitution if it can be effected by any means in our power and that it will be important that you should substantiate the fact that such prizes are in our ports or waters your list of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports is i believe correct with respect to losses by detention waste spoliation sustained by vessels taken as before mentioned between the dates of june   and aug   it is proposed as a provisional measure that the collector of the customs of the district and the british consul or any other person you please shall appoint persons to establish the value of the vessel and cargo at the times of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which she is brought according to their value in that port if this shall be agreeable to you and you will be pleased to signify it to me with the names of the prizes understood to be of this description instructions will be given accordingly to the collectors of the customs where the respective vessels are i have the honor to be with great respect sir your most obedient and most humble

desiring the recall of mr genet were read  approved a letter from the governr of georgia to the secy of state dated aug         was read communicating the demand by the vice consul of france in georgia of certain individuals under prosecution in a court of justice it is the opinion that he be answered that the law must take its course a memorial from mr hammond dated sep   complaining of the capture of the british brig the william tell by the french brig le cerf within the limits of the protection of the u s and the refusal of the french minister  consul to have the prize delivered into the hands of a marshal charged with process from a court to arrest her was read it is the opinion that a letter be written to mr genet calling for evidence in the cases of the vessels heretofore reclaimed  not yet finally decided on  which were permitted to remain in the hands of the french consuls in the mean time informing him that the letter of june    was not intended to authorize opposition to the officers or orders of courts respecting vessels taken within the limits of our protection that therefore the brig william tell ought to be delivered    into the hands of the officer charged to arrest her and that in the event of the courts deciding that it has no jurisdiction of the case as in that of the ship william whereon the letter of june    was written she may again be replaced in the consuls hands till the executive shall have decided thereon a letter from lt govr wood dated aug    stating that the french vessel the orion was arrived in norfolk  had brought in the sans culottes as a prize and doubting whether from the particular circumstances of this prize she came within the general orders heretofore given it is the opinion that the situation of the sans culottes is the same in respect to england  france as any other french vessel not fitted in our ports and therefore that the orion is within the   th article of our treaty  the rules heretofore given on that subject a memorial from mr hammond dated sep   was read complaining of the long stay of the french fleet in new york that a regular succession of them appears to be appointed for cruizing on the coasts that a jurisdiction over prizes is exercised by the french consuls and desiring to be informed whether it be the intention of the executve to permit this indefinitely it is the opinion that mr hammond be informed that effectual measures are taken to put an end to the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction by the french consuls that the french have by treaty a right to come into our ports with their prizes exclusively that they have also a right by treaty to enter our ports for any urgent necessity that this right is exclusive as to privateers but not so as to    public vessels of war and has therefore not been denied to british ships of war nor has the executive as yet prescribed to either any limits to the time they may remain in their ports a letter from mr bordman at boston dated sep   was read complaining of the capture of the schooner flora an american vessel by the roland one of the illicit privateers it is the opn he must seek redress in the courts of law the draught of a letter to mr pinckney on the additional instructions of the court of st jamess dated june      was read and approved a question was proposed by the president whether we ought not to enquire from mr hammond if he is prepared to give an answer on the subject of the inexecution of the treaty it is the opinion that it will be better to await the arrival of the next packet then to make the application to mr hammond and if he be not prepared to answer that mr pinckney be instructed to remonstrate on the subject to the british court th jefferson h knox edm randolph thomas jefferson sept        philadelphia thomas pinckney to the u s minister to great britain thomas pinckney j mss  philadelphia sept        sir— we have received through a channel which cannot be considered as authentic the copy of a paper styled additional instructions to the commanders of his majestys ships of war and privateers c dated at st jamess june        if    this paper be authentic i have little doubt but that you have taken measures to forward it to me but as your communications of it may miscarry and time in the meanwhile be lost it has been thought better that it should be supposed authentic that on that supposition i should notice to you its very exceptionable nature and the necessity of obtaining explanations on the subject from the british government desiring at the same time that you will consider this letter as provisionally written only and as if never written in the event that the paper which is the occasion of it be not genuine the first article of it permits all vessels laden wholly or in part with corn flour or meal bound to any port in france to be stopped and sent into any british port to be purchased by that government or to be released only on the condition of security given by the master that he will proceed to dispose of his cargo in the ports of some country in amity with his majesty this article is so manifestly contrary to the law of nations that nothing more would seem necessary than to observe that it is so reason and usage have established that when two nations go to war those who choose to live in peace retain their natural right to pursue their agriculture manufactures and other ordinary vocations to carry the produce of their industry for exchange to all nations belligerent or neutral as usual to go and come freely without injury or molestation and in short that the war among others shall be for them as if it did not exist one restriction on those mutual rights has been    submitted to by nations at peace that is to say that of not furnishing to either party implements merely of war for the annoyance of the other or anything whatever to a place blockaded by its enemy what these implements of war are has been so often agreed and is so well understood as to leave little question about them at this day there does not exist perhaps a nation in our common hemisphere which has not made a particular enumeration of them in some or all of their treaties under the name of contraband it suffices for the present occasion to say that corn flour and meal are not of the class of contraband and consequently remain articles of free commerce a culture which like that of the soil gives employment to such a proportion of mankind could never be suspended by the whole earth or interrupted for them whenever any two nations should think proper to go to war the state of war then existing between great britain and france furnishes no legitimate right either to interrupt the agriculture of the united states or the peaceable exchange of its produce with all nations and consequently the assumption of it will be as lawful hereafter as now in peace as in war no ground acknowledged by the common reason of mankind authorizes this act now and unacknowledged ground may be taken at any time and all times we see then a practice begun to which no time no circumstances prescribe any limits and which strikes at the root of our agriculture that branch of industry which gives food clothing and comfort to the great mass of the inhabitants of    these states if any nation whatever has a right to shut up to our produce all the ports of the earth except her own and those of her friends she may shut up these also and so confine us within our own limits no nation can subscribe to such pretensions no nation can agree at the mere will or interest of another to have its peaceable industry suspended and its citizens reduced to idleness and want the loss of our produce destined for foreign markets or that loss which would result from an arbitrary restraint of our markets is a tax too serious for us to acquiesce in it is not enough for a nation to say we and our friends will buy your produce we have a right to answer that it suits us better to sell to their enemies as well as their friends our ships do not go to france to return empty they go to exchange the surplus of our produce which we can spare for surpluses of other kinds which they can spare and we want which they can furnish on better terms and more to our mind than great britain or her friends we have a right to judge for ourselves what market best suits us and they have none to forbid to us the enjoyment of the necessaries and comforts which we may obtain from any other independent country this act too tends directly to draw us from that state of peace in which we are wishing to remain it is an essential character of neutrality to furnish no aids not stipulated by treaty to one party which we are not equally ready to furnish to the other if we permit corn to be sent to great britain and her friends we are equally bound to permit    it to france to restrain it would be a partiality which might lead to war with france and between restraining it ourselves and permitting her enemies to restrain it unrightfully is no difference she would consider this as a mere pretext of which she would not be the dupe and on what honorable ground could we otherwise explain it thus we should see ourselves plunged by this unauthorized act of great britain into a war with which we meddle not and which we wish to avoid if justice to all parties and from all parties will enable us to avoid it in the case where we found ourselves obliged by treaty to withhold from the enemies of france the right of arming in our ports we thought ourselves in justice bound to withhold the same right from france also and we did it were we to withhold from her supplies of provisions we should in like manner be bound to withhold them from her enemies also and thus shut to ourselves all the ports of europe where corn is in demand or make ourselves parties in the war this is a dilemma which great britain has no right to force upon us and for which no pretext can be found in any part of our conduct she may indeed feel the desire of starving an enemy nation but she can have no right of doing it at our loss nor of making us the instrument of it the president therefore desires that you will immediately enter into explanations on this subject with the british government lay before them in friendly and temperate terms all the demonstrations of the injury done us by this act and endeavor to obtain a revocation of it and full indemnification    to any citizens of these states who may have suffered by it in the mean time accompany your representations with every assurance of our earnest desire to live on terms of the best friendship and harmony with them and to found our expectation of justice on their part on a strict observance of it on ours it is with concern however i am obliged to observe that so marked has been the inattention of the british court to every application which has been made to them on any subject by this government not a single answer i believe having ever been given to one of them except in the act of exchanging a minister that it may become unavoidable in certain cases where an answer of some sort is necessary to consider their silence as an answer perhaps this is their intention still however desirous of furnishing no color of offence we do not wish you to name to them any term for giving an answer urge one as much as you can without commitment and on the first day of december be so good as so give us information of the state in which this matter is that it may be received during the session of congress the second article of the same instruction allows the armed vessels of great britain to seize for condemnation all vessels on their first attempt to enter a blockaded port except those of denmark and sweden which are to be prevented only but not seized on their first attempt of the nations inhabiting the shores of the atlantic ocean and practising its navigation denmark sweden and the  0 united states alone are neutral to declare then all neutral vessels for as to the vessels of the belligerent powers no order was necessary to be legal prize which shall attempt to enter a blockaded port except those of denmark and sweden is exactly to declare that the vessels of the united states shall be lawful prize and those of denmark and sweden shall not it is of little consequence that the article has avoided naming the united states since it has a description applicable to them and to them alone while it exempts the others from its operation by name you will be pleased to ask an explanation of this distinction and you will be able to say in discussing its justice that in every circumstance we treat great britain on the footing of the most favored nation where our treaties do not preclude us and that even these are just as favorable to her as hers are to us possible she may be bound by treaty to admit this exception in favor of denmark and sweden but she cannot be bound by treaty to withhold it from us and if it be withheld merely because not established with us by treaty what might not we on the same ground have withheld from great britain during the short course of the present war as well as the peace which has preceded it whether these explanations with the british government shall be verbal or in writing is left to yourself verbal communications are very insecure for it is only necessary to deny them or to change their terms in order to do away their effect at any time those in writing have many and obvious    advantages and ought to be preferred unless there be obstacles of which we are unapprised thomas jefferson september        philadelphia circular to the french consuls j mss  philadelphia september        sir— finding by the protests of several of the consuls of france by their advertisements in the public papers and other proceedings and by other sufficient testimony that they claim and are exercising within the united states a general admiralty jurisdiction and in particular assume to try the validity of prizes and to give sentence thereon as judges of admiralty and moreover that they are undertaking to give commissions within the united states and to enlist or encourage the enlistment of men natives or inhabitants of these states to commit hostilities on nations with whom the united states are at peace in direct opposition to the laws of the land i have it in charge from the president of the united states to give notice to all the consuls and vice consuls of france in the united states as i hereby do to you that if any of them shall commit any of the acts before mentioned or assume any jurisdiction not expressly given by the convention between france and the united states the exequatur of the consul so transgressing will be immediately revoked and his person be submitted to such prosecutions and punishments as the laws may prescribe for the case    thomas jefferson sept        james madison to james madison mad mss  sept        i have received and am charmed with no v i thought the introduction an useful lesson to others as i found it to myself for i had really by constantly hearing the sound been led into a pretty free use of it myself i struck out the passage you desired in the last page i struck out also the words and neutrality in the following passage taking the proclamation in its proper sense as reminding all concerned that as the u s were at peace the laws of peace and neutrality were still obligatory also a paragraph of   lines that a minister from france was hourly expected when the proclamation issued there was one here at the time—the other did not arrive in   weeks to have waited that time should have given full course to the evil i went through franklin with enchantment  what peculiarly pleased me was that there was not a sentence from which it could be conjectured whether it came from n s e or west at last a whole page of virginia flashed on me it was in the section on the state of parties and was an apology for the continuance of slavery among us however this circumstance may be justly palliated it had nothing to do with the state of parties with the bank encumbered a good cause with a questionable argument many readers who would have gone heart  hand with the author so far would have flown off in a tangent from that paragraph i struck it out justify this if you please to those concerned and if it cannot be done say so  it may still be reestablished    i mentioned to you in my last that a fr consul at boston had rescued a vessel out of the hands of a marshal by military force genet has at new york forbidden a marshal to arrest a vessel and given orders to the french squadron to protect her by force was there ever an instance before of a diplomatic man overawing  obstructing the course of the law in a country by an armed force the yellow fever increases the week before last about   a day died this last week about    a day have died consequently from known data about    a day are taken and there are about   0 patients under it they are much scattered through the town and it is the opinion of the physicians that there is no possibility of stopping it they agree that it is a nondescript disease and no two agree in any one part of their process of cure the presidt goes off the day after tomorrow

phænomenon if his courage of which he has the reputation in military occasions were genuine his friends who have not seen him suspect it is only an autumnal fever he has i would really go away because i think there is rational danger but that i had before announced that i should not go till the beginning of october     i do not like to exhibit the appearance of panic besides that i think there might serious ills proceed from there being not a single member of the administration in place poor hutcheson dined with me on friday was sennight was taken that night on his return home  died the day before yesterday it is difficult to say whether the republican interest has suffered more by his death or genets extravagance i sometimes cannot help seriously believing the latter to be a dumourier endeavouring to draw us into the war against france as dumourier while a minister drew on her the war of the empire—the indians have refused to meet our commissioners unless they would make the ohio a boundary by preliminary condn consequently they are on their return  we may suppose wayne in movement—since my last which was of the  st yours of the   d aug   d sep are received adieu thomas jefferson september        philadelphia edmond charles genet to the french minister edmond charles genet j mss  philadelphia september        sir— in my letter of june   th on the subject of the ship william and generally of vessels suggested to be taken within the limits of the protection of the united states by the armed vessels of your nation i undertook to assure you it would be more agreeable to the president that such vessels should be detained under the orders of yourself or the consuls of france than by a military guard until the government of the united states should be able to    inquire into and decide on the fact in two separate letters of the   th of the same month i had the honor to inform you of the claims lodged with the executive for the same ship william and the brig fanny to enclose you the evidence on which they were founded and to desire that if you found it just you would order the vessels to be delivered to the owners or if overweighed in your judgment by any contradictory evidence which you might have or acquire you would do me the favor to communicate that evidence and that the consuls of france might retain the vessels in their custody in the meantime until the executive of the united states should consider and decide finally on the subject when that mode of proceeding was consented to for your satisfaction it was by no means imagined it would have occasioned such delays of justice to the individuals interested the president is still without information either that the vessels are restored or that you have any evidence to offer as to the place of capture i am therefore sir to repeat the request of early information on the subject in order that if any injury has been done those interested it may be no longer aggravated by delay the intention of the letter of june   th having been to permit such vessels to remain in the custody of the consuls instead of that of a military guard which in the case of the ship william appeared to have been disagreeable to you the indulgence was of course to be understood as going only to cases where the executive might take or keep possession with a military guard and not to interfere with the    authority of the courts of justice in any case wherein they should undertake to act my letter of june   th accordingly in the same case of the ship william informed you that no power in this country could take a vessel out of the custody of the courts and that it was only because they decided not to take cognizance of that case that it resulted to the executive to interfere in it consequently this alone put it in their power to leave the vessel in the hands of the consul the courts of justice exercise the sovereignty of this country in judiciary matters are supreme in these and liable neither to control nor opposition from any other branch of the government we learn however from the enclosed paper that the consul of new york in the first instance and yourself in a subsequent one forbade an officer of justice to serve the process with which he was charged from his court on the british brig william tell taken by a french armed vessel within a mile of our shores as has been deposed on oath and brought into new york and that you had even given orders to the french squadron there to protect the vessel against any person who should attempt to take her from their custody if this opposition were founded as is there suggested on the indulgence of the letters before cited it was extending that to a case not within their purview and even had it been precisely the case to which they were to be applied is it possible to imagine you might assert it within the body of the country by force of arms i forbear to make the observations which such a    measure must suggest and cannot but believe that a moments reflection will evince to you the depth of the error committed in this opposition to an officer of justice and in the means proposed to be resorted to in support of it i am therefore charged to declare to you expressly that the president expects and requires that the officer of justice be not obstructed in freely and peaceably serving the process of his court and that in the mean time the vessel and her cargo be not suffered to depart till the judiciary if it will undertake it or himself if not shall decide whether the seizure has been within the limits of our protection thomas jefferson september        philadelphia george hammond to the british minister  george hammond j mss  philadelphia september        sir— i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your two memorials of the fourth and sixth instant which have been duly laid before the president of the united states you cannot be uninformed of the circumstances which have occasioned the french squadron now in new york to seek asylum in the ports of the united states driven from those where they were on duty by the superiority of the adverse party in the civil war which has so unhappily afflicted the    colonies of france filled with the wretched fugitives from the same scenes of distress and desolation without water or provisions for the shortest voyage their vessels scarcely in a condition to keep the sea at all they were forced to seek the nearest ports in which they could be received and supplied with necessaries that they have ever been out again to cruise is a fact we have never heard and which we believe to be impossible from the information received of their wants and other impediments to active service this case has been noted specially to show that no inconvenience could have been produced to the trade of the other belligerent powers by the presence of this fleet in our harbors i shall now proceed to more general ground france england and all other nations have a right to cruise on our coasts—a right not derived from our permission but from the law of nature to render this more advantageous france has secured to herself by treaty with us as she has done also by a treaty with great britain in the event of a war with us or any other nation two special rights  st admission for her prizes and privateers into our ports this by the seventeenth and twentysecond articles is secured to her exclusively of her enemies as is done for her in the like case by great britain were her present war with us instead of great britain  d admission for her public vessels of war into our ports in cases of stress of weather pirates enemies or other urgent necessity to refresh victual repair c this is not exclusive as we are bound by treaty to receive the public armed vessels of    france and we are not bound to exclude those of her enemies the executive had never denied the same right of asylum in our ports to the public armed vessels of your nation they as well as the french are free to come into them in all cases of weather pirates enemies or other urgent necessity and to refresh victual repair c and so many are these urgent necessities to vessels far from their own ports that we have thought inquiries into the nature as well as the degree of their necessities which drove them hither as endless as they would be fruitless and therefore have not made them and the rather because there is a third right secured to neither by treaty but due to both on the principles of hospitality between friendly nations—that of coming into our ports not under the pressure of urgent necessity but whenever their comfort or convenience induced them on this ground also the two nations are on a footing as it has never been conceived that either would detain their ships of war in our ports when they were in a condition for action we have never conceived it necessary to prescribe any limits to the time of their stay nor can it be viewed as an injury to either party to let their enemies lie idle in our ports from years end to years end if they choose it thus then the public ships of war of both nations enjoy a perfect equality in our ports  st in cases of urgent necessity  d in cases of comfort or convenience and  d in the time they choose to continue and all a friendly power can ask from another is to extend to her the same indulgence which she extends  0 to other friendly powers and though the admission of the prizes and privateers of france is exclusive yet it is the effect of treaty made long ago for valuable considerations not with a view to the present circumstances nor against any nation in particular but all in general and may therefore be faithfully observed without offence to any and we mean faithfully to observe it the same exclusive article has been stipulated as was before observed by great britain in her treaty with france and indeed is to be found in the treaties between most nations with respect to the usurpation of admiralty jurisdiction by the consuls of france within these states the honor and right of the states themselves were sufficient motives for the executive to take measures to prevent its continuance as soon as they were apprized of it they have been led by particular considerations to await the effect of these measures believing they would be sufficient but finding at length they were not such others have been lately taken as can no longer fail to suppress this irregularity completely the president is duly sensible of the character of the act of opposition made to the service of legal process on the brig william tell and he presumes the representations made on that subject to the minister of france will have the effect of opening a free access to the officer of justice when he shall again present himself with the precept of his court    thomas jefferson september  0      philadelphia st george tucker to st george tucker j mss  philadelphia september  0      dear sir— your favor of june    came to hand some time ago and nothing but a load of business has prevented my sooner acknoleging it no person on earth heard with more sincere regret the tales which were the subject of it nobody lamented more the torture thro which their victim must have passed for myself when placed under the necessity of deciding in a case where on the one hand is a young and worthy person all the circumstances of whose education and position in life pronounce her virtuous and innocent and on the other the proneness of the world to sow and spread slander there is no hesitation in my mind i needed no evidence therefore on this question and could at any time have conscientiously appeared as one of her compurgators—what an ocean is life and how our barks get separated in beating through it one of the greatest comforts of the retirement to which i shall soon withdraw will be its rejoining me to my earliest and best friends and acquaintance i shall hope to be in your way in some of your tacks and to be able to assure you personally of the sincere respect and esteem with which i am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson september         philadelphia edmond charles genet to the french minister edmond charles genet j mss  philadelphia september         sir— i have the honor of your letter of the  th inst and can assure you with real truth of the readiness    and zeal with which the executive will concur in preventing within the limits of the united states any preparation of hostilities against france or her colonies as far as this can be effected by the extension of that portion of the public power with which they are invested by the laws your letter requests the arrest and delivery of tanguy galbaud conscience and bonne escaped from the ship jupiter and from the punishment of crime committed against the republic of france and also that necessary measures be taken to prevent the carrying into execution certain plots formed by them and others against their country these two requisitions stand on different ground the laws of this country take no notice of crimes committed out of their jurisdiction the most atrocious offender coming within their pale is received by them as an innocent man and they have authorized no one to seize or deliver him the evil of protecting malefactors of every dye is sensibly felt here as in other countries but until a reformation of the criminal codes of most nations to deliver fugitives from them would be to become their accomplices the former therefore is viewed as the lesser evil when the consular convention with france was under consideration this subject was attended to but we could agree to go no further than is done in the  th article of that instrument when we agree mutually to deliver up captains officers mariners sailors and all other persons being part of the crews of vessels c unless therefore the persons before named be part of the crew of some vessel of the french nation no person    in this country is authorized to deliver them up but on the contrary they are under the protection of the laws if they are part of the crew of a vessel they are to be delivered up but then it happens that the district judge of each state is by the law of congress made the competent person to execute this article of the convention and consequently each within his own state and no one over all the states so that as criminals they cannot be given up and if they be of the crew of a vessel the act of congress has not given authority to any one officer to send his process through all the states of the union the other branch of your request is more completely provided for by the laws which authorize coercions as to expeditions formed in the territory of the united states against nations with whom they are at peace if therefore you will be pleased to give me such information as to persons and places as may indicate to what points the vigilance of the officers is to be directed proper measures will be immediately taken for preventing every attempt to make any hostile expedition from these states against any of the dominions of france the stronger the proofs you can produce and the more pointed as to persons the stronger will be the means of coercion which the laws will allow to be used i have not yet laid this matter before the president who is absent from the seat of government but to save delay which might be injurious i have taken the liberty as the case is plain to give you this provisory answer i shall immediately communicate it to the president and if he shall direct    anything in addition or alteration it shall be the subject of another letter in the mean time i may venture to let this be considered as a ground for your proceeding thomas jefferson

more having never had any money connection at philadelphia i take the liberty of applying to you rather than to any other person to enable me to receive immediately the amount of the enclosed order on mr bankson one of my clerks who is to receive the money at the treasury for me and of my own note for  00 d which i cannot get by discount from the bank till wednesday next and my wish is to go on sunday or monday i expect to be absent   weeks but for fear any accident might delay me a few days i have left the date of my note blank to be filled on the day it shall be lodged in the bank that i may be the less hurried by this circumstance in my return i will assuredly see that it be taken up in time if you can for this paper furnish me a check on the bank or its amount otherwise you will

his conspiracies with my answer sent to him my hurry of business has prevented my translating the former but if it cannot be done in your family i shall be in time to do it myself i enclose also mr

approved by you i expect also to receive from the office a blank commission for the collector of annapolis in time to enclose it herein having found on my going to town the day you left it that i had but one clerk left and that business could not be carried on i determined to set out for virginia as soon as i could clear my own letter files i have now got through it so as to leave not a single letter unanswered or anything undone which    is in a state to be done and expect to set out tomorrow or next day i shall hope to be at mount vernon on the  th day to take your orders the fever here is still diffusing itself it is not quite as fatal colo hamilton and mrs hamilton are recovered the consul dupont is dead of it so is wright the consul hauterive has sent me an answer to my circular letter as proud as could have been expected and not very like a desisting from the acts forbidden as i shall probably be with you as soon as this letter i shall add nothing further than assurances of the high respect and esteem with which i have the honor to be sincerely dear sir your most obedient and humble servant thomas jefferson september         edmond charles genet to the french minister edmond charles genet j mss  september         sir— the correspondence which has taken place between the executive and yourself  the acts which you have thought proper to do  to countenance in opposition to the laws of the land have rendered it necessary in the opinion of the president to lay a faithful statement of them before the government of france to explain to them the reasons  the necessity which have dictated our measures to renew the assurances of that sincere friendship which has suffered no intermission during the course of these proceedings and to express our extreme anxiety that none may be produced on their part this has accordingly been directed to be done by the min pleny of the u s at paris in a letter a copy    of which i now enclose to you and in order to bring to an end what cannot be permitted to continue there could be no hesitation to declare in it the necessity of their having a representative here disposed to respect the laws and authorities of the country  to do the best for their interest which these would permit an anxious regard for those interests and a desire that they may not suffer will induce the executive in the meantime to receive your communications in writing  to admit the continuance of your functions so long as they shall be restrained within the limits of the law as heretofore announced to you or shall be of the tenor usually observed towards independent nations by the representative of a friendly power residing with them the president thought it respectful to your nation as well as yourself to leave to yourself the restraining certain proceedings of the consuls of france within the u s which you were informed were contrary to the laws of the land  therefore not to be permitted he has seen with regret however that you have been far from restraining these proceedings  that the duty has devolved on him of suppressing them by the authority of the country i enclose to you the copy of a letter written to the several consuls  viceconsuls of france warning them that this will be done if any repetition of these acts shall render it necessary to the consul of france at boston no such letter has been written a more serious fact is charged on him which if proved as there is reason to expect will render the revocation of his exequatur an act of immediate duty    thomas jefferson sep    schuylkill james

wrote you last i have some expectation to set out tomorrow and shall make it eight days to your house but it is very possible i may yet be detained here two or three days the arrangement on which i had consented to remain another quarter was that the president was to be absent three weeks and after that i was to be absent   weeks this got me rid of   weeks of the    and the remaining   congress would be setting my view in this was precisely to avoid being at any more councils as much as possible that i might not be committed in anything further this fever by driving me off sooner will bring me back sooner  so far counteract my view—but i need not take the trouble of writing on this subject as i shall see you as early as you will get this letter adieu thomas jefferson september         george hammond to the british minister george hammond j mss  september         sir— i have yet to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the   th instant covering an additional instruction to the commanders of british armed    vessels and explaining its principles and i receive it readily as a proof of your willingness to anticipate our inquiries on subjects interesting to us certainly none was ever more so than the instruction in question as it strikes at the root of our agriculture and at the means of obtaining for our citizens in general the numerous articles of necessity and comfort which they do not make for themselves but have hitherto procured from other nations by exchange the paper has been before communicated to the president but instructions immediately sent to our minister at london to make proper representations on the subject in the effect of which we have all that confidence which the justice of the british government is calculated to inspire that all provisions are to be considered as contraband in the case where the depriving an enemy of these supplies is one of the means intended to be employed or in any case but that of a place actually blockaded is a position entirely new however the discussion having been transferred to another place i forbear to enter into it here we had conjectured but did not before entirely know that the distinction which the instruction makes between denmark and sweden on the one hand and the united states on the other in the case of vessels bound to ports blockaded was on the principle explained by you that what was yielded to those countries by treaty it is not unfriendly to refuse to us because not yielded to us by treaty i shall not contest the right of the principle as a right to its reciprocity necessarily results to us  0 thomas jefferson oct      a statement  j mss  oct      a question whether mr g has threatd to appeal from the pr to the people of the us has excited considble attention from the public has been thot worthy of callg forth the evidence of the highest officers of the govmt to bear testimony to it  to justify the disclosure of the secret private consultations of the exve the performce of an official duty having implicated me in the transaction i have made me necessarily made me a party in the operation having connected me with the matter in question i have been vouched in affirmation of the charge it is with much regret that i enter for anything in so disagreeable an altercn but considerg its present ground silence on my part might beget surmises which would not be just i had conversons on the sunday the  th of july with mr genet and mr dallas as has been stated in the public papers i had a private consultn with the secry of the treasury  was on the next monday to decide what shd be done in the event of the l ss attempting to depart and it was then i made my communication to them the pr retd on the wednesday  on that day i committed the same communications to writing in a report to him a full detail of what has passed i did this when the transactions were fully in my mind  particular circumstanees of the moment conversations led me to detail with more minuteness than usual every circumstance which i could recollect    thought worthy any the least notice i did this when it was impossible to i could not foresee then foresee that the question altercation which has now arisen to nor consequently give to the statemt any hue which might reflect on that and under no other view than that of aspect respecting it my only object was to giveing to the pr a circumstantial  faithful relation of what he had a right to know and i did it with with a sacred regard to truth i have since heard the same transactions matters spoken of on different occn  by different persons that my memory i cd not trust to my insomuch that i should fear to attempt from memory alone for to distinguish at this time what i have heard from one person  on what occasion  what from another what on one occn or what on another i think it therefore safest to give the whole statement report without attempting of a the suppression of a tittle of it there are as it contains many things in it which relate not at all to the present question  some which it will be obvious it might be imagined that to be made public had these been omitted were these however now omitted it mt have been thought that tho the parts given forth were in the very words of the report  consequently not stated with a view to the present case yet that it has it might be imagined that their suppression the aspect of what would remain might be sensibly affected by it been i chuse then to throw my self on the indulgencies of those who may need it rather than to incur their suspicions and therefore give a verbal copy of the whole report as follows    thomas jefferson oct        monticello george washington to the president of the united states d s mss  monticello oct        dear sir— i have the honor to inclose herewith the following papers     a note from mr coxe which covered a letter from nassau     a letter from george nicholas which covered his commission returned     a letter from mr gore relating to mr duplaine  the communications between him  govr hancock which i asked at the desire of the secretary at war  which are for him     a letter from mr genet of sep    which being merely an answer to one of mine requires no reply     a letter from mr genet of sep    this is an answer to the written and verbal applications made to him on the subject of the william  the fanny after being in his hands between two  three months the consul at philadelphia is still too busy to furnish the information i had desired he is since dead which of course furnishes a new excuse for delay this indicates clearly enough that mr genet does not mean to deliver them up however he adds that the information would be useless until we settle what is to be deemed the extent of the limits of our protection as this has never yet been decided i am not able to answer him until you shall be pleased to determine what shall be proposed on that subject i think myself that these limits    are of great consequence  would not hesitate the sacrifice of money to obtain them large i would say for instance to great britain we will pay you for such of these vessels as you chuse only requiring in return that the distance of their capture from shore shall as between us be ever considered as within our limits now say for yourself which of these vessels you will accept payment for with france it might not be so easy to purchase distance by pecuniary sacrifices but if by giving up all further reclamation of the vessels in their hands they could be led to fix the same limits say   leagues i should think it an advantageous purchase besides ridding us of an article of account which they may dispute i doubt on the whole whether any thing further can be effectually done on this subject until your return to the seat of government or to the place where you will fix for the time mr genets answer with respect to his opposing the service of process on a vessel is singularly equivocal i rather conjecture he means to withdraw the opposition and i am in hopes my letter to mr hammond will have produced another effort by the marshal which will have succeeded should this not be the case if military constraint cannot be used without endangering military opposition this vessel also may become a subject of indemnification mr bankson writes me word that genl moylans residence being off the post road he had been obliged to send an express to him which was not yet returned besides the duplicate dispatches for    gouvernr morris i had left in his hands letters for all our foreign ministers  consuls he writes me that the communications with philadelphia had been so much intercepted that he had not yet obtained conveyances the death of wright will require a new nomination of an engraver if it be left to mr rittenhouse i think he would prefer scott just before i left philada i received from mr genet a claim of exemption from tonnage for their vessels which quitted the cape in distress  made the first ports in the u s  particularly as to those which came to baltimore the tonnage of which amounted to a large sum as you were come away i thought it would shorten the business to send his claim in a letter addressed to the secretary of the treasury but as he was sick under cover to mr wolcott in hopes they would make a report thereon to you for your consideration the necessity of these abridgments of formalities in our present distant situations requires that i should particularly suggest to you the expediency of desiring genl knox to communicate to the foreign ministers himself directly any matters relative to the interpositions of his department through the governors for him to send these to me from boston to this place merely that i may send them back to the ministers at philadelphia or new york might be an injurious delay of business i shall hope to have the honor of a line from you whenever you shall have fixed on the time and place at which you shall decide to reassemble us    thomas jefferson oct         monticello george washington to the president of the united states j mss  monticello oct         dear sir— i was the day before yesterday honored with your favor of the  th inst by post and yesterday i received that of the   th by express from colo carrington i will take care to be at germantown by the  st of the month as the ploughing thro the roads of the month of january would be disagreeable with my own horses i shall send them back from fredericksburg for which place i will set out tomorrow friday sennight in order to take the stage from thence of monday the   th this of course will deprive me of the honor of waiting on you at mount vernon but perhaps i may have that of seeing you on the road i have carefully considered the question whether the president may call congress to any other place than that to which they have adjourned themselves and think he cannot have such a right unless it has been given him by the constitution or the laws  that neither of these has given it the only circumstance which he can alter as to their meeting is that of time by calling them at an earlier day than that to which they stand adjourned but no power to change the place is given mr madison happened to come here yesterday after the receipt of your letter i proposed the question to him and he thinks there was particular caution intended  used in the diction of the constitution to avoid giving the president any power over the place of meeting lest he should exercise it with local partialities with respect to the executive the residence law    has fixed our offices at philadelphia till the year   00  therefore it seems necessary that we should get as near them as we may with safety as to the place of meeting for the legislature were we authorized to decide that question i should think it right to have it in some place in pensylvania in consideration of the principles of the residence bill  that we might furnish no pretext to that state to infringe them hereafter i am quite unacquainted with reading  its means of accommodation its situation is perhaps as little objectionable as that of lancaster  less so than trenton or perhaps wilmington however i think we have nothing to do with the question  that congress must meet in philadelphia even if it be in the open fields to adjourn themselves to some other place—i am extremely afraid something has happened to mr bankson on whom i relied for continuance at my office for two posts past i have not received any letter from him nor dispatches of any kind this involves new fears for the duplicates of those to mr morris i have the honor c ps mr randolphs and mr trumbuls letters are returned thomas jefferson nov      germantown thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss  germantown nov      after having experienced on my journey the extremes of heat cold dust  rain i arrived here yesterday i found at baltimore that the stages run no further north and being from that circumstance    thrown into the hands of the harpies who prey upon travellers was pretty well fleeced to get here i think from fredericksburg here with a single servant cost me upwards of seventy dollars before this change in the weather the fever had very much abated in philadelphia  at this time it has almost entirely disappeared in so much that the inhabitants are very many of them returning into the city this is very necessary for our accommodation here as this place is so full that i have been able to obtain a bed in a corner of the public room of a tavern only and that as a great favor the other alternative being to sleep on the floor in my cloak before the fire in this state i am awaiting till some of the philadelphians may take courage to go into the city and make a vacancy here nothing will be done by the president as to the meeting of congress it is imagined that knowing he is here they will rendezvous here and after settling informally to what place they will remove they will go into the fields of the city and pass a regular vote the pure blacks have been found insusceptible of the infection the mixed blood has taken it what is more singular is that tho hundreds have been taken with the disease out of philadelphia have died of it after being well attended yet not a single instance has occurred of anybodys catching it out of philadelphia the question for the session of congress will lie between philadelphia new york  lancaster—freneaus paper is discontinued i fear it is the want of money he promises to resume it before the meeting of congress i wish the subscribers in our neighborhood    would send on their money my love to my dear daughters  am with sincere esteem dear sir yours affectionately ps mr hollingsworth at the head of elk thinks he can immediately send me on a good overseer in the place of rogers i authorized him to allow exactly the same as to biddle consequently on his arrival i must get you to give him orders on watson  colo bell for the same necessaries which i had furnished to biddle thomas jefferson nov        germantown james madison to james madison mad mss  germantown nov        i overtook the president at baltimore  we arrived here yesterday myself fleeced of seventy odd dollars to get from fredericksburg here the stages running no further than baltimore i mention this to put yourself  monroe on your guard the fever in phila has so much abated as to have almost disappeared the inhabitants are about returning it has been determined that the president shall not interfere with the meeting of congress r h  k were of opinion he had a right to call them to any place but that the occasion did not call for it i think the president inclined to the opinion i proposed a proclmn notifying that the executive business would be done here till further notice which i believe will be agreed h r lewis rawle c all concur in the necessity that congress should meet in phila  vote there their own adjournment if it shall    then be necessary to change the place the question will be between n y  lancaster the pensylva members are very anxious for the latter  will attend punctually to support it as well as to support muhlenburg  oppose the appointment of smith s c speaker which is intended by the northern members according to present appearances this place cannot lodge a single person more as a great favor i have got a bed in the corner of the public room of a tavern and must continue till some of the philadelphians make a vacancy by removing into the city then we must give him from   to   or   dollars a week for cuddies without a bed and sometimes without a chair or table there is not a single lodging house in the place ross  willing are alive hancock is dead johnson of maryld has refused  ru l and mcl  in contemplation the last least—you will have seen genets letters to moultrie  to myself of the last i know nothing but from the public papers and he published moultries letter  his answer the moment he wrote it you will see that his inveteracy against the president leads him to meditate the embroiling him with congress they say he is going to be married to a daughter of clintons if so he is afraid to return to france hamilton is ill  suspicious he has taken the fever again by returning to his house he of course could not attend here today but the pr had showed me his letter on the right of calling congress to another place adieu  0 thomas jefferson november        germantown edmond charles genet to the french minister edmond charles genet j mss  germantown november        sir— i have now to acknowledge and answer your letter of september    wherein you desire that we may define the extent of the line of territorial protection on the coasts of the united states observing that governments and jurisconsults have different views on this subject it is certain that heretofore they have been much divided in opinion as to the distance from their sea coasts to which they might reasonably claim a right of prohibiting the commitment of hostilities the greatest distance to which any respectable assent among nations has been at any time given has been the extent of the human sight estimated at upwards of twenty miles and the smallest distance i believe claimed by any nation whatever is the utmost range of a cannon ball usually stated at one sea league some intermediate distances have also been insisted on and that of three sealeagues has some authority in its favour the character of our coasts remarkable in considerable parts of it for admitting no vessels of size to pass near the shores would entitle us in reason to as broad a margin of protected navigation as any nation whatever not proposing however at this time and without a respectful and friendly communication with the powers interested in this navigation to fix on the distance to which we may ultimately insist on the right of protection the president gives instructions to the officers acting under this authority to consider those heretofore    given them as restrained for the present to the distance of one sealeague or three geographical miles from the seashore this distance can admit of no opposition as it is recognized by treaties between some of the powers with whom we are connected in commerce and navigation and is as little or less than is claimed by any of them on their own coasts future occasions will be taken to enter into explanations with them as to the ulterior extent to which we may reasonably carry our jurisdiction for that of the rivers and bays of the united states the laws of the several states are understood to have made provision and they are moreover as being landlocked within the body of the united states examining by this rule the case of the british brig fanny taken on the  th of may last it appears from the evidence that the capture was made four or five miles from the land and consequently without the line provisionally adopted by the president as before mentioned     thomas jefferson nov        germantown george hammond to the british minister george hammond j mss  germantown nov        sir— the president of the united states thinking that before it shall be finally decided to what distance from our sea shores the territorial protection of the united states shall be exercised it will be proper to enter into friendly conferences  explanations with the powers chiefly interested in the navigation of the seas on our coast and relying that convenient occasions may be taken for these hereafter finds it necessary in the mean time to fix provisionally on some distance for the present government of these questions you are sensible that very different opinions  claims have been heretofore advanced on this subject the greatest distance to which any respectable assent among nations has been at any time given has been the extent of the human sight estimated at upwards of  0 miles and the smallest distance i believe claimed by any nation whatever is the utmost range of a cannon ball usually stated at one sealeague some intermediate distances have also been insisted on and that of three sea leagues has some authority in its favor the character of our coast remarkable in considerable parts of it for admitting no vessels of size to pass near the shores would entitle us in reason to as broad a margin of protected navigation as any nation whatever reserving however the ultimate extent of this for future deliberation the president gives instructions to the officers acting under his authority to consider those heretofore given them as restrained    for the present to the distance of one sealeague or three geographical miles from the sea shore this distance can admit of no opposition as it is recognized by treaties between some of the powers with whom we are connected in commerce and navigation and is as little or less than is claimed by any of them on their own coasts for the jurisdiction of the rivers and bays of the united states the laws of the several states are understood to have made provision and they are moreover as being landlocked within the body

affections to all adieu thomas jefferson november   th      germantown george hammond to the british minister george hammond j mss  germantown november   th      sir— i have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the  th instant on the subject of the british ship roehampton taken and sent into baltimore by the french privateer the industry an armed schooner    of st domingo which is suggested to have augmented her force at baltimore before the capture on this circumstance a demand is grounded that the prize she has made shall be restored before i proceed to the matters of fact in this case i will take the liberty of calling your attention to the rules which are to govern it these are i that restitution of prizes has been made by the executive of the united states only in the two cases   of capture within their jurisdiction by armed vessels originally constituted such without the limits of the united states or  d of capture either within or without their jurisdiction by armed vessels originally constituted such within the limits of the united states which last have been called proscribed vessels ii that all military equipments within the ports of the united states are forbidden to the vessels of the belligerent powers even where they have been constituted vessels of war before their arrival in our ports and where such equipments have been made before detection they are ordered to be suppressed when detected and the vessel reduced to her original condition but if they escape detection altogether depart and make prizes the executive has not undertaken to restore the prizes with due care it can scarcely happen that military equipments of any magnitude shall escape discovery those which are small may sometimes perhaps escape but to pursue these so far as to decide that the smallest circumstance of military equipment to a vessel in our ports shall invalidate her prizes through all time would be a measure of incalcuable    consequences and since our interference must be governed by some general rule and between great and small equipments no practicable line of distinction can be drawn it will be attended with less evil on the whole to rely on the efficacy of the means of prevention that they will reach with certainty equipments of any magnitude and the great mass of those of smaller importance also and if some should in the event escape all our vigilance to consider these as of the number of cases which will at times baffle the restraints of the wisest and bestguarded rules which human foresight can devise and i think we may safely rely that since the regulations which got into a course of execution about the middle of august last it is scarcely possible that equipments of any importance should escape discovery these principles shewing that no demand of restitution holds on the ground of a mere military alteration or an augmentation of force i will consider your letter only as a complaint that the orders of the president prohibiting these have not had their effect in the case of the industry and enquire whether if this be so it has happened either from neglect or connivance in those charged with the execution of these orders for this we must resort to facts which shall be taken from the evidence furnished by yourself and the british viceconsul at baltimore and from that which shall accompany this letter about the beginning of august the industry is said to have arrived at baltimore with the french fleet from st domingo the particular state of her armament on her arrival is lately questioned but it is not    questioned that she was an armed vessel of some degree the executive having received an intimation that two vessels were equipping themselves at baltimore for a cruise a letter was on the  th of augt addressed by the secretary of war to the governor of maryland desiring an inquiry into the fact in his absence the executive council of maryland charged one of their own body the honorable mr killy with the inquiry he proceeded to baltimore and after two days examination found no vessel answering the description of that which was the object of his inquiry he then engaged the british viceconsul in the search who was not able any more than himself to discover any such vessels captain killy however observing a schooner which appeared to have been making some equipments for a cruise to have added to her guns and made some alteration in her waist thought these circumstances merited examination though the rules of august had not yet appeared finding that his inquiries excited suspicion and fearing the vessel might be withdrawn he had her seized and proceeded in investigation he found that she was the schooner industry captain carver from st domingo that she had been an armed vessel for three years before her coming here and as late as april last had mounted    guns that she now mounted only    and he could not learn that she had procured any of these or done anything else essential to her as a privateer at baltimore he therefore discharged her and on the   d of august the executive council made the report to the secretary of war of which i    enclose you a copy about a fortnight after this sep   you added to a letter on other business a short paragraph saying that you had lately received information that a vessel named the industry had within the last   or   weeks been armed manned and equipped in the port of baltimore the proceedings before mentioned having been in another department were not then known to me i therefore could only communicate this paragraph to the proper department the separation of the executive within a few weeks after prevented any explanations on this subject and without them it was not in my power to either controvert or admit the information you had received under these circumstances i think you must be sensible sir that your conclusion from my silence that i regarded the fact as proved was not a very necessary one new inquiries at that time could not have prevented the departure of the privateer or the capture of the roehampton for the privateer had then been out some time the roehampton was already taken and was arriving at baltimore which she did about the day of the date of your letter after her arrival new witnesses had come forward to prove that the industry had made some military equipments at baltimore before her cruise the affidavits taken by the british viceconsul are dated about   or  0 days after the date of your letter and arrival of the roehampton and we have only to lament that those witnesses had not given their information to the viceconsul when mr killy engaged his aid in the enquiries he was making and when it would have    had the effect of our detaining the privateer till she should have reduced herself to the condition in which she was when she arrived in our ports if she had really added anything to her then force but supposing the testimony just and full tho taken ex parte and not under the legal sanction of an oath yet the governors refusal to restore the prize was perfectly proper for as has been before observed restitution has never been made by the executive nor can be made on a mere clandestine alteration or augmentation of military equipments which was all that the new testimony tended to prove notwithstanding however that the president thought the information obtained on the former occasion had cleared this privateer from any wellgrounded cause of arrest yet that which you have now offered opens the possibility that the former was defective he has therefore desired new inquiry to be made before a magistrate legally authorized to administer an oath and indifferent to both parties and should the result be that the vessel did really make any military equipments in our ports instructions will be given to reduce her to her original condition whenever she shall again come into our ports on the whole sir i hope you will perceive that on the first intimation thro their own channel and without waiting for information on your part that a vessel was making military equipments at baltimore the executive took the best measures for inquiring into the fact in order to prevent or suppress such equipments that an officer of high respectability was charged with the inquiry and that he made it  0 with great diligence himself and engaged similar inquiries on the part of your viceconsul that neither of them could find that the privateer had made such equipments or of course that there was any ground for reducing or detaining her that at the date of your letter of sep   the first intimation received from you the privateer was departed had taken her prize and that prize was arriving in port that the new evidence taken  0 days after that arrival can produce no other effect than the institution of a new inquiry and a reduction of the force of the privateer should she appear to have made any military alterations or augmentation on her return into our ports and that in no part of this proceeding is there the smallest ground for imputing either negligence or connivance to any of the officers who have acted in it thomas jefferson nov         germantown eli whitney

thomas jefferson november         germantown edmond charles genet to the french minister edmond charles genet j mss  germantown november         sir— in my letter of october   i took the liberty of noticing to you that the commission of consul to m dannery ought to have been addressed to the president of the united states he being the only channel of communication between this country and foreign nations it is from him alone that foreign nations or their agents are to learn what is or has been the will of the nation and whatever he communicates as such they have a right and are bound to consider as the expression of the nation and no foreign agent can be allowed to question it to interpose between him and any other branch of government under the pretext of eithers transgressing their functions nor to make himself the umpire and final judge between them i am therefore sir not authorized to enter into any discussions with you on the meaning of our constitution in any part of it or    to prove to you that it has ascribed to him alone the admission or interdiction of foreign agents i inform you of the fact by authority from the president i had observed to you that we were persuaded that in the case of the consul dannery the error in the address had proceeded from no intention in the executive council of france to question the functions of the president and therefore no difficulty was made in issuing the commission we are still under the same persuasion but in your letter of the   th instant you personally question the authority of the president and in consequence of that have not addressed to him the commissions of messrs pennevert and chervi making a point of this formality on your part it becomes necessary to make a point of it on ours also and i am therefore charged to return you those commissions and to inform you that bound to enforce respect to the order of things established by our constitution the president will issue no exequatur to any consul or vice consul not directed to him in the usual form after the party from whom it comes has been apprized that such should be the address thomas jefferson nov         cabinet decisions w mss  nov

constantly bleeding the influence of the united states has been put into action as far as it could be either with decency or effect but i fear that distance and difference of principle give little hold to general washington on the jailers of lafayette however his friends may be assured that our zeal has not been inactive your letter gives me the first information that our dear friend madame de corny has been as to her fortune among the victims of the times sad times indeed and much lamented victim i know no country where the remains of a fortune could place her so much at her ease as this and where public esteem is so attached to worth regardless of wealth but our manners and the state of our society here are so different from those to which her habits have been formed that she would lose more perhaps in that scale and madame cosway in a convent i knew that to much goodness of heart she joined enthusiasm and religion but i thought that very enthusiasm would have prevented her from shutting up her adoration of the god of the universe within the walls of a cloister that she would rather have sought the mountaintop how happy should i be that it were mine that you she and madame de corny would seek you say indeed that you are coming to america but i know that means new    york in the meantime i am going to virginia i have at length become able to fix that to the beginning of the new year i am then to be liberated from the hated occupations of politics and to remain in the bosom of my family my farm and my books i have my house to build my fields to farm and to watch for the happiness of those who labor for mine i have one daughter married to a man of science sense virtue and competence in whom indeed i have nothing more to wish they live with me if the other shall be as fortunate in due process of time i shall imagine myself as blessed as the most blessed of the patriarchs nothing could then withdraw my thoughts a moment from home but the recollection of my friends abroad i often put the question whether yourself and kitty will ever come to see your friends at monticello but it is my affection and not my experience of things which has leave to answer and i am determined to believe the answer because in that belief i find i sleep sounder and wake more cheerful en attendant god bless you accept the homage of my sincere and constant affection thomas jefferson

thought it my duty to communicate to them certain correspondences which have taken place the representative  executive bodies of france have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country have given advantages to our commerce  navigation and have made overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground a decree however of the national assembly subjecting vessels laden with

vessels also as we learn very recently to the has been recently represented stated to us representations made on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our minister there by our minister others will be immediately given him in special charge  the result shall be communicated to the legislature     it is with extreme concern i have to inform you that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their minister plenipy here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of the nation which sent him their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war abroad  discord  anarchy at home so far as his acts or those of his agents have threatened our immediate commitment in the war or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognisance of the laws  by an exertion of the powers confided to me where their danger was not imminent they have been borne with from sentiments of regard to his nation from a sense of their friendship towards us from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respected our mutual dispositions and i will add from a firm reliance on the firmness of my fellowcitizens in their principles of peace and order in the meantime i have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties according to what i judged their true sense and have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us  which justice to others left us free to perform—i have gone further rather than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which i deemed the us bound to restore i thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties by avowing it to be my opinion that if restitution were not made it would be incumbent on the us to make compensation the papers now communicated    will more particularly apprize you of these transactions the vexations and spoliations understood to have been committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers  officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared to require attention the proofs of these however not having been brought forward the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified that on furnishing them to the executive due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past  more effectual provisions against the future should such documents be furnished proper representations will be made thereon with a just reliance on a redress proportioned to the exigency of the case the undertaking to restrain generally our commerce of corn  other provisions to their own ports  those of their friends by an express order of the british government has been the subject of the communications — representations now communicated these were forwarded to our minister at their court and we may expect final information thereon in time to make the same known to the legislature during their present session the british government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn  other provisions to their own ports  those of their friends the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our minister at that court in the mean time some discussions on the subject took place between him  them these are also laid    before you  i may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present session very early after the arrival of a british minister here mutual explanations on the inexecution of the treaty of peace were entered into between the secretary of state and with that minister these are now laid before you for your information on the subjects of mutual interest between this country  spain negociations  conferences are now depending the public good requiring that the present state of these should be made known to the legislature in confidence only they shall be the subject of a separate  subsequent communication thomas jefferson nov  0      philadelphia edmund charles genet to the french minister edmund charles genet philadelphia nov  0      sir— i have laid before the president of the united states your letter of nov    and have now the honor to inform you that most of its objects being beyond the powers of the executive they can only manifest their dispositions by acting on those which are within their powers instructions are accordingly sent to the district attorneys of the united states residing within states wherein french consuls are established requiring them to inform the consuls of the nature of the provisions made by the laws for preventing as well as punishing injuries to their persons and to advise and assist them    in calling these provisions into activity whenever the occasions for them shall arise it is not permitted by the law to prohibit the departure of the emigrants to st domingo according to the wish you now express any more than it was to force them away according to that expressed by you in a former letter our country is open to all men to come and go peaceably when they choose and your letter does not mention that these emigrants meant to depart armed and equipped for war lest however this should be attempted the governors of the states of pennsylvania and maryland are requested to have particular attention paid to the vessels named in your letter and to see that no military expedition be covered or permitted under color of the right which the passengers have to depart from these states provisions not being classed among the articles of contraband in time of war it is possible that american vessels may have carried them to the ports of jeremie and la mole as they do to other dominions of the belligerent powers but if they have carried arms also these as being contraband might certainly have been stopped and confiscated in the letter of may    to mr ternant i mentioned that in answer to the complaints of the british minister against the exportation of arms from the united states it had been observed that the manufacture of arms was the occupation and livelihood of some of our citizens that it ought not to be expected that a war among other nations should produce such an internal derangement of the    occupations of a nation at peace as the suppression of a manufacture which is the support of some of its citizens but that if they should export these arms to nations at war they would be abandoned to the seizure and confiscation which the law of nations authorized to be made of them on the high seas this letter was handed to you and you were pleased in yours of may    expressly to approve of the answer which had been given on this occasion therefore we have only to declare that the same conduct will be observed which was announced on that the proposition to permit all our vessels destined for any port in the french west india islands should be stopped unless furnished with passports from yourself is so far beyond the powers of the executive that it will be unnecessary to enumerate the objections to which it should be liable thomas jefferson december        george washington to the president of the united states j mss  december        th jefferson with his respects to the president has the honor to send him the letters  orders referred to in mr morriss letter except that of the  th of april which must be a mistake for some other date as the records of the office perfectly establish that no letters were written to him in the months of march  april but those of mar         apr  0     now enclosed the enigma of mr merlino is inexplicable by anything in his possession he encloses the message respecting france     great britain he first wrote it fair as it was agreed the other evening at the presidents he then drew a line with a pen through the passages he proposes to alter in consequence of subsequent information but so lightly as to leave the passages still legible for the president and interlined the alterations he proposes the overtures mentioned in the first alteration are in consequence of its having been agreed that they should be mentioned in general terms only to the two houses the numerous alterations made the other evening in the clause respecting our corn trade with the hasty amendments proposed in the moment had so much broken the tissue of the paragraph as to render it necessary to new mould it in doing this care has been taken to use the same words as nearly as possible and also to insert a slight reference to mr pinckneys proceedings on a severe review of the question whether the british communication should carry any such mark of being confidential as to prevent the legislature from publishing them he is clearly of opinion they ought not will they be kept secret if secrecy be enjoined certainly not  all the offence will be given if it be possible any should be given which would follow their complete publication if they could be kept secret from whom would it be from our own constituents only for great britain is possessed of every tittle why then keep it secret from them no ground of support of the executive will ever be so sure as a complete knolege of their proceedings by the people and it is only in cases where the public good would be injured and    because it would be injured that proceedings should be secret in such cases it is the duty of the executive to sacrifice their personal interests which would be promoted by publicity to the public interest if the negotiations with england are at an end if not given to the public now when are they to be given  what moment can be so interesting if anything amiss should happen from the concealment where will the blame originate at least it may be said indeed that the president puts it in the power of the legislature to communicate these proceedings to their constituents but is it more their duty to communicate them to their constituents than it is the presidents to communicate them to his constituents and if they were desirous of communicating them ought the president to restrain them by making the communication confidential i think no harm can be done by the publication because it is impossible england after doing us an injury should declare war against us merely because we tell our constituents of it and i think good may be done because while it puts it in the power of the legislature to adopt peaceable measures of doing ourselves justice it prepares the minds of our constituents to go cheerfully into an acquiescence under these measures by impressing them with a thorough  enlightened conviction that they are founded in right the motive too of proving to the people the impartiality of the executive between the two nations of france and england urges strongly that while they are to see the disagreeable things which have been going on as to france we should not conceal from them what    has been passing with england and induce a belief that nothing has been doing thomas jefferson december        cabinet decisions j mss  december        at a meeting of the heads of departments and attorneygeneral at the presidents on the  th of december      mr genets letter of dec   questioning the right of requiring the address of consular commissions to the president was read it is the opinion that the address may be either to the united states or to the president of the united states but that one of these should be insisted on a letter of james king was read dated philadelphia nov         complaining of the capture of his schooner nancy by a british privateer and carried into new providence and that the court there has thrown the onus probandi on the owners to show that the vessel and cargo are american property it is the opinion that mr king be informed that it is a general rule that the government should not interpose individually till a final denial of justice has taken place in the courts of the country where the wrong is done but that a considerable degree of information being shortly expected relative to these cases his will be further considered and attended to at that time the secretary of state informed the president that he had received a number of applications from mr genet on behalf of the refugees of st domingo    who have been subjected to tonnage on their vessels and duties on their property on taking asylum in the ports of this country into which they were forced by the misfortunes of that colony it is the opinion that the secretary of state may put the petitions into the hands of a member of the legislature in his private capacity to be presented to the legislature thomas jefferson december        philadelphia edmond charles genet to the french minister edmond charles genet j mss  philadelphia december        sir— i have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the  d instant which has been duly laid before the president we are very far from admitting your principle that the government on either side has no other right on the presentation of a consular commission than to certify that having examined it they find it according to rule the governments of both nations have a right and that of yours has exercised it as to us of considering the character of the person appointed the place for which he is appointed and other material circumstances and of taking precautions as to his conduct if necessary and this does not defeat the general object of the convention which in stipulating that consuls shall be permitted on both sides could not mean to supersede reasonable objections to particular persons who might at the moment be obnoxious to the nation to which they were sent or whose conduct might render them so  0 at any time after in fact every foreign agent depends on the double will of the two governments of that which sends him and of that which is to permit the exercise of his functions within their territory and when either of these wills is refused or withdrawn his authority to act within that territory becomes incomplete by what member of the government the right of giving or withdrawing permission is to be exercised here is a question on which no foreign agent can be permitted to make himself the umpire it is sufficient for him under our government that he is informed of it by the executive on an examination of the commissions from your nation among our records i find that before the late change in the form of our government foreign agents were addressed sometimes to the united states and sometimes to the congress of the united states that body being then the executive as well as legislative thus the commissions of messrs letombe holker dannemoures marbois crevecœur and chateaufort have all this clause prions et requerons nos très chers et grands amis et alliés les etats unis de lamerique septentrionale leurs gouverneurs et autres officiers c de laisser jouir c le dit sieur c de la charge de notre consul c on the change in the form of our government foreign nations not undertaking to decide to what member of the new government their agents should be addressed ceased to do it to congress and adopted the general address to the united states before cited this was done by the government of your own    nation as appears by the commissions of messrs mangourit and la forest which have in them the clause before cited so your own commission was not as m gerards and luzernes had been a nos très chers c le president et membres du congres general des etats unis c but a nos très chers c les etats unis de lamerique c under this general address the proper member of the government was included and could take it up when therefore it was seen in the commission of messrs dupont and hauterive that your executive had returned to the ancient address to congress it was conceived to be an inattention insomuch that i do not recollect and i do not think it material enough to inquire whether i noticed it to you either verbally or by letter when that of m dannery was presented with the like address being obliged to notice to you an inaccuracy of another kind i then mentioned that of the address not calling it an innovation but expressing my satisfaction which is still entire that it was not from any design in your executive council the exequatur was therefore sent that they will not consider our notice of it as an innovation we are perfectly secure no government can disregard formalities more than ours but when formalities are attacked with a view to change principles and to introduce an entire independence of foreign agents on the nation with whom they reside it becomes material to defend formalities they would be no longer trifles if they could in defiance of the national will continue a foreign agent among us whatever might be his course    of action continuing therefore the refusal to receive any commission from yourself addressed to an improper member of the government you are left free to use either the general one to the united states as in the commissions of messrs mangourit and la forest before cited or the special one to the president of the united states i have the honor to be with respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson december         george washington to the president of the united states j mss  december         the president doubtless recollects the communications of mr ternant expressing the dissatisfaction of the executive council of france with mr morris our minister there which however mr ternant desired might be considered as informal that colo smith also mentioned that dissatisfaction  that mr le brun told him he would charge mr genet expressly with their representations on this subject  that all further consideration thereon lay over therefore for mr genets representations mr genet some time after his arrival i cannot now recollect how long but i think it was a month or more coming to my house in the country one evening joined me in a walk near the river our conversation was on various topics  not at all of an official complexion as we were returning to the house being then i suppose on some subject relative to his country tho i really do not recall to mind    what it was he turned about to me just in the passage of the gate  said but i must tell you we all depend on you to send us a good minister there with whom we may do business confidentially in the place of mr morris these are perhaps not the identical words yet i believe they are nearly so i am sure they are the substance  he scarcely employed more in the expression it was unexpected  to avoid the necessity of an extempore answer i instantly said something resuming the preceding thread of conversation which went on  no more was said about mr morris from this i took it for granted he meant now to come forward formally with complaints against mr morris as we had been given to expect  therefore i mentioned nothing of this little expression to the president time slipped along i expecting his complaints  he not making them it was undoubtedly his office to bring forward his own business himself  not at all mine to hasten or call for it  if it was not my duty i could not be without reasons for not taking it on myself officiously he at length went to new york to wit about the of without having done anything formally on this subject i now became uneasy lest he should consider the little sentence he had uttered to me as effectually tho not regularly a complaint but the more i reflected on the subject the more impossible it seemed that he could have viewed it as such  the rather because if he had he would naturally have asked from time to time well what are you doing with my complaint against mr morris or some question equivalent but he never    did it is possible i may at other times have heard him speak unfavorably of mr morris tho i do not recollect any particular occasion but i am sure he never made to me any proposition to have him recalled i believe i mentioned this matter to mr randolph before i left philadelphia i know i did after my return but i did not to the president till the receipt of mr genets letter of sep  0 which from some unaccountable delay of the post never came to me in virginia tho i remained there till oct    and received there three subsequent mails and it never reached me in philadelphia till dec   the preceding is the state of this matter as nearly as i can recollect it at this time  i am sure it is not materially inaccurate in any point thomas jefferson dec         philadelphia mr church to mr church j mss  philadelphia dec         sir— the president has received your letter of aug    with its enclosures it was with deep concern that he learnt the unhappy fortunes of m de la fayette and that he still learns his continuance under them his friendship for him could not fail to impress him with the desire of relieving him and he was sure that in endeavoring to do this he should gratify the sincere attachments of his fellow citizens he has accordingly employed such means as appeared the most likely to effect his purpose tho under the existing circumstances he could not be sanguine in their obtaining very immediately the    desired effect conscious however that his anxieties for the sufferer flow from no motives unfriendly to those who feel an interest in his confinement he indulges their continuance  will not relinquish the hope that the reasons for this severity will at length yield to those of a more benign character thomas jefferson december         philadelphia george hammond to the british minister george hammond j mss  philadelphia december         sir— i am to acknowledge the honor of your letter of november  0th and to express the satisfaction with which we learn that you are instructed to discuss with us the measures which reason and practicability may dictate for giving effect to the stipulations of our treaty yet remaining to be executed i can assure you on the part of the united states of every disposition to lessen difficulties by passing over whatever is of smaller concern and insisting on those matters only which either justice to individuals or public policy render indispensable and in order to simplify our discussions by defining precisely their objects i have the honor to propose that we shall begin by specifying on each side the particular acts which each considers to have been done by the other in contravention of the treaty i shall set the example the provisional and definitive treaties in their  th article stipulated that his britannic majesty should with all convenient speed and without causing any destruction or carrying away any negroes    or other property of the american inhabitants withdraw all his armies garrisons and fleets from the said united states and from every port place and harbor within the same but the british garrisons were not withdrawn with all convenient speed nor have ever yet been withdrawn from machilimackinac on lake michigan detroit on the strait of lakes erie and huron fort erie on lake erie niagara oswego on lake ontario oswegatchie on the river st lawrence point aufer and dutchmans point on lake champlain  d the british officers have undertaken to exercise a jurisdiction over the country and inhabitants in the vicinities of those forts and  d they have excluded the citizens of the united states from navigating even on our side of the middle line of the rivers and lakes established as a boundary between the two nations by these proceedings we have been intercepted entirely from the commerce of furs with the indian nations to the northward—a commerce which had ever been of great importance to the united states not only for its intrinsic value but as it was the means of cherishing peace with those indians and of superseding the necessity of that expensive warfare we have been obliged to carry on with them during the time that these posts have been in other hands on withdrawing the troops from new york  st a large embarkation of negroes of the property of the inhabitants of the united states took place before the commissioners on our part for inspecting and superintending embarkations had arrived there    and without any account ever rendered thereof  d near three thousand others were publicly carried away by the avowed order of the british commanding officer and under the view and against the remonstrances of our commissioners  d a very great number were carried off in private vessels if not by the express permission yet certainly without opposition on the part of the commanding officer who alone had the means of preventing it and without admitting the inspection of the american commissioners and  th of other species of property carried away the commanding officer permitted no examination at all in support of these facts i have the honor to enclose you documents a list of which will be subjoined and in addition to them i beg leave to refer to a roll signed by the joint commissioners and delivered to your commanding officer for transmission to his court containing a description of the negroes publicly carried away by his order as before mentioned with a copy of which you have doubtless been furnished a difference of opinion too having arisen as to the river intended by the plenipotentiaries to be the boundary between us and the dominions of great britain and by them called the st croix which name it seems is given to two different rivers the ascertaining of this point becomes a matter of present urgency it has heretofore been the subject of application from us to the government of great britain there are other smaller matters between the two nations which remain to be adjusted but i think it would be better to refer these for settlement through    the ordinary channel of our ministers than to embarrass the present important discussions with them they can never be obstacles to friendship and harmony permit me now sir to ask from you a specification of the particular acts which being considered by his britannic majesty as a noncompliance on our part with the engagement contained in the  th  th and  th articles of the treaty induced him to suspend the execution of the  th and render a separate discussion of them inadmissible and accept assurances c thomas jefferson report on the privileges and restrictions on the commerce of the united states in foreign countries  the secretary of state to whom was referred by the house of representatives the report of a committee on the written message of the president of the united states of the   th of february      with instructions to report to congress the nature and extent of the privileges and restrictions of the commercial intercourse of the united states with foreign nations and the measures which he should think proper to be adopted for the improvement of the commerce and navigation of the same has had the same under consideration and thereupon makes the following report the countries with which the united states have their chief commercial intercourse are spain    portugal france great britain the united netherlands denmark and sweden and their american  00 possessions and the articles of export which constitute the basis of that commerce with their respective amounts are breadstuff that is to say bread grains meals and bread to the annual amount of         tobacco         rice         wood         salted fish        pot and pearl ash    0   salted meats      0 indigo        horses and mules        whale oil        flax seed    0   tar pitch and turpentine        live provisions        ships  foreign goods   0    to descend to articles of smaller value than these would lead into a minuteness of detail neither necessary nor useful to the present object the proportions of our exports which go to the nations before mentioned and to their dominions respectively are as follows to spain and its dominions  00  0  portugal and its dominions         france and its dominions         great britain and its dominions         the united netherlands and their dominions       0 denmark and its dominions        sweden and its dominions     0 our imports from the same countries are  spain and its dominions      0 portugal and its dominions        france and its dominions  0      great britain and its dominions          united netherlands and their dominions         denmark and its dominions        sweden and its dominions       these imports consist mostly of articles on which industry has been exhausted our navigation depending on the same commerce will appear by the following statement of the tonnage of our own vessels entering in our ports from those several nations and their possessions in one year that is to say from october      to september    0 inclusive as follows  tons spain       portugal       france      0 great britain     0 united netherlands       denmark       sweden   0 of our commercial objects spain receives favorably our breadstuff salted fish wood ships tar  0  pitch and turpentine on our meals however as well as on those of other foreign countries when reexported to their colonies they have lately imposed duties of from halfadollar to two dollars the barrel the duties being so proportioned to the current price of their own flour as that both together are to make the constant sum of nine dollars per barrel they do not discourage our rice pot and pearl ash salted provisions or whale oil but these articles being in small demand at their markets are carried thither but in a small degree their demand for rice however is increasing neither tobacco nor indigo are received there our commerce is permitted with their canary islands under the same conditions themselves and their colonies are the actual consumers of what they receive from us our navigation is free with the kingdom of spain foreign goods being received there in our ships on the same conditions as if carried in their own or in the vessels of the country of which such goods are the manufacture or produce portugal receives favorably our grain and bread salted fish and other salted provisions wood tar pitch and turpentine for flaxseed pot and pearl ash though not discouraged there is little demand our ships pay  0 per cent on being sold to their subjects and are then freebottoms foreign goods except those of the east indies are received on the same footing in our vessels as in their own or any others that is to say on general duties  0  of from  0 to    per cent and consequently our navigation is unobstructed by them tobacco rice and meals are prohibited themselves and their colonies consume what they receive from us these regulations extend to the azores madeira and the cape de verd islands except that in these meals and rice are received freely france receives favorably our breadstuffs rice wood pot and pearl ashes a duty of   sous the quintal or nearly  ½ cents is paid on our tar pitch and turpentine our whale oils pay   livres the quintal and are the only foreign whale oils admitted our indigo pays   livres the quintal their own  ½ but a difference of quality still more than a difference of duty prevents its seeking that market salted beef is received freely for reexportation but if for home consumption it pays five livres the quintal other salted provisions pay that duty in all cases and salted fish is made lately to pay the prohibitory one of twenty livres the quintal our ships are free to carry thither all foreign goods which may be carried in their own or any other vessels except tobaccoes not of our own growth and they participate with theirs the exclusive carriage of our whale oils and tobaccoes during their former government our tobacco was under a monopoly but paid no duties and our ships were freely sold in their ports and converted into national bottoms the first national assembly took from our ships this privilege they emancipated  0  tobacco from its monopoly but subjected it to duties of eighteen livres fifteen sous the quintal carried in their own vessels and five livres carried in ours—a difference more than equal to the freight of the article they and their colonies consume what they receive from us great britain receives our pot and pearl ashes free whilst those of other nations pay a duty of two shillings and three pence the quintal there is an equal distinction in favor of our bar iron of which article however we do not produce enough for our own use woods are free from us whilst they pay some small duty from other countries indigo and flaxseed are free from all countries our tar and pitch pay eleven pence sterling the barrel from other alien countries they pay about a penny and a third more our tobacco for their own consumption pays one shilling and three pence sterling the pound custom and excise besides heavy expenses of collection and rice in the same case pays seven shillings and four pence sterling the hundred weight which rendering it too dear as an article of common food it is consequently used in very small quantity our salted fish and other salted provisions except bacon are prohibited bacon and whale oils are under prohibitory duties so are our grains meals and bread as to internal consumption unless in times of such scarcity as may raise the price of wheat to fifty shillings sterling the quarter and other grains and meals in proportion  0  our ships though purchased and navigated by their own subjects are not permitted to be used even in their trade with us while the vessels of other nations are secured by standing laws which cannot be altered but by the concurrent will of the three branches of the british legislature in carrying thither any produce or manufacture of the country to which they belong which may be lawfully carried in any vessels ours with the same prohibition of what is foreign are further prohibited by a standing law    car      sect   from carrying thither all and any of our own domestic productions and manufactures a subsequent act indeed has authorized their executive to permit the carriage of our own productions in our own bottoms at its sole discretion and the permission has been given from year to year by proclamation but subject every moment to be withdrawn on that single will in which event our vessels having anything on board stand interdicted from the entry of all british ports the disadvantage of a tenure which may be so suddenly discontinued was experienced by our merchants on a late occasion  when an official notification that this law would be strictly enforced gave them just apprehensions for the fate of their vessels and cargoes despatched or destined for the ports of great britain the minister of that court indeed frankly expressed his personal convictions that the words of the order went farther than was intended and so he afterwards officially informed us but the embarrassments of  0  the moment were real and great and the possibility of their renewal lays our commerce to that country under the same species of discouragement as to other countries where it is regulated by a single legislator and the distinction is too remarkable not to be noticed that our navigation is excluded from the security of fixed laws while that security is given to the navigation of others our vessels pay in their ports one shilling and nine pence sterling per ton light and trinity dues more than is paid by british ships except in the port of london where they pay the same as british the greater part of what they receive from us is reexported to other countries under the useless charges of an intermediate deposit and double voyage from tables published in england and composed as is said from the books of their customhouses it appears that of the indigo imported there in the years          onethird was reexported and from a document of authority we learn that of the rice and tobacco imported there before the war fourfifths were reexported we are assured indeed that the quantities sent thither for reexportation since the war are considerably diminished yet less so than reason and national interest would dictate the whole of our grain is reexported when wheat is below fifty shillings the quarter and other grains in proportion the united netherlands prohibit our pickled beef and pork meals and bread of all sorts and lay a prohibitory duty on spirits distilled from grain all other of our productions are received on varied  0  duties which may be reckoned on a medium at about three per cent they consume but a small proportion of what they receive the residue is partly forwarded for consumption in the inland parts of europe and partly reshipped to other maritime countries on the latter portion they intercept between us and the consumer so much of the value as is absorbed in the charges attending an intermediate deposit foreign goods except some east india articles are received in vessels of any nation our ships may be sold and neutralized there with exceptions of one or two privileges which somewhat lessen their value denmark lays considerable duties on our tobacco and rice carried in their own vessels and half as much more if carried in ours but the exact amount of these duties is not perfectly known here they lay such duties as amount to prohibitions on our indigo and corn sweden receives favorably our grains and meals salted provisions indigo and whale oil they subject our rice to duties of sixteen mills the pound weight carried in their own vessels and of forty per cent additional on that or twentytwo and fourtenths mills carried in ours or any others being thus rendered too dear as an article of common food little of it is consumed with them they consume some of our tobaccoes which they take circuitously through great britain levying heavy duties on them also their duties of entry town duties and excise being     dollars the hundred weight if  0  carried in their own vessels and of forty per cent on that additional if carried in our own or any other vessels they prohibit altogether our bread fish pot and pearl ashes flaxseed tar pitch and turpentine wood except oak timber and masts and all foreign manufactures under so many restrictions and prohibitions our navigation with them is reduced to almost nothing with our neighbors an order of things much harder presents itself spain and portugal refuse to all those parts of america which they govern all direct intercourse with any people but themselves the commodities in mutual demand between them and their neighbors must be carried to be exchanged in some port of the dominant country and the transportation between that and the subject state must be in a domestic bottom france by a standing law permits her west india possessions to receive directly our vegetables live provisions horses wood tar pitch turpentine rice and maize and prohibits our other bread stuff but a suspension of this prohibition having been left to the colonial legislatures in times of scarcity it was formerly suspended occasionally but latterly without interruption our fish and salted provisions except pork are received in their islands under a duty of three colonial livres the quintal and our vessels are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither and to bring away rum and molasses  0  great britain admits in her islands our vegetables live provisions horses wood tar pitch and turpentine rice and bread stuff by a proclamation of her executive limited always to the term of a year but hitherto renewed from year to year she prohibits our salted fish and other salted provisions she does not permit our vessels to carry thither our own produce her vessels alone may take it from us and bring in exchange rum molasses sugar coffee cocoanuts ginger and pimento there are indeed some freedoms in the island of dominica but under such circumstances as to be little used by us in the british continental colonies and in newfoundland all our productions are prohibited and our vessels forbidden to enter their ports their governors however in times of distress have power to permit a temporary importation of certain articles in their own bottoms but not in ours our citizens cannot reside as merchants or factors within any of the british plantations this being expressly prohibited by the same statute of    car   c    commonly called the navigation act in the danish american possessions a duty of   per cent is levied on our corn corn meal rice tobacco wood salted fish indigo horses mules and live stock and of  0 per cent on our flour salted pork and beef tar pitch and turpentine in the american islands of the united netherlands and sweden our vessels and produce are received subject to duties not so heavy as to have been complained of but they are heavier in the dutch possessions on the continent   0 to sum up these restrictions so far as they are important first in europe— our bread stuff is at most times under prohibitory duties in england and considerably dutied on reexportation from spain to her colonies our tobaccoes are heavily dutied in england sweden and france and prohibited in spain and portugal our rice is heavily dutied in england and sweden and prohibited in portugal our fish and salted provisions are prohibited in england and under prohibitory duties in france our whale oils are prohibited in england and portugal and our vessels are denied naturalization in england and of late in france second in the west indies— all intercourse is prohibited with the possessions of spain and portugal our salted provisions and fish are prohibited by england our salted pork and bread stuff except maize are received under temporary laws only in the dominions of france and our salted fish pays there a weighty duty third in the article of navigation— our own carriage of our own tobacco is heavily dutied in sweden and lately in france we can carry no article not of our own production to the british ports in europe nor even our own produce to her american possessions     such being the restrictions on the commerce and navigation of the united states the question is in what way they may best be removed modified or counteracted as to commerce two methods occur   by friendly arrangements with the several nations with whom these restrictions exist or   by the separate act of our own legislatures for countervailing their effects there can be no doubt but that of these two friendly arrangements is the most eligible instead of embarrassing commerce under piles of regulating laws duties and prohibitions could it be relieved from all its shackles in all parts of the world could every country be employed in producing that which nature has best fitted it to produce and each be free to exchange with others mutual surplusses for mutual wants the greatest mass possible would then be produced of those things which contribute to human life and human happiness the numbers of mankind would be increased and their condition bettered would even a single nation begin with the united states this system of free commerce it would be advisable to begin it with that nation since it is one by one only that it can be extended to all where the circumstances of either party render it expedient to levy a revenue by way of impost on commerce its freedom might be modified in that particular by mutual and equivalent measures preserving it entire in all others some nations not yet ripe for free commerce in all its extent might still be willing to mollify its restrictions     and regulations for us in proportion to the advantages which an intercourse with us might offer particularly they may concur with us in reciprocating the duties to be levied on each side or in compensating any excess of duty by equivalent advantages of another nature our commerce is certainly of a character to entitle it to favor in most countries the commodities we offer are either necessaries of life or materials for manufacture or convenient subjects of revenue and we take in exchange either manufactures when they have received the last finish of art and industry or mere luxuries such customers may reasonably expect welcome and friendly treatment at every market customers too whose demands increasing with their wealth and population must very shortly give full employment to the whole industry of any nation whatever in any line of supply they may get into the habit of calling for from it but should any nation contrary to our wishes suppose it may better find its advantage by continuing its system of prohibitions duties and regulations it behooves us to protect our citizens their commerce and navigation by counter prohibitions duties and regulations also free commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for restrictions and vexations nor are they likely to produce a relaxation of them our navigation involves still higher considerations as a branch of industry it is valuable but as a resource of defence essential its value as a branch of industry is enhanced by     the dependence of so many other branches on it in times of general peace it multiplies competitors for employment in transportation and so keeps that at its proper level and in times of war that is to say when those nations who may be our principal carriers shall be at war with each other if we have not within ourselves the means of transportation our produce must be exported in belligerent vessels at the increased expence of warfreight and insurance and the articles which will not bear that must perish on our hands but it is as a resource of defence that our navigation will admit neither negligence nor forbearance the position and circumstances of the united states leave them nothing to fear on their landboard and nothing to desire beyond their present rights but on their seaboard they are open to injury and they have there too a commerce which must be protected this can only be done by possessing a respectable body of citizenseamen and of artists and establishments in readiness for shipbuilding were the ocean which is the common property of all open to the industry of all so that every person and vessel should be free to take employment wherever it could be found the united states would certainly not set the example of appropriating to themselves exclusively any portion of the common stock of occupation they would rely on the enterprise and activity of their citizens for a due participation of the benefits of the seafaring business and for keeping the marine class of citizens equal to their     object but if particular nations grasp at undue shares and more especially if they seize on the means of the united states to convert them into aliment for their own strength and withdraw them entirely from the support of those to whom they belong defensive and protecting measures become necessary on the part of the nation whose marine resources are thus invaded or it will be disarmed of its defence its productions will lie at the mercy of the nation which has possessed itself exclusively of the means of carrying them and its politics may be influenced by those who command its commerce the carriage of our own commodities if once established in another channel cannot be resumed in the moment we may desire if we lose the seamen and artists whom it now occupies we lose the present means of marine defence and time will be requisite to raise up others when disgrace or losses shall bring home to our feelings the error of having abandoned them the materials for maintaining our due share of navigation are ours in abundance and as to the mode of using them we have only to adopt the principles of those who put us on the defensive or others equivalent and better fitted to our circumstances the following principles being founded in reciprocity appear perfectly just and to offer no cause of complaint to any nation   where a nation imposes high duties on our productions or prohibits them altogether it may be proper for us to do the same by theirs first burdening or excluding those productions which they bring     here in competition with our own of the same kind selecting next such manufactures as we take from them in greatest quantity and which at the same time we could the soonest furnish to ourselves or obtain from other countries imposing on them duties lighter at first but heavier and heavier afterwards as other channels of supply open such duties having the effect of indirect encouragement to domestic manufactures of the same kind may induce the manufacturer to come himself into these states where cheaper subsistence equal laws and a vent of his wares free of duty may insure him the highest profits from his skill and industry and here it would be in the power of the state governments to cooperate essentially by opening the resources of encouragement which are under their control extending them liberally to artists in those particular branches of manufacture for which their soil climate population and other circumstances have matured them and fostering the precious efforts and progress of household manufacture by some patronage suited to the nature of its objects guided by the local informations they possess and guarded against abuse by their presence and attentions the oppressions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occasion of relieving it from a dependence on the councils and conduct of others and of promoting arts manufactures and population at home   where a nation refuses permission to our merchants and factors to reside within certain parts of their dominions we may if it should be thought     expedient refuse residence to theirs in any and every part of ours or modify their transactions   where a nation refuses to receive in our vessels any productions but our own we may refuse to receive in theirs any but their own productions the first and second clauses of the bill reported by the committee are well formed to effect this object   where a nation refuses to consider any vessel as ours which has not been built within our territories we should refuse to consider as theirs any vessel not built within their territories   where a nation refuses to our vessels the carriage even of our own productions to certain countries under their domination we might refuse to theirs of every description the carriage of the same productions to the same countries but as justice and good neighborhood would dictate that those who have no part in imposing the restriction on us should not be the victims of measures adopted to defeat its effect it may be proper to confine the restrictions to vessels owned or navigated by any subjects of the same dominant power other than the inhabitants of the country to which the said productions are to be carried and to prevent all inconvenience to the said inhabitants and to our own by too sudden a check on the means of transportation we may continue to admit the vessels marked for future exclusion on an advanced tonnage and for such length of time only as may be supposed necessary to provide against that inconvenience     the establishment of some of these principles by great britain alone has already lost to us in our commerce with that country and its possessions between eight and nine hundred vessels of near  0000 tons burden according to statements from official materials in which they have confidence this involves a proportional loss of seamen shipwrights and shipbuilding and is too serious a loss to admit forbearance of some effectual remedy it is true we must expect some inconvenience in practice from the establishment of discriminating duties but in this as in so many other cases we are left to choose between two evils these inconveniences are nothing when weighed against the loss of wealth and loss of force which will follow our perseverance in the plan of indiscrimination when once it shall be perceived that we are either in the system or in the habit of giving equal advantages to those who extinguish our commerce and navigation by duties and prohibitions as to those who treat both with liberality and justice liberality and justice will be converted by all into duties and prohibitions it is not to the moderation and justice of others we are to trust for fair and equal access to market with our productions or for our due share in the transportation of them but to our own means of independence and the firm will to use them nor do the inconveniences of discrimination merit consideration not one of the nations before mentioned perhaps not a commercial nation on earth is without them in our case one distinction alone will     suffice that is to say between nations who favor our productions and navigation and those who do not favor them one set of moderate duties say the present duties for the first and a fixed advance on these as to some articles and prohibitions as to others for the last still it must be repeated that friendly arrangements are preferable with all who will come into them and that we should carry into such arrangements all the liberality and spirit of accommodation which the nature of the case will admit france has of her own accord proposed negotiations for improving by a new treaty on fair and equal principles the commercial relations of the two countries but her internal disturbances have hitherto prevented the prosecution of them to effect though we have had repeated assurances of a continuance of the disposition proposals of friendly arrangement have been made on our part by the present government to that of great britain as the message states but being already on as good a footing in law and a better in fact than the most favored nation they have not as yet discovered any disposition to have it meddled with we have no reason to conclude that friendly arrangements would be declined by the other nations with whom we have such commercial intercourse as may render them important in the meanwhile it would rest with the wisdom of congress to determine whether as to those nations they will not surcease ex parte regulations on the reasonable presumption     that they will concur in doing whatever justice and moderation dictate should be done thomas jefferson dec         philadelphia edmund randolph to the attorneygeneral edmund randolph j mss  philadelphia dec         sir— the minister plenipotentiary of france has inclosed to me the copy of a letter of the   th inst which he addressed to you stating that some libellous publications had been made against him by mr jay chief justice of the u s  mr king one of the senators for the state of new york  desiring that they might be prosecuted this letter has been laid before the president according to the request of the minister  the president never doubting your readiness on all occasions to perform the functions of your office yet thinks it incumbent on him to recommend it specially on the present occasion as it concerns a public character peculiarly entitled to the protection of the laws on the other hand as our citizens ought not be to vexed with groundless prosecutions duty to them requires it to be added that if you judge the prosecution in question to be of that nature you consider this recommendation as not extending to it its only object being to engage you to proceed in this case according to the duties of your office the laws of the land  the privileges of the parties concerned i have the honor c   0 thomas jefferson dec  0th      opinion on neutral trade dec  0th      explanation of the origin of the principle that free bottoms make free goods a doubt being entertained whether the use of the word modern as applied to the law of nations in the presidents proclamation be not inconsistent with ground afterwards taken in a letter to genet i will state the matter while it is fresh in my mind—beginning it from an early period it cannot be denied that according to the general law of nations the goods of an enemy are lawful prize in the bottom of a friend and the goods of a friend privileged in the bottom of an enemy or in other words that the goods follow the owner the inconvenience of this principle in subjecting neutral vessels to vexatious searches at sea has for more than a century rendered it usual for nations to substitute a conventional principle that the goods shall follow the bottom instead of the natural one before mentioned france has done it in all her treaties so i believe had spain before the american revolution britain had not done it when that war had involved those powers russia foreseeing that her commerce would be much harassed by the british ships engaged denmark sweden and portugal to arm and to declare that the conventional principle should be observed by the powers at war towards neutrals and that they would make common cause against the party who should violate it declaring expressly at the same time that that convention     should be in force only during the war then existing holland acceded to the convention and britain instantly attacked her but the other neutral powers did not think proper to comply with their stipulation of making common cause france declared at once that she would conform to the conventional principle this in fact imposed no new obligation on her for she was already bound by her treaties with all those powers to observe that principle spain made the same declaration congress gave similar orders to their vessels but congress afterwards gave instructions to their ministers abroad not to engage them in any future combination of powers for the general enforcement of the conventional principle that goods should follow the bottom as this might at some time or other engage them in a war for other nations but to introduce the principle separately with every nation by the treaties they were authorized to make with each it had been already done with france and holland and it was afterwards done with prussia and made a regular part in every treaty they proposed to others after the war great britain established it between herself and france when she engaged in the present war with france it was thought extremely desirable for us to get this principle admitted by her and hoping that as she had acceded to it in one instance she might be induced to admit it as a principle now settled by the common consent of nations for every nation belligerent or neutral had stipulated it on one or more occasions that she might be induced to consider it as now become a conventional     law of nations i proposed to insert the word modern in the proclamation to open upon her the idea that we should require the acquiescence in that principle as the condition of our remaining in peace it was thought desirable by the other gentlemen but having no expectation of any effect from it they acquiesced in the insertion of the word merely to gratify me i had another view which i did not mention to them because i apprehended it would occasion the loss of the word by the ancient law of nations e g in the time of the romans the furnishing a limited aid of troops though stipulated was deemed a cause of war in latter times it is admitted not to be a cause of war this is one of the improvements in the law of nations i thought we might conclude by parity of reasoning that the guaranteeing a limited portion of territory in a stipulated case might not by the modern law of nations be a cause of war i therefore meant by the introduction of that word to lay the foundation of the execution of our guarantee by way of negotiation with england the word was therefore introduced and a strong letter was written to mr pinckney to observe to great britain that we were bound by our treaties with the other belligerent powers to observe certain principles during this war that we were willing to observe the same principles towards her and indeed that we considered it as essential to proceed by the same rule to all and to propose to her to select those articles concerning our conduct in a case of our neutrality from any one of our treaties which she pleased or that we would take     those from her own treaty with france and make a temporary convention of them for the term of the present war and he was instructed to press this strongly i told genet that we had done this but instead of giving us time to work our principles into effect by negotiation he immediately took occasion in a letter to threaten that if we did not resent the conduct of the british in taking french property in american bottoms and protect their goods by effectual measures meaning by arms he would give direction that the principle of our treaty of goods following the bottom should be disregarded he was at the same time in the habit of keeping our goods taken in british bottoms so that they were to take the gaining alternative of each principle and give us the losing one it became necessary to oppose this in the answer to his letter and it was impossible to do it soundly but by placing it on its own ground to wit that the law of nations established as a general rule that goods should follow the owner and that the making them follow the vessel was an exception depending on special conventions only in those cases where the convention had been made that the exception had been established by us in our treaties with france holland and prussia and that we should endeavor to extend it to england spain and other powers but that till it was done we had no right to make war for the enforcement of it he thus obliged us to abandon in the first moment the ground we were endeavoring to gain that is to say his ground against england and spain and to take the very ground of england and     spain against him this was my private reason for proposing the term modern in the proclamation that it might reserve us a ground to obtain the very things he wanted but the world who knew nothing of these private reasons were to understand by the expression the modern law of nations that law with all the improvements and mollifications of it which an advancement of civilization in modern times had introduced it does not mean strictly anything which is not a part of the law of nations in modern times and therefore could not be inconsistent with the ground taken in the letter of genet which was that of the law of nations and by no means could be equivalent to a declaration by the president of the specific principle that goods should follow the bottom thomas jefferson dec         philadelphia martha jefferson randolph to martha jefferson randolph j mss  philadelphia dec         my dear martha— in my

embark tomorrow for richmond these will be as much in bulk as what went before i think to address them to colo gamble as i retained the longest here the things most necessary they are of course those

by the next post i shall be able to send mr randolph a printed copy of our correspondence with mr genet  mr hammond as communicated to congress they are now in the press our affairs with england  spain have a turbid appearance the letting loose the algerines on us which has been contrived by england has produced peculiar irritation i think congress will indemnify themselves by high duties on

instant desiring an ascertainment in the mode pointed out in my letter of septr   of the losses occasioned by waste spoliation and detention of the sloop hope taken on the  0th of august by the privateer la citoyen genet brought into this port the   th and restored on the  0th in consequence of the orders of this government has been laid before the president i have observed to you in the letter of sept   that we were bound by treaties with three of the belligerent powers to protect their vessels on our coast      waters by all the means in our power that if these means were sincerely used in any case and should fail in their effect we should not be bound to make compensation to those nations though these means should be effectual and restitution of the vessel be made yet if any unnecessary delay or other default in using them should have been the cause of a considerable degree of waste or spoliation we should probably think we ought to make it good but whether the claim be for compensation of a vessel not restored or for spoliation before her restitution it must be founded on some default in the government though we have no treaty with great britain we are in fact in the course of extending the same treatment to her as to nations with which we are in treaty and we extend the effect of our stipulations beyond our coasts  waters as to vessels taken and brought into our ports by those which have been illicitly armed in them but still the foundation of claim from hazard of them must be some palpable default on the part of our government now none such is alledged in the case of the sloop hope she appears to have been delivered within   days after her arrival in port a shorter term than we can possibly count upon in general perhaps too the term may have been still shorter between notice to the proper officer and restitution for the time of notice is not mentioned this then not being a case where compensation seems justly demandable from us the president thinks it unnecessary to give any order for ascertaining the degree of injury sustained i have stated to the president the desire you expressed     to me in conversation that the orders proposed to be given for ascertaining damages in the special cases described in my letter of sep   should be rendered general so that a valuation might be obtained by the officers of the customs whenever applied to by a consul without the delay of sending for the orders of the executive in every special case the president is desirous not only that justice shall be done but that it shall be done in all cases without delay he therefore will have such general orders given to the collector of the customs in every state but you must be pleased to understand that the valuation in such case is to be a mere provisory measure not producing any presumption whatever that the case is one of those whereon compensation is due but that the question whether it is due or not shall remain as free and uninfluenced as if the valuation had never been made i have the honor to be c thomas jefferson dec  0      supplementary report on commerce dec  0      the secretary of state to whom the president of the united

their productions and of acquiring those necessary for their own consumption for that purpose and to increase the national commerce—the commerce of those provinces and their agriculture—has directed the following articles to be provisionally observed the inhabitants of the abovementioned provinces to be allowed to commerce freely both in europe and america with all friendly nations who have treaties of commerce with spain new orleans pensacola and st augustine to be ports for that purpose no exception as to the articles to be sent or to be received every vessel however to be subjected to

proprietors thereof he takes this occasion to note an act of the british parliament of the    george iii chap   which though passed before the epoch to which his report aforesaid related had escaped his researches the effect of it was to convert the proclamations regulating our direct intercourse with their west indian islands into a standing law and so far to remove the unfavorable distinction

to approach nearer to the sentiments of the people in the demonstration of their own they have the advantage of a very full communication from the executive of the ground on which we stand with foreign nations some very unpleasant transactions have taken place here with mr genet of which the world will judge as the correspondence is now in the press as is also that with mr hammond on our points of difference with his nation of these you will doubtless receive copies had they been out yet i should have had the pleasure of sending them to you but tomorrow i resign my office and two days after set out for virginia where i hope to spend the remainder of my days in occupations infinitely more pleasing than those to which i have sacrificed    years of the prime of my life i might rather say    of them—our campaign against the indians has been lost by an unsuccessful effort to effect peace by treaty which they protracted till the season for action was over the attack brought on us from the algerines is a ray from the same centre i believe we shall endeavor to do ourselves justice in a peaceable and rightful way we wish to have nothing to do in the present war but if it is to be forced upon us i am happy to     see in the countenances of all but our paper men a mind ready made up to meet it unwillingly indeed but perfectly without fear no nation has strove more than we have done to merit the peace of all by the most rigorous impartiality to all—sr john sinclairs queries shall be answered from my retirement i am with great esteem dear sir your most obedient servant thomas

officially before both houses and proposing to transmit successively other papers to be laid before them in like manner and i have it in charge to observe that your functions as the missionary of a foreign nation here are confined to the transactions of the affairs of your nation with the executive of the united states that the communications which are to pass between the executive and

that term being now arrived  my propensities to retirement daily more  more irresistible i now take the liberty of resigning the office into your hands be pleased to accept with it my sincere thanks for all the indulgences which you have been so good as to exercise towards me in the discharge of its duties conscious that my need of them has been great i have still ever found them greater without any other claim on my part than a firm pursuit of what has appeared to me to be right and a thorough disdain of all means which were not as open  honorable as their object was pure i carry into my

arrived at home on the   th inst when i left philadelphia there was a great dearth of foreign news since my arrival here there are rumors favorable to france but i know nothing particular the federal house of representatives had given some pleasing expectations of their dispositions by one or two leading votes however mr madisons propositions set for the   th inst would be a better proof of the character of the majority i think the next weeks post may bring us some vote or votes on them which may indicate what we are to expect—now settled at home as a farmer i shall hope you will never pass without calling and that you will make this your head quarters whenever you visit the neighborhood accept sincere assurances of my friendship  respect thomas jefferson feb        monticello edmund randolph to edmund randolph j mss  monticello feb        dear sir— i have to thank you for the transmission of the letters from genl gates la motte      hauterive i perceive by the latter that the partisans of the one or the other principle perhaps of both have thought my name a convenient cover for declarations of their own sentiments what those are to which hauterive alludes i know not having never seen a newspaper since i left philadelphia except those of richmond and no circumstances authorize him to expect that i should inquire into them or answer him i think it is montaigne who has said that ignorance is the softest pillow on which a man can rest his head i am sure it is true as to everything political and shall endeavor to estrange myself to everything of that character i indulge myself on one political topic only that is in declaring to my countrymen the shameless corruption of a portion of the representatives to the  st   d congresses and their implicit devotion to the treasury i think i do good in this because it may produce exertions to reform the evil on the success of which the form of the government is to depend    at richmond our market no property of any form would command money even before the interruption of business by the smallpox produce might be bartered at a low price for goods at a high one one house alone bought wheat at all  that on credit i take this to be the habitual state of the markets on james river to which shortlived exceptions have existed when some particular cash commission for purchases has been received from abroad i know not how it is on the other rivers  therefore say nothing as to them this is the first letter i have written to philadelphia     since my arrival at home  yours the only ones i have received thomas jefferson feb         monticello james madison to james madison j mss  monticello feb         dear sir— we are here in a state of great quiet having no public news to agitate us i have never seen a philadelphia paper since i left that place nor learnt anything of later date except some successes of the french the account of which seemed to have come by our vessel from havre it was said yesterday at our court that genet was to be recalled however nobody could tell how the information came we have been told that mr smiths speech  yours also on your propositions have got into daviss papers but none of them have reached us i could not have supposed when at philadelphia that so little of what was passing there could be known even at kentucky as is the case here judging from this of the rest of the union it is evident to me that the people are not in a condition either to approve or disapprove of their government nor consequently influence it    thomas jefferson mar         monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss  monticello mar         dear sir— the small pox at richmond has cut off the communication by post to or through that place i should have thought it duty to have removed his office a little way out of town that the   0 communication might not have been interrupted instead of that it is said the inhabitants of the country are to be prosecuted because they thought it better to refuse a passage to his postriders than take the smallpox from them straggling travellers who have ventured into richmd now and then leave a newspaper with colo bell two days ago we got that with the debates on the postponement of mr madisons propositions i have never received a letter from philadelphia since i left it except a line or two from e r there is much enquiry for the printed correspondence with hammond of which no copy had come to richmond some days ago we have heard of one at staunton our winter was mild till the middle of january but since the   d of that month when my observations begun it has been    mornings out of    below the freezing point and once as low as   ° it has also been very wet once a snow of   i which lay   days and lately a snow of   i which laid on the plains   days there have been very few ploughing days since the middle of january so that the farmers were never backwarder in their preparations wheat we are told is from    to   at richmond but whether cash can be got for it i have not heard at milton it is    payable in goods only at from  0 to  00 per cent above the philadelphia prices which renders the wheat worth in fact half a dollar i do not believe that  000 bushels of wheat could be sold at milton  charlottesville for   a bushel cash such is the present scarcity of cash here  the general wretched situation of commerce in this country     we are told that the market for wheat at richmond will cease on the departure of the french fleet    thomas jefferson apr        monticello james madison to james madison mad mss  monticello apr        dear sir— our post having ceased to ride ever since the inoculation began in richmond till now i received three days ago  all together your friendly favors of march the  d         and colo monroes of mar the       i have been particularly gratified by the receipt of the papers containing yours  smiths discussion of your regulating propositions these debates had not been seen here but in a very short  mutilated form i am at no loss to ascribe smiths speech to its true father every tittle of it is hamiltons except the introduction there is scarcely anything there which i have not heard from him in our various private tho official discussions the very turn of the arguments is the same and others will see as well as myself that the style is hamiltons the sophistry is too fine too ingenious even to have been comprehended by smith much less devised by him his reply shews he did not understand his first speech as its general inferiority proves its legitimacy as evidently as it does the bastardy of the original you know we had understood that hamilton had prepared a counter report  that some of his humble servants in the senate were to move a reference to him in order to produce it but i suppose they thought it would have a better effect if fired off in the h of representatives     i find the report however so fully justified that the anxieties with which i left it are perfectly quieted in this quarter all espouse your propositions with ardor  without a dissenting voice the rumor of a declaration of war has given an opportunity of seeing that the people here tho attentive to the loss of value of their produce in such an event yet find in it a gratification of some other passions  particularly of their ancient hatred to gr britain still i hope it will not come to that but that the proposition will be carried and justice be done ourselves in a peaceable way as to the guarantee of the french islands whatever doubts may be entertained of the moment at which we ought to interpose yet i have no doubt but that we ought to interpose at a proper time and declare both to england  france that these islands are to rest with france and that we will make a common cause with the latter for that object—as to the naval armament the land armament  the marine fortifications which are in question with you i have no doubt they will all be carried not that the monocrats  paper men in congress want war but they want armies  debts and tho we may hope that the sound part of congress is now so augmented as to insure a majority in cases of general interest merely yet i have always observed that in questions of expense where members may hope either for offices or jobs for themselves or their friends some few will be debauched  that is sufficient to turn the decision where a majority is at most but small i have never seen a philadelphia paper since i left it till     those you enclosed me and i feel myself so thoroughly weaned from the interest i took in the proceedings there while there that i have never had a wish to see one and believe that i never shall take another newspaper of any sort i find my mind totally absorbed in my rural occupations    thomas jefferson apr       monticello james monroe to james monroe mon mss  monticello apr       i wrote to mr madison on the  d inst since that i have received his of mar           apr    and yours of mar        apr   which had been accumulating in the post office of richmond the spirit of war has grown much stronger in this part of the country as i can judge of myself and in other parts along the mountains from n e to s w as i have had opportunities of learning by enquiry some few very quiet people not suffering themselves to be inflamed as others are by kicks  cuffs gt britain has been giving us express a wish to remain in peace but the mass of thinking men seem to be of opinion that we have borne as much as to invite eternal insults in future should not a very spirited conduct be now assumed for myself i wish for peace if it can be preserved salvê fide et honore i learn by your letters  mr madisons that a special mission to england is meditated  h the missionary a more degrading measure could not have been proposed and why is pinckney to be recalled for it is impossible he should remain there after such a testimony that he is not confided in i suppose they think him     not thorough fraud enough i suspect too the mission besides the object of placing the aristocracy of this country under the patronage of that government has in view that of withdrawing h from the disgrace  the public execrations which sooner or later must fall on the man who partly by erecting fictitious debt partly by volunteering in the payment of the debts of others who could have paid them so much more conveniently themselves has alienated for ever all our ordinary  easy resources  will oblige us hereafter to extraordinary ones for every little contingency out of the common line and who has lately brought the p forward with manifestations that the business of the treasury had got beyond the limits of his comprehension—let us turn to more pleasing themes thomas jefferson apr         monticello john adams to john adams j mss  monticello apr         dear sir— i am to thank you for the book you were so good as to transmit me as well as the letter covering it and your felicitations on my present quiet the difference of my present  past situation is such as to leave me nothing to regret but that my retirement has been postponed four years too long the principles on which i calculate the value of life are entirely in favor of my present course i return to farming with an ardor which i scarcely knew in my youth and which has got the better entirely of my love of study instead of writing  0 or    letters a day which i have been in the habit of doing     as a thing of course i put off answering my letters now farmerlike till a rainy day  then find it sometimes postponed by other necessary occupations the case of the pays de vaud is new to me the claims of both parties are on grounds which i fancy we have taught the world to set little store by the rights of one generation will scarcely be considered hereafter as depending on the paper transactions of another my countrymen are groaning under the insults of gr britain i hope some means will turn up of reconciling our faith  honor with peace i confess to you i have seen enough of one war never to wish to see another with wishes of every degree of happiness to you both public  private and with my best respects to mrs adams i am your affectionate  humble servant thomas jefferson may        monticello john taylor to john taylor j mss  monticello may        dear sir— in my new occupation of a farmer i find a good drilling machine indispensably necessary i remember your recommendation of one invented by one of your neighbors  your recommendation suffices to satisfy me with it i must therefore beg of you to desire one to be made for me  if you will give me some idea of its bulk  whether it could travel here on its own legs i will decide whether to send express for it or get it sent around by richmond mention at the same time the price of it  i will have it put in your hands—i remember i showed you for your advice a plan of a rotation of crops     which i had contemplated to introduce into my own lands on a more minute examination of my lands than i had before been able to take since my return from europe i find their degradation by illusage much beyond what i had expected  at the same time much more open land than i had calculated on one of these circumstances forces a milder course of cropping on me  the other enables me to adopt it i drop therefore two crops in my rotation  instead of   crops in   years take   in   years in the following order   wheat   corn  potatoes in the strongest moiety potatoes alone or peas alone in the other moiety according to its strength   wheat or rye   clover   clover   folding  buckwheat dressing in such of my fields as are too much worn for clover i propose to try stfoin which i know will grow in the poorest land bring plentiful crops  is a great ameliorator it is for this chiefly i want the drilling machine as well as for lucerne my neighbors to whom i had distributed some seed of the succory critybus brot from france by young  sent to the president are much pleased with it i am trying a patch of it this year—this drops from the tip of lazarus finger to cool your tongue i have thought even father abraham would approve he refused it to dives in the common hall but in yours he could not do it pray let me have a copy of the pamphlet published on the subject of the bank not even the title of it has ever been seen by my neighbors my best affections to the sound part of our representation in both houses which i calculate to be    0th adieu yours affectionately     thomas jefferson may        monticello tench coxe to tench coxe j mss  monticello may        dear sir— your several favors of feb        march    which had been accumulating in richmond during the prevalence of the small pox in that place were lately brought to me on the permission given the post to resume his communication i am particularly to thank you for your favor in forwarding the bee your letters give a comfortable view of french affairs and later events seem to confirm it over the foreign powers i am convinced they will triumph completely  i cannot but hope that that triumph  the consequent disgrace of the invading tyrants is destined in the order of events to kindle the wrath of the people of europe against those who have dared to embroil them in such wickedness and to bring at length kings nobles  priests to the scaffolds which they have been so long deluging with human blood i am still warm whenever i think of these scoundrels tho i do it as seldom as i can preferring infinitely to contemplate the tranquil growth of my lucerne  potatoes i have so completely withdrawn myself from these spectacles of usurpation  misrule that i do not take a single newspaper nor read one a month  i feel myself infinitely the happier for it we are alarmed here with the apprehensions of war and sincerely anxious that it may be avoided but not at the expense either of our faith or honor it seems much the general opinion here that the latter has been too much wounded not to require reparation  to seek it even in war if that be necessary as to myself i love     peace and i am anxious that we should give the world still another useful lesson by showing to them other modes of punishing injuries than by war which is as much a punishment to the punisher as to the sufferer i love therefore mr clarkes proposition of cutting off all communication with the nation which has conducted itself so atrociously this you will say may bring on war if it does we will meet it like men but it may not bring on war  then the experiment will have been a happy one i believe this war would be vastly more unanimously approved than any one we ever were engaged in because the aggressions have been so wanton  barefaced and so unquestionably against our desire—i am sorry mr cooper  priestly did not take a more general survey of our country before they fixed themselves i think they might have promoted their own advantage by it and have aided the introduction of our improvement where it is more wanting the prospect of wheat for the ensuing year is a bad one this is all the sort of news you can expect from me from you i shall be glad to hear all sort of news  particularly any improvements in the arts applicable to husbandry or household manufacture thomas jefferson may         monticello george washington to george washington j mss  monticello may         dear sir— i am honored with your favor of apr    and received at the same time mr bertrands agricultural prospectus tho he mentions my     having seen him at a particular place yet i remember nothing of it and observing that he intimates an application for lands in america i conceive his letter meant for me as secretary of state  therefore i now send it to the secretary of state he has given only the heads of his demonstrations so that nothing can be conjectured of their details ld kaims once proposed an essence of dung one pint of which should manure an acre if he or mr bertrand could have rendered it so portable i should have been one of those who would have been greatly obliged to them i find on a more minute examination of my lands than the short visits heretofore made to them permitted that a  0 years abandonment of them to the unprincipled ravages of overseers has brought on a degree of degradation far beyond what i had expected as this obliges me to adopt a milder course of cropping so i find that they have enabled me to do it by having opened a great deal of lands during my absence i have therefore determined on a division of my farms into   fields to be put under this rotation  st year wheat  d corn potatoes peas  d rye or wheat according to circumstances  th   th clover where the fields will bring it  buckwheat dressings where they will not  th folding and buckwheat dressings but it will take me from   to   years to get this plan underway i am not yet satisfied that my acquisition of overseers from the head of elk has been a happy one or that much will be done this year towards rescuing my plantation from their wretched condition time patience  perseverance must be the remedy and   0 the maxim of your letter slow  sure is not less a good one in agriculture than in politics i sincerely wish it may extricate us from the event of a war if this can be done saving our faith and our rights my opinion of the british government is that nothing will force them to do justice but the loud voice of their people  that this can never be excited but by distressing their commerce but i cherish tranquillity too much to suffer political things to enter my mind at all i do not forget that i owe you a letter for mr young but i am waiting to get full information with every wish for your health  happiness  my most friendly respects for mrs washington i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson may         monticello james madison to james madison j mss  monticello may         dear sir— i wrote you on the  d of april and since that have received yours of mar          apr        and yesterday i received colo monroes of the  th inst informing me of the failure of the nonimportation bill in the senate this body was intended as a check on the will of the representatives when too hasty they are not only that but completely so on the will of the people also and in my opinion are heaping coals of fire not only on their persons but on their body as a branch of the legislature i have never known a measure more universally desired by the people than the passage of that bill it is not from my own observation of the wishes of     the people that i would decide what they are but from that of the gentlemen of the bar who move much with them  by their intercommunications with each other have under their view a greater portion of the country than any other description of men it seems that the opinion is fairly launched into public that they should be placed under the control of a more frequent recurrence to the will of their constituents this seems requisite to compleat the experiment whether they do more harm or good i wrote lately to mr taylor for the pamphlet on the bank since that i have seen the definition of parties and must pray you to bring it for me it is one of those things which merits to be preserved—the safe arrival of my books at richmond  some of them at home has relieved me from anxiety  will not be indifferent to you it turns out that our fruit has not been as entirely killed as was at first apprehended some latter blossoms have yielded a small supply of this precious refreshment i was so improvident as never to have examined at philadelphia whether negro cotton  oznabrigs can be had there if you do not already possess the information pray obtain it before you come away our spring has on the whole been seasonable  the wheat has much recovered as its thinness would permit but the crop must still be a miserable one there would not have been seed made but for the extraordinary rains of the last month our highest heat as yet has been    this was on the  th inst that blake should not have arrived at the date of your letter surprises me pray inquire into that fact     before you leave philadelphia according to colo monroes letter this will find you on the point of departure i hope we shall see you here soon after your return remember me affectionately to colo  mrs monroe and accept the sincere esteem of dear sir your sincere friend and servant thomas

which has now kept me for ten days in constant torment  presents no hope of abatement but the express  the nature of the case requiring immediate answer i write to you under this situation no circumstances my dear sir will ever more tempt me to engage in anything public i thought myself perfectly fixed in this determination when i left philadelphia but every day  hour since has added to its inflexibility it is a great pleasure to me to retain the esteem  approbation of the president and forms the only ground of any reluctance at being unable to comply with every wish of his pray convey these sentiments  a thousand more to him which my situation does not permit me to go into but however suffering by the addition of every single word to this letter i must add a solemn declaration that neither mr j  nor mr — ever mentioned to me one word     of any want of decorum in mr carmichael nor anything stronger or more special than stated in my notes of the conversation excuse my brevity my dear sir and accept assurances of the sincere esteem  respect with which i have the honor to be your affectionate friend and servant thomas jefferson nov         monticello wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas j mss  monticello nov         dear sir— i take the liberty of enclosing for your perusal  consideration a proposal from a mr divernois a genevan of considerable distinction for science and patriotism  that too of the republican kind tho you will see that he does not carry it so far as our friends of the national assembly of france while i was at paris i knew him as an exile from his democratic principles the aristocracy having then the upper hand in geneva he is now obnoxious to the democratic party the sum of his proposition is to translate the academy of geneva in a body to this country you know well that the colleges of edinburgh  geneva as seminaries of science are considered as the two eyes of europe while great britain  america give the preference to the former all other countries give it to the latter i am fully sensible that two powerful obstacles are in the way of this proposition  st the expense  dly the communication of science in foreign languages that is to say in french or latin but i have been so long absent from my own country as to     be an incompetent judge either of the force of the objections or of the dispositions of those who are to decide on them the respectability of mr divernois character  that too of the proposition require an answer from me and that it should be given on due inquiry he desires secrecy to a certain degree for the reasons which he explains what i have to request of you my dear sir is that you will be so good as to consider his proposition to consult on its expediency and practicability with such gentlemen of the assembly as you think best  take such other measures as you shall find eligible to discover what would be the sense of that body were the proposition to be hazarded to them if yourself  friends approve of it and think there is hope that the assembly would do so your zeal for the good of our country in general  the promotion of science as an instrument towards that will of course induce you and them to bring it forward in such a way as you shall judge best if on the contrary you disapprove of it yourselves or think it would be desperate with the assembly be so good as to return it to me with such information as i may hand forward to mr divernois to put him out of suspense keep the matter by all means out of the public papers and particularly if you please do not couple my name with the proposition if brought forward because it is much my wish to be in nowise implicated in public affairs it is necessary for me to appeal to all my titles for giving you this trouble whether founded in representation patriotism or friendship the last however as the broadest is that on which i wish to     rely being with sentiments of very cordial esteem dear sir your sincere friend and humble servant thomas jefferson dec       monticello william branch giles to william branch giles j mss  monticello dec       dear sir— i have made mr bannisters affair the subject of a separate letter containing a full explanation of it because by giving in the letter it will give you no other trouble i will only add here what would have been too urging if expressed there that if any thing be said of early paiment i would rather be allowed to draw on any one there for the money than have it sent here the attempt which has been made to restrain the liberty of our citizens meeting together interchangeing sentiments on what subjects they please  stating their sentiments in the public papers has come upon us a full century earlier than i expected to demand the censors of public measures to be given up for punishment is to renew the demand of the wolves in the fable that the sheep should give up their dogs as hostages of the peace  confidence established between them the tide against our constitution is unquestionably strong but it will turn every thing tells me so and every day verifies the prediction hold on then like a good  faithful seaman till our brothersailors can rouse from their intoxication  right the vessel—make friends with the transalleganians they are gone if you do not do not let false pride make a teaact of your exciselaw adieu yours affectionately     thomas jefferson dec         monticello james madison to james madison mad mss  monticello dec         dear sir— i have kept mr jays letter a post or two with an intention of considering attentively the observation it contains but i have really now so little stomach for anything of that kind that i have not resolution enough even to endeavor to understand the observations i therefore return the letter not to delay your answer to it and beg you in answering for yourself to assure him of my respects and thankful acceptance of chalmers treaties which i do not possess and if you possess yourself of the scope of his reasoning make any answer to it you please for me if it had been on the rotation of my crops i would have answered myself lengthily perhaps put certainly con gusto the denunciation of the democratic societies is one of the extraordinary acts of boldness of which we have seen so many from the fraction of monocrats it is wonderful indeed that the president should have permitted himself to be the organ of such an attack on the freedom of discussion the freedom of writing printing  publishing it must be a matter of rare curiosity to get at the modifications of these rights proposed by them and to see what line their ingenuity would draw between democratical societies whose avowed object is the nourishment of the republican principles of our constitution and the society of the cincinnati a selfcreated one carving out for itself hereditary distinctions lowering over our constitution eternally meeting together in all parts of the union periodically with closed doors accumulating     a capital in their separate treasury corresponding secretly  regularly  of which society the very persons denouncing the democrats are themselves the fathers founders  high officers their sight must be perfectly dazzled by the glittering of crowns  coronets not to see the extravagance of the proposition to suppress the friends of general freedom while those who wish to confine that freedom to the few are permitted to go on in their principles  practices i here put out of sight the persons whose misbehavior has been taken advantage of to slander the friends of popular rights and i am happy to observe that as far as the circle of my observation  information extends everybody has lost sight of them and views the abstract attempt on their natural  constitutional rights in all its nakedness i have never heard or heard of a single expression or opinion which did not condemn it as an inexcusable aggression and with respect to the transactions against the excise law it appears to me that you are all swept away in the torrent of governmental opinions or that we do not know what these transactions have been we know of none which according to the definitions of the law have been anything more than riotous there was indeed a meeting to consult about a separation but to consult on a question does not amount to a determination of that question in the affirmative still less to the acting on such a determination but we shall see i suppose what the court lawyers  courtly judges  wouldbe ambassadors will make of it the excise law is an infernal one the first     error was to admit it by the constitution the  d to act on that admission the  d  last will be to make it the instrument of dismembering the union  setting us all afloat to chuse which part of it we will adhere to the information of our militia returned from the westward is uniform that tho the people there let them pass quietly they were objects of their laughter not of their fear that  000 men could have cut off their whole force in a thousand places of the alleganey that their detestation of the excise law is universal and has now associated to it a detestation of the government  that separation which perhaps was a very distant  problematical event is now near  certain  determined in the mind of every man i expected to have seen some justification of arming one part of the society against another of declaring a civil war the moment before the meeting of that body which has the sole right of declaring war of being so patient of the kicks  scoffs of our enemies  rising at a feather against our friends of adding a million to the public debt  deriding us with recommendations to pay it if we can c c but the part of the speech which was to be taken as a justification of the armament reminded me of parson saunders demonstration why minus into minus make plus after a parcel of shreds of stuff from æsops fables and tom thumb he jumps all at once into his ergo minus multiplied into minus make plus just so the   000 men enter after the fables in the speech—however the time is coming when we shall fetch up the leeway of our vessel the changes in your     house i see are going on for the better and even the augean herd over your heads are slowly purging off their impurities hold on then my dear friend that we may not shipwreck in the meanwhile i do not see in the minds of those with whom i converse a greater affliction than the fear of your retirement but this must not be unless to a more splendid  a more efficacious post there i should rejoice to see you i hope i may say i shall rejoice to see you i have long had much in my mind to say to you on that subject but double delicacies have kept me silent i ought perhaps to say while i would not give up my own retirement for the empire of the universe how i can justify wishing one whose happiness i have so much at heart as yours to take the front of the battle which is fighting for my security this would be easy enough to be done but not at the heel of a lengthy epistle    thomas jefferson notes for a constitution  j mss  every male citizen of the

remained several days we have had but few thawing days during the time—it is generally feared here that your collegue f walker will be in great danger of losing his election his competitor is indefatigable attending courts c and wherever he is there is a general drunkenness observed tho we do not know that it proceeds from his purse—wilson nicholas is attacked also in his election the ground on which the attack is made is that he is a speculator the explanations which this has produced prove it a serious crime in the eyes of the people but as far as i hear he is only investing the profits of a first  only speculation—almost every carriageowner has been taken in for a double tax information through the newspapers not being actual tho legal in a country where they are little read this circumstance has made almost every man so taken in a personal enemy to the tax i escaped the penalty only by sending an express     over the country to search out the officer the day before the forfeiture would have been incurred—we presume you will return to orange after the close of the session  hope the pleasure of seeing mrs madison  yourself here i have past my winter almost alone mr  mrs randolph being at varina present my best respects to mrs madison  accept them affectionately yourself thomas jefferson feb        monticello in virginia m divernois to m divernois j mss  monticello in virginia feb        dear sir— your several favors on the affairs of geneva found me here in the month of december last it is now more than a year that i have withdrawn myself from public affairs which i never liked in my life but was drawn into by emergencies which threatened our country with slavery but ended in establishing it free i have returned with infinite appetite to the enjoyment of my farm my family  my books and had determined to meddle in nothing beyond their limits your proposition however for transplanting the college of geneva to my own country was too analogous to all my attachments to science  freedom the firstborn daughter of science not to excite a lively interest in my mind and the essays which were necessary to try its practicability this depended altogether on the opinions  dispositions of our state legislature which was then in session i immediately communicated your papers to a member of the legislature whose abilities  zeal pointed him out as proper for it urging him to sound     as many of the leading members of the legislature as he could  if he found their opinions favorable to bring forward the proposition but if he should find it desperate not to hazard it because i thought it best not to commit the honor either of our state or of your college by an useless act of eclat it was not till within these three days that i have had an interview with him and an account of his proceedings he communicated the papers to a great number of the members and discussed them maturely but privately with them they were generally welldisposed to the proposition and some of them warmly however there was no difference of opinion in the conclusion that it could not be effected the reasons which they thought would with certainty prevail against it were   that our youth not familiarized but with their mother tongue were not prepared to receive instructions in any other  d that the expence of the institution would excite uneasiness in their constituents  endanger its permanence    that its extent was disproportioned to the narrow state of the population with us whatever might be urged on these several subjects yet as the decision rested with others there remained to us only to regret that circumstances were such or were thought to be such as to disappoint your  our wishes i should have seen with peculiar satisfaction the establishment of such a mass of science in my country and should probably have been tempted to approach myself to it by procuring a residence in its neighborhood at those seasons of the year at least when the operations of agriculture     are less active and interesting i sincerely lament the circumstances which have suggested this emigration i had hoped that geneva was familiarized to such a degree of liberty that they might without difficulty or danger fill up the measure to its maximum a term which though in the insulated man bounded only by his natural powers must in society be so far restricted as to protect himself against the evil passions of his associates  consequently them against him i suspect that the doctrine that small states alone are fitted to be republics will be exploded by experience with some other brilliant fallacies accredited by montesquieu  other political writers perhaps it will be found that to obtain a just republic and it is to secure our just rights that we resort to government at all it must be so extensive as that local egoisms may never reach its greater part that on every particular question a majority may be found in its councils free from particular interests and giving therefore an uniform prevalence to the principles of justice the smaller the societies the more violent  more convulsive their schisms we have chanced to live in an age which will probably be distinguished in history for its experiments in government on a larger scale than has yet taken place but we shall not live to see the result the grosser absurdities such as hereditary magistracies we shall see exploded in our day long experience having already pronounced condemnation against them but what is to be the substitute this our children or grand children will answer we may be satisfied with the certain     knowledge that none can ever be tried so stupid so unrighteous so oppressive so destructive of every end for which honest men enter into government as that which their forefathers had established  their fathers alone venture to tumble headlong from the stations they have so long abused it is unfortunate that the efforts of mankind to recover the freedom of which they have been so long deprived will be accompanied with violence with errors  even with crimes but while we weep over the means we must pray for the end—but i have been insensibly led by the general complexion of the times from the particular case of geneva to those to which it bears no similitude of that we hope good things its inhabitants must be too much enlightened too well experienced in the blessings of freedom and undisturbed industry to tolerate long a contrary state of things i shall be happy to hear that their government perfects itself and leaves room for the honest the industrious  wise in which case your own talents  those of the persons for whom you have interested yourself will i am sure find welcome  distinction my good wishes will always attend you as a consequence of the esteem  regard with which i am dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson apl       monticello james brown to james brown  monticello apl       dear sir— i received a few days ago your kind favor of mar    the object of my letter had been     not at all a retardation of the paiment i had promised you during the present  ensuing month but as my crop of tobo was much short of what was usual it was merely to see how far my next best article of produce to wit nails could take its place with you i have had   hammers at work for you for some time past we have of nails on hand  credits to go to your benefit about £ 0 and some time in the next month shall have enough for the balance if i cannot sell them for cash here i will send them to richmond to be converted into cash there so as to be in time for my engagement      in the margin are the weights of my tobo only    hhds now in richmond averaging      lbs i am offered here   above the present market price but you shall certainly have a preference on equal terms to any other purchaser as i shall not go to richmond myself i must ask you by letter your highest price you know i have an established privilege of being considerably above the market i must tell you at the same time that the quality of the last years crop is inferior but still mine preserving its comparative superiority stands on its usual ground with respect to others let me have your ultimatum if you please by the post after next say that which leaves richmond the  d of may till which time i will reserve myself here                   0         0                   0                thomas jefferson apl       monticello archibald stuart to archibald stuart  monticello apl       dear sir— i did not receive your favor of the  th till the   th inst consequently you had then passed on to new london i could not learn that your brother was in the neighborhood i inclose you a copy of an advertisement i had thought some time ago of putting in the public papers but did not do it you will see by that the books i have to dispose of the last two or three lines of it are not for you for you may take such of the books as you chuse and what time of paiment you please if you meet with any body who will take the whole of the residue i shall be glad of it i have stated that at the price i offer the whole would be at about   doll average a volume but if they are separated being of very unequal values their respective prices can be proportioned to that sum total by worrals catalogue hargraves coke littleton for instance cost as much as any   or   of the other volumes—when i spoke of meeting you on your way to the bedford court i did not know that our own district court was exactly at the same time at which i was obliged to attend this put it out of my power to be in bedford this month—with respect to the gentleman whom we expected to see there satisfy him if you please that there is no remain of disagreeable sentiment towards him on my part  i was once sincerely affectioned towards him and it accords with my philosophy to encourage the tranquillizing passions adieu     thomas jefferson apr         monticello james madison to james madison mad mss  monticello apr         dear sir— your letter of mar    came to hand the  th of april and notwithstanding the urgent reasons for answering a part of it immediately yet as it mentioned that you would leave philadelphia within a few days i feared that the answer might pass you on the road a letter from philadelphia by the last post having announced to me your leaving that place the day preceding its date i am in hopes this will find you in orange in mine to which yours of mar    was an answer i expressed my hope of the only change of position i ever wished to see you make and i expressed it with entire sincerity because there is not another person in the u s who being placed at the helm of our affairs my mind would be so completely at rest for the fortune of our political bark the wish too was pure  unmixed with anything respecting myself personally for as to myself the subject had been thoroughly weighed  decided on  my retirement from office had been meant from all office high or low without exception i can say too with truth that the subject had not been presented to my mind by any vanity of my own i know myself  my fellow citizens too well to have ever thought of it but the idea was forced upon me by continual insinuations in the public papers while i was in office as all these came from a hostile quarter i knew that their object was to poison the public mind as to my motives when they were not able to charge me with facts but the idea being once presented to me my own quiet required   0 that i should face it  examine it i did so thoroughly  had no difficulty to see that every reason which had determined me to retire from the office i then held operated more strongly against that which was insinuated to be my object i decided then on those general grounds which could alone be present to my mind at the time that is to say reputation tranquillity labor for as to public duty it could not be a topic of consideration in my case if these general considerations were sufficient to ground a firm resolution never to permit myself to think of the office or to be thought of for it the special ones which have supervened on my retirement still more insuperably bar the door to it my health is entirely broken down within the last eight months my age requires that i should place my affairs in a clear state these are sound if taken care of but capable of considerable dangers if longer neglected and above all things the delights i feel in the society of my family and the agricultural pursuits in which i am so eagerly engaged the little spice of ambition which i had in my younger days has long since evaporated and i set still less store by a posthumous than present name in stating to you the heads of reasons which have produced my determination i do not mean an opening for future discussion or that i may be reasoned out of it the question is forever closed with me my sole object is to avail myself of the first opening ever given me from a friendly quarter and i could not with decency do it before of preventing any division or loss of votes which might be fatal to the republican     interest if that has any chance of prevailing it must be by avoiding the loss of a single vote and by concentrating all its strength on one object who this should be is a question i can more freely discuss with anybody than yourself in this i painfully feel the loss of monroe had he been here i should have been at no loss for a channel through which to make myself understood if i have been misunderstood by anybody through the instrumentality of mr fenno  his abettors—i long to see you i am proceeding in my agricultural plans with a slow but sure step to get under full way will require   or   years but patience  perseverence will accomplish it my little essay in red clover the last year has had the most encouraging success i sowed then about  0 acres i have sowed this year about   0 which the rain now falling comes very opportunely on from   0 to  00 acres will be my yearly sowing the seedbox described in the agricultural transactions of new york reduces the expense of seeding from   to    the acre and does the business better than is possible to be done by the human hand may we hope a visit from you if we may let it be after the middle of may by which time i hope to be returned from bedford i had had a proposition to meet mr henry there this month to confer on the subject of a convention to the calling of which he is now become a convert the session of our district court furnished me a just excuse for the time but the impropriety of my entering into consultation on a measure in which i would take no part is a permanent one     present my most respectful compliments to mrs madison  be assured of the warm attachment of dear sir yours affectionately thomas jefferson apr         monticello william branch giles to william branch giles j mss  monticello apr         dear sir— your favor of the   th came to hand by the last post    i sincerely congratulate you on the great prosperities of our two first allies the french  dutch if i could but see them now at peace with the rest of their continent i should have little doubt of dining with pichegru in london next autumn for i believe i should be tempted to leave my clover for awhile to go and hail the dawn of liberty  republicanism in that island i shall be rendered very happy by the visit you promise me the only thing wanting to make me completely so is the more frequent society with my friends it is the more wanting as i am become more firmly fixt to the glebe if you visit me as a farmer it must be as a condisciple for i am but a learner an eager one indeed but yet desperate being too old now to learn a new art however i am as much delighted  occupied with it as if i was the greatest adept i shall talk with you about it from morning till night and put you on very short allowance as to political aliment now and then a pious ejaculation for the french  dutch republicans returning with due despatch to clover potatoes wheat c that i may not lose the pleasure promised me let it not be till     the middle of may by which time i shall be returned from a trip i meditate to bedford yours affectionately thomas jefferson apr       monticello virginia m de meusnier to m de meusnier  j mss  monticello virginia apr       dear sir— your favor of mar  0 from philadelphia came to my hands a few days ago that which you mention to have written from london has never been received nor had i been able to discover what has been your fortune during the troubles of france after the death of the king being thoroughly persuaded that under all circumstances your conduct had been entirely innocent  friendly to the freedom of your country i had hopes that you had not been obliged to quit your own country being myself a warm zealot for the attainment  enjoiment by all mankind of as much liberty as each may exercise without injury to the equal liberty of his fellow citizens i have lamented that in france the endeavours to obtain this should have been attended with the effusion of so much blood i was intimate with the leading characters of the year      so i was with those of the brissotine party who succeeded them  have always been persuaded that their views were upright those who have followed have been less known to me but i have been willing to hope that they also meant the establishment of a free government in their country excepting perhaps the party which has     lately been suppressed the government of those now at the head of affairs appears to hold out many indications of good sense moderation  virtue  i cannot but presume from their character as well as your own that you would find a perfect safety in the bosom of your own country i think it fortunate for the united states to have become the asylum for so many virtuous patriots of different denominations but their circumstances with which you were so well acquainted before enabled them to be but a bare asylum  to offer nothing for them but an entire freedom to use their own means  faculties as they please there is no such thing in this country as what would be called wealth in europe the richest are but a little at ease  obliged to pay the most rigorous attention to their affairs to keep them together i do not mean to speak here of the beaujons of america for we have some of these tho happily they are but ephemeral our public œconomy also is such as to offer drudgery and subsistence only to those entrusted with its administration a wise  necessary precaution against the degeneracy of the public servants in our private pursuits it is a great advantage that every honest employment is deemed honorable i am myself a nailmaker on returning home after an absence of ten years i found my farms so much deranged that i saw evidently they would be a burden to me instead of a support till i could regenerate them  consequently that it was necessary for me to find some other resource in the meantime i thought for awhile of taking up the manufacture of potash which requires     but small advances of money i concluded at length however to begin a manufacture of nails which needs little or no capital  i now employ a dozen little boys from  0 to    years of age overlooking all the details of their business myself  drawing from it a profit on which i can get along till i can put my farms into a course of yielding profit my new trade of nailmaking is to me in this country what an additional title of nobility or the ensigns of a new order are in europe in the commercial line the grocers business is that which requires the least capital in this country the grocer generally obtains a credit of three months  sells for ready money so as to be able to make his paiments  obtain a new supply but i think i have observed that your countrymen who have been obliged to work out their own fortunes here have succeeded best with a small farm labour indeed is dear here but rents are low  on the whole a reasonable profit  comfortable subsistence results it is at the same time the most tranquil healthy  independent and since you have been pleased to ask my opinion as to the best way of employing yourself till you can draw funds from france or return there yourself i do presume that this is the business which would yield the most happiness  contentment to one of your philosophic turn but at the distance i am from new york where you seem disposed to fix yourself  little acquainted with the circumstances of that place i am much less qualified than disposed to suggest to you emploiments analogous to your turn of mind  at the same     time to the circumstances of your present situation be assured that it will always give me lively pleasure to learn that your pursuits whatever they may be may lead you to contentment  success being with very sincere esteem  respect dear sir your most obedient servant thomas jefferson may         monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss  monticello may         dear sir— i have received your favor of sep  th from paris which gave us the only news we have had from you since your arrival there on my part it would be difficult to say why this is the first time i have written to you revising the case myself i am sensible it has proceeded from that sort of procrastination which so often takes place when no circumstance fixes a business to a particular time i have never thought it possible through the whole time that i should be ten days longer without writing to you  thus more than a year has run off i am too much withdrawn from the scene of politics to give you anything in that line worth your notice the servile copyist of mr pitt thought he too must have his alarms his insurrections and plots against the constitution hence the incredible fact that the freedom of association of conversation  of the press should in the  th year of our government have been attacked under the form of a denunciation of the democratic societies a measure which even england as boldly as she is advancing to the establishment of an absolute monarchy has not yet     been bold enough to attempt hence too the example of employing military force for civil purposes when it has been impossible to produce a single fact of insurrection unless that term be entirely confounded with occasional riots  when the ordinary process of law had been resisted indeed in a few special cases but by no means generally nor had its effect been duly tried but it answered the favorite purposes of strengthening government and increasing public debt  therefore an insurrection was announced  proclaimed  armed against but could never be found  all this under the sanction of a name which has done too much good not to be sufficient to cover harm also  what is equally astonishing is that by the pomp of reports proclamations armies c the mind of the legislature itself was so fascinated as never to have asked where when  by whom this insurrection has been produced the original of this scene in another country was calculated to excite the indignation of those whom it could not impose on the mimicry of it here is too humiliating to excite any feeling but shame our comfort is that the public sense is coming right on the general principles of republicanism  that its success in france puts it out of danger here we are still uninformed what is mr jays treaty but we see that the british piracies have multiplied upon us lately more than ever they had at one time been suspended we will quit the subject for our own business the valuation by mr lewis  mr divers which had been set on foot before your departure took     place sep         it was £    currency  exchange being then at  0 per cent it was equivalent to £       sterling on the   th of nov i drew on james maury for £   0 sterling in favor of wm b giles  shall now immediately draw for the balance mr madison  myself examined your different situations for a house we did not think it admitted any sort of question but that that on the east side of the road in the wood was the best there is a valley not far from it to the southwest  on the western side of the road which would be a fine situation for an orchard mr jones having purchased in loudon we shall hardly see him here  indeed have hardly seen him if i can get proper orders from him i will have the ground above mentioned planted in fruit trees from my own nursery where i have made an extra provision on your account indeed i wish you would determine to save  00 or  000£ a year from your present salary which you ought to do as a compensation for your time  send us a plan of the house  let us be building it drawing on you for a fixed sum annually till it be done i would undertake to employ people in the most economical way to superintend them  the work  have the place in a comfortable state for your reception if you think proper to authorize me to do this i shall begin immediately on receiving your permission i am so confident that you ought to do it  will do it that i have ventured to send a small claim or two to you as explained in the two inclosed letters to lamotte  froullé with an expectation that you will give me an opportunity of replacing it here to those who     shall be employed for you should you however not conclude to let us do anything for you here i would wish you to suppress both these letters while speaking of froullé libraire au quai des augustins i can assure you that after having run a severe gauntlet under the paris booksellers i rested at last on this old gentleman whom i found in a long  intimate course of after dealings to be one of the most conscientiously honest men i ever had dealings with i commend him to you strongly should you purchase books i think lamotte at havre a very good  friendly man  wish your forming more than an official intimacy with him should you have occasion for wines from burgundy apply to monsr parent connelie à beaume who will furnish you with the genuine wines you may call for  at honest prices i found him indeed very faithful in a long course of employment he can particularly send you of the best crops of meursalt  cotte dor for fine champagne non mousseux apply to monsr dorsai or to his hommedaffaires monsr louis if still in place at his chateau at aij near epernay in champagne while recommending good subjects to you i must ask you to see for me the following persons present my affectionate remembrance to them and let me hear how they have weathered the storm these are labbe ammon place vendome chez m daville an excellent mentor and much affectioned to the americans monsr la vieillard of passy whom dr franklin presented to me as the honestest man in france  a very honest  friendly one i found him monsr  madame grand at   0 passy vastly good  friendly people also dr gem an old english physician in the faubourg st germains who practiced only for his friends  would take nothing one of the most sensible  worthy men i have ever known but i reckon he has gone to england many others i could name of great worth but they would be too many  have perhaps changed their scene if mr balbatre the musical preceptor of my daughters of the faubourg st honore or its neighborhood can be found be so good as to deliver him the affectionate compliments of my family  if he can send them anything new  good in the musical line i will ask you to pay him for it  let it be packed with the books from froullé these if they come at all must come before the winter as a winter pasage is inevitable ruin to books i have bought for mr short the land between yours  blenheim      acres      ready money three out of seven shares of  0 as each of carters land over the mountain will be for sale soon it is not known where these lands will lie as the partition is not yet made should anyone join you on the mountain it would be worth your purchase collé is lately sold for £    to a mr catlet a farmer whom i do not know it is very possible it will be for sale again should you conclude to build a house you must decide whether of brick or stone the latter costs about onehalf of the former to wit about   a perch of    cubic feet i hope mr jones will change the system of corn  wheat alternately on your land till the fields are entirely worn out abandoned  the new ones treated in the same manner this is the     way my lands have been ruined yours are yet in a saveable state but a very little time will put some of them beyond recovery the best plan would be to divide the open grounds into   fields and tend them in this order   wheat   corn  potatoes   rye   clover   clover and then begin wheat c over again by this means they would go into corn but once in five years it would be still better to have four or five men for a twelve months to clear the whole body of your tenable lands at once that you may at once come into the use of the whole  allow more relief to the old  an easier service to all of it in general instead of wearing out one half while clearing the other by little  little as we have generally done in this neighborhood i am going to have shorts all cleared in this way but of all this there can be no better judge than mr jones i have divided my farms into seven fields on this rotation   wheat   peas  potatoes   corn  potatoes   peas  potatoes till i can get the vetch from europe   rye   clover   clover my lands were so worn that they required this gentle treatment to recover them some of yours are as far gone there are two or three objects which you should endeavour to enrich our country with   the alpine strawberry   the skylark   the red legged partridge i despair too much of the nightingale to add that we should associate mrs monroe to you in these concerns present to her our most affectionate esteem not forgetting eliza we are all well except mr randolph whose health is very frail indeed it     is the more discouraging as there seems to have been no founded conjecture what is the matter with him your brother is well but mrs monroe rather sickly the death of dr walker is the only event of that kind which has taken place in our neighborhood since you left us dr gilmer still lives his eldest daughter is to be married to a

liberty will be the atrocities of robespierre we are enjoying a most seasonable sowing after a winter which had greatly injured our small grain nothing can give us a great crop i doubt if it can be made even a good one our first haycutting clover begins today this may mark to you the difference of your seasons  ours my clover in common upland fields which were never manured will yield   00 lb to

of foreign affairs or the minister of france because i thought you might possibly find a safer channel than either it requires safety and secrecy but adopt either of those channels if you think them

in your letter and in that of mr ogilvie the heat of the weather the business of the farm to which i have made myself necessary forbade it and to give one round reason for all mature sanus i have laid up my rosinante in his stall before his unfitness for the road shall expose him faultering to the world but why did not i answer you in time because in truth i am encouraging myself to grow lazy and i was sure you would ascribe the delay to anything sooner than a want of affection or respect to you for this was not among the possible causes in truth if anything could ever induce me to sleep another night out of my own house it would have been your friendly invitation and my sollicitude for the subject of it the education of our youth i do most anxiously wish to see the highest degrees of education given to the higher degrees of genius and to all degrees of it so much as may enable them to read      understand what is going on in the world and to keep their part of it going on right for nothing can keep it right but their own vigilant  distrustful superintendence i do not believe with the rochefoucaults  montaignes that fourteen out of fifteen men are rogues i believe a great abatement from that proportion may be made in favor of general honesty but i have always found that rogues would be uppermost and i do not know that the proportion is too strong for the higher orders and for those who rising above the swinish multitude always contrive to nestle themselves into the places of power  profit these rogues set out with stealing the peoples good opinion and then steal from them the right of withdrawing it by contriving laws and associations against the power of the people themselves our part of the country is in considerable fermentation on what they suspect to be a recent roguery of this kind they say that while all hands were below deck mending sails splicing ropes and every one at his own business  the captain in his cabbin attending to his log book  chart a rogue of a pilot has run them into an enemys port but metaphor apart there is much dissatisfaction with mr jay  his treaty for my part i consider myself now but as a passenger leaving the world  its

his uncles executors for  000 which we must trouble you to remit in some way or other without loss if possible and if it cannot be received without too sensible a loss i think it had better lie observe that the money is not to be remitted to derieux as he has conveyed it to colo gamble  colo bell to satisfy debts i think it had better be sent to colo bell who will pay to gamble his part of it if you receive it it may be a convenience and safety to all parties for you to apply a part of it to answer the little commissions i gave you for froullé  la motte and to order me to pay their amount to colo bell which i will do on sight of your order but name the sum i am to pay in dollars to avoid all questions of depreciation in this case i would be willing to extend my commission to the procuring me some wines from bordeaux to be purchased  shipped for me by mr fenwick to richmond consigned to colo gamble i will note the wines at the foot of my letter when you shall have read the letter to madame bellanger be so good as seal  send it to her—i trouble you also with a letter     to madame de tessé whom i suppose to be in switzerland pray find a safe conveyance and receive for me

that to madame de tessé—nothing has happened in our neighborhood worth communication to you mr randolphs health was at the lowest ebb  he determined to go to the sweet springs where he still is his last letter informs me that his amendment is so great as to give him hopes of an entire recovery—in political matters there is always something new yet at such a distance and with such uncertain conveyances it is best to say little of them it may be necessary however to observe to you that in all countries where parties are strongly marked as the monocrats and republicans here there will always be desertions from the one side to the other and to caution you therefore in your correspondence with dawson  who is now closely connected in speculations as we are told with harry lee with steel become a consummate tory and even innes who has changed backwards and forwards two or three times lately—mr jays treaty has at length been made public so general a burst of dissatisfaction never before appeared against any transaction those who understand the particular articles of it condemn these articles those who do not understand them minutely condemn it generally as wearing a hostile face to france this last is the     must numerous class comprehending the whole body of the people who have taken a greater interest in this transaction than they were ever known to do in any other it has in my opinion completely demolished the monarchial party here the chamber of commerce in new york against the body of the town the merchants in philadelphia against the body of their town also and our town of alexandria have come forward in its support some individual champions also appear marshall carrington harvey bushrod washington doctor stewart a more powerful one is hamilton under the signature of camillus adams holds his tongue with an address above his character we do not know whether the president has signed it or not if he has it is much believed the h of representatives will oppose it as constitutionally void and thus bring on an embarrassing and critical state in our government—if you should receive derieux money and order the wines mr fenwick ought to ship them in the winter months present my affectionate respects to mrs monroe and accept them yourself no signature is necessary  ps the day after writing the preceding letter yours of june        came to hand i open this     therefore to acknowledge the receipt  thank you for the information given soon after that date you will have received mine of may    and perceive by that  this that i had taken the liberty of asking some services from you yes the treaty is now known here by a bold act of duty in one of our senators and what the sentiments upon it are our public papers will tell you for i take for granted they are forwarded to you from the secretary of states office the same post which brought your letter brought also advice of the death of bradford atty genl the resignation of e randolph retiring perhaps from the storm he saw gathering and of the resolutions of the chamber of commerce of boston in opposition to those of the town of boston in general p marks is dead within these    hours his wife had died some months before i omitted in my letter to mention that j rutledge was appointed chief justice in the room of mr jay and that he govr pinckney  others of that southern constellation had pronounced themselves more desperately than any others against the treaty—still deliver the letters to made bellanger a true state of the case soothing and altering terms may perhaps produce the execution of her last promise thomas jefferson sep  0    monticello tench coxe to tench coxe j mss  monticello sep  0    dear sir— i have to acknolege the receipt of your favor of july  0 the sentiments therein expressed on the subject of the treaty coincide   0 perfectly with those of this country which i believe were never more unanimous   or   individuals of richmond distinguished however by their talents as by their devotion to all the sacred acts of the government  the town of alexandria constitute the whole support of that instrument here camillus may according to his custom write an encyclopedia on the subject but it is too obstinate to be twisted by all his sophisms into a tolerable shape having interdicted to myself the reading of newspapers  thinking or saying anything on public matters beyond what the conversation of my neighbors draws me into i leave such delights to those who more rational than myself prefer them to their tranquility  to those whose stations keep them in that vortex  make them better judges of what is passing around them my situation putting it out of my power to find good conveyances for my foreign letters in these times of obstruction by sea  by land i avail myself of your friendship to get them on  now take the liberty of enclosing some our foreign ministers being entitled to charge their postages  the risque of separating the  d letter dispenses with apology on the subject of postage that to van staphorst covers bills of exchange the property of mr mazzei which i am remitting as it is collected thomas jefferson sep         monticello henry tazewell to henry tazewell j mss  monticello sep         dear sir— i ought much sooner to have acknoleged your obliging attention in sending me a copy of     the treaty it was the first we received in this part of the country tho i have interdicted myself all serious attention to political matters yet a very slight notice of that in question sufficed to decide my mind against it i am not satisfied we should not be better without treaties with any nation but i am satisfied we should be better without such as this the public dissatisfaction too  dissension it is likely to produce are serious evils i am not without hopes that the operations on the   th article may render a recurrence to the senate yet necessary and so give to the majority an opportunity of correcting the error into which their exclusion of public light has led them i hope also that the recent results of the english will at length awaken in our executive that sense of public honor  spirit which they have not lost sight of in their proceedings with other nations and will establish the eternal truth that acquiescence under insult is not the way to escape war i am with great esteem dear sir your most obedient humble servant thomas jefferson sep         monticello james madison to james madison mad mss  monticello sep         i received about three weeks ago a box containing   doz volumes of     pages    mo with a letter from lambert beckleys clerk that they came from mr beckley  were to be divided between yourself j walker  myself i have sent   doz to j walker and shall be glad of a conveyance for yours in the meantime i send you by post the title page table of     contents and one of the pieces curtius  lest it should not have come to you otherwise it is evidently written by hamilton giving a first  general view of the subject that the public mind might be kept a little in check till he could resume the subject more at large from the beginning under his second signature of camillus the piece called the features of the treaty i do not send because you have seen it in the newspapers it is said to be written by coxe but i should rather suspect by beckley the antidote is certainly not strong enough for the poison of curtius if i had not been informed the present came from beckley i should have suspected it from jay or hamilton i gave a copy or two by way of experiment to honest soundhearted men of common understanding and they were not able to parry the sophistry of curtius i have ceased therefore to give them hamilton is really a colossus to the antirepublican party without numbers he is an host within himself they have got themselves into a defile where they might be finished but too much security on the republican part will give time to his talents  indefatigableness to extricate them we have had only middling performances to oppose to him in truth when he comes forward there is nobody but yourself who can meet him his adversaries having begun the attack he has the advantage of answering them  remains unanswered himself a solid reply might yet completely demolish what was too feebly attacked and has     gathered strength from the weakness of the attack the merchants were certainly except those of them who are english as open mouthed at first against the treaty as any but the general expression of indignation has alarmed them for the strength of the government they have feared the shock would be too great and have chosen to tack about  support both treaty  government rather than risk the government thus it is that hamilton jay c in the boldest act they ever ventured on to undermine the government have the address to screen themselves  direct the hue  cry against those who wish to drag them into light a bolder partystroke was never struck for it certainly is an attempt of a party which finds they have lost their majority in one branch of the legislature to make a law by the aid of the other branch  of the executive under color of a treaty which shall bind up the hands of the adverse branch from ever restraining the commerce of their patronnation there appears a pause at present in the public sentiment which may be followed by a revulsion this is the effect of the desertion of the merchants of the presidents chiding answer to boston  richmond of the writings of curtius  camillus and of the quietism into which people naturally fall after first sensations are over for gods sake take up your pen and give a fundamental reply to curtius  camillus     thomas jefferson oct         fontainbleau james madison to james madison  fontainbleau oct         dear sir— seven oclock and retired to my fireside i have determined to enter into conversation with you this is a village of about  000 inhabitants when the court is not here   0000 when they are occupying a valley thro which runs a brook and on each side of it a ridge of small mountains most of which are naked rock the king comes here in the fall always to hunt his court attend him as do also the foreign diplomatic corps but as this is not indispensably required  my finances do not admit the expense of a continued residence here i propose to come occasionally to attend the kings levees returning again to paris distant  0 miles this being the first trip i set out yesterday morning to take a view of the place for this purpose i shaped my course towards the highest of the mountains in sight to the top of which was about a league as soon as i had got clear of the town i fell in with a poor woman walking at the same rate with myself  going the same course wishing to know the condition of the laboring poor i entered into conversation with her which i began by enquiries for the path which would lead me into the mountain  thence proceeded to enquiries into her vocation condition  circumstances she told me she was a day labourer at   sous or  d sterling the day that she had two     children to maintain  to pay a rent of  0 livres for her house which would consume the hire of    days that often she could get no emploiment and of course was without bread as we had walked together near a mile  she had so far served me as a guide i gave her on parting    sous she burst into tears of a gratitude which i could perceive was unfeigned because she was unable to utter a word she had probably never before received so great an aid this little attendrissement with the solitude of my walk led me into a train of reflections on that unequal division of property which occasions the numberless instances of wretchedness which i had observed in this country  is to be observed all over europe the property of this country is absolutely concentrated in a very few hands having revenues of from half a million of guineas a year downward these employ the flower of the country as servants some of them having as many as  00 domestics not labouring they employ also a great number of manufacturers  tradesmen  lastly the class of labouring husbandmen but after all there comes the most numerous of all the classes that is the poor who cannot find work i asked myself what could be the reason that so many should be permitted to beg who are willing to work in a country where there is a very considerable proportion of uncultivated lands these lands are undisturbed only for the sake of game it should seem then that it must be because of the enormous wealth of the proprietors which places them above attention to the encrease of their revenues by permitting these lands to be laboured i     am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable but the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind the descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children or to all the brothers  sisters or other relations in equal degree is a politic measure and a practicable one another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point  to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise whenever there is in any country uncultivated lands and unemployed poor it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right the earth is given as a common stock for man to labour  live on if for the encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated we must take care that other employment be provided to those excluded from the appropriation if we do not the fundamental right to labour the earth returns to the unemployed it is too soon yet in our country to say that every man who cannot find employment but who can find uncultivated land shall be at liberty to cultivate it paying a moderate rent but it is not too soon to provide by every possible means that as few as possible shall be without a little portion of land the small land holders are the most precious part of a state        thomas jefferson nov       james madison to james madison j mss  nov       your favor from fredericksburg came safe to hand i enclose you the extract of a letter i received from mr r now in richmond  tho you will have been informed of the fact before this reaches you yet you will see more of the subject by having different views of it presented to you though marshall will be able to embarras the republican party in the assembly a good deal yet upon the whole his having gone into it will be of service he has been hitherto able to do more mischief acting under the mask of republicanism than he will be able to do after throwing it plainly off his lax lounging manners have made him popular with the bulk of the people of richmond  a profound hypocrisy with many thinking men of our country but having come forth in the plenitude of his english principles the latter will     see that it is high time to make him known his doctrine that the whole commercial part of the treaty  he might have added the whole unconstitutional part of it rests in the power of the h of r is certainly the true doctrine  as the articles which stipulate what requires the consent of the three branches of the legislature must be referred to the h of r for their concurrence so they being free agents may approve or reject them either by a vote declaring that or by refusing to pass acts i should think the former mode the most safe  honorable the people in this part of the country continue very firmly disposed against the treaty i imagine the  0 negative votes comprehend the whole force of the alexandrian party  the bigots  passive obedience men of the whole state who have got themselves into the legislature i observe an expression     in randolphs printed secret intimating that the president tho an honest man himself may be circumvented by snares  artifices  is in fact surrounded by men who wish to clothe the executive with more than constitutional powers this when public will make great impression it is not only a truth but a truth levelled to every capacity  will justify to themselves the most zealous votaries for ceasing to repose the unlimited confidence they have done in the measures which have been pursued communicate the enclosed paper if you please to mr giles our autumn is fine the weather mild  intermixed with moderate rains at proper intervals no ice yet  not much frost adieu thomas jefferson nov  0    monticello edward rutledge to edward rutledge  monticello nov  0    my dear sir— i received your favor of oct    by your son who has been kind enough to visit me here and from whose visit i have received all that pleasure which i do from whatever comes from you and especially from a subject so deservedly dear to you he found me in a retirement i doat on living like an antediluvian patriarch among my children  grand children and tilling my soil as he had lately come from philadelphia boston c he was able to give me a great deal of information of what is passing in the world  i pestered him with questions pretty much as our friends lynch nelson c  00 will us when we step across the styx for they will wish to hear what has been passing above ground since they left us you hope i have not abandoned entirely the service of our country after a five  twenty years continual employment in it i trust it will be thought i have fulfilled my tour like a punctual soldier and may claim my discharge but i am glad of the sentiment from you my friend because it gives a hope you will practice what you preach and come forward in aid of the public vessel i will not admit your old excuse that you are in public service tho at home the campaigns which are fought in a mans own house are not to be counted the present situation of the president unable to get the offices filled really calls with uncommon obligation on those whom nature has fitted for them i join with you in thinking the treaty an execrable thing but both negotiators must have understood that as there were articles in it which could not be carried into execution without the aid of the legislatures on both sides that therefore it must be referred to them and that these legislatures being free agents would not give it their support if they disapproved of it i trust the popular branch of our legislature will disapprove of it and thus rid us of this infamous act which is really nothing more than a treaty of alliance between england  the anglomen of this country against the legislature  people of the united states—i told your son i had long had it in contemplation to write to you for half a dozen sour orange trees of a proper size for small boxes as they abound with you the only  0  trouble they would give would be the putting them into boxes long enough before sending them for them to take root  when rooted to put them into some vessel coming direct to richmond to the care of mr daniel hylton there your son is kind enough to undertake the commission with constant  unchanged affections i am my dear friend thomas jefferson dec       monticello william branch giles to william branch giles  monticello dec       dear sir— your favors of dec      0 came to hand by the last post i am well pleased with the manner in which your house has testified their sense of the treaty while their refusal to pass the original clause of the reported answer proved their condemnation of it the contrivance to let it disappear silently respected appearances in favor of the president who errs as other men do but errs with integrity randolph seems to have hit upon the true theory of our constitution that when a treaty is made involving matters confided by the constitution to the three branches of the legislature conjointly the representatives are as free as the president  senate were to consider whether the national interest requires or forbids their giving the forms  force of law to the articles over which they have a power—i thank you much for the pamphlet—his narrative is so straight  plain that even those who did not know him will acquit him of the charge of bribery those who knew  0  him had done it from the first tho he mistakes his own political character in the aggregate yet he gives it to you in the detail thus he supposes himself a man of no party page    that his opinions not containing any systematic adherence to party fall sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other pa    yet he gives you these facts which shew that they fall generally on both sides  are complete inconsistencies—  he never gave an opinion in the cabinet against the rights of the people pa    yet he advised the denunciation of the popular societies      he would not neglect the overtures of a commercial treaty with france    yet he always opposed it while attygeneral and never seems to have proposed it while secretary of state   he concurs in resorting to the militia to quell the pretended insurrection in the west    and proposes an augmentation from    00 to   000 to march against men at their ploughs pa  0 yet on the  th of aug he is against their marching     0  and on the   th of aug he is for it      he concurs in the measure of a mission extraordinary to london as inferred from pa    but objects to the men to wit hamilton  jay      he was against granting commercial powers to mr jay    yet he besieged the doors of the senate to procure their advice to ratify—  he advises the president to a ratification on the merits of the treaty —  but to a suspension till the provision order is repealed    the fact is that he has generally given his principles to the one party  his practice to the other the oyster to one the shell to the other  0  unfortunately the shell was generally the lot of his friends the french and republicans  the oyster of their antagonists had he been firm to the principles he professes in the year      the president would have been kept from a habitual concert with the british  antirepublican party but at that time i do not know which r feared most a british fleet or french disorganisers whether his conduct is to be ascribed to a superior view of things an adherence to right without regard to party as he pretends or to an anxiety to trim between both those who know his character and capacity will decide were parties here divided merely by a greediness for office as in england to take a part with either would be unworthy of a reasonable or moral man but where the principle of difference is as substantial and as strongly pronounced as between the republicans  the monocrats of our country i hold it as honorable to take a firm  decided part and as immoral to pursue a middle line as between the parties of honest men  rogues into which every country is divided a copy of the pamphlet came by this post to charlottesville i suppose we shall be able to judge soon what kind of impression it is likely to make it has been a great treat to me as it is a continuation of that cabinet history with the former part of which i was intimate i remark in the reply of the president a small travestie of the sentiment contained in the answer of the representatives they acknowlege that he has contributed a great share to the national happiness by his services he thanks them for ascribing to his agency a great share of those benefits  0  the former keeps in view the cooperation of others towards the public good the latter presents to view his sole agency at a time when there would have been less anxiety to publish to the people a strong approbation from your house this strengthening of your expression would not have been noticed our attentions have been so absorbed by the first manifestations of the sentiments of your house that we have lost sight of our own legislature insomuch that i do not know whether they are sitting or not the rejection of mr rutledge by the senate is a bold thing because they cannot pretend any objection to him but his disapprobation of the treaty it is of course a declaration that they will receive none but tories hereafter into any department of the government i should not wonder if monroe were to be recalled under the idea of his being of the partisans of france whom the president considers as the partisans of war  confusion in his letter of july    and as disposed to excite them to hostile measures or at least to unfriendly sentiments a most infatuated blindness to the true character of the sentiments entertained in favor of france the bottom of my page warns me that it is time to end my commentaries on the facts you have furnished me you would of course however wish to know the sensations here on those facts my friendly respects to mrs madison to whom the next weeks dose will be directed adieu affectionately  0  thomas jefferson notes on prof ebelings letter of july  0     professor ebeling mentioning the persons in america from whom he derives information for his work it may be useful for him to know how far he may rely on their authority president stiles an excellent man of very great learning but remarkable for his credulity dr willard  all these are men of respectable characters worthy of confidence as to any facts they may state and rendered by their good sense good judges of them dr barton  dr ramsay  mr barlow  mr morse  good authorities for whatever relates to the eastern states  perhaps as far south as the delaware mr webster  but south of that their information is worse than none at all except as far as they quote good authorities they both i believe took a single journey through the southern parts merely to acquire the right of being considered as eyewitnesses but to pass once along a public road thro a country  in one direction only to put up at its taverns and get into conversation with the idle drunken individuals who pass their time lounging in these taverns is not the way to know a country its inhabitants or manners to generalize a whole nation from these specimens is not the sort of information which professor ebeling would wish to compose his work from  0  fennos gazette of the u s  to form a just judgment of a country from its newspapers the character of these papers should be known in order that proper allowances  corrections may be used this will require a long explanation without which these particular papers would give a foreigner a very false view of american affairs websters minerva  columbian centinel  the people of america before the revolutionwar being attached to england had taken up without examination the english ideas of the superiority of their constitution over every thing of the kind which ever had been or ever would be tried the revolution forced them to consider the subject for themselves and the result was an universal conversion to republicanism those who did not come over to this opinion either left us  were called refugees or staid with us under the name of tories  some preferring profit to principle took side with us and floated with the general tide our first federal constitution or confederation as it was called was framed in the first moments of our separation from england in the highest point of our jealousies of independance as to her  as to each other it formed therefore too weak a bond to produce an union of action as to foreign nations this appeared at once on the establishment of peace when the pressure of a common enemy which had hooped us together during the war was taken away congress was found to be quite unable to point the action of the several states to a common object a general desire therefore took place of amending the federal constitution  0  this was opposed by some of those who wished for monarchy to wit the refugees now returned the old tories  the timid whigs who prefer tranquility to freedom hoping monarchy might be the remedy if a state of complete anarchy could be brought on a convention however being decided on some of the monocrats got elected with a hope of introducing an english constitution when they found that the great body of the delegates were strongly for adhering to republicanism  for giving due strength to their government under that form they then directed their efforts to the assimilation of all the parts of the new government to the english constitution as nearly as was attainable in this they were not altogether without success insomuch that the monarchical features of the new constitution produced a violent opposition to it from the most zealous republicans in the several states for this reason  because they also thought it carried the principle of a consolidation of the states farther than was requisite for the purpose of producing an union of action as to foreign powers it is still doubted by some whether a majority of the people of the u s were not against adopting it however it was carried through all the assemblies of the states tho by very small majorities in the largest states the inconveniences of an inefficient government driving the people as is usual into the opposite extreme the elections to the first congress run very much in favor of those who were known to favor a very strong government hence the antirepublicans appeared a considerable majority in both houses of  0  congress they pressed forward the plan therefore of strengthening all the features of the government which gave it resemblance to an english constitution of adopting the english forms  principles of administration and of forming like them a monied interest by means of a funding system not calculated to pay the public debt but to render it perpetual and to make it an engine in the hands of the executive branch of the government which added to the great patronage it possessed in the disposal of public offices might enable it to assume by degrees a kingly authority the biennial period of congress being too short to betray to the people spread over this great continent this train of things during the first congress little change was made in the members to the second but in the mean time two very distinct parties had formed in congress and before the third election the people in general became apprised of the game which was playing for drawing over them a kind of government which they never had in contemplation at the  d election therefore a decided majority of republicans were sent to the lower house of congress and as information spread still farther among the people after the  th election the antirepublicans have become a weak minority but the members of the senate being changed but once in   years the completion of that body will be much slower in its assimilation to that of the people this will account for the differences which may appear in the proceedings  spirit of the two houses still however it is inevitable that the senate will at length be formed to the republican  0  model of the people  the two houses of the legislature once brought to act on the true principles of the constitution backed by the people will be able to defeat the plan of sliding us into monarchy  to keep the executive within republican bounds notwithstanding the immense patronage it possesses in the disposal of public offices notwithstanding it has been able to draw into this vortex the judiciary branch of the government  by their expectancy of sharing the other offices in the executive gift to make them auxiliary to the executive in all its views instead of forming a balance between that  the legislature as it was originally intended and notwithstanding the funding phalanx which a respect for public faith must protect tho it was engaged by false brethren two parties then do exist within the u s they embrace respectively the following descriptions of persons the antirepublicans consist of   the old refugees  tories   british merchants residing among us  composing the main body of our merchants   american merchants trading on british capital another great portion   speculators  holders in the banks  public funds   officers of the federal government with some exceptions   officehunters willing to give up principles for places a numerous  noisy tribe   nervous persons whose languid fibres have more analogy with a passive than active state of things   0 the republican part of our union comprehends   the entire body of landholders throughout the united states   the body of labourers not being landholders whether in husbanding or the arts the latter is to the aggregate of the former party probably as  00 to one but their wealth is not as disproportionate tho it is also greatly superior and is in truth the foundation of that of their antagonists trifling as are the numbers of the antirepublican party there are circumstances which give them an appearance of strength  numbers they all live in cities together  can act in a body readily  at all times they give chief employment to the newspapers  therefore have most of them under their command the agricultural interest is dispersed over a great extent of country have little means of intercommunication with each other and feeling their own strength  will are conscious that a single exertion of these will at any time crush the machinations against their government as in the commerce of human life there are commodities adapted to every demand so there are newspapers adapted to the antirepublican palate and others to the republican of the former class are the columbian centinel the hartford

materials were worthy of confidence except so far as they were taken from the abbé raynal against these effusions of an imagination in delirio it is presumed professor ebeling needs not be put on his guard the earlier editions of the abbé raynals work were equally bad as to both south  north america a gentleman however of perfect information as to south america undertook to reform that part of the work and his changes  additions were for the most part adopted by the abbé in his latter editions but the northamerican part remains in its original state of worthlessness     thomas jefferson jan      monticello archibald stuart to archibald stuart  monticello jan      dear sir— i troubled you once before on the subject of my nails and must trouble you once more but hope my present plan will protect you from all further embarrasment with it i set out with refusing to retail expecting the merchants of my neighborhood and the upper country would have given a preference to my supplies because delivered here at the richmond wholesale prices and at hand to be called for in small parcels so that they need not to keep large sums invested in that article  lying dead on their hands the importing merchants however decline taking them from a principle of suppressing every effort towards domestic manufacture  the merchants who purchase here being much under the influence of the importers take their nails from them with their other goods i have determined therefore to establish deposits of my nails to be retailed at milton charlottesville staunton wormester  warren but first at the three first places because i presume my present works which turn out a ton a month will fully furnish them and two additional fires which will be at work in a short time will raise it to a ton and a half a month and enable me to extend my supplies to wormester  warren i shall retail at richmond wholesale prices laying on   percent at milton  charlottesville for commission to the retailers and  0 percent at the other places     for commission  transportation my present retailing prices at staunton would be sixes   ½d per lb equal to   ½ per m eights   d per lb equal to  0 tens   ½d per lb equal to    ½ twelves   d per lb equal to     sixteens  0½d per lb equal to     twenties  0d per lb equal to  0 0 it is tolerably certain that the moment my deposit opens there will be an entire stoppage to the sale of all imported nails for a body can retail them in the upper country at the richmond wholesale prices advanced only   or  0 percent and as i mean to employ only one person in each place to retail it will be of some advantage to the merchant who will undertake it to have the entire monopoly of the nail business  so draw to his store every one who wants nails besides the commission of   percent which in an article to be sold for ready money only and where he does not employ a farthing of his own capital i am advised is a sufficient allowance for commission i should expect them to send me a copy of their sales once a month and to hold the proceeds ready for my draughts at stated periods say monthly i trouble you to engage some person whom you can recommend for punctuality to retail for me i heard very favorable accounts of a mr stuart mercht of staunton  should not hesitate to prefer him if he will undertake it if not pray do me the favor to find some other i have written you the details not that     you need trouble yourself with explaining them to any person but that you may put this letter into his hands as soon as you will name to me the person you engage i will send him an assortment of nails by the first waggons which will take them in—will you be so good as to procure for me a good bearskin dressed with a soft skin  the hair on dr johnson will on your application be so good as to pay for it and take credit on his account with me my respectful salutations to mrs stuart and assurances of attachment to yourself from yours affectionately thomas jefferson january         monticello george wythe to george wythe j mss  monticello january         in my letter which accompanied the box containing my collection of printed laws i promised to send you by post a statement of the contents of the box on taking up the subject i found it better to take a more general view of the whole of the laws i possess as well manuscript as printed as also of those which i do not possess and suppose to be no longer extant this general view you will have in the enclosed paper whereof the articles stated to be printed constitute the contents of the box i sent you those in ms were not sent because not supposed to have been within your view and because some of them will not bear removal being so rotten that in turning over a leaf it sometimes falls into powder these i preserve by wrapping  sewing them up in oiled cloth so that neither air nor moisture can have access to     them very early in the course of my researches into the laws of virginia i observed that many of them were already lost and many more on the point of being lost as existing only in single copies in the hands of careful or curious individuals on whose death they would probably be used for waste paper i set myself therefore to work to collect all which were then existing in order that when the day should come in which the public should advert to the magnitude of their loss in these precious monuments of our property and our history a part of their regret might be spared by information that a portion has been saved from the wreck which is worthy of their attention  preservation in searching after these remains i spared neither time trouble nor expense and am of opinion that scarcely any law escaped me which was in being as late as the year      in the middle or southern parts of the state in the northern parts perhaps something might still be found in the clerks office in the antient counties some of these ms copies of the laws may possibly still exist which used to be furnished at the public expense to every county before the use of the press was introduced and in the same places and in the hands of antient magistrates or of their families some of the fugitive sheets of the laws of separate sessions which have been usually distributed since the practice commenced of printing them but recurring to what we actually possess the question is what means will be the most effectual for preserving these remains from future loss all the care i can take of them will not preserve them from the worm from the     natural decay of the paper from the accidents of fire or those of removal when it is necessary for any public purposes as in the case of those now sent you our experience has proved to us that a single copy or a few deposited in ms in the public offices cannot be relied on for any great length of time the ravages of fire and of ferocious enemies have had but too much part in producing the very loss we are now deploring how many of the precious works of antiquity were lost while they were preserved only in manuscript has there ever been one lost since the art of printing has rendered it practicable to multiply  disperse copies this leads us then to the only means of preserving those remains of our laws now under consideration that is a multiplication of printed copies i think therefore that there should be printed at public expense an edition of all the laws ever passed by our legislatures which can now be found that a copy should be deposited in every public library in america in the principle public offices within the state and some perhaps in the most distinguished public libraries of europe and that the rest should be sold to individuals towards reimbursing the expences of the edition nor do i think that this would be a voluminous work the mss would probably furnish matter for one printed volume in folio would comprehend all the laws from      to   0  which period includes purvis my collection of fugitive sheets forms as we know two volumes and comprehends all the extant laws from      to      and the laws which can be gleaned up from the revisals to supply     the chasm between   0        with those from      to the close of the present century by which term the work might be compleated would not be more than the matter of another volume so that four volumes in folio would give every law ever passed which is now extant whereas those who wish to posses as many of them as can be procured must now buy the six folio volumes of revisals to wit purvis  those of                           and in all of them possess not one half of what they wish what would be the expence of the edition i cannot say nor how much would be reimbursed by the sales but i am sure it would be moderate compared with the rates which the public have hitherto paid for printing their laws provided a sufficient latitude be given as to printers  places the first step would be to make out a single copy for the mss which would employ a clerk about a year or something more to which expence about a fourth should be added for the collation of the mss which would employ   persons at a time about half a day or a day in every week as i have already spent more time in making myself acquainted with the contents  arrangement of these mss than any other person probably ever will  their condition does not admit their removal to a distance i will chearfully undertake the direction  superintendence of this work if it can be done in the neighboring towns of charlottesville or milton farther than which i could not undertake to go from home for the residue of the work my printed volumes might be delivered to the printer     i have troubled you with these details because you are in the place where they may be used for the public service if they admit of such use  because the order of assembly which you mention shews they are sensible of the necessity of preserving such of these laws as relate to our landed property and a little further consideration will perhaps convince them that it is better to do the whole work once for all than to be recurring to it by piecemeal as particular parts of it shall be required  that too perhaps when the materials shall be lost you are the best judge of the weight of these observations  of the mode of giving them any effect they may merit adieu affectionately thomas jefferson feb       monticello john adams to john adams j mss  monticello feb       i am to thank you my dear sir for forwarding m divernois book on the french revolution i receive everything with respect which comes from him but it is on politics a subject i never loved  now hate i will not promise therefore to read it thoroughly i fear the oligarchical executive of the french will not do we have always seen a small council get into cabals  quarrels the more bitter  relentless the fewer they are we saw this in our committee of the states  that they were from their bad passions incapable of doing the business of their country i think that for the prompt clear  consistent action so necessary in an executive unity of person is necessary as with us i am aware of the     objection to this that the office becoming more important may bring on serious discord in elections in our country i think it will be long first not within our day  we may safely trust to the wisdom of our successors the remedies of the evil to arise in theirs both experiments however are not fairly committed  the result will be seen never was a finer convass presented to work on than our countrymen all of them engaged in agriculture or the pursuits of honest industry independent in their circumstances enlightened as to their rights  firm in their habits of order  obedience to the laws this i hope will be the age of experiments in government  that their basis will be founded in principles of honesty not of mere force we have seen no instance of this since the days of the roman republic nor do we read of any before that either force or corruption has been the principle of every modern government unless the dutch perhaps be excepted  i am not well enough informed to accept them absolutely if ever the morals of a people could be made the basis of their own government it is our case  who could propose to govern such a people by the corruption of a legislature before he could have one night of quiet sleep must convince himself that the human soul as well as body is mortal i am glad to see that whatever grounds of apprehension may have appeared of a wish to govern us otherwise than on principles of reason  honesty we are getting the better of them i am sure from the honesty of your heart you join me in detestation of the corruptions of the english government  that no man on earth is more incapable   0 than yourself of seeing that copied among us willingly i have been among those who have feared the design to introduce it here  it has been a strong reason with me for wishing there was an ocean of fire between that island and us but away politics i owe a letter to the auditor on the subject of my accounts while a foreign minister  he informs me yours hang on the same difficulties with mine before the present government there was a usage either practised on or understood which regulated our charges this government has directed the future by a law but this is not retrospective  i cannot conceive why the treasury cannot settle accounts under the old congress on the principles that body acted on i shall very shortly write to mr harrison on this subject  if we cannot have it settled otherwise i suppose we must apply to the legislature in this i will act in concert with you if you approve of it present my very affectionate respects to mrs adams  be assured that no one more cordially esteems your virtues than dear sir your sincere friend  servant thomas jefferson mar      james monroe to james monroe mon mss  mar      dear sir— i wrote you two letters in the course of the last twelve months to wit may     sep      and have received from you those of sep       june       neither of which were late enough to inform me if either of mine had got to hand in those i gave you all the details public  private     which my situation enabled me to do in the last i asked the delivery of a note to frouillé for some books particularly the sequel of the encyclopedia come out since he last furnished me i hope these have got to hand the most remarkable political occurrence with us has been the treaty with england of which no man in the u s has had the effrontery to affirm that it was not a very bad one except a h under the signature of camillus its most zealous defenders only pretended that it was better than war as if war was not invited rather than avoided by unfounded demands i have never known the public pulse beat so full and in such universal union on any subject since the declaration of independance the house of representatives of the u s has manifested its disapprobation of the treaty we are yet to learn whether they will exercise their constitutional right of refusing the means which depend on them for carrying it into execution should they be induced to lend their hand to it it will be hard swallowing with their constituents but will be swallowed from the habits of order  obedience to the laws which so much distinguish our countrymen the resignation or rather the removal of r you will have learnt his vindication bears hard on the executive in the opinions of this quarter and tho it clears him in their judgment of the charge of bribery it does not give them high ideas of his wisdom or steadiness the appointment of j rutledge to be c j seems to have been intended merely to establish a precedent against the descent of that office by seniority and to keep five mouths     always gaping for one sugar plumb for it was immediately negatived by the very votes which so implicitly concur with the will of the executive i may consign the appointment of chase to the bench to your own knolege of him  reflections mchenry secty at war charles lee atty genl with pickering  wolcott by their devotion

not till there was a moral certainty that he would not accept it i presume you receive the newspapers  will have seen the amendments to the constitution proposed by the virginia assembly their reception by some of the other assemblies has been such as to call for the sacrifice of all feeling rather than ruffle the harmony so necessary to the common good the finances are said to have been left by the late financier in the utmost derangement and his tools are urging the funding the new debts they have contracted thus posterity is to be left to pay the ordinary expenses of our government

sincere affections to mrs monroe  to yourself adieu thomas jefferson mar      james madison to james madison mad mss  mar      i wrote you feb    since which i have recd yours of the same day indeed mine of that date related only to a single article in yours of jan     feb   i do not at all wonder at the condition in which the finances of the u s are found hams object from the beginning was to throw them into forms which should be utterly undecypherable i ever said he     did not understand their condition himself nor was able to give a clear view of the excess of our debts beyond our credits nor whether we were diminishing or increasing the debt my own opinion was that from the commencemt of this government to the time i ceased to attend to the subject we had been increasing our debt about a million of d annually if mr gallatin would undertake to reduce this chaos to order present us with a clear view of our finances  put them into a form as simple as they will admit he will merit immortal honor the accounts of the u s ought to be and may be made as simple as those of a common farmer and capable of being understood by common farmers disapproving as i do of the unjustifiable largess to the daurs of the c de grasse i will certainly not propose to rivet it by a second example on behalf of m de chastelluxs son it will only be done in the event of such a repetition of the precedent as will give every one a right to share in the plunder it is indeed surprising you have not yet received the british treaty in form i presume you would never receive it were not your cooperation on it necessary but this will oblige the formal notification of it to you i thank you for your information respecting lownes there is one article still necessary to be known from mr howell lownes began with credit of  0 days from the time of the departure of the nailrod from philadelphia not his delivery of it to the vessel for that makes a difference sometimes of many weeks but he afterwards reduced it to  0 days what would be mr howells credits i know that credit     in virginia startle a merchant in philadelphia but i presume that mr howell could have confidence enough in me tho not personally known to him to make a trial  govern himself afterwards according to the result  to the punctuality with which he would receive his remittances i wish to know this tho i am not yet decided to drop lownes on account of his being a good man  i like much to be in the hands of good men there is great pleasure in unlimited confidence my consumption has now advanced from   to   tons a quarter i call for a quarters supply at once so that the last quarters supply is always paid for before the next is called for or at the very time—the spanish treaty will have some disagreeable features seeds of chicanery  eternal broils instead of peace  friendship at a period not long before that they had been ready to sign one giving us vastly more than we had ever contemplated particularly in our intercourse with their w indies—i by no means think of declining the work we have spoken of on the contrary i wish with ardor to begin it since the change of form into which i propose to put it the first ideas had always oppressed me from a consciousness of my want both of talents  materials to execute it but it will be impossible for a year to come and i am not certain whether even after the present year i shall not be obliged to put my farms under such direction as that i should be considered as not here as to them while i should be here as to my papers my salutations to mrs madison friendly esteem to mr giles page c     p s have you considered all the consequences of your proposition respecting post roads i view it as a source of boundless patronage to the executive jobbing to members of congress  their friends and a bottomless abyss of public money you will begin by only appropriating the surplus of the post office revenues but the other revenues will soon be called into their aid and it will be a scene of eternal scramble among the members who can get the most money wasted in their state and they will always get most who are meanest we have thought hitherto that the roads of a state could not be so well administered even by the state legislature as by the magistracy of the county on the spot what will it be when a member of n h is to mark out a road for georgia does the power to establish post roads given you by congress mean that you shall make the roads or only select from those already made those on which there shall be a post if the term be equivocal  i really do not think it so which is the safest construction that which permits a majority of congress to go to cutting down mountains  bridging of rivers or the other which if too restricted may refer it to the states for amendment securing still due measure  proportion among us and providing some means of information to the members of congress tantamount to that ocular inspection which even in our county determinations the magistrate finds cannot be supplied by any other evidence the fortification of harbors were liable to great objection but national circumstances furnished some color in this case there is none the     roads of america are the best in the world except those of france  england but does the state of our population the extent of our internal commerce the want of sea  river navigation call for such expense on roads here or are our means adequate to it think of all this and a great deal more which your good judgment will suggest and pardon my freedom thomas jefferson mar       monticello william b giles to william b giles j mss  monticello mar       i know not when i have received greater satisfaction than on reading the speech of dr lieb in the pennsylvania assembly he calls himself a new member i congratulate honest republicanism on such an acquisition and promise myself much from a career which begins on such elevated ground we are in suspense here to see the fate and effect of mr pitts bill against democratic societies i wish extremely to get at the true history of this effort to suppress freedom of meeting speaking writing and printing your acquaintance with sedgwick will enable you to do it pray get from him the outlines of the bill he intended to have brought in for this purpose this will enable us to judge whether we have the merit of the invention whether we were really beforehand with the british minister on this subject whether he took his hint from our proposition or whether the concurrence in the sentiment is merely the result of the general truth that great men will think alike and act alike tho without intercommunication     i am serious in desiring extremely the outlines of the bill intended for us from the debates on the subject of our seamen i am afraid as much harm as good will be done by our endeavours to arm our seamen against impressments it is proposed i observe to register them  give them certificates of citizenship to protect them from foreign impressment but these certificates will be lost in a thousand ways a sailor will neglect to take his certificate he is wet twenty times in a voyage if he goes ashore without it he is impressed if with it he gets drunk it is lost stolen from him taken from him and then the want of it gives authority to impress which does not exist now after ten years attention to the subject i have never been able to devise anything effectual but that the circumstance of an american bottom be made ipso facto a protection for a number of seamen porportioned to her tonnage to oblige american captains when called on by foreign officers to parade the men on deck which would show whether they exceeded their own quota and allow the foreign officers to send   or   persons aboard and hunt for any suspected to be concealed this mr pinckney was instructed to insist upon with great britain to accept of nothing short of it and most especially not to agree that a certificate of citizenship should be requirable from our seamen because it would be made a ground for the authorized impressment of them i am still satisfied that such a protection will place them in a worse situation than they are at present it is true the british minister has not shown any disposition to accede to my proposition but it was not     totally rejected and if he still refuses lay a duty of   d sterling a yard on british oznabrigs to make a fund for paying the expenses of the agents you are obliged to employ to seek out our suffering seamen i congratulate you

laid before congress all america is a tiptoe to see what the h of representatives will decide on it we conceive the constitutional doctrine to be that tho the p  senate have the general power of making treaties yet whenever they include in a treaty matters confided by the constitution to the three branches of legislature an act of legislation will be requisite to confirm these articles and that the h of repr as one branch of the legislature are perfectly free to pass the act or to refuse it governing themselves by their own judgment whether it is for the good of their constituents to let the treaty go into effect or not on the precedent now to be set will depend the future construction of our constitution and whether the powers of legislation shall be transferred from the p senate

only rational commentary on the part of the constitution to which it relates not that there may not be objections and difficult ones to it and which i shall be glad to see his answers to but if they are never answered they are more easily to be gulped down than those which lie to the doctrines of his opponents which do in fact annihilate the whole of the powers given by the constitution to the legislature according to the rule established by usage  common sense of construing one part of the instrument by another the objects on which the p  s may exclusively act by treaty are much reduced but the field on which they may act with the sanction of the legislature is large enough and i see no harm in rendering their sanction necessary and not much harm in annihilating the whole treatymaking power except as to making peace if you decide in favor of your right to refuse cooperation in any case of treaty i should wonder on what occasion it is to be used if not on one where the rights the interest the honor  faith of our nation are so grossly sacrificed where a faction has entered into a conspiracy with the enemies of their country to chain down the legislature at the feet of both where the whole mass of your constituents have condemned this work in the most unequivocal manner and are looking to you as their last hope to save them from the effects of the avarice  corruption of the first agent the revolutionary machinations of others and the incomprehensible acquiescence of the only honest man who has assented to it i wish that his honesty and his political

      dear sir— yours of the  th came to hand the day before yesterday i have turned to the conventional history and enclose you an exact copy of what is there on the subject you mentioned i have also turned to my own papers  send you some things extracted from them which shew that the recollection of the p has not been accurate when he supposed his own opinion to have been uniformly that declared in his answer of mar  0 the records of the senate will vouch for this    extract verbatim from last page but one  the last page mr king suggested that the journals of the convention should be either destroyed or deposited in the custody of the president he thought if suffered to be made public a bad use would be made of them by those who would wish to prevent the adoption of the constitution mr wilson preferred the  d expedient he had     at one time liked the first best but as false suggestions may be propagated it should not be made impossible to contradict them a question was then put on depositing the journals  other papers of the convention in the hands of the president on which n h ay m ay ct ay n j ay penna ay del ay md no virga ay n c ay s c ay georgia ay this negative of maryland was occasioned by the language of the instructions to the deputies of that state which required them to report to the state the proceedings of the convention the president having asked what the convention meant should be done with the journals c whether copies were to be allowed to the members if applied for it was resolved nem con that he retain the journals  other papers subject to the order of the congress if ever formed under the constitution the members then proceeded to sign the instrument c in the senate feb        the commee to whom was referred that part of the speech of the prt of the u s at the opening of the session which relates to the commerce of the mediterranean  also the letter from the secy of state dated  0 jan      with the papers accompanying the same reported whereupon resolved that the senate do advise  consent that the pr of the u s take such measures as he may think necessary for the redemption of the citizens of the u s now in captivity at algiers provided the     expense shall not exceed  0000 dolls  also that measures be taken to confirm the treaty now existing between the u s and the emperor of morocco the above is a copy of a resoln of senate referred to me by the pt to prepare an answer to and i find immediately following this among my papers a press copy from an original written fairly in my own hand ready for the ps signature  to be given in to the senate the following answer gent of the senate— i will proceed to take measures for the ransom of our citizens in captivity at algiers in conformity with your resoln of advice of the  st inst so soon as the moneys necessary shall be appropriated by the legislature  shall be in readiness the recognition of our treaty with the new emperor of morocco requires also previous appropriation  provision the importance of this last to the liberty  property of our citizens induces me to urge it on your earliest attention tho i have no memm of the delivery of this to the senate yet i have not the least doubt it was given in to them  will be found among their records i find among my press copies the following in my hand writing the committee to report that the president does not think that circumstances will justify in the present instance his entering into absolute engagements     for the ransom of our captives in algiers nor calling for money from the treasury nor raising it by loan without previous authority from both branches of the legislature apr        i do not recollect the occasion of the above paper with certainty but i think there was a comme appointed by the senate to confer with the p on the subject of the ransom and to advise what is there declined and that a member of the commee advising privately with me as to the report they were to make to the house i minuted down the above as the substance of what i conceived to be the proper report after what had passed with the prt and gave the original to the member preserving the press copy i think the member was either mr izard or mr butler and have no doubt such a report will be found on the files of the senate on the  th of may following in consequence of questions proposed by the prt to the senate they came to a resolution on which a mission was founded    thomas jefferson apr         monticello phillip mazzei to phillip mazzei j mss  monticello apr         my dear friend— your letter of

been protested i immediately write to the drawers to secure the money if still unpaid i wonder i have never had a letter from our friends of amsterdam on that subject as well as acknoleging the subsequent remittances of these i have apprised you by triplicates but for fear of miscarriage will just mention that on sep   i forwarded them hodgdens bill on robinson saunderson  rumney of whitehaven for £ 00 and jan    that of the same on the same for £       both received from mr blair for your stock sold out i have now the pleasure to inform you that dohrman has settled his account with you has allowed the new york damage of  0 per cent for the protest  the new york interest of   per cent and after deducting the partial payments for which he held receipts the balance was three thousand  eightyseven dollars which sum he has paid into mr madisons hands  as he mr madison is now in philadelphia i have desired him to invest the money in good bills on amsterdam  remit them to the

nations renders theirs an unsafe medium to do business through i hope these remittances will place you at your ease  i will endeavor to execute your wishes as to the settlement of the other small

honorable i expect we may get whatever may be in his hands lomax is under greater difficulties with less means so that i apprehend you have little more to expect from this country except the balance which will remain for colle after deducting the little matter due to me  what will be recovered by anthony this will be decided this summer i have written to you by triplicates with every remittance i sent to the v s  h  always recapitulated in each letter the objects of the preceding ones i enclosed in two of them some seeds of the squash as you desired send me in return some seeds of the winter

vetch can be had pray fail not in this i have it greatly at heart      the aspect of our politics has wonderfully changed since you left us in place of that noble love of liberty  republican government which carried us triumphantly thro the war an anglican monarchical  aristocratical party has sprung up whose     avowed object is to draw over us the substance as they have already done the forms of the british government the main body of our citizens however remain true to their republican principles the whole landed interest is republican and so is a great   0 mass of talents against us are the executive the judiciary two out of three branches of the legislature all the officers of the government all who want to be officers all timid men who prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty british merchants  americans trading on british capitals speculators  holders in the banks  public funds a contrivance invented for the purposes of corruption  for assimilating us in all things to the rotten as well as the sound parts of the british model it would give you a fever were i to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies men who were samsons in the field  solomons in the council but who have had their heads shorn by the     harlot england in short we are likely to preserve the liberty we have obtained only by unremitting labors  perils but we shall preserve them and our mass of weight  wealth on the good side is so great as to leave no danger that force will ever be attempted against us we have only to awake and snap the lilliputian cords with which they have been entangling us during the first sleep which succeeded our labors i will forward the testimonial of the death of mrs mazzei which i can do the more

its contents by fire occasions the present letter to cover one from him to his aunt i send it open for your perusal be so good as to seal  send it i hope she will if she has not done it already send him some relief i received only   weeks ago your favor of nov    it has been   months on its way to me the reason for engaging laborers to prepare for your buildings was then over they are to be got only about the new years day to this is added that the plan you promised to send me is not come it is perhaps not unfortunate that nothing was begun this year corn     to  0 a barrel would have rendered building this year extremely dear it does so to me who had engaged in it before that circumstance was foreseen if your plan arrives i will consult with mr jones and according to the result of our consultation make preparations in the winter for the next years work congress has risen you will have seen by their proceedings the truth of what i always observed to you that one man outweighs them all in influence     over the people who have supported his judgment against their own  that of their representatives republicanism must lie on its oars resign the vessel to its pilot and themselves to the course he thinks best for them—i had always conjectured from such facts as i could get hold of that our public debt was increasing about a million of dollars a year you will see by gallatins speeches that the thing is proved you will see further that we are compleatly saddled  bridled  that the bank is so firmly mounted on us that we must go where they will guide they openly publish a resolution that the national property being increased in value they must by an increase of circulating medium furnish an adequate representation of it and by further additions of active capital promote the enterprises of our merchants it is supposed that the paper in circulation in and around philadelphia amounts to  0 millions of doll and that in the whole union to  00 millions i think the last too high all the imported commodities are raised about  0 per cent by the depreciation of the money tobo shares the rise because it has no competition abroad wheat has been extravagantly high from other causes when these cease it must fall to its antient nominal price notwithstanding the depreciation of that because it must contend at market with foreign wheats lands have risen within the notice of the papers and as far out as that can influence they are not risen at all here on the contrary they are lower than they were  0 years ago those i had mentioned to you to wit carters  colle were sold before your     letter came colle  two dollars the acre carters had been offered me for two french crowns     mechanics here get from a dollar to a dollar  a half a day yet are much worse of than at old prices—volney is with me at present he is on his way to the illinois some late appointments judiciary  diplomatic you will have heard and stared at the death of r jouett is the only small news in our neighborhood our best affections attend mrs monroe eliza  yourself thomas jefferson june         monticello george washington to george washington j mss  monticello june         dear sir— in baches aurora of the  th inst which came here by the last post a paper appears which having been confided as i presume to but few hands makes it truly wonderful how it should have got there i cannot be satisfied as to my own part till i relieve my mind by declaring and i attest everything sacred  honorable to the declaration that it has got there neither thro me nor the paper confided to me this has never been from under my own lock  key or out of my own hands no mortal ever knew from me that these questions had been proposed perhaps i ought to except one person who possesses all my confidence as he has possessed yours i do not remember indeed that i communicated it even to him but as i was in the habit of unlimited trust  council with him it is possible i may have read it to him no more for     the quire of which it makes a part was never in any hand but my own nor was a word ever copied or taken down from it by any body i take on myself without fear any divulgation on his part we both know him incapable of it from myself then or my paper this publication has never been derived i have formerly mentioned to you that from a very early period of my life i had laid it down as a rule of conduct never to write a word for the public papers from this i have never departed in a single instance  on a late occasion when all the world seemed to be writing besides a rigid adherence to my own rule i can say with truth that not a line for the press was ever communicated to me by any other except a single petition referred for my correction which i did not correct however though the contrary as i have heard was said in a public place by one person through error thro malice by another i learn that this last has thought it worth his while to try to sow tares between you  me by representing me as still engaged in the bustle of politics  in turbulence  intrigue against the government i never believed for a moment that this could make any impression on you or that your knowledge of me would not overweigh the slander of an intriguer dirtily employed in sifting the conversations of my table where alone he could hear of me and seeking to atone for his sins against you by sins against another who had never done him any other injury than that of declining his confidences political conversations i really dislike  therefore avoid where i can without affectation     but when urged by others i have never conceived that having been in public life requires me to belie my sentiments or even to conceal them when i am led by conversation to express them i do it with the same independence here which i have practiced everywhere and which is inseparable from my nature but enough of this miserable tergiversator who ought indeed either to have been of more truth or less trusted by his country  while on the subject of papers permit me to ask one from you you remember the difference of opinion between hamilton  knox on the one part  myself on the other on the subject of firing on the little sarah and that we had exchanged opinions  reasons in writing on your arrival in philadelphia i delivered you a copy of my reasons in the presence of colo hamilton on our withdrawing he told me he had been so much engaged that he had not been able to prepare a copy of his  general knoxs for you and that if i would send you the one he had given me he would replace it in a few days i immediately sent it to you wishing you should see both sides of the subject together i often after applied to both the gentlemen but could never obtain another copy i have often thought of asking this one or a copy of it back from you but have not before written on subjects of this kind to you tho i do not know that it will ever be of the least importance to me yet one loves to possess arms tho they hope never to have occasion for them they possess     my paper in my own handwriting it is just i should possess theirs the only thing amiss is that they should have left me to seek a return of the paper or a copy of it from you i put away this disgusting dish of old fragments  talk to you of my peas  clover as to the latter article i have great encouragement from the friendly nature of our soil i think i have had both the last  present year as good clover from common grounds which had brought several crops of wheat  corn without ever having been manured as i ever saw on the lots around philadelphia i verily believe that a yield of    acres sowed on wheat april was twelvemonth has given me a ton to the acre at its first cutting this spring the stalks extended measured  ½ feet long very commonly another field a year older  which yielded as well the last year has sensibly fallen off this year my exhausted fields bring a clover not high enough for hay but i hope to make seed from it such as these however i shall hereafter put into peas in the broadcast proposing that one of my sowings of wheat shall be after two years of clover  the other after   years of peas i am trying the white boiling pea of europe the albany pea this year till i can get the hog pea of england which is the most productive of all but the true winter vetch is what we want extremely i have tried this year the caroline drill it is absolutely perfect nothing can be more simple nor perform its office more perfectly for a single row i shall try to make one to sow four rows at a time of wheat or peas at    inches distance i have one of     the scotch threshing machines nearly finished it is copied exactly from a model mr pinckney sent me only that i have put the whole works except the horse wheel into a single frame movable from one field to another on the two axles of a wagon it will be ready in time for the harvest which is coming on which will give it a full trial our wheat and rye are generally fine and the prices talked of bid fair to indemnify us for the poor crops of the two last years i take the liberty of putting under your cover a letter to the son of the m de la fayette not exactly knowing where to direct to him with very affectionate compliments to mrs washington i have the honor to be with great  sincere esteem  respect dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson july        monticello jonathan williams to jonathan williams j mss  monticello july        dear sir— i take shame to myself for having so long left unanswered your valuable favor on the subject of the mountains but in truth i am become lazy to everything except agriculture the preparations for harvest and the length of the harvest itself which is not yet finished would have excused the delay however at all times  under all dispositions i examined with great satisfaction your barometrical estimate of the heights of our mountains and with the more as they corroborated conjectures on this subject which i had made before my estimates had made them a little higher than yours i speak of the   0 blue ridge measuring with a very nice instrument the angle subtended vertically by the highest mountain of the blue ridge opposite to my own house a distance of about    miles southwestward i made the highest about  000 f as well as i remember for i can no longer find the notes i made you make the south side of the mountain near rockfish gap      f above woods you make the other side of the mountain     f mr thomas lewis decd an accurate man with a good quadrant made the north side of the highest mountain opposite my house something more i think than  000 f but the mountain estimated by him  myself is probably higher than that next rockfish gap i do not remember from what principles i estimated the peaks of otter at  000 f but some late observations of judge tuckers coincided very nearly with my estimate your measures confirm another opinion of mine that the blue ridge on its south side is the highest ridge in our country compared with its base i think your observations on these mountains well worthy of being published and hope you will not scruple to let them be communicated to the world—you wish me to present to the philosophical society the result of my philosophical researches since my retirement but my good sir i have made researches into nothing but what is connected with agriculture in this way i have a little matter to communicate and will do it ere long it is the form of a mouldboard of least resistance i had some years ago conceived the principles of it and i explained them to mr rittenhouse i have since     reduced the thing to practice and have reason to believe the theory fully confirmed i only wish for one of those instruments used in england for measuring the force exerted in the draughts of different ploughs c that i might compare the resistance of my mouldboard with that of others but these instruments are not to be had here in a letter of this date to mr rittenhouse i mention a discovery in animal history very signal indeed of which i shall lay before the society the best account i can as soon as i shall have received some other materials which are collecting for me i have seen with extreme indignation the blasphemies lately vended against the memory of the father of american philosophy but his memory will be preserved and venerated as long as the thunders of heaven shall be heard or feared with good wishes to all of his family and sentiments of great respect  esteem for yourself i am dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson july  0    james monroe to james monroe mon mss  july  0    dear sir— your brother received a letter from you a few days since in which he says you mention having received but two from me since you left us i have not been a very troublesome correspondent to you i acknoledge but have written letters of the following dates to you to wit      mar    apr   —     may    sep  —     june    in this last     i acknoleged the receipt of yours of nov    and mentioned that your plan was not yet come to hand which with the difficulty  expence of getting laborers at this season would prevent beginning your works till the new year i have been in daily expectation of hearing of the arrival of mr short having no news from him since his leaving madrid for paris i am often asked when you will return my answer is when eliza is    years old longer than that you will be too wise to stay till then i presume you will retain a post which the public good requires to be filled by a republican i put under your cover some letters from m de liancourt i wish the present government would permit his return he is an honest man sincerely attached to his country zealous against its enemies and very desirous of being permitted to live retired in the bosom of his family my sincere affection for his connections at rocheguyon and most especially for madame danville would render it a peculiar felicity to me to be any ways instrumental in having him restored to them i have no means however unless you can interpose without giving offence if you can i should be much pleased the campaign of congress is closed tho the anglomen have in the end got their treaty through and so far have triumphed over the cause of republicanism yet it has been to them a dear bought victory it has given the most radical shock to their party which it has ever received and there is no doubt they would be glad to be replaced on the ground they possessed the instant before jays nomination extraordinary they see that     nothing can support them but the colossus of the presidents merits with the people and the moment he retires that his successor if a monocrat will be overborne by the republican sense of his constituents if a republican he will of course give fair play to that sense and lead things into the channel of harmony between the governors  governed in the mean time patience—among your neighbors there is nothing new mr rittenhouse is lately dead governor brook has lost his lady we have had the finest harvest ever known in this part of the country both the quantity  quality of our wheat are extraordinary we got    a bushel for the last crop  hope two thirds of that at least for the present one—most assiduous court is paid to p h he has been offered every thing which they knew he would not accept some impression is thought to be made but we do not believe it is radical if they thought they could count on him they would run him for v p their first object being to produce a schism in this state as it is they will run mr pinckney in which they regard his southern position rather than his principles mr j and his advocate camillus are compleatly treatyfoundered we all join in love to mrs monroe  elvie and accept for yourself assurances of sincere  affectionate friendship adieu thomas jefferson nov  0      monticello colonel john stuart to colonel john stuart j mss  monticello nov  0      dear sir— i have to acknolege the receipt of your last favor together with the bones of the greatclaw     which accompanied it my anxiety to obtain a thigh bone is such that i defer communicating what we have to the philosophical society in the hope of adding that bone to the collection we should then be able to fix the stature of the animal without going into conjecture  calculation as we should possess a whole limb from the haunch bone to the claw inclusive whenever you announce to me that the recovery of a thigh bone is desperate i shall make the communication to the philosophical society i think it happy that this incident will make known to them a person so worthy as yourself to be taken into their body and without whose attention to these extraordinary remains the world might have been deprived of the knowledge of them i cannot however help believing that this animal as well as the mammoth are still existing the annihilation of any species of existence is so unexampled in any parts of the economy of nature which we see that we have a right to conclude as to the parts we do not see that the probabilities against such annihilation are stronger than those for it in hopes of hearing from you as soon as you can form a conclusion satisfactory to yourself that the thigh bone will or will not be recovered i remain with great respect  esteem dear sir your most obedient servant thomas jefferson dec         monticello james madison to james madison mad mss  monticello dec         your favor of the  th came to hand last night the first wish of my heart was that you should have been     proposed for the administration of the government on your declining it i wish any body rather than myself and there is nothing i so anxiously hope as that my name may come out either second or third these would be indifferent to me as the last would leave me at home the whole year  the other twothirds of it i have no expectation that the eastern states will suffer themselves to be so much outwitted as to be made the tools for bringing in p instead of a i presume they will throw away their second vote in this case it begins to appear possible that there may be an equal division where i had supposed the republican vote would have been considerably minor it seems also possible that the representatives may be divided this is a difficulty from which the constitution has provided no issue it is both my duty  inclination therefore to relieve the embarrassment should it happen and in that case i pray you and authorize you fully to solicit on my behalf that mr adams may be preferred he has always been my senior from the commencement of my public life and the expression of the public will being equal this circumstance ought to give him the preference and when so many motives will be operating to induce some of the members to change their vote the addition of my wish may have some effect to preponderate the scale i am really anxious to see the speech it must exhibit a very different picture of our foreign affairs from that presented in the adieu or it will little correspond with my views of them i think they never wore so gloomy an aspect since the year    let those come to the helm who     think they can steer clear of the difficulties i have no confidence in myself for the undertaking we have had the severest weather ever known in november the thermometer was at   ° here  in goochland  i suppose generally it arrested my buildings very suddenly when eight days more would have completed my walls  permitted us to cover in the drought is excessive from the middle of october to the middle of december not rain enough to lay the dust a few days ago there fell a small rain but the succeeding cold has probably prevented it from sprouting the grain sown during the drought present me in friendly terms to messrs giles venable page adieu affectionately p s i enclose a letter for volney because i do not know where to address to him pray send me gallatins view of the finances of the u s and paines lre to the president if within the compass of a conveyance by post thomas jefferson dec         monticello edward rutledge to edward rutledge j mss  monticello dec         my dear sir—    you have seen my name lately tacked to so much of eulogy  of abuse that i dare say you hardly thought it meant your old acquaintance of    in truth i did not know myself under the pens either of my friends or foes it is unfortunate for our peace that unmerited abuse wounds while unmerited praise has not the power to heal these are hard wages for the services of all the active  healthy years of ones life i had retired     after five  twenty years of constant occupation in public affairs and total abandonment of my own i retired much poorer than when i entered the public service and desired nothing but rest  oblivion my name however was again brought forward without concert or expectation on my part on my salvation i declare it i do not as yet know the result as a matter of fact for in my retired canton we have nothing later from philadelphia than of the  d week of this month yet i have never one moment doubted the result i knew it was impossible mr adams should lose a vote north of the delaware and that the free and moral agency of the south would furnish him an abundant supplement on principles of public respect i should not have refused but i protest before my god that i shall from the bottom of my heart rejoice at escaping i know well that no man will ever bring out of that office the reputation which carries him into it the honey moon would be as short in that case as in any other  its moments of extasy would be ransomed by years of torment  hatred i shall highly value indeed the share which i may have had in the late vote as an evidence of the share i hold in the esteem of my countrymen but in this point of view a few votes more or less will be little sensible and in every other the minor will be preferred by me to the major vote i have no ambition to govern men no passion which would lead me to delight to ride in a storm flumina amo sylvasque inglorius my attachment to my home has enabled me to make the calculation with rigor perhaps with partiality to the issue which     keeps me there the newspapers will permit me to plant my corn peas c in hills or drills as i please and my oranges bythebye when you send them while our eastern friend will be struggling with the storm which is gathering over us perhaps be shipwrecked in it this is certainly not a moment to covet the helm i have often doubted whether most to praise or to blame your line of conduct if you had lent to your country the excellent talents you possess on you would have fallen those torrents of abuse which have lately been poured forth on me so far i praise the wisdom which has descried  steered clear of a waterspout ahead but now for the blame there is a debt of service due from every man to his country proportioned to the bounties which nature  fortune have measured to him counters will pay this from the poor of spirit but from you my friend coin was due there is no bankrupt law in heaven by which you may get off with shillings in the pound with rendering to a single state what you owed to the whole confederacy i think it was by the roman law that a father was denied sepulture unless his son would pay his debts happy for you  us that you have a son whom genius  education have qualified to pay yours but as you have been a good father in everything else be so in this also come forward  pay your own debts your friends the mr pinckneys have at length undertaken their tour my joy at this would be complete if you were in gear with them i love to see honest and honorable men at the helm men who will not bend their politics to     their purses nor pursue measures by which they may profit  then profit by their measures au diable les bougres i am at the end of my curse and bottom of my page so god bless you and yours adieu affectionately thomas jefferson dec         monticello john adams to john adams  monticello dec         dear sir— the public  the papers have been much occupied lately in placing us in a point of opposition to each other i trust with confidence that less of it has been felt by ourselves personally in the retired canton where i am i learn little of what is passing pamphlets i see never papers but a few and the fewer the happier our latest intelligence from philadelphia at present is of the   th inst but tho at that date your election to the first magistracy seems not to have been known as a fact yet with me it has never been doubted i knew it impossible you should lose a vote north of the delaware and even if that of pennsylvania should be against you in the mass yet that you would get enough south of that to place your succession out of danger i have never one single moment expected a different issue  tho i know i shall not be believed yet it is not the less true that i have never wished it my neighbors as my compurgators could   0 aver that fact because they see my occupations  my attachment to them indeed it is impossible that you may be cheated of your succession by a trick worthy the subtlety of your archfriend of new york who has been able to make of your real friends tools to defeat their and your just wishes most probably he will be disappointed as to you and my inclinations place me out of his reach i leave to others the sublime delights of riding in the storm better pleased with sound sleep and a warm birth below with the society of neighbors friends  fellowlaborers of the earth than of spies  sycophants no one then will congratulate you with purer disinterestedness than myself the share indeed which i may have had in the late vote i shall still value highly as an evidence of the share i have in the esteem of my fellow citizens but while in this point of view a few votes less would be little sensible the difference in the effect of a few more would be very sensible and oppressive to me i have no ambition to govern men it is a painful and thankless office since the day too on which you signed the treaty of paris our horizon was never so overcast i devoutly wish you may be able to shun for us this war by which our agriculture commerce  credit will be destroyed if you are the glory will be all your own and that your administration may be filled with glory and happiness to yourself and advantage to us is the sincere wish of one who tho in the course of our own voyage thro life various little incidents have happened or been contrived to separate us retains still for you the solid esteem of the moments when we     were working for our independence and sentiments of respect  affectionate attachment      thomas jefferson jan      james madison to james madison mad mss  jan      yours of dec    has come safely the event of the election has never been a matter of doubt in my mind i knew that the eastern states were disciplined in the schools of their town meetings to sacrifice differences of opinion to the great object of operating in phalanx  that the more free  moral agency practiced in the other states would always make up the supplement of their weight indeed the vote comes much nearer an equality than i had expected i know the difficulty of obtaining belief to ones declarations of a disinclination to honors  that it is greatest with those who still remain in the world but no arguments were wanting to reconcile me to a relinquishment of the first office or acquiescence under the second as to the first it was impossible that a more solid unwillingness settled on full calculation could have existed in any mans mind short of the degree of absolute refusal the only view on which i would have gone into it for awhile was to put our vessel on her republican tack before she should be thrown too much to leeward of her true principles as to the second it is the only office in the world about which i am unable to decide in my own mind whether i had rather have it or not have it pride does not enter into the estimate for i think with the romans that the general of today should be a soldier tomorrow if necessary i can particularly have no feelings which would revolt at a secondary position to mr adams i am his junior in life was his junior in congress his junior in the     diplomatic line his junior lately in the civil government before the receipt of your letter i had written the enclosed one to him i had intended it some time but had deferred it from time to time under the discouragement of a despair of making him believe i could be sincere in it the papers by the last post not rendering it necessary to change anything in the letter i enclose it open for your perusal not only that you may possess the actual state of dispositions between us but that if anything should render the delivery of it ineligible in your opinion you may return it to me if mr adams can be induced to administer the government on its true principles  to relinquish his bias to an english constitution it is to be considered whether it would not be on the whole for the public good to come to a good understanding with him as to his future elections he is perhaps the only sure barrier against hamiltons getting in since my last i have received a packet of books  pamphlets the choiceness of which testifies that they come from you the incidents of hamiltons insurrection is a curious work indeed the hero of it exhibits himself in all the attitudes of a dexterous balance master the political progress is a work of value  of a singular complexion the eye of the author seems to be a natural achromatic which divests every object of the glare of colour the preceding work under the same title had the same merit one is disgusted indeed with the ulcerated state which it presents of the human mind but to cure an ulcer     we must go to its bottom  no writer has ever done this more radically than this one the reflections into which he leads one are not flattering to our species in truth i do not recollect in all the animal kingdom a single species but man which is eternally  systematically engaged in the destruction of its own species what is called civilization seems to have no other effect on him than to teach him to pursue the principle of bellum omnium in omnia on a larger scale  in place of the little contests of tribe against tribe to engage all the quarters of the earth in the same work of destruction when we add to this that as to the other species of animals the lions  tigers are mere lambs compared with man as a destroyer we must conclude that it is in man alone that nature has been able to find a sufficient barrier against the too great multiplication of other animals  of man himself an equilibrating power against the fecundity of generation my situation points my views chiefly to his wars in the physical world yours perhaps exhibit him as equally warring in the moral one we both i believe join in wishing to see him softened adieu      thomas jefferson jan        monticello archibald stuart to archibald stuart  monticello jan        dear sir— in answer to your favor of dec     to the question whether adviseable to address the president on the subject of war against france i shall speak explicitly because i know i may do it safely to you such is the popularity of the president that the people will support him in whatever he will do or will not do without appealing to their own reason or to anything but their feelings toward him his mind has been so long used to unlimited applause that it could not brook contradiction or even advice offered unasked to advise when asked he     is very open i have long thought therefore it was best for the republican interest to soothe him by flattering where they could approve his measures  to be silent where they disapprove that they may not render him desperate as to their affections  entirely indifferent to their wishes in short to lie on their oars while he remains at the helm and let the bark drift as his will and a superintending providence shall direct by his answer to the house of representatives on the subject of the french war  also by private information it seems he is earnest that the war should be avoided  to have the credit of leaving us in full peace i think then it is best to     leave him to his own movements  not to risk the ruffling them by what he might deem an improper interference with the constituted authorities the rather too because we do not hear of any movement in any other quarter concurrent with what you suggest  because it would scarcely reach him before his departure from office as to the president elect there is reason to believe that he mr adams i mean is detached from hamilton  there is a possibility he may swerve from his politics in a greater or less degree should the british faction attempt to urge him to the war by addresses of support with life  fortune as may happen it would then be adviseable to counteract their endeavors by dissuasive addresses at this moment therefore at our distance from the scene of information  influence i should think it most adviseable to be silent till we see what turn the new administration will take at the same time i mix so little with the world that my opinion merits less attention than anybodys else and ought not to be weighed against your own good judgment if therefore i have given it freely it is because you have desired it  not because i think it worth your notice my information from philadelphia confirms the opinion i gave you as to the event of the election mr adams will have a majority of three votes with respect to myself  whether mr pinckney will have a few more or less than him seems uncertain the votes of n h r i and vermont had not come in nor those of georgia  the two western states you shall receive a gong by the first conveyance it is     but fair reciprocity to give me an opportunity of gratifying you sometimes and to prove by accepting this that my repeated intrusions on you have not been too troublesome it is a great satisfaction to know that the object will be acceptable to you with every wish for your happiness i am dear sir your affectionate friend  servt thomas jefferson jan      james madison to james madison mad mss  jan      yours of dec    is safely received i much fear the issue of the present dispositions of france  spain whether it be in war or in the suppression of our commerce it will be very distressing and our commerce seems to be already sufficiently distressed through the wrongs of the belligerent nations and our own follies it was impossible the bank and papermania should not produce great  extensive ruin the president is fortunate to get off just as the bubble is bursting leaving others to hold the bag yet as his departure will mark the moment when the difficulties begin to work you will see that they will be ascribed to the new administration and that he will have his usual good fortune of reaping credit from the good acts of others and leaving to them that of his errors—we apprehend our wheat is almost entirely killed and many people are expecting to put something else in the ground i have so little expectations from mine that as much as i am an enemy to tobacco i shall endeavor to make some for taxes and clothes in the morning of the       d of dec my thermometer was  ° below 0  the   th it was at 0 the last day of dec we had a snow  ½ i deep  the  th of this month one of   i deep which is still on the ground adieu affectionately thomas jefferson jan       monticello james madison to james madison mad mss  monticello jan       dear sir— the usual accidents of the winter ice floods rains have prevented the orange post from coming to charlottesville the last postday so that we have nothing from philadelphia the last week i see however by the richmond papers a probability that the choice of v p has fallen on me i have written the enclosed letter therefore to mr tazewell as a private friend  have left it open for your perusal it will explain its own object  i pray you  mr tazewell to decide in your own discretion how it may best be used for its object so as to avoid the imputation of an indecent forwardness in me i observe doubts are still expressed as to the validity of the vermont election surely in so great a case substance  not form should prevail i cannot suppose that the vermont constitution has been strict in requiring particular forms of expressing the legislative will as far as my disclaimer may have any effect i pray you to declare it on every occasion foreseen or not foreseen by me in favor of the choice of the people substantially expressed  to prevent the phænomenon of a pseudopresident at so early a day adieu yours affectionately   0 thomas jefferson jan         monticello henry tazewell to henry tazewell j mss  monticello jan         dear sir— as far as the public papers are to be credited i may suppose that the choice of vicepresident has fallen on me on this hypothesis i trouble you and only pray if it be wrong that you will consider this letter as not written i believe it belongs to the senate to notify the v p of his election i recollect to have heard that on the first election of president  vice president gentlemen of considerable office were sent to notify the parties chosen but this was the inauguration of our new government  ought not to be drawn into example at the  d election both gentlemen were on the spot and needed no messengers on the present occasion the president will be on the spot so that what is now to be done respects myself alone and considering that the season of notification will always present one difficulty that the distance in the present case adds a second not inconsiderable and may in future happen to be sometimes much more considerable i hope the senate will adopt that method of notification which will always be least troublesome and most certain the channel of the post is certainly the least troublesome is the most rapid  considering also that it may be sent by duplicates  triplicates is unquestionably the most certain inclosed to the postmaster at charlottesville with an order to send it by express no hazard can endanger the notification apprehending that should there be a difference of opinion on this subject in the senate my ideas of selfrespect might     be supposed by some to require something more formal  inconvenient i beg leave to avail myself of your friendship to declare if a different proposition should make it necessary that i consider the channel of the postoffice as the most eligible in every respect  that it is to me the most desirable which i take the liberty of expressing not with a view of encroaching on the respect due to that discretion which the senate have a right to exercise on the occasion but to render them the more free in the exercise of it by taking off whatsoever weight the supposition of a contrary desire in me might have in the mind of any member thomas jefferson jan       james madison to james madison mad mss  jan       yours of the  th came to hand yesterday i was not aware of any necessity of going on to philadelphia immediately yet i had determined to do it as a mark of respect to the public and to do away the doubts which have spread that i should consider the second office as beneath my acceptance the journey indeed for the month of february is a tremendous undertaking for me who have not been seven miles from home since my resettlement i will see you about the rising of congress and presume i need not stay there a week your letters written before the  th of feb will still find me here my letters inform me that mr a speaks of me with great friendship and with satisfaction in the prospect of administering the government in concurrence with     me  i am glad of the first information because tho i saw that our antient friendship was affected by a little leaven produced partly by his constitution partly by the contrivance of others yet i never felt a diminution of confidence in his integrity and retained a solid affection for him his principles of government i knew to be changed but conscientiously changed as to my participating in the administration if by that he meant the executive cabinet both duty  inclination will shut that door to me i cannot have a wish to see the scenes of    revived as to myself  to descend daily into the arena like a gladiator to suffer martyrdom in every conflict as to duty the constitution will know me only as the member of a legislative body and its principle is that of a separation of legislative executive  judiciary functions except in cases specified if this principle be not expressed in direct terms yet it is clearly the spirit of the constitution  it ought to be so commented  acted on by every friend of free government i sincerely deplore the situation of our affairs with     france war with them and consequence alliance with great britain will completely compass the object of the executive council from the commencement of the war between france  england taken up by some of them from that moment by others more latterly i still however hope it will be avoided i do not believe mr a wishes war with france nor do i believe he will truckle to england as servilely as has been done if he assumes this front at once and shews that he means to attend to selfrespect  national dignity with both the nations perhaps the depredations of both on our commerce may be amicably arrested i think we should begin first with those who first begin with us and by an example on them acquire a right to redemand the respect from which the other party has departed—i suppose you are informed of the proceeding commenced by the legislature of maryland to claim the south branch of the potomac as their boundary and thus of albemarle now the central county of the state to make a frontier as it is impossible upon any consistent principles  after such a length of undisturbed possession that they can expect to establish their claim it can be ascribed to no other than an intention to irritate  divide and there can be no doubt from what bow the shaft is shot however let us cultivate pennsylvania  we need not fear the universe the assembly have named me among those who are to manage this controversy but i am so averse to motion  contest and the other members are so fully equal to the business that i cannot undertake to act in it i wish you     were added to them indeed i wish  hope you may consent to be added to our assembly itself there is no post where you can render greater services without going out of your state let but this block stand firm on its basis  pennsylvania do the same our union will be perpetual  our general government kept within the bounds  form of the constitution adieu affectionately thomas jefferson jan       monticello george wythe to george wythe j mss  monticello jan       it seems probable that i will be called on to preside in a legislative chamber it is now so long since i have acted in the legislative line that i am entirely rusty in the parliamentary rules of procedure i know they have been more studied and are better known by you than by any man in america perhaps by any man living i am in hopes that while inquiring into the subject you made notes on it if any such remain in your hands however informal in books or in scraps of paper and you will be so good as to trust me with them for a little while they shall be most faithfully returned if they lie in small compass they might come by post without regard to expense if voluminous mr randolph will be passing through richmond on his way from varina to this place about the  0th of feb and could give them a safe conveyance did the assembly do anything for the preservation by publication of the laws with great affection adieu     thomas jefferson jan         monticello john langdon to john langdon j mss  monticello jan         dear sir— your friendly letter of the  d inst never came to hand till yesterday  i feel myself indebted for the solicitude you therein express for my undertaking the office to which you inform me i am called i know not from what source an idea has spread itself which i have found to be generally spread that i would accept the office of president of the u s but not of vice president when i retired from the office i last held no man in the union less expected than i did ever to have come forward again and whatever has been insinuated to the contrary to no man in the union was the share which my name bore in the late contest more unexpected than it was to me if i had contemplated the thing beforehand  suffered my will to enter into action at all on it it would have been in a direction exactly the reverse of what has been imputed to me but i had no right to a will on the subject much less to controul that of the people of the u s in arranging us according to our capacities least of all could i have any feelings which would revolt at taking a station secondary to mr adams i have been secondary to him in every situation in which we ever acted together in public life for twenty years past a contrary position would have been the novelty  his the right of revolting at it be assured then my dear sir that if i had had a fibre in my composition still looking after public office it would have been gratified precisely by the very call you are pleased to announce to me and no other     but in truth i wish for neither honors nor offices i am happier at home than i can be elsewhere since however i am called out an object of great anxiety to me is that those with whom i am to act shutting their minds to the unfounded abuse of which i have been the subject will view me with the same candor with which i shall certainly act an acquaintance of many long years ensures to me your just support as it does to you the sentiments of sincere respect and attachment with which i am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson jan       monticello doctor john edwards to doctor john edwards j mss  monticello jan       dear sir— i was yesterday gratified with the receipt of your favor of december   th which gave me the first information of your return from europe on the   th of oct i received a letter of july  0 from colo monroe but did not know through what channel it came i should be glad to see the defence of his conduct which you possess tho no paper of that title is necessary for me he was appointed to an office during pleasure merely to get him out of the senate  with an intention to seize the first pretext for exercising the pleasure of recalling him as i shall be at philadelphia the first week in march perhaps i may have an opportunity of seeing the paper there in mr madisons hands i think with you it will be best to publish nothing concerning colo monroe till his return that he may accommodate the complexion of his publication to times  circumstances     when you left america you had not a good opinion of the train of our affairs i dare say you do not find that they have got into better train it will never be easy to convince me that by a firm yet just conduct in      we might not have obtained such a respect for our neutral rights from great britain as that her violations of them  use of our means to wage her wars would not have furnished any pretence to the other party to do the same war with both would have been avoided commerce  navigation protected  enlarged we shall now either be forced into a war or have our commerce  navigation at least totally annihilated and the produce of our farms for some years left to rot on our hands a little time will unfold these things and shew which class of opinions would have been most friendly to the firmness of our government  to the interests to those for whom it was made i am with great respect dear sir your most obedient servant thomas jefferson jan       monticello doctor benjamin rush to doctor benjamin rush j mss  monticello jan       dear sir— i received yesterday your kind favor of the  th instant and the eulogium it covered on the subject of our late invaluable friend rittenhouse  i perused it with the avidity  approbation which the matter  manner of everything from your pen has long taught me to feel i thank you too for your congratulations on the public call on me to undertake the  d office in the u s but still more for the justice     you do me in viewing as i do the escape from the first i have no wish to meddle again in public affairs being happier at home than i can be anywhere else still less do i wish to engage in an office where it would be impossible to satisfy either friends or foes and least of all at a moment when the storm is about to burst which has been conjuring up for four years past if i am to act however a more tranquil  unoffending station could not have been found for me nor one so analogous to the dispositions of my mind it will give me philosophical evenings in the winter  rural days in summer i am indebted to the philosophical society for a communication of some bones of an animal of the lion kind but of most exaggerated size what are we to think of a creature whose claws were   inches long when those of the lion are not      i whose thighbone was      i diameter when that of the lion is not      i were not these things within the jurisdiction of the rule  compass and of ocular inspection credit to them could not be obtained i have been disappointed in getting the femur as yet but shall bring on the bones i have if i can for the society  have the pleasure of seeing you for a few days in the first week of march i wish the usual delays of the publications of the society may admit the addition to our new volume of this interesting article which it would be best to have first announced under the sanction of their authority i am with sincere esteem dear sir your friend and servant     thomas jefferson jan  0    james madison to james madison mad mss  jan  0    yours of the   th came to hand yesterday i am very thankful for the discretion you have exercised over the letter that has happened to be the case which i knew to be possible that the honest expression of my feelings towards mr a might be rendered malapropos from circumstances existing  known at the seat of government but not seen by me in my retired situation mr a  myself were cordial friends from the beginning of the revolution since our return from europe some little incidents have happened which were capable of affecting a jealous mind like his the deviation from that line of politics on which we have been united has not made me less sensible of the rectitude of his heart and i wished him to know this  also another truth that i am sincerely pleased at having escaped the late draught for the helm and have not a wish which he stands in the way of that he should be convinced of these truths is important to our mutual satisfaction  perhaps to the harmony  good of the public service but there was a difficulty in conveying them to him  a possibility that the attempt might do mischief there or somewhere else  i would not have hazarded the attempt if you had not been in place to decide upon its expediency it is now become unnecessary to repeat it by a letter i have had occasion to write to langdon in answer to one from him in which i have said exactly the things which will be grateful to mr a  no more this i imagine will be shewn to him      0 i have turned to the constitution  laws and find nothing to warrant the opinion that i might not have been qualified here or wherever else i could meet with a senator every member of that body being authorized to administer the oath without being confined to time or place  consequently to make a record of it and to deposit it with the records of the senate however i shall come on on the principle which had first determined me—respect to the public i hope i shall be made a part of no ceremony whatever i shall escape into the city as covertly as possible if gov mifflin should show any symptoms of ceremony pray contrive to parry them we have now fine mild weather here the thermometer is above the point which renders fires necessary adieu affectionately thomas jefferson feb        monticello james sullivan to james sullivan monticello feb        dear sir— i have many acknolegements to make for the friendly anxiety you are pleased to express in your letter of jan    for my undertaking the office to which i have been elected the idea that i would accept the office of president but not that of vice president of the u s had not its origin with me i never thought of questioning the free exercise of the right of my fellow citizens to marshal those whom they call into their service according to their fitness nor ever presumed that they were not the best judges of these had i indulged a wish in what manner they should dispose of me it would precisely have     coincided with what they have done neither the splendor nor the power nor the difficulties nor the fame or defamation as may happen attached to the first magistracy have any attractions for me the helm of a free government is always arduous  never was ours more so than at a moment when two friendly people are like to be committed in war by the ill temper of their administrations i am so much attached to my domestic situation that i would not have wished to leave it at all however if i am to be called from it the shortest absences  most tranquil station suit me best i value highly indeed the part my fellow citizens gave me in their late vote as an evidence of their esteem  i am happy in the information you are so kind as to give that many in the eastern quarter entertain the same sentiment where a constitution like ours wears a mixed aspect of monarchy  republicanism its citizens will naturally divide into two classes of sentiment according as their tone of body or mind their habits connections  callings induce them to wish to strengthen either the monarchial or the republican features of the constitution some will consider it as an elective monarchy which had better be made hereditary  therefore endeavor to lead towards that all the forms and principles of its administration others will view it as an energetic republic turning in all its points on the pivot of free and frequent elections the great body of our native citizens are unquestionably of the republican sentiment foreign education  foreign connections of interest have produced some exceptions     in every part of the union north and south  perhaps other circumstances in your quarter better known to you may have thrown into the scale of exceptions a greater number of the rich still there i believe and here i am sure the great mass is republican nor do any of the forms in which the public disposition has been pronounced in the last half dozen years evince the contrary all of them when traced to their true source have only been evidences of the preponderent popularity of a particularly great character that influence once withdrawn  our countrymen left to the operation of their own unbiassed good sense i have no doubt we shall see a pretty rapid return of general harmony  our citizens moving in phalanx in the paths of regular liberty order and a sacrosanct adherence to the constitution thus i think it will be if war with france can be avoided but if that untoward event comes athwart us in our present point of deviation nobody i believe can foresee into what port it will drive us i am always glad of an opportunity of inquiring after my most antient  respected friend mr samuel adams his principles founded on the immovable basis of equal right  reason have continued pure  unchanged permit me to place here my sincere veneration for him  wishes for his health  happiness  to assure yourself of the sentiments of esteem  respect with which i am dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant     thomas jefferson may       philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry j mss  philadelphia may       my dear friend— your favor of the  th instt came to hand yesterday that of the  th of apr with the one for monroe has never been received the first of mar    did not reach me till apr    when i was within a few days of setting out for this place  i put off acknoleging it till i should come here i entirely commend your dispositions towards mr adams knowing his worth as intimately and esteeming it as much as any one and acknoleging the preference of his claims if any i could have had to the high office conferred on him but in truth i had neither claims nor wishes on the subject tho i know it will be difficult to obtain belief of this when i retired from this place  the office of secy of state it was in the firmest contemplation of never more returning here there had indeed been suggestions in the public papers that i was looking towards a succession to the presidents chair but feeling a consciousness of their falsehood and observing that the suggestions came from hostile quarters i considered them as intended merely to excite public odium against me i never in my life exchanged a word with any person on the subject till i found my name brought forward generally in competition with that of mr adams those with whom i then communicated could say if it were necessary whether i met the call with desire or even with a ready acquiescence and whether from the moment of my first acquiescence i did not devoutly pray that the very thing might happen which has happened the     second office of this government is honorable  easy the first is but a splendid misery you express apprehensions that stratagems will be used to produce a misunderstanding between the president and myself tho not a word having this tendency has ever been hazarded to me by any one yet i consider as a certainty that nothing will be left untried to alienate him from me these machinations will proceed from the hamiltons by whom he is surrounded and who are only a little less hostile to him than to me it cannot but damp the pleasure of cordiality when we suspect that it is suspected i cannot help fearing that it is impossible for mr adams to believe that the state of my mind is what it really is that he may think i view him as an obstacle in my way i have no supernatural power to impress truth on the mind of another nor he any to discover that the estimate which he may form on a just view of the human mind as generally constituted may not be just in its application to a special constitution this may be a source of private uneasiness to us i honestly confess that it is so to me at this time but neither of us are capable of letting it have effect on our public duties those who may endeavor to separate us are probably excited by the fear that i might have influence on the executive councils but when they shall know that i consider my office as constitutionally confined to legislative functions and that i could not take any part whatever in executive consultations even were it proposed their fears may perhaps subside  their object be found not worth a machination     i do sincerely wish with you that we could take our stand on a ground perfectly neutral  independent towards all nations it has been my constant object thro public life and with respect to the english  french particularly i have too often expressed to the former my wishes  made to them propositions verbally  in writing officially  privately to official  private characters for them to doubt of my views if they would be content with equality of this they are in possession of several written  formal proofs in my own hand writing but they have wished a monopoly of commerce  influence with us and they have in fact obtained it when we take notice that theirs is the workshop to which we go for all we want that with them centre either immediately or ultimately all the labors of our hands and lands that to them belongs either openly or secretly the great mass of our navigation that even the factorage of their affairs here is kept to themselves by factitious citizenships that these foreign  false citizens now constitute the great body of what are called our merchants fill our sea ports are planted in every little town  district of the interior country sway everything in the former places by their own votes  those of their dependants in the latter by their insinuations  the influence of their ledgers that they are advancing fast to a monopoly of our banks  public funds and thereby placing our public finances under their control that they have in their alliance the most influential characters in  out of office when they have shewn that by all these bearings on the different branches of the government they can force     it to proceed in whatever direction they dictate and bend the interests of this country entirely to the will of another when all this i say is attended to it is impossible for us to say we stand on independent ground impossible for a free mind not to see  to groan under the bondage in which it is bound if anything after this could excite surprise it would be that they have been able so far to throw dust in the eyes of our own citizens as to fix on those who wish merely to recover selfgovernment the charge of subserving one foreign influence because they resist submission to another but they possess our printing presses a powerful engine in their government of us at this very moment they would have drawn us into a war on the side of england had it not been for the failure of her bank such was their open  loud cry  that of their gazettes till this event after plunging us in all the broils of the european nations there would remain but one act to close our tragedy that is to break up our union and even this they have ventured seriously  solemnly to propose  maintain by arguments in a connecticut paper i have been happy however in believing from the stifling of this effort that that dose was found too strong  excited as much repugnance there as it did horror in other parts of our country  that whatever follies we may be led into as to foreign nations we shall never give up our union the last anchor of our hope  that alone which is to prevent this heavenly country from becoming an arena of gladiators much as i abhor war and view it as the greatest scourge of mankind and anxiously as i wish to keep out of the broils of     europe i would yet go with my brethren into these rather than separate from them but i hope we may still keep clear of them notwithstanding our present thraldom  that time may be given us to reflect on the awful crisis we have passed through and to find some means of shielding ourselves in future from foreign influence political commercial or in whatever other form it may be attempted i can scarcely withhold myself from joining in the wish of silas deane that there were an ocean of fire between us  the old world  a perfect confidence that you are as much attached to peace  union as myself that you equally prize independence of all nations and the blessings of selfgovernment has induced me freely to unbosom myself to you and let you see the light in which i have viewed what has been passing among us from the beginning of the war and i shall be happy at all times in an intercommunication of sentiments with you believing that the dispositions of the different parts of our country have been considerably misrepresented  misunderstood in each     part as to the other and that nothing but good can result from an exchange of information  opinions between those whose circumstances  morals admit no doubt of the integrity of their views i remain with constant and sincere esteem dear sir your affectionate friend and servant thomas jefferson may       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia may       i was informed on my arrival here that govr pinckneys dispatches had on their first receipt excited in the administration a great deal of passion that councils were held from day to day and their ill temper fixed at length in war that under this impression congress was called that the tone of the party in general became high and so continued till the news of the failure of the bank of england this first gave it a check  a great one  they have been cooling down ever since the most intemperate only still asking permission to arm the vessels for their own defence while the more prudent disapprove of putting it in the power of their brethren  leaving to their discretion to begin the war for us the impression was too that the executive had for some time been repenting that they had called us  wished the measure undone all the members from north as well as south concurred in attesting that negociation or any thing rather than war was the wish of their constituents what was our surprise then at receiving the speech which will come     to you by this post i need make no observation to you on it i believe there was not a member of either house out of the secret who was not much disappointed however some had been prepared the spirit of supporting the executive was immediately given out in the lower house  is working there the senate admits of no fermentation tracy laurence  livermore were appointed to draw an answer for them venable freeman rutledge griswold  for the representatives the former will be reported to day  will be in time to be inclosed the other not till tomorrow when the post will be gone we hope this last will be in general terms but this is not certain a majority as is believed of the commitee being for arming the merchantmen finishing the frigates fortifying harbors  making all other military preparations as an aid to negociation how the majority of the house will be is very doubtful if all were here it is thought it would be decidedly pacific but all are not here  will not be here the division on the choice of a clerk was    for condy  0 for beckley besides the loss of the ablest clerk in the us  the outrage committed on the absent members prevented by the suddenness of the call  their distance from being here on the  st day of the session it excites a fear that the republican interest has lost by the new changes it is said that three from virginia separate from their brethren the hope however is that as the antirepublicans take the high ground of war and their opponents are for everything moderate that the most moderate of   0 those who came under contrary dispositions will join them langdon tells me there is a considerable change working in the minds of the people to the eastward that the idea that they have been deceived begins to gain ground and that were the elections to be now made their result would be considerably different this however is doubted  denied by others france has asked of holland to send away our minister from them  to treat our commerce on the plan of their late decree the batavian government answered after due consideration that their commerce with us was now their chief commerce that their money was in our funds that if they broke off correspondence with us they should be without resources for themselves for their own public  for france  therefore declined doing it france acquiesced i have this from the president who had it from his son still at hague i presume that france has made the same application to spain for i know that spain has memorialized our executive against the effect of the british treaty as to the articles concerning neutral bottoms contraband and the missisipi has been pressing for an answer  has not yet been able to obtain one it does not seem candid to have kept out of sight in the speech this discontent of spain which is strongly and seriously pronounced  to have thereby left it to be imagined that france is the only power of whom we are in danger—the failure of the bank of england  the fear of having a paper tender there has stopped buying bills of exchange specie is raked up from all quarters  remitted for paiments at a     disadvantage from risks c of  0 per cent the bankruptcies here have been immense i heard a sensible man well acquainted with them conjecture that the aggregate of the clear losses on all these added together in all the states would be not less than  0 millions of dollars a heavy tax indeed to which are to be added the maritime spoliations and this tax falling on only a particular description of citizens—bills of lading are arrived to a merchant for goods shipped from bordeaux for this place in a vessel in which monroe is coming passenger we hope hourly therefore to receive him—innes is arrived  that board going to work may    the answer of the senate is reported by the commitee it is perfectly an echo and full as high toned as the speech amendments may  will be attempted but cannot be carried—note to me the day you receive this that i may know whether i conjecture rightly what is our true post day here thomas jefferson may         philadelphia thomas pinckney to thomas pinckney j mss  philadelphia may         dear sir— i received from you before i left england a letter enclosing one from the prince of parma as i learnt soon after that you were shortly to return to america i concluded to join my acknolegments of it to my congratulations on your arrival  both have been delayed by a blameable spirit of procrastination forever suggesting to our indolence that we need not do today what may be done tomorrow accept these now in all the sincerity of     my heart it is but lately i have answered the princes letter it required some time to establish arrangements which might effect his purpose  i wished also to forward a particular article or two of curiosity you have found on your return a higher style of political difference than you had left here i fear this is inseparable from the different constitutions of the human mind  that degree of freedom which permits unrestrained expression political dissension is doubtless a less evil than the lethargy of despotism but still it is a great evil and it would be as worthy the efforts of the patriot as of the philosopher to exclude its influence if possible from social life the good are rare enough at best there is no reason to subdivide them by artificial lines but whether we shall ever be able so far to perfect the principles of society as that political opinions shall in its intercourse be as inoffensive as those of philosophy mechanics or any other may well be doubted foreign influence is the present  just object of public hue and cry  as often happens the most guilty are foremost  loudest in the cry if those who are truly independent can so trim our vessels as to beat through the waves now agitating us they will merit a glory the greater as it seems less possible when i contemplate the spirit which is driving us on here  that beyond the water which will view us as but a mouthful the more i have little hope of peace i anticipate the burning of our sea ports havoc of our frontiers household insurgency with a long train of et ceteras which is enough for a man to have met once in his life the     exchange which is to give us new neighbors in louisiana probably the present french armies when disbanded has opened us to combinations of enemies on that side where we are most vulnerable war is not the best engine for us to resort to nature has given us one in our commerce which if properly managed will be a better instrument for obliging the interested nations of europe to treat us with justice if the commercial regulations had been adopted which our legislature were at one time proposing we should at this moment have been standing on such an eminence of safety  respect as ages can never recover but having wandered from that our object should now be to get back with as little loss as possible  when peace shall be restored to the world endeavor so to form our commercial regulations as that justice from other nations shall be their mechanical result i am happy to assure you that the conduct of genl pinckney has met universal approbation it was marked with that coolness dignity  good sense which we expected from him i am told that the french government had taken up an unhappy idea that monroe was recalled for the candor of his conduct in what related to the british treaty  genl pinckney was sent as having other dispositions towards them i learn further that some of their wellinformed citizens here are setting them right as to genl pinckneys dispositions so well known to have been just towards them  i sincerely hope not only that he may be employed as envoy extraordinary to them but that their minds will be better prepared to receive him i candidly     acknolege however that i do not think the speech  addresses of congress as conciliatory as the preceding irritations on both sides would have rendered wise i shall be happy to hear from you at all times to make myself useful to you whenever opportunity offers and to give every proof of the sincerity of the sentiments of esteem  respect with which i am dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson may  0      philadelphia horatio gates to horatio gates j mss  philadelphia may  0      dear general— i thank you for the pamphlet of erskine enclosed in your favor of the  th inst and still more for the evidence which your letter affords me of the health of your mind and i hope of your body also erskine has been reprinted here  has done good it has refreshed the memory of those who had been willing to forget how the war between france and england has been produced and who apeing st james called it a defensive war on the part of england i wish any events could induce us to cease to copy such a model  to assume the dignity of being original they had their paper system stockjobbing speculations public debt moneyed interest c and all this was contrived for us they raised their cry against jacobinism and revolutionists we against democratic societies  antifederalists their alarmists sounded insurrection ours marched an army to look for one but they could not find it i wish the parallel may stop here and that we may     avoid instead of imitating a general bankruptcy and disastrous war congress or rather the representatives have been a fortnight debating a more or less irritating answer to the presidents speech the latter was lost yesterday by    against    or    it is believed however that when they come to propose measures leading directly to war they will lose some of their numbers those who have no wish but for the peace of their country  its independence of all foreign influence have a hard struggle indeed overwhelmed by a cry as loud  imposing as if it were true of being under french influence  this raised by a faction composed of english subjects residing among us or such as are english in all their relations  sentiments however patience will bring all to rights and we shall both live to see the mask taken from their faces and our citizens sensible on which side true liberty  independence are sought should any circumstance draw me further from home i shall with great cordiality pay my respects to you at rose hill  am not without hope of meeting you here some time here there  everywhere else i am with great  sincere attachment  respect your friend and servant thomas jefferson june        philadelphia james madison to james madison j mss  philadelphia june        dear sir— i wrote you on the   th of may the address of the senate was soon after that the first     draught was responsive to the speech  higher toned mr henry arrived the day it was reported the addressers had not yet their strength around them they listened therefore to his objections recommitted the papers added him and tazewell to the committee and it was reported with considerable alterations but one great attack was made on it which was to strike out the clause approving everything heretofore done by the executive this clause was retained by a majority of four they received a new accession of members held a caucus took up all the points recommended in the speech except the raising money agreed the lists of every committee and on monday passed the resolutions  appointed the committees by an uniform vote of    to    mr henry was accidentally absent ross not then come yesterday they put up the nomination of j q adams to berlin which had been objected to as extending our diplomatic establishment it was approved by    to    mr tatnall accidentally absent from the proceedings we were able to see that    on the one side   0 on the other with two wavering votes will decide every question schuyler is too ill to come this session  gunn has not yet come pinckney the genl john marshall  dana are nominated envoys extraordinary to france charles lee consulted a member from virginia to know whether marshall would be agreeable he named you as more likely to give satisfaction the answer was nobody of mr madisons way of thinking will be appointed the representatives have not yet got through their     address an amendment of mr nicholas which you will have seen in the papers was lost by a division of    to    a clause by mr dayton expressing a wish that france might be put on an equal footing with other nations was inserted by    against    this vote is most worthy of notice because the moderation  justice of the proposition being unquestionable it shews that there are    decided to go all lengths to illegible they have received a new orator from the district of mr ames he is the son of the secretary of the senate they have an accession from s c also that state being exactly divided in the h of repr i learned the following facts which give me real concern when the british treaty arrived at charleston a meeting as you know was called and a committee of seventeen appointed of whom general pinckney was one he did not attend they waited for him sent for him he treated the mission with great hauteur and disapproved of their meddling in the course of the subsequent altercations he declared that his brother t pinckney approved of every article in the treaty under the existing circumstances and since that time the politics of charleston have been assuming a different hue young rutledge joining smith and harper is an ominous fact as to that whole interest tobacco is at   dollars and flour very dull of sale a great stagnation in commerce generally during the present bankruptcy in england the merchants seem disposed to lie on their oars it is impossible to conjecture the rising of congress as it will depend on the system they decide on whether     of preparation for war or inaction in the vote of    to    morgan macher  evans were of the majority and clay kept his seat refusing to vote with either in that of    to    evans was the only one of our delegation who voted against putting france on an equal footing with other nations p m so far i had written in the morning i now take up my pen to add that the addresses having been reported to the house it was moved to disagree to so much of the amendment as went to the putting france on an equal footing with other nations  morgan and macher turning tail in consequence as is said of having been closeted last night by charles lee the vote was    to  0 so the principle was saved by a single vote they then proposed that compensations for spoliations shall be a sine qua non and this will be decided on tomorrow yours affectionately thomas jefferson june        philadelphia peregrine fitzhugh to peregrine fitzhugh j mss  philadelphia june        dear sir— i am favoured with yours of may     thank you for your intentions as to the corn  the large white clover which if forwarded to mr archibald stuart at staunton will find daily means of conveyance from thence to me that indeed is the nearest post road between you  myself by  0 or  0 miles the one by georgetown being very circuitous the representatives have at length got through their address as you doubtless receive the newspapers     regularly from hence you will have seen in them the address  all the amendments made or proposed while mentioning newspapers it is doing a good office to as distant places as yours  mine to observe that bache has begun to publish his aurora for his country customers on   sheets a week instead of six you observe that the  st   th pages are only of advertisement the  d   d contain all the essays  laws he prints therefore his  d   d pages of mondays  tuesdays papers on opposite sides of the same sheet omitting the  st   th so that we have the news pages of   papers on one this costs but   instead of   dollars  saves half the postage smith begins in july to publish a weekly paper without advertisements which will probably be a good one carys paper is an excellent one  bradfords compiled by lloyd perhaps the best in the city but both of these are daily papers thinking this episode on newspapers might not be unacceptable in a position as distant as yours i return to congress  to politics you will perceive by the votes that the republican majority of the last congress has been much affected by the changes of the late election still however if all were here the majority would be on the same side though a small one they will now proceed to consider what is to be done it is not easy nor safe to prophecy but i think the expectation is that they will not permit the merchant vessels to arm that they will leave the militia as it stands for the present season vote further sums for going on with the fortifications  frigates  prefer borrowing the money  00 of the bank to the taking up the subject of taxation generally at this inconvenient season in fact i consider the calling of congress so out of season an experiment of the new administration to see how far  on what lines they could count on its support nothing new had intervened between the late separation  the summons for pinckneys nonreception was then known it is possible from the complexion of the presidents speech that he was disposed or perhaps advised to proceed on a line which would endanger the peace of our country  though the address is nearly responsive yet it would be too bold to proceed on so small a majority the first unfavorable event  even the necessary taxes would restore preponderance to the side of peace the nomination of the envoys for france does not prove a thorough conversion to the pacific system our greatest security perhaps is in the impossibility of either borrowing or raising the money which would be necessary i am suggesting an idea on the subject of taxation which might perhaps facilitate much that business  reconcile all parties that is to say to lay a land tax leviable in      c but if by the last day of      any state bring its whole quota into the federal treasury the tax shall be suspended one year for that state if by the end of the next year they bring another years tax it shall be suspended a  d year as to them  so toties quoties forever if they fail the federal collectors will go on of course to make their collection in this way those who prefer excises may raise their quota by excises  those who prefer land taxes may raise by land taxes  0  either on the federal plan or on any other of their own which they like better this would tend i think to make the general government popular  to render the state legislatures useful allies  associates instead of rivals  to mollify the harsh tone of government which has been asserted i find the idea pleasing to most of those to whom i have suggested it it will be objected to by those who are for a consolidation you mention the retirement of mr ames you will observe that he has sent us a successor mr h g otis as rhetorical as himself you have perhaps seen an attack made by a mr luther martin on the facts stated in the notes on virginia relative to logan his speech the fate of his family  the share col cresap had in their extermination i do not desire to enter the field in the newspapers with mr martin but if any injury has been done col cresap in the statement i have given it shall certainly be corrected whenever another edition of that work shall be published i have given it as i have received it i think you told me cresap had lived in your neighbourhood hence i have imagined you could in the ordinary course of conversations in the societies there find the real truth of the whole transaction  the genuine character and conduct of cresap if you will be so good as to keep this subject in your mind to avail yourself of the opportunities of enquiry  evidence which may occur  communicate the result to me you will singularly oblige me the proceedings in the federal court of virginia to overawe the communications between the people  their representatives excite  0  great indignation probably a great fermentation will be produced by it in that state indeed it is the common cause of the confederacy as it is one of their courts which has taken the step the charges of the federal judges have for a considerable time been inviting the grand juries to become inquisitors on the freedom of speech of writing  of principle of their fellowcitizens perhaps the grand juries in the other states as well as in that of virginia may think it incumbent in their next presentment to enter protestations against this perversion of their institution from a legal to a political engine  even to present those concerned in it the hostile use which is made of whatever can be laid hold of of mine obliges me to caution the friends to whom i write never to let my letters go out of their own hands lest they should get into the newspapers i pray you to present my most friendly respects to your father  wishes for the continuance of his health  good faculties to accept yourself assurances of the esteem with which i am dear sir your most obedt  most humble servt thomas jefferson june        philadelphia french strother to french strother j mss  philadelphia june        dear sir— in compliance with the desire you expressed in the few short moments i had the pleasure of being with you at fredericksburg i shall give you some account of what is passing here the presidents speech you will have seen and how far its  0  aspect was turned towards war our opinion here is that the executive had that in contemplation and were not without expectation that the legislature might catch the flame a powerful part of that has shown a disposition to go all lengths with the executive and they have been able to persuade some of more moderate principles to go so far with them as to join them in a very sturdy address they have voted the compleating  manning the three frigates  going on with the fortifications the senate have gone much further they have brought in bills for buying more armed vessels sending them  the frigates out as convoys to our trade raising more cavalry more artillerists and providing a great army to come into actual service only if necessary they have not decided whether they will permit the merchants to arm the hope  belief is that the representatives will concur in none of these measures though their divisions hitherto have been so equal as to leave us under doubt  apprehension the usual majorities have been from   to   votes  these sometimes one way sometimes the other three of the virginia members dividing from their colleagues occasion the whole difficulty if they decline these measures we shall rise about the   th inst it appears that the dispositions of the french government towards us wear a very angry cast indeed and this before pickerings letter to pinckney was known to them we do not know what effect that may produce we expect paine every day in a vessel from havre  colo monroe in one from bordeaux tobacco keeps up to a

not sooner have done it with anything satisfactory on the subject it concerned the first opening of the session of congress was rather inauspicious to those who consider war as among the greatest calamities to our country private conversation public discussion  thorough calculation aided by the events of europe have nearly brought everyone to the same sentiment not only to wish for a continuance of peace but to let no false sense of honor lead us to take a threatening attitude which to a nation prompt in its passions  flushed with victory might produce a blow from them i rather believe that congress will think it best to do little or nothing for the present to give fair play to the negotiation proposed  in the meantime lie on their oars till their next meeting in november  0  still however both english  french spoliations continue in a high degree perhaps the prospects in europe may deaden the activity of the former  call home all their resources but i see nothing to check the depredations of the french but the natural effect they begin to produce of starving themselves by deterring us from venturing to sea with provisions this is the best general view i am able to give you of the probable course of things for the summer so far as they may be interesting to commerce the liberties which the presses take in mutilating whatever they can get hold of obliges me to request every gentleman to whom i write to take care that nothing from me may be put within their power thomas jefferson june      —am philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia june      —am my last was of the  th inst i had enclosed you separately a paper giving you an account of buonapartes last great victory since that we receive information that the preliminaries of peace were signed between france  austria mr hammond will have arrived at vienna too late to influence the terms the victories lately obtained by the french on the rhine were as splendid as buonapartes the mutiny on board the english fleet tho allayed for the present has impressed that country with terror king has written letters to his friends recommending a pacific conduct towards france notwithstanding the continuance of her injustices volney  0  is convinced france will not make peace with england because it is such an opportunity for sinking her as she never had  may not have again buonapartes army would have to march  00 miles to calais therefore it is imagined the armies of the rhine will be destined for england the senate yesterday rejected on its  d reading their own bill for raising   more companies of light dragoons by a vote of    to    their cost would have been about   0000 d a year today the bill for manning the frigates  buying   vessels  about  0000 d each comes to its  d reading some flatter us we may throw it out the trial will be in time to mention the issue herein the bills for preventing our citizens from engaging in armed vessels of either party  for prohibitg exportation of arms  ammunition have passed both houses the fortification bill is before the representatives still it is thought by many that with all the mollifying clauses they can give it it may perhaps be thrown out they have a separate bill for manning the   frigates but its fate is uncertain these are probably the ultimate measures which will be adopted if even these be adopted the folly of the convocation of congress at so inconvenient a season  an expense of  0000 d is now palpable to everybody or rather it is palpable that war was the object since that being out of the question it is evident there is nothing else however nothing less than the miraculous string of events which have taken place to wit the victories of the rhine  italy peace with austria bankruptcy of england mutiny in her fleet and kings  0  writing letters recommending peace could have cooled the fury of the british faction even all that will not prevent considerable efforts still in both houses to shew our teeth to france we had hoped to have risen this week it is now talked of for the   th but it is impossible yet to affix a time i think i cannot omit being at our court july   whether congress rises or not if so i shall be with you on the friday or saturday preceding i have a couple of pamphlets for you utrum horum  paines agrarian justice being the only things since

equipping the   frigates  buying   vessels of not more than  0 guns has this day passed on its  d reading by    against    the fortification bill before the representatives as amended in commee of the whole passed to its  d reading by    against    adieu affectionately with my best respects to mrs madison  0  thomas jefferson june         philadelphia aaron burr to aaron burr j mss  philadelphia june         dear sir— the newspapers give so minutely what is passing in congress that nothing of detail can be wanting for your information perhaps however some general view of our situation  prospects since you left us may not be unacceptable at any rate it will give me an opportunity of recalling myself to your memory  of evidencing my esteem for you you well know how strong a character of division had been impressed on the senate by the british treaty common error common censure  common efforts of defence had formed the treaty majority into a common band which feared to separate even on other subjects towards the close of the last congress however it had been hoped that their ties began to loosen  their phalanx to separate a little this hope was blasted at the very opening of the present session by the nature of the appeal which the president made to the nation the occasion for which had confessedly sprung from the fatal british treaty this circumstance rallied them again to their standard and hitherto we have had pretty regular treaty votes on all questions of principle and indeed i fear that as long as the same individuals remain so long we shall see traces of the same division in the h of representatives the republican body has also lost strength the nonattendance of   or   of that description has left the majority very equivocal indeed a few individuals of no fixed system at all governed by the panic or the prowess of the moment flap as the   0 breeze blows against the republican or the aristocratic bodies and give to the one or the other a preponderance entirely accidental hence the dissimilar aspect of the address  of the proceedings subsequent to that the inflammatory composition of the speech excited sensations of resentment which had slept under british injuries threw the wavering into the war scale and produced the war address buonapartes victories  those on the rhine the austrian peace british bankruptcy mutiny of the seamen and mr kings exhortations to pacific measures have cooled them down again  the scale of peace preponderates the threatening propositions therefore founded in the address are abandoned one by one  the cry begins now to be that we have been called together to do nothing the truth is there is nothing to do the idea of war being scouted by the events of europe but this only proves that war was the object for which we were called it proves that the executive temper was for war  that the convocation of the representatives was an experiment on the temper of the nation to see if it was in unison efforts at negociation indeed were promised but such a promise was as difficult to withhold as easy to render nugatory if negociation alone had been meant that might have been pursued without so much delay and without calling the representatives and if strong  earnest negotiation had been meant the additional nomination would have been of persons strongly  earnestly attached to the alliance of      war then was intended whether abandoned or not we must judge from     future indications  events for the same secrecy  mystery is affected to be observed by the present which marked the former administration i had always hoped that the popularity of the late president being once withdrawn from active effect the natural feelings of the people towards liberty would restore the equilibrium between the executive  legislative departments which had been destroyed by the superior weight  effect of that popularity  that their natural feelings of moral obligation would discountenance the ungrateful predilection of the executive in favor of great britain but unfortunately the preceding measures had already alienated the nation who was the object of them had excited reaction from them  this reaction has on the minds of our citizens an effect which supplies that of the washington popularity this effect was sensible on some of the late congressional elections  this it is which has lessened the republican majority in congress when it will be reinforced must depend on events  these are so incalculable that i consider the future character of our republic as in the air indeed its future fortune will be in the air if war is made on us by france  if louisiana becomes a galloamerican colony i have been much pleased to see a dawn of change in the spirit of your state the late elections have indicated something which at a distance we do not understand however what with the english influence in the lower and the patroon influence in the upper part of your state i presume little is to be hoped if a prospect could be once opened upon us     of the penetration of truth into the eastern states if the people there who are unquestionably republicans could discover that they have been duped into the support of measures calculated to sap the very foundations of republicanism we might still hope for salvation and that it would come as of old from the east but will that region ever awake to the true state of things can the middle southern  western states hold on till they awake these are painful  doubtful questions and if in assuring me of your health you can give me a comfortable solution of them it will relieve a mind devoted to the preservation of our republican government in the true form  spirit in which it was established but almost oppressed with apprehensions that fraud will at length effect what force could not  that what with currents  countercurrents we shall in the end be driven back to the land from which we launched  0 years ago indeed my dear sir we have been but a sturdy fish on the hook of a dexterous angler who letting us flounce till we have spent our force brings us up at last i am tired of the scene  this day sennight shall change it for one where to tranquillity of mind may be added pursuits of private utility since none public are admitted by the state of things i am with great  sincere esteem dear sir your friend and servant p s since writing the above we have received a report that the french directory has proposed a declaration of war against the u s to the council of antients who have rejected it thus we see two     nations who love one another affectionately brought by the ill temper of their executive administrations to the very brink of a necessity to imbrue their hands in the blood of each other thomas jefferson june         philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry j mss  philadelphia june         my dear friend— it was with infinite joy to me that you were yesterday announced to the senate as envoy extraordinary jointly with genl pinckney  mr marshall to the french republic it gave me certain assurance that there would be a preponderance in the mission sincerely disposed to be at peace with the french government  nation peace is undoubtedly at present the first object of our nation interest  honor are also national considerations but interest duly weighed is in favor of peace even at the expence of spoliations past  future  honor cannot now be an object the insults  injuries committed on us by both the belligerent parties from the beginning of      to this day  still continuing cannot now be wiped off by engaging in war with one of them as there is great reason to expect this is the last campaign in europe it would certainly be better for us to rub thro this year as we have done through the four preceding ones and hope that on the restoration of peace we may be able to establish some plan for our foreign connections more likely to secure our peace interest  honor in future our countrymen have divided themselves by such strong     affections to the french  the english that nothing will secure us internally but a divorce from both nations and this must be the object of every real american and its attainment is practicable without much selfdenial but for this peace is necessary be assured of this my dear sir that if we engage in a war during our present passions  our present weakness in some quarters that our union runs the greatest risk of not coming out of that war in the shape in which it enters it my reliance for our preservation is in your acceptance of this mission i know the tender circumstances which will oppose themselves to it but its duration will be short and its reward long you have it in your power by accepting and determining the character of the mission to secure the present peace  eternal union of your country if you decline on motives of private pain a substitute may be named who has enlisted his passions in the present contest  by the preponderance of his vote in the mission may entail on us calamities your share in which  your feelings will outweigh whatever pain a temporary absence from your family could give you the sacrifice will be short the remorse would be never ending let me then my dear sir conjure your acceptance and that you will by this act seal the mission with the confidence of all parties your nomination has given a spring to hope which was dead before i leave this place in three days and therefore shall not here have the pleasure of learning your determination but it will reach me in my retirement and enrich the tranquillity of that scene it will add to the proofs     which have convinced me that the man who loves his country on its own account and not merely for its trappings of interest or power can never be divorced from it can never refuse to come forward when he finds that she is engaged in dangers which he has the means of warding off make then an effort my friend to renounce your domestic comforts for a few months and reflect that to be a good husband and good father at this moment you must be also a good citizen with sincere wishes for your acceptance  success i am with unalterable esteem dear sir your affectionate friend and servant thomas jefferson june       philadelphia james madison to james madison j mss  philadelphia june       the senate have this day rejected their own bill for raising a provisional army of   000 men i think they will reject that for permitting private vessels to arm the representatives have thrown out the bill of the senate for raising artillery they wednesday put off one forbidding our citizens to serve in foreign vessels of war till nov by a vote of    to    this day they came to a resolution proposing to the senate to adjourn on wednesday the   th by a majority of   thus it is now perfectly understood that the convocation of congress is substantially condemned by their several decisions that nothing is to be done i

his room being supported in senate by the republican vote   nays of the opposite description no news of monroe or payne adieu thomas jefferson june       philadelphia edward rutledge to edward rutledge j mss  philadelphia june       my dear sir— i have to acknolege your two favors of may       and to thank you for your attentions to the commissions for the peas  oranges which i learn are arrived in virginia your draft i hope will soon follow on mr john barnes merchant here who as i before advised you is directed to answer it when congress first met the assemblage of facts presented in the presidents speech with the multiplied accounts of spoliations by the french west indians appeared by sundry votes on the address to incline a majority to put themselves in a posture of war under this influence the address was formed  its spirit would probably have been pursued by corresponding measures had the events of europe been of an ordinary train but this has been so extraordinary that numbers have gone over to those who from the first feeling with sensiblity the french insults as they had felt those of england before thought now as they thought then that war measures should be avoided  those of peace pursued their favorite engine on the former occasion was commercial regulations in preference to negociations     to war preparations  increase of debt on the latter as we have no commerce with france the restriction of which could press on them they wished for negociation those of the opposite sentiment had on the former occasion preferred negociation but at the same time voted for great war preparations and increase of debt now also they were for negociation war preparations  debt the parties have in debate mutually charged each other with inconsistency  with being governed by an attachment to this or that of the belligerent nations rather than the dictates of reason  pure americanism but in truth both have been consistent the same men having voted for war measures who did before  the same against them now who did before the events of europe coming to us in astonishing  rapid succession to wit the public bankruptcy of england buonapartes successes the successes on the rhine the austrian peace mutiny of the british fleet irish insurrection a demand of    millions for the current services of the year and above all the warning voice as is said of mr king to abandon all thought of connection with great britain that she is going down irrecoverably  will sink us also if we do not clear ourselves have brought over several to the pacific party so as at present to give majorities against all threatening measures they go on with frigates and fortifications because they were going on with them before they direct  0000 of their militia to hold themselves in readiness for service but they reject the propositions to raise cavalry artillery  a provisional army  to trust     private ships with arms in the present combustible state of things they believe the present is the last campaign of europe  wish to rub through this fragment of a year as they have through the four preceding ones opposing patience to insult  interest to honor they will therefore immediately adjourn this is indeed a most humiliating state of things but it commenced in    causes have been adding to causes  effects accumulating on effects from that time to this we had in    the most respectable character in the universe what the neutral nations think of us now i know not but we are low indeed with the belligerents their kicks  cuffs prove their contempt if we weather the present storm i hope we shall avail ourselves of the calm of peace to place our foreign connections under a new  different arrangement we must make the interest of every nation stand surety for its justice  their own loss to follow injury to us as effect follows its cause as to everything except commerce we ought to divorce ourselves from them all but this system would require time temper wisdom  occasional sacrifice of interest  how far all of these will be ours our children may see but we shall not the passions are too high at present to be cooled in our day you  i have formerly seen warm debates and high political passions but gentlemen of different politics would then speak to each other  separate the business of the senate from that of society it is not so now men who have been intimate all their lives cross the streets to avoid meeting  turn their heads another     way lest they should be obliged to touch their hats this may do for young men with whom passion is enjoyment but it is afflicting to peaceable minds tranquillity is the old mans milk i go to enjoy it in a few days  to exchange the roar  tumult of bulls  bears for the prattle of my grandchildren

considerably tho it was not finally done during the vacation we may perhaps be able to hunt up the letters which are wanting and get this tornado which has been threatening us dissipated you have seen

bankruptcy insubordination of the fleet c that congress is rejecting one by one the measures brought in on the principles of their own address but nothing less than such miraculous events as have been pouring in on us from the first of our convening could have assuaged the fermentation produced in mens minds in consequence of these   0 events what was the majority at first is by degrees become the minority so that we may say that in the representatives moderation will govern but nothing can establish firmly the republican principles of our government but an establishment of them in england france will be the apostle for this we very much fear that gerry will not accept the mission to paris the delays which have attended this measure have left a dangerous void in our endeavors to preserve peace which can scarcely be reconciled to a wish to preserve it i imagine we shall rise from the  st to the  d of july i am dear sir your friend and servant p s the interruption of letters is

uncertain the repr are cooking up a stamp tax which it is thought themselves will reject the fate of the bill for private armaments is yet undecided in the senate the expenses of the session are

jefferson aug      petition to virginia house of delegates  j mss  aug      to the speaker and house of delegates of the commonwealth of virginia being a protest against interference of judiciary between representative and constituent the petition of the subscribers inhabitants of the counties of amherst albemarle fluvanna and goochland sheweth that by the constitution of this state established from its earliest settlement the people thereof have professed the right of being governed by laws to which they have consented by representatives chosen by themselves immediately that in order to give to the will of the people the influence it ought to have and the information which may enable them to exercise it usefully it was a part of the common law adopted as the law of this land that their representatives in the discharge of their functions should be free from the cognizance or coercion of the coordinate branches judiciary and executive and that their communications with their constituents should of right as of duty also be free full and unawed by any that so necessary has this intercourse been deemed in the country from which they derive principally their descent and laws that the correspondence between the representative and constituent is privileged there to pass free of expense through the channel of the public post and that the proceedings of the legislature have been known to be     arrested and suspended at times until the representatives could go home to their several counties and confer with their constituents that when at the epoch of independence the constitution was formed under which we are now governed as a commonwealth so high were the principles of representative government esteemed that the legislature was made to consist of two branches both of them chosen immediately by citizens and that general system of laws was continued which protected the relations between the representative and constituent and guarded the functions of the former from the control of the judiciary and executive branches that when circumstances required that the ancient confederation of this with the sister states for the government of their common concerns should be improved into a more regular and effective form of general government the same representative principle was preserved in the new legislature one branch of which was to be chosen directly by the citizens of each state and the laws and principles remained unaltered which privileged the representative functions whether to be exercised in the state or general government against the cognizance and notice of the coordinate branches executive and judiciary and for its safe and convenient exercise the intercommunication of the representative and constituent has been sanctioned and provided for through the channel of the public post at the public expense that at the general partition of this commonwealth     into districts each of which was to choose a representative to congress the counties of amherst albemarle fluvanna and goochland were laid off into one district that at the elections held for the said district in the month of april in the years      and      the electors thereof made choice of samuel jordan cabell of the county of amherst to be their representative in the legislature of the general government that the said samuel jordan cabell accepted the office repaired at the due periods to the legislature of the general government exercised his functions there as became a worthy member and as a good and dutiful representative was in the habit of corresponding with many of his constituents and communicating to us by way of letter information of the public proceedings of asking and receiving our opinions and advice and of contributing as far as might be with right to preserve the transactions of the general government in unison with the principles and sentiments of his constituents that while the said samuel j cabell was in the exercise of his functions as a representative from this district and was in the course of that correspondence which his duty and the will of his constituents imposed on him the right of thus communicating with them deemed sacred under all the forms in which our government has hitherto existed never questioned or infringed even by royal judges or governors was openly and directly violated at a circuit court of the general government held at the city of richmond for the district of virginia in the month of may of this present year      that at the said court a b     c some of whom were foreigners having been called upon to serve in the office of grand jurors before the said court were sworn to the duties of said office in the usual forms of the law the known limits of which duties are to make presentment of those acts of individuals which the laws have declared to be crimes or misdemeanors that departing out of the legal limits of their said office and availing themselves of the sanction of its cover wickedly and contrary to their fidelity to destroy the rights of the people of this commonwealth and the fundamental principles of representative government they made a presentment of the act of the said samuel j cabell in writing letters to his constituents in the following words to wit we of the grand jury of the united states for the district of virginia present as a real evil the circular letters of several members of the late congress and particularly letters with the signature of samuel j cabell endeavoring at a time of real public danger to disseminate unfounded calumnies against the happy government of the united states and thereby to separate the people therefrom and to increase or produce a foreign influence ruinous to the peace happiness and independence of these united states that the grand jury is a part of the judiciary not permanent indeed but in office pro hac vice and responsible as other judges are for their actings and doings while in office that for the judiciary to interpose in the legislative department between the constituent and his representative to control them in the exercise of their functions or duties towards each     other to overawe the free correspondence which exists and ought to exist between them to dictate what communications may pass between them and to punish all others to put the representative into jeopardy or criminal prosecution of vexation expense and punishment before the judiciary if his communications public or private do not exactly square with their ideas of fact or right or with their designs of wrong is to put the legislative department under the feet of the judiciary is to leave us indeed the shadow but to take away the substance of representation which requires essentially that the representative be as free as his constituents would be that the same interchange of sentiment be lawful between him and them as would be lawful among themselves were they in the personal transaction of their own business is to do away the influence of the people over the proceedings of their representatives by excluding from their knowledge by the terror of punishment all but such information or misinformation as may suit their own views and is the more vitally dangerous when it is considered that grand jurors are selected by officers nominated and holding their places at the will of the executive that they are exposed to influence from the judges who are nominated immediately by the executive and who although holding permanently their commissions as judges yet from the career of additional office and emolument actually opened to them of late whether constitutionally or not are under all those motives which interest or ambition inspire of courting the favor of that branch from which     appointments flow that grand juries are frequently composed in part of bystanders often foreigners of foreign attachments and interests and little knowledge of the laws they are most improperly called to decide on and finally is to give to the judiciary and through them to the executive a complete preponderance over the legislature rendering ineffectual that wise and cautious distribution of powers made by the constitution between the three branches and subordinating to the other two that branch which most immediately depends on the people themselves and is responsible to them at short periods that independently of these considerations of a constitutional nature the right of free correspondence between citizen and citizen on their joint interests public or private and under whatsoever laws these interests arise is a natural right of every individual citizen not the gift of municipal law but among the objects for the protection of which municipal laws are instituted that so far as the attempt to take away this natural right of free correspondence is an offence against the privileges of the legislative house of which the said samuel j cabell is a member it is left to that house entrusted with the preservation of its own privileges to vindicate its immunities against the encroachments and usurpations of a coordinate branch but so far as it is an infraction of our individual rights as citizens by other citizens of our own state the judicature of this commonwealth is solely competent to its cognizance no other possessing any powers of redress that the     commonwealth retains all its judiciary cognisances not expressly alienated in the grant of powers to the united states as expressed in their constitution that that constitution alienates only those enumerated in itself or arising under laws or treaties of the united states made in conformity with its own tenor but the right of free correspondence is not claimed under that constitution or the laws or treaties derived from it but as a natural right placed originally under the protection of our municipal laws and retained under the cognizance of our own courts your petitioners further observe that though this crime may not be specifically defined and denominated by any particular statute yet it is a crime and of the highest and most alarming nature that the constitution of this commonwealth aware it would sometimes happen that deep and dangerous crimes pronounced as such in the heart of every friend to his country and its free constitution would often escape the definitions of the law and yet ought not to escape its punishments fearing at the same time to entrust such undescribed offences to the discretion of ordinary juries and judges has reserved the same to the cognizance of the body of the commonwealth acting by their representatives in general assembly for which purpose provision is made by the constitution in the following words to wit the governor when he is out of office and others offending against the state either by maladministration corruption or other means by which the safety of the state may be endangered shall be impeachable by the house of     delegates such impeachment to be prosecuted by the attorney general or such other person or persons as the house may appoint in the general court according to the laws of the land if found guilty he or they shall be either forever disabled to hold any office under government or removed from such offices pro tempore or subjected to such pains or penalties as the law shall direct considering then the house of delegates as the standing inquest of the whole commonwealth so established by the constitution that its jurisdiction as such extends over all persons within its limits and that no pale no sanctuary has been erected against their jurisdiction to protect offenders who have committed crimes against the laws of the commonwealth and rights of its citizens that the crime committed by the said grand jurors is of that high and extraordinary character for which the constitution has provided extraordinary procedure that though the violation of right falls in the first instance on us your petitioners and the representative chosen immediately by us yet in principle and consequence it extends to all our fellowcitizens whose safety is passed away whenever their representatives are placed in the exercise of their functions under the direction and coercion of either of the other departments of government and one of their most interesting rights is lost when that of a free communication of sentiment by speaking or writing is suppressed we your petitioners therefore pray that you will be pleased to take your constitutional cognizance of the premises and institute   0 such proceedings for impeaching and punishing the said a b c as may secure to the citizens of this commonwealth their constitutional right that their representatives shall in the exercise of their functions be free and independent of the other departments of government may guard that full intercourse between them and their constituents which the nature of their relations and the laws of the land establish may save to them the natural right of communicating their sentiments to one another by speaking and writing and may serve as a terror to others attempting hereafter to subvert those rights and the fundamental principles of our constitution to exclude the people from all direct influence over the government they have established by reducing that branch of the legislature which they choose directly to a subordination under those over whom they have but an indirect distant and feeble control and your petitioners further submit to the wisdom of the two houses of assembly whether the safety of the citizens of this commonwealth in their persons their property their laws and government does not require that the capacity to act in the important office of a juror grand or petty civil or criminal should be restrained in future to native citizens of the united states or such as were citizens at the date of the treaty of peace which closed our revolutionary war and whether the ignorance of our laws and natural partiality to the countries of their birth are not reasonable causes for declaring this to be one of the rights incommunicable in future to adoptive citizens     we therefore your petitioners relying with entire confidence on the wisdom and patriotism of our representatives in general assembly clothed preeminently with all the powers of the people which have not been reserved to themselves or enumerated in the grant to the general government delegated to maintain all their rights and relations not expressly and exclusively transferred to other jurisdictions and stationed as sentinels to observe with watchfulness and oppose with firmness all movements tending to destroy the equilibrium of our excellent but complicated machine of government invoke from you that redress of our violated rights which the freedom and safety of our common country calls for we denounce to you a great crime wicked in its purpose and mortal in its consequences unless prevented committed by citizens of this commonwealth against the body of their country if we have erred in conceiving the redress provided by the law we commit the subject to the superior wisdom of this house to devise and pursue such proceedings as they shall think best and we as in duty bound shall ever pray c thomas jefferson aug      monticello james madison to james madison mad mss  monticello aug      i scribbled you a line on the   th ult it missed of the post and so went by a private hand i perceive from yours by mr bringhurst that you had not received it in fact it was only on earnest exhortation     to come here with monroe which i still hope you will do in the meantime i enclose you a letter from him and wish your opinion on its principal subject the variety of other topics the day i was with you kept out of sight the letter to mazzei imputed to me in the papers the general substance of which is mine tho the diction has been considerably varied in the course of its translations from english into italian from italian into french  from french into english i first met with it at bladensburg and for a moment conceived i must take the field of the public papers i could not disavow it wholly because the greatest part was mine in substance tho not in form i could not avow it as it stood because the form was not mine and in one place the substance very materially falsified this then would render explanations necessary nay it would render proofs of the whole necessary  draw me at length into a publication of all even the secret transactions of the administration while i was of it and embroil me personally with every member of the executive with the judiciary and with others still i soon decided in my own mind to be entirely silent i consulted with several friends at philadelphia who every one of them were clearly against my avowing or disavowing  some of them conjured me most earnestly to let nothing provoke me to it i corrected in conversation with them a substantial misrepresentation in the copy published the original has a sentiment like this for i have it not before me they are endeavoring to submit us to the substance as they already have to the forms of the british     government meaning by forms the birthdays levees processions to parliament inauguration pomposities c but the copy published says as they have already submitted us to the form of the british c making me express hostility to the form of our government that is to say to the constitution itself for this is really the difference of the word form used in the singular or plural in that phrase in the english language now it would be impossible for me to explain this publicly without bringing on a personal difference between genl washington  myself which nothing before the publication of this letter has ever done it would embroil me also with all those with whom his character is still popular that is to say nine tenths of the people of the u s and what good would be obtained by my avowing the letter with the necessary explanations very little indeed in my opinion to counterbalance a good deal of harm from my silence in this instance it can never be inferred that i am afraid to own the general sentiments of the letter if i am subject to either imputation it is to that of avowing such sentiments too frankly both in private  public often when there is no necessity for it merely because i disdain everything like duplicity still however i am open to conviction think for me on the occasion and advise me what to do and confer with colo monroe on the subject let me entreat you again to come with him there are other important things to consult on one will be his affair another is the subject of the petition now enclosed you to be proposed to our district on     the late presentment of our representative by the grand jury the idea it brings forward is still confined to my own breast it has never been mentioned to any mortal because i first wish your opinion on the expediency of the measure if you approve it i shall propose to p carr or some other to father it and to present it to the counties at their general muster this will be in time for our assembly the presentment going in the public papers just at the moment when congress was together produced a great effect both on its friends  foes in that body very much to the disheartening  mortification of the latter i wish this petition if approved to arrive there under the same circumstance to produce the countereffect so wanting for their gratification i could have wished to receive it from you again at our court on monday because p carr  wilson nicholas will be there and might also be consulted and commence measures for putting it into motion if you can return it then with your opinion and corrections it will be of importance present me affectionately to mrs madison  convey to her my entreaties to interpose her good offices  persuasives with you to bring her here and before we uncover our house which will yet be some weeks salutations  adieu thomas jefferson aug       monticello st george tucker to st george tucker j mss  monticello aug       dear sir— i have to acknolege the receipt of your two favors of the  d    d inst and to thank you for     the pamphlet covered by the former  you know my subscription to its doctrines and to the mode of emancipation i am satisfied that that must be a matter of compromise between the passions the prejudices  the real difficulties which will each have their weight in that operation perhaps the first chapter of this history which has begun in st domingo  the next succeeding ones which will recount how all the whites were driven from all the other islands may prepare our minds for a peaceable accommodation between justice policy  necessity  furnish an answer to the difficult question whither shall the colored emigrants go and the sooner we put some plan underway the greater hope there is that it may be permitted to proceed peaceably to its ultimate effect but if something is not done  soon done we shall be the murderers of our own children the murmura venturos nautis prodentia ventos has already reached us the revolutionary storm now sweeping the globe will be upon us and happy if we make timely provision to give it an easy passage over our land from the present state of things in europe  america the day which begins our combustion must be near at hand and only a single spark is wanting to make that day tomorrow if we had begun sooner we might probably have been allowed a lengthier operation to clear ourselves but every days delay lessens the time we may take for emancipation some people derive hope from the aid of the confederated states but this is a delusion there is but one state in the union which will aid     us sincerely if an insurrection begins and that one may perhaps have its own fire to quench at the same time the facts stated in yours of the   d were not identically known to me but others like them were from the general government no interference need be expected even the merchant and navigator the immediate sufferers are prevented by various motives from wishing to be redressed i see nothing but a state procedure which can vindicate us from the insult it is in the power of any single magistrate or of the attorney for the commonwealth to lay hold of the commanding officer whenever he comes ashore for the breach of the peace and to proceed against him by indictment this is so plain an operation that no power can prevent its being carried through with effect but the want of will in the officers of the state i think that the matter of finances which has set the people of europe to thinking is now advanced to that point with us that the next step  it is an unavoidable one a land tax will awaken our constituents and call for inspection into past proceedings i am with great esteem dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson sepr      monticello colonel arthur campbell to colonel arthur campbell j mss  monticello sepr      dear sir— i have to acknolege the receipt of your favor of july   and to recognize in it the sentiments you have ever held  worthy of the day on which it is dated it is true that a party has risen up     among us or rather has come among us which is endeavoring to separate us from all friendly connection with france to unite our destinies with those of great britain  to assimilate our government to theirs our lenity in permitting the return of the old tories gave the first body to this party they have been increased by large importations of british merchants and factors by american merchants dealing on british capital and by stock dealers  banking companies who by the aid of a paper system are enriching themselves to the ruin of our country and swaying the government by their possession of the printing presses which their wealth commands and by other means not always honorable to the character of our countrymen hitherto their influence  their system has been irresistible and they have raised up an executive power which is too strong for the legislature but i flatter myself they have passed their zenith the people while these things were doing were lulled into rest and security from a cause which no longer exists no prepossessions now will shut their ears to truth they begin to see to what port their leaders were steering during their slumbers and there is yet time to haul in if we can avoid a war with france all can be done peaceably by the people confiding their choice of representatives  senators to persons attached to republican government  the principles of      not officehunters but farmers whose interests are entirely agricultural such men are the true representatives of the great american interest and are alone to be relied on for expressing the     proper american sentiments we owe gratitude to france justice to england good will to all and subservience to none all this must be brought about by the people using their elective rights with prudence  selfpossession and not suffering themselves to be duped by treacherous emissaries it was by the sober sense of our citizens that we were safely and steadily conducted from monarchy to republicanism and it is by the same agency alone we can be kept from falling back i am happy in this occasion of reviving the memory of old things and of assuring you of the continuance of the esteem  respect of dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson september        monticello john francis mercer to john francis mercer j mss  monticello september           we have now with us our friend monroe he is engaged in stating his conduct for the information of the public as yet however he has done little being too much occupied with rearranging his household his preliminary skirmish with the secretary of state has of course bespoke a suspension of the public mind till he can lay his statement before them our congressional district is fermenting under the presentment of their representative by the grand jury and the question of a convention for forming a state constitution will probably be attended to in these parts these are the news of our canton those of a more public nature you know before we do my best respects to mrs mercer and     assurances to yourself of the affectionate esteem of dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson sep      monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss  monticello sep      the doubt which you suggest as to our jurisdiction over the case of the grand jury vs cabell had occurred to me  naturally occurs on first view of the question but i knew that to send the petition to the ho of represent in congress would make bad worse that a majority of that house would pass a vote of approbation on examination of the question too it appeared to me that we could maintain the authority of our own government over it a right of free correspondence between citizen  citizen on their joint interests whether public or private  under whatsoever laws these interests arise to wit of the state of congress of france spain or turkey is a natural right it is not the gift of any municipal law either of england or of virginia or of congress but in common with all our other natural rights is one of the objects for the protection of which society is formed  municipal laws established the courts of this commonwealth and among them the general court as a court of impeachment are originally competent to the cognizance of all infractions of the rights of one citizen by another citizen and they still retain all their judiciary cognizances not expressly alienated by the federal constitution   0 the federal constitution alienates from them all cases arising  st under that constitution  dly under the laws of congress  dly under treaties c but this right of free correspondence whether with a public representative in general assembly in congress in france in spain or with a private one charged with a pecuniary trust or with a private friend the object of our esteem or any other has not been given to us under  st the federal constitution  dly any law of congress or  dly any treaty but as before observed by nature it is therefore not alienated but remains under the protection of our courts were the question even doubtful it is no reason for abandoning it the system of the general government is to seize all doubtful ground we must join in the scramble or get nothing where first occupancy is to give a right he who lies still loses all besides it is not right for those who are only to act in a preliminary form to let their own doubts preclude the judgment of the court of ultimate decision we ought to let it go to the ho of delegates for their consideration  they unless the contrary be palpable ought to let it go to the general court who are ultimately to decide on it it is of immense consequence that the states retain as complete authority as possible over their own citizens the withdrawing themselves under the shelter of a foreign jurisdiction is so subversive of order and so pregnant of abuse that it may not be amiss to consider how far a law of præmunire should be revived  modified against all citizens who attempt     to carry their causes before any other than the state courts in cases where those other courts have no right to their cognizance a plea to the jurisdiction of the courts of their state or a reclamation of a foreign jurisdiction if adjudged valid would be safe but if adjudged invalid would be followed by the punishment of præmunire for the attempt think further of the preceding part of this letter and we will have further conference on it adieu p s observe that it is not the breach of mr cabells privilege which we mean to punish that might lie with congress it is the wrong done to the citizens of our district congress has no authority to punish that wrong they can only take cognizance of it in vindication of their member thomas jefferson sept  0    monticello alexander white to alexander white j mss  monticello sept  0    dear sir— so many persons have of late found an interest or a passion gratified by imputing to me sayings and writings which i never said or wrote or by endeavoring to draw me into newspapers to harass me personally that i have found it necessary for my quiet  my other pursuits to leave them in full possession of the field and not to take the trouble of contradicting them in private conversation if i do it now it is out of respect to your application made by private letter  not thro the newspapers  under the perfect assurance that what i write to you will not be permitted to get into a newspaper while you are at full liberty to assert it in conversation under my authority     i never gave an opinion that the government would not remove to the federal city i never entertained that opinion but on the contrary whenever asked the question i have expressed my full confidence that they would remove there having had frequent occasion to declare this sentiment i have endeavored to conjecture on what a contrary one could have been ascribed to me i remember that in georgetown where i passed a day in february in conversation with several gentlemen on the preparations there for receiving the government an opinion was expressed by some  not privately that there would be few or no private buildings erected in washington this summer and that the prospect of their being a sufficient number in time was not flattering this they grounded on the fact that the persons holding lots from a view to increase their means of building had converted their money at low prices into morris  nicholsons notes then possessing a good degree of credit  that having lost these by the failure of these gentlemen they were much less able to build than they would have been i then observed and i did it with a view to excite exertion that if there should not be private houses in readiness sufficient for the accommodation of congress  the persons annexed to the government it could not be expected that men should come there to lodge like cattle in the fields and that it highly behooved those interested in the removal to use every exertion to provide accommodations in this opinion i presume i shall be joined by yourself  every other but delivered as it was only on the hypothesis     of a fact stated by others it could not authorize the assertion of an absolute opinion separated from the statement of fact on which it was hypothetically grounded i have seen no reason to believe that congress have changed their purpose with respect to the removal every public indication from them  every sentiment i have heard privately expressed by the members convinces me they are steady in the purpose being on this subject i will suggest to you what i did privately at georgetown to a particular person in confidence that it should be suggested to the managers if in event it should happen that there should not be a sufficiency of private buildings erected within the proper time would it not be better for the commissioners to apply for a suspension of the removal for one year than to leave it to the hazard which a contrary interest might otherwise bring on it of this however you have yet two summers to consider and you have the best knolege of the circumstances on which a judgment may be formed whether private accommodations will be provided as to the public buildings every one seems to agree that they will be in readiness i have for five or six years been encouraging the opening a direct road from the southern part of this state leading through this county to georgetown the route proposed is from georgetown by colol alexanders elk  run church normans ford stevensburg the racoon ford the marquiss road martin keys ford on the rivanna the mouth of slate river the high bridge on appomattox prince edward c h charlotte c h coles ferry on     stanton dixs ferry on dan guilford c h salisbury croswells ferry on saluda ninetysix augusta it is believed this road will shorten the distance along the continent  00 miles it will be to open anew only from georgetown to prince edward courthouse an actual survey has been made from stevensburg to georgetown by which that much of the road will be shortened  0 miles  be all a dead level the difficulty is to get it first through fairfax  prince william the counties after that will very readily carry it on we consider it as opening to us a direct road to the market of the federal city for all the beef  mutton we could raise for which we have no market at present i am in possession of the survey  had thought of getting the bridge co at georgetown to undertake to get the road carried through fairfax  prince william either by those counties or by themselves but i have some apprehension that by pointing our road to the bridge it might get out of the level country and be carried over the hills which will be but a little above it this would be inadmissible perhaps you could suggest some means of our getting over the obstacle of those two counties i shall be very happy to concur in any measure which can effect all our purposes i am with esteem dear sir your most obedient servant thomas jefferson oct       monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss  monticello oct       i like your second title better than the first because it is shorter i should like the following better than     either the foreign affairs of the u s during the years        laid before his fellow citizens by j m their late m p to the republic of france the reason of my preference is that it implies no inculpation of the executive such an implication will determine prejudiced men against buying or reading the book the following title would be better but for one reason an account of the foreign affairs of the u s during the years        rendered to his fellow citizens by j m their late m p to the republic of france but that it would raise the old hue and cry against the attempt to separate the people from their government for this reason it might be questionable whether the words laid before his fellow citizens in the first title i propose had not better be omitted in that case the words a view of should be premised so as to make it a view of the foreign affairs of the u s during c—by j m c decide among them i should not be for publishing the long letters from the secy of state to fauchet  hammond because they were no part of your business  because they are already printed by the executive perhaps it would be well to refer in a note to e rs letter to you that it enclosed such and such letters which may be seen in such a publication quoting the pages i rather think that to you relative to fenwick ought to be published   because it is to you   because it will show how vigorous they were when the english interests were affected   because it was a malversation in fenwick if true  ought to be published for the honor of the u s  warning to other consuls     skipwiths report might be referred to as already printed as to the question whether a minister is that of his country or of g w or j a i do not think will need a very formal discussion a bare statement of it with a few such strong observations as will occur currente calamo will suffice still it is necessary to be stated to bring indolent readers to reflection appearances might otherwise lead them astray adieu thomas jefferson dec       philadelphia john wayles eppes to john wayles eppes j mss  philadelphia dec       presuming that you get the newspapers i shall not repeat the public news which they detail the great victory obtained by the english over the dutch fleet is placed beyond doubt they have taken   out of    as to the proceedings of congress they have passed a bill putting off the commencement of the stamp act till july next the land tax will not be taken up this session it is suspected that the approaching elections have had as much influence in both these measures as the condition of the treasury which is said to be better than was expected congress therefore have absolutely nothing to do but to wait for news from our parisian envoys if that is of a peaceable aspect i know nothing which ought to keep us long from home and that it will be of peaceable aspect there is solid reason to expect notwithstanding the newspaper paragraphs of a contrary import fabricated to give a hostile impulse to congress we learn from norfolk that barry is     made judge of admiralty in the french west indies  has forbidden the capture of any american vessels except going to rebel ports this looks as if they wish to distinguish between real american vessels  english ones under american papers they suppose  probably that barry will be able to distinguish them i send according to your desire paines letter in my next i will enclose another pamphlet on the same subject monroes book appears this day it is of near  00 pages consequently too large to go by post bache will send on   or  00 copies to richmond i have put on board strattons schooner an anvil vice  beekiron for george proposing as soon as he receives them that isaac shall take those he has we had hoped   or   days ago that the vessels here would have got out but the weather has now set in so as to render it doubtful whether they are not shut for the winter if so it will be february before these things get on you would do well to employ isaac in the meantime in preparing coal for his years work he should have about  000 bushels laid in nor will it be amiss to cord his wood in order to excite him to an emulation in burning it well i am in hopes you or mr randolph will prepare for the road contract it is very interesting to us all tell my dear maria i received her letter of the  th from chestnut grove this day i will write to her next in the meantime convey to her the warmest expressions of my love present me affectionately to mr  mrs eppes  to all the younger ones adieu with sincere affection     p s i am entirely at a loss to what post office to direct your letters i have conjectured you have most intercourse with petersburg thomas jefferson dec       philadelphia john taylor to john taylor j mss  philadelphia dec       dear sir—    our stamp act is put off till july next the land tax will also be put off the approach of the elections may have had its weight in both these measures the affluence of the treasury has rendered it possible to go on a year longer without a land tax the questions about beginning a navy  permitting our merchants alias the english merchants to arm  begin the war for us must of course be discussed because the speech has recommended these measures but i see no reason to apprehend any change in the opinion of congress on these points since the summer session these therefore  blounts impeachment will serve to give us an appearance of business for sometime for an honest truth i believe every man here acknoleges we have nothing to do that there is literally nothing which the public good requires us to act upon as we are together i think myself we ought not to separate till we hear from our envoys at paris  i think we may expect by the last of january not only to hear from them but to see what is likely to be the aspect of our affairs with france if peaceable i know no reason why we should not go home immediately  economise something on the daily expenses     of our session which in truth are enormous the french envoy here tells me he has a letter from his government mentioning that they expect our envoys  that they will be well received a pamphlet written by fauchet is come here i have not read it but i understand that the sum of it is that our executive are the enemies of france our citizens generally friendly but that the mutual interests of both countries require a continuance of friendly intercourse between the two republics a bill extending for three years the law respecting foreign coins has passed the representatives with some difficulty  may possibly fail in the senate whether illegible fears for the mint or whether ground illegible i know not but if it fails we are left almost without a coin for legal tenders as you are in session it behooves you to see that your laws fixing the value of foreign coin  making them a tender are in illegible footing by the constitution congress may regulate the value of foreign coin but if they do not do it the old power revives to the state the constitution only forbidding them to make anything but gold  silver coin a tender in payment of debts this construction is admitted here by persons not disposed to give to the states more powers than they are entitled to adieu affectionately thomas jefferson dec       philadelphia james monroe to james monroe j mss  philadelphia dec       dear sir— i communicated to mr m the evening i was with him the papers you sent by me for mr d   0 he was clearly of opinion nothing further ought to be done d was decisively of the same opinion this being the case then there was no ground for consulting l or b  accordingly nothing has been said to them your book was later coming than was to have been wished however it works irresistably it would be very gratifying to you to hear the unqualified eulogies both on the matter  manner by all who are not hostile to it from principle a pamphlet written by fauchet and now reprinting here reinforced the views you have presented of the duplicity of the administration here the republican party in the h of representatives is stronger than its antagonistic party in all strong questions today on a question to put off a bill for permitting private vessels to arm it was put off to the  st monday of feb by  0 to     on a motion to reconsider was confirmed by    to    we have half a dozen members absent who if here would give decisive preponderance two of these are of our state giles  cabell the stamp act is put off to july  the land tax will not be touched this session before the next the elections will be over we have therefore literally nothing to do but to await intelligence from our envoys at paris  as soon as we learn that our affairs there will be of peaceable aspect as there is reason to expect i see nothing which ought to keep us here the question about building a navy to be sure must be discussed out of respect to the speech but it will only be to reject them a bill has passed the representatives giving three years longer currency to foreign coins it is in danger in the senate the     effect of stopping the currency of gold  silver is to force bank paper through all the states however i presume the state legislatures will exercise their acknoleged right of regulating the value of foreign coins when not regulated by congress  their exclusive right of declaring them a tender the marquis fayette was expected in the ship john from hamburg she is cast away in this river  0 passengers were said to be got ashore  the rest still remaining on the wreck but we do not know that he was actually a passenger some late elections have been remarkable lloyd of maryland in the place of henry by a majority of   against winder the republican candidate chipman senator of vermont by a majority of   against j smith the republican candidate tichenor chosen governor of vermont by a small majority against the republican candidate governor robertson of that state writes that the people there are fast coming over to a sound understanding of the state of our affairs the same is said of some other of the n england states in this state that spirit rises very steadily the republicans have a firm majority of about   in the h of representatives here a circumstance which has not been seen for some years even their senate is purifying the contest for the government will be between mckean  ross  will probably be an extreme hard one in n york it will be the same between livingston  jay who is becoming unpopular with his own party we are anxious to see how the n york representatives are the dismission of tench coxe from office without any     reason assigned is considered as one of the bold acts of the president tant mieux as soon as fauchets pamphlet appears i will send you a copy your book so far has sold rapidly i received from mr madison paper for  00 d for you which will be paid in the course of a few weeks i shall desire barnes to receive and hold it subject to your order present me respectfully to mrs monroe  accept assurances of my sincere friendship adieu thomas jefferson jan        philadelphia john page to john page j mss  philadelphia jan        my dear page— you have probably seen or heard of some very abusive letters addressed to me in the publick papers by a mr martin of baltimore on the subject of logans speech cited in the notes on virginia i do not mean to notice mr martin or to go into the newspapers on the subject but i am still anxious to inquire into the foundation of that story and if i find anything wrong in it it shall be corrected  what is right supported either in some new edition of that work or in an appendix to it you  i were so much together about the year      that i take for granted that whatsoever i heard you heard also  therefore that your memory can assist mine in recollecting the substance of the story how it came to us  who could now be applied to to give information relative to it you were more in ld dunmores  foys company than i was  probably heard more of it from that family than i did i     must pray you to rub up your recollection  communicate to me as fully as you can what you can recall to your mind relative to it  if you can procure me the evidence or the recollections of any other persons on it it will much oblige me we have now been met   weeks  have done nothing except put off the stamp act to july next nor does it seem as if there would be anything to do we are waiting for news from france a letter from talleyrand french minister of foreign affairs to mr le tombe consul here dated the day after the arrival of our ministers at paris says they will be well received  that every disposition exists on the side of france to accommodate their differences with us i imagine you will have seen monroes work as many copies were sent to richmond by bache we hourly expect fauchets pamphlet from the same press i will send you a copy present me respectfully to mrs page  accept assurances of the constant friendship of my dear sir yours affectionately thomas jefferson jan        philadelphia mann page to mann page j mss  philadelphia jan        dear sir— i do not know whether you have seen some very furious abuse of me in the baltimore papers by a mr luther martin on account of logans speech published in the notes on virginia he supposes both the speech  story made by me to support an argument against buffon i mean not to enter into a newspaper contest with mr martin     but i wish to collect as well as the lapse of time will permit the evidence on which we received that story it was brought to us i remember by ld dunmore  his officers on their return from the expedition of      i am sure it was from them that i got it as you were very much in the same circle of society in wmsburg with myself i am in hopes your memory will be able to help out mine and recall some facts which have escaped me i ask it as a great favor of you to endeavor to recollect  to communicate to me all the circumstances you possibly can relative to this matter particularly the authority on which we received it  the names of any persons who you think can give me information i mean to fix the fact with all possible care and truth and either to establish or correct the former statement in an appendix to the notes on virginia or in the first republication of the work congress have done nothing interesting except postponing the stamp act an act continuing the currency of the foreign coins   years longer has passed the representatives but was lost in the senate we have hopes that our envoys will be received decently at paris and some compromise agreed on there seems to be little appearance of peace in europe those among us who were so timid when they apprehended war with england are now bold in propositions to arm i do not think however that the representatives will change the policy pursued by them at their summer session the land tax will not be brought forward this year congress of course have no real business to be employed     on we may expect in a month or six weeks to hear so far from our commissioners at paris as to judge what will be the aspect of our situation with france if peaceable as we hope i know of nothing which should keep us together in my late journey to this place i came through culpeper  prince william to georgetown when i return it will be through the eastern shore a country i have never seen by norfolk  petersburg so that i shall fail then also of the pleasure of seeing you present my respectful compliments to mrs page and accept assurances of the sincere esteem of dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson p jan        james madison to james madison mad mss  p jan        dear sir—    our weather has been here as with you cold  dry the thermometer has been at  ° the river closed here the first week of december which has caught a vast number of vessels destined for departure it deadens also the demand for wheat the price at new york is      of flour   0 to   tobacco    to    d there need be no doubt of greater prices the bankruptcies here continue the prison is full of the most reputable merchants  it is understood that the scene has not yet got to its height prices have fallen greatly the market is cheaper than it has been for   years labor  house rent much reduced dry goods somewhat it is expected they will fall till they get     nearly to old prices money scarce beyond all example the representatives have rejected the presidents proposition for enabling him to prorogue them a law is passed putting off the stamp act till july next the land tax will not be brought on the secretary of the treasury says he has money enough no doubt these two measures may be taken up more boldly at the next session when most of the elections will be over it is imagined the stamp act will be extended or attempted on every possible object a bill has passed the rep to suspend for   years the law arresting the currency of foreign coins the senate propose an amendment continuing the currency of the foreign gold only very possibly the bill may be lost the object of opposing the bill is to make the french crowns a subject of speculation for it seems they fell on the presidents proclamation to a dollar in most of the states and to force bank paper for want of other medium through all the states generally tench coxe is displaced  no reason ever spoken of it is therefore understood to be for his activity during the late election it is said that the people from hence quite to the eastern extremity are beginning to be sensible that their government has been playing a foul game in vermont chipman was elected senator by a majority of one against the republican candidate in maryland lloyd by a majority of one against winder the republican candidate tichenor chosen governor of vermont by a very small majority the house of representatives of this state has become republican     by a firm majority of   two counties it is said have come over generally to the republican side it is thought the republicans have also a majority in the n york h of representatives hard elections are expected there between jay  livingston  here between ross  mckean in the h of representatives of congress the republican interest has at present on strong questions a majority of about half a dozen as is conjectured  there are as many of their firmest men absent not one of the antirepublicans is from his post the bill for permitting private vessels to arm was put off to the  st monday in february by a sudden vote  a majority of five it was considered as an index of their dispositions on that subject tho some voted both ways on other ground it is most evident that the antirepublicans wish to get rid of blounts impeachment many metaphysical niceties are handing about in conversation to shew that it cannot be sustained to show the contrary it is evident must be the task of the republicans or of nobody monroes book is considered as masterly by all those who are not opposed in principle and it is deemed unanswerable an answer however is commenced in fennos paper of yesterday under the signature of scipio the real author not yet conjectured  as i take these papers merely to preserve them i will forward them to you as you can easily return them to me on my arrival at home for i shall not see you on my way as i mean to go by the eastern shore  petersburg     perhaps the paragraphs in some of these abominable papers may draw from you now  then a squib a pamphlet of fauchets appeared yesterday i send you a copy under another cover a handbill is just arrived here from n y where they learn from a vessel which left havre about the  th of nov that the emperor had signed the definitive articles given up mantua evacuated mentz agreed to give passage to the french troops into hanover and that the portuguese ambassador had been ordered to quit paris on account of the seizure of fort st julians by the english supposed with the connivance of portugal tho this is ordinary mercantile news it looks like truth the latest official intelligence from paris is from talleyrand perigord to the french consul here letombe dated sep    saying that our envoys were arrived  would find every disposition on the part of his government to accommodate with us thomas jefferson january         philadelphia james madison to james madison j mss  philadelphia january         dear sir— i wrote you last on the  d inst on which day i received yours of decr    i have not resumed my pen because there has really been nothing worth writing about but what you would see in the newspapers there is as yet no certainty what will be the aspect of our affairs with france either the envoys have not written to the government or their communications are hushed up this last is suspected because so many arrivals have happened     from bordeaux  havre the letters from american correspondents in france have been always to boston  the experience we had last summer of their adroitness in counterfeiting this kind of intelligence inspires doubts as to their late paragraphs a letter is certainly received here by an individual from talleyrand which says our envoys have been heard that their pretensions are high that possibly no arrangement may take place but that there will be no declaration of war by france it is said that bournonville has written that he has hopes of an accommodation   audiences having then nov been had and to be himself a member of a new diplomatic mission to this country on the whole i am entirely suspended as to what is to be expected the representatives have been several days in debate on the bill for foreign intercourse a motion has been made to reduce it to what it was before the extension of      the debate will probably have good effects in several ways on the public mind but the advocates for the reformation expect to lose the question they find themselves deceived in the expectation entertained in the beginning of the session that they had a majority they now think the majority is on the other side by   or   and there are moreover   or   of them absent blounts affair is to come on next in the mean time the senate have before them a bill for regulating proceedings in impeachment this will be made the occasion of offering a clause for the introduction of juries into these trials compare the paragraph in the constitution which says that the trial of all crimes except in cases of   0 impeachment shall be by jury with the viiith amendment which says that in all criminal prosecutions the trial shall be by jury there is no expectation of carrying this because the division in the senate is of   to   but it will draw forth the principles of the parties and concur in accumulating proofs on which side all the sound principles are to be found very acrimonious altercations are going on between the spanish minister  the executive and at the natchez something worse than mere altercation if hostilities have not begun there it has not been for want of endeavors to bring them on by our agents marshall of kentucky this day proposed in senate some amendments to the constitution they were barely read just as we were adjourning  not a word of explanation given as far as i caught them in my ear they went only to modifications of the elections of president  v president by authorizing voters to add the office for which they name each  giving to the senate the decision of a disputed election of president  to the representatives that of vice president but i am apprehensive i caught the thing imperfectly  probably incorrectly perhaps this occasion may be taken of proposing again the virginia amendments as also to condemn elections by the legislatures themselves to transfer the power of trying impeachments from the senate to some better constituted court c c good tobo here is    doll flour   0 wheat   0 but dull because only the millers buy the river however is nearly open  the merchants will now     come to market  give a spur to the price but their competition will not be what it has been bankruptcies thicken  the height of them has by no means yet come on it is thought this winter will be very trying friendly salutations to mrs madison adieu affectionately january    i enclose marshalls propositions they have been this day postponed to the  st of june chiefly by the vote of the antirepublicans under the acknoleged fear that other amendments would be also proposed and that this is not the time for agitating the public mind thomas jefferson jan       henry tazewell to henry tazewell j mss  jan       as you mentioned that some of your commee admitted that the introduction of juries into trials by impeachment under the viiith amendment depended on the question whether an impeachment for a misdemeanor be a criminal prosecution i devoted yesterday evening to the extracting passages from law authors showing that in lawlanguage the term crime is in common use applied to misdemeanors  that impeachments even when for misdemeanors only are criminal prosecutions these proofs were so numerous that my patience could go no further than two authors blackstone  wooddeson they shew that you may meet that question without the danger of being contradicted     the constitution closes the proofs by explaining its own meaning when speaking of impeachments crimes misdemeanors the object in supporting this engraftment into impeachments is to lessen the dangers of the court of impeachment under its present form  to induce dispositions in all parties in favor of a better constituted court of impeachment which i own i consider as an useful thing if so composed as to be clear of the spirit of faction do not let the enclosed paper be seen in my handwriting thomas jefferson feb      philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia feb      i wrote you last on the   th ult since which yours of the   st has been received bache had put  00 copies of monroes book on board a vessel which was stopped by the early  unexpected freezing of the river he then tried in vain to get them carried by fifties at a time by the stage the river is now open here the vessels have fallen down and if they can get through the ice below the one with baches packet will soon be at richmond it is surmised here that scipio is written by c lee articles of impeachment were yesterday given in against blount but many knotty preliminary questions will arise must not a formal law settle the oath of the senators forms of pleadings process against person  goods c may he not appear by attorney must he not be tried by jury is a senator     impeachable is an exsenator impeachable you will readily conceive that these questions to be settled by    lawyers are not likely to come to speedy issue a very disagreeable question of privilege has suspended all other proceedings for several days you will see this in the newspapers the question of arming was to have come on on monday last that morning the president sent in an inflammatory message about a vessel taken  burnt by a french privateer near charleston of this he had been possessed some time and it had run through all the newspapers it seemed to come in very apropos for spurring on the disposition to arm however the question is not come on in the meantime the general spirit even of the merchants is becoming adverse to it new hampshire  rhode island are unanimously against arming so is baltimore this place becoming more so boston divided  desponding i know nothing of new york but i think there is no danger of the question being carried unless something favorable to it is received from our envoys from them we hear nothing yet it seems reasonably believed that the executive has heard  that it is something which would not promote their views of arming for every action of theirs shews they are panting to come to blows walkers bill will be applied to answer a draught of colo monroes on barnes i have not heard yet from bailey i wrote to you about procuring a rider for the fredsbg post the proposition should be here by the   th inst but i can get it kept open a little longer there is no bidder yet but green     the printer £ 00 virga will be given giles has arrived thomas jefferson feby        james monroe to james monroe mon mss  post marked feby        i received yesterday by mr giles yours of jan    and am well pleased with the indications of republicanism in our assembly their law respecting the printer is a good one i only wish they would give the printing of the laws to one  journals to another this would secure two as each portion of the business would be object enough to the printer and two places in their gift would keep within bounds the other printers also who would be in expectancy of catching something in case of either vacancy bache was prevented sending  00 copies of your book to richmond by the freezing of this river after they were aboard the vessel he tried in vain to get boxes of fifties carried on by the stages however the river is now open here the vessels have fallen down and if they find it open below that with baches packets will soon be in richmond it has been said here that c lee was the author of scipio but i know of no authority for it i had expected hamilton would have taken the field and that in that case you might have come forward yourself very shortly merely to strengthen and present in a compact view those points which you expected yourself they would lay hold of particularly the disposition expressed to acquiesce under their spoiliatory decree scipios attack is so weak as to make no impression i     understand that the opposite party admit that there is nothing in your conduct which can be blamed except the divulging secrets  this i think might be answered by a few sentences discussing the question whether an ambassador is the representative of his country or of the president barnes has accepted your bill as to the question of your practising the law in richmond i have been too long out of the way in virginia to give an opinion on it worth attention i have understood the business is very profitable much more so than in my time and an opening of great importance must be made by the retirement of marshall  washington which will be filled by somebody i do expect that your farm will not sufficiently employ your time to shield you from ennui your mind is active  would suffer if unemployed perhaps its energies could not be more justifiably employed than for your own comfort i should doubt very much however whether you should combine with this the idea of living in richmond at least till you see farther before you i have always seen that tho a residence at the seat of government gave some advantages yet it increased expences also so seriously as to overbalance the advantages i have always seen too that a good stand in the country intercepted more business than was shared by the residents of the city yours is a good stand you need only visit staunton cts some times to put yourself in the way of seeing clients—the articles of impeachment against blount were yesterday received by the senate some great questions will immediately arise   can they prescribe     their own oath the forms of pleadings issue process against person or goods by their own orders without the formality of a law authorizing it has not the  th amendment of the constitution rendered trial by jury necessary is a senator impeachable these and other questions promise no very short issue the representatives have a dirty business now before them on a question of privilege this you will see in the public papers—the question of arming our vessels was to have come on on monday last accordingly the president that morning sent in an inflammatory message about a vessel taken near charleston  burned by a french privateer of which fact he had been sometime possessed  it had been in all the newspapers it seemed thrown in on that day precisely to give a spur to the question however it did not come on in the mean time the spirit of the merchants is going fast over to the safe side of the question in new hampshire and rhode island they are unanimous in baltimore also in this place becoming more so in boston divided  desponding of new york i have no information but i think the proposition will not be carried unless something befriending it should come from our envoys nothing transpires yet of their mission yet it cannot be well doubted but that the executive must have received information perhaps it is of a nature to damp the spirit for arming—pray tell colo bell to whom i wrote about getting a rider for the fredsbg post that the   th inst is the day by which the proposition should come in i can get it kept open a little longer £ 00 our     money will be given my friendly salutations to mrs monroe adieu affectionately thomas jefferson feb       philadelphia hugh williamson to hugh williamson j mss  philadelphia feb       dear sir— i have to acknolege the receipt of your favor of the  d inst i will with great pleasure sound opinions on the subject you mention  see whether it can be brought forward with any degree of strength i doubt it however  for this reason you may recollect that a report which i gave into congress in     mr madisons propositions of jan    went directly to establish a navigation act on the british principle on the last vote given on this which was in feb    from the three states of massachusetts connecticut  rhode island there were   votes for it   0 against it  from the   states of virginia kentuckey  n carolina wherein not a single top mast vessel is i believe owned by a native citizen there were    votes for    against the measure i very much suspect that were the same proposition now brought forward the northern vote would be nearly the same while the southern one i am afraid would be radically varied the suggestion of their disinterested endeavors for placing our navigation on an independent footing  forcing on them the british treaty have not had a tendency to invite new offers of sacrifice  especially under the prospect of a new rejection you observe that the rejection would change the politics of new england     but it would afford no evidence which they have not already in the records of jan  feb    however as i before mentioned i will with pleasure sound the dispositions on that subject if the proposition should be likely to obtain a reputable vote it may do good as to myself i sincerely wish that the whole union may accommodate their interests to each other  play into their hands mutually as members of the same family that the wealth  strength of any one part should be viewed as the wealth  strength of the whole the countervailing act of g britain lately laid before us by the president offers a just occasion of looking to our navigation for the merchants here say that the effect of it will be that they themselves shall never think of employing an american vessel to carry produce to gr britain after a peace not having as yet any conversation on this subject i cannot say whether it has excited sensibility either in the north or south it shall be tried however accept assurances of the sincere esteem of dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson feb       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia feb       i wrote you last on the  th we have still not a word from our envoys this long silence if they have been silent proves things are not going on very roughly if they have not been silent it proves their information if made public would check the disposition to arm i am flattered myself from the     progress of the public sentiment against arming that the same progress had taken place in the legislature but i am assured by those who have better opportunities of forming a good judgment that if the question against arming is carried at all it will not be by more than a majority of two  particularly that there will not be more than   votes against it from the   eastern states or   votes at the utmost you will have perceived that dayton is gone over compleatly he expects to be appointed secretary of war in the room of mhenry who it is said will retire he has been told as report goes that they would not have confidence enough in him to appoint him the desire of inspiring them with more seems the only way to account for the eclat which he chuses to give to his conversion you will have seen the disgusting proceedings in the case of lyon if they would have accepted even of a commitment to the serjeant it might have been had but to get rid of his vote was the most material object these proceedings must degrade the general government and lead the people to lean more on their state governments which have been sunk under the early popularity of the former this day the question of the jury in cases of impeachment comes on there is no doubt how it will go the general division in the senate is    and  0 and under the probable prospect of what it will forever be i see nothing in the mode of proceeding by impeachment but the most formidable weapon for the purposes of a dominant faction that ever was contrived it would be the most effectual one for getting rid of any man whom   0 they consider as dangerous to their views and i do not know that we could count on onethird on an emergency it depends then on the h of representatives who are the impeachers  there the majorities are of     or   only  these sometimes one way  sometimes another in a question of pure party they have the majority and we do not know what circumstances may turn up to increase that majority temporarily if not permanently i know of no solid purpose of punishment which the courts of law are not equal to and history shows that in england impeachment has been an engine more of passion than justice a great ball is to be given here on the   d and in other great towns of the union this is at least very indelicate  probably excites uneasy sensations in some i see in it however this useful deduction that the birth days which have been kept have been not those of the president but of the general i enclose with the newspapers the two acts of parliament passed on the subject of our commerce which are interesting the merchants here say that the effect of the countervailing tonnage on american vessels will throw them completely out of employ as soon as there is peace the eastern members say nothing but among themselves but it is said that it is working like gravel in their stomachs our only comfort is that they have brought it on themselves my respectful salutation to mrs madison  to yourself friendship and adieu     thomas jefferson feb       philadelphia horatio gates to horatio gates j mss  philadelphia feb       dear general— i received duly your welcome favor of the   th and had an opportunity of immediately delivering the one it enclosed to general kosciusko i see him often and with great pleasure mixed with commiseration he is as pure a son of liberty as i have ever known and of that liberty which is to go to all and not to the few or the rich alone we are here under great anxiety to hear from our envoys but i think this is one of the cases where no news is good news if the dispositions at paris threatened war it is impossible that our envoys should not find some means of putting us on our guard of warning us to begin our preparations especially too when so many vessels have come from ports of france and if writing were dangerous which cannot be there are so many of our countrymen at paris who would bring us their viva voce communications peace then must be probable i agree with you that some of our merchants have been milking the cow yet the great mass of them have become deranged they are daily falling down by bankruptcies and on the whole the condition of our commerce far less firm  really prosperous than it would have been by the regular operations and steady advances which a state of peace would have occasioned were a war to take place and throw our agriculture into equal convulsions with our commerce our business would be done at both ends but this i hope will not be the good news from the natchez has cut off the fear of a breach in that     quarter where a crisis was brought on which has astonished every one how this mighty duel is to end between gr britain and france is a momentous question the sea which divides them makes it a game of chance but it is narrow and all the chances are not on one side should they make peace still our fate is problematical the countervailing acts of gr brit now laid before congress threaten in the opinion of merchants the entire loss of our navigation to england it makes a difference from the present state of things of  00 guineas on a vessel of   0 tons if as the newspapers have told us france has renewed her arret of      laying a duty of   livres a hundred on all tobo brought in foreign bottoms even our own and should extend it to rice  other commodities we are done as navigators to that country also in fact i apprehend that those two great nations will think it their interest not to permit us to be navigators france had thought otherwise and had shown an equal desire to encourage our navigation as her own while she hoped its weight would at least not be thrown into the scale of her enemies she sees now that that is not to be relied on and will probably use her own means and those of the nations under her influence to exclude us from the ocean how far it may lessen our happiness to be rendered merely agricultural how far that state is more friendly to principles of virtue  liberty are questions yet to be solved kosciusko has been disappointed by the sudden peace between france  austria a ray of hope seemed to gleam on his mind     for a moment that the extension of the revolutionary spirit through italy and germany might so have occupied the remnants of monarchy there as that his country might have risen again i sincerely rejoice to find that you preserve your health so well that you may so go on to the end of the chapter  that it may be a long one i sincerely pray make my friendly salutations acceptable to mrs gates  accept yourself assurances of the great  constant esteem  respect of dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson february       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia february       yours of the   th is received i wrote you last on the   th but the letter getting misplaced will only go by this post we still hear nothing from our envoys whether the executive hear we know not but if war were to be apprehended it is impossible our envoys should not find means of putting us on our guard or that the executive should hold back their information no news therefore is good news the countervailing act which i sent you by the last post will confessedly put american bottoms out of employ in our trade with gr britain so say wellinformed merchants indeed it seems probable when we consider that hitherto with the advantage of our foreign tonnage our vessels could only share with the british and the countervailing duties will it is said make a difference of  00 guineas to our prejudice on a ship of   0 tons still the eastern     men say nothing every appearance  consideration render it probable that on the restoration of peace both france  britain will consider it their interest to exclude us from the ocean by such peaceable means as are in their power should this take place perhaps it may be thought just  politic to give to our native capitalists the monopoly of our internal commerce this may at once relieve us from the danger of wars abroad and british thraldom at home the news from the natchez of the delivery of the posts which you will see in the papers is to be relied on we have escaped a dangerous crisis there the great contest between israel  morgan of which you will see the papers full is to be decided this day it is snowing fast at this time and the most sloppy walking i ever saw this will be to the disadvantage of the party which has the most invalids whether the event will be known this evening i am uncertain i rather presume not  therefore that you will not learn it till next post you will see in the papers the ground on which the introduction of the jury into the trial by impeachment was advocated by mr tazewell  the fate of the question reades motion which i enclosed you will probably be amended  established so as to declare a senator unimpeachable absolutely and yesterday an opinion was declared that not only officers of the state governments but every private citizen of the u s is impeachable whether they will think this the time to make the declaration i know not but if they bring it on i think there will be not more than two votes north of the patowmac     against the universality of the impeaching power the system of the senate may be inferred from their transactions heretofore and from the following declaration made to me personally by their oracle  no republic can ever be of any duration without a senate  a senate deeply and strongly rooted strong enough to bear up against all popular storms  passions the only fault in the constitution of our senate is that their term of office is not durable enough hitherto they have done well but probably they will be forced to give way in time i suppose their having done well hitherto alluded to the stand they made on the british treaty this declaration may be considered as their text that they consider themselves as the bulwarks of the government and will be rendering that the more secure in proportion as they can assume greater powers the foreign intercourse bill is set for today but the parties are so equal on that in the h repr that they seem mutually to fear the encounter    thomas jefferson feb         philadelphia peregrine fitzhugh to peregrine fitzhugh j mss  philadelphia feb         dear sir— i have yet to acknolege your last favor which i received at monticello and therefore cannot now recur to the date the perversion of the expressions of a former letter to you which you mention to have been made in the newspapers i     had not till then heard of yet the spirit of it was not new i have been for some time used as the property of the newspapers a fair mark for every mans dirt some too have indulged themselves in this exercise who would not have done it had they known me otherwise than thro these impure and injurious channels it is hard treatment and for a singular kind of offence that of having obtained by the labors of a life the indulgent opinions of a part of ones fellow citizens however these moral evils must be submitted to like the physical scourges of tempest fire c we are waiting with great anxiety to hear from our envoys at paris but the very circumstance of silence speaks i think plain enough if there were danger of war we should certainly hear from them it is impossible if that were the aspect of their negociations that they should not find or make occasion of putting us on our guard  of warning us to prepare i consider therefore their silence as a proof of peace indeed i had before imagined that when france had thrown down the gauntlet to england and was pointing all her energies to that object her regard for the subsistence of her islands would keep her from cutting off our resources from them i hope therefore we shall rub through the war without engaging in it ourselves and that when in a state of peace our legislature  executive will endeavor to provide peaceable means of obliging foreign nations to be just to us and of making their injustice recoil on themselves the advantages of our commerce to them may be made the engine for this purpose provided we shall     be willing to submit to occasional sacrifices which will be nothing in comparison with the calamities of war congress has nothing of any importance before them except the bill on foreign intercourse  the proposition to arm our merchant vessels these will be soon decided and if we then get peaceable news from our envoys i know of nothing which ought to prevent our immediate separation it had been expected that we must have laid a land tax this session however it is thought we can get along another year without it some very disagreeable differences have taken place in congress they cannot fail to lessen the respect of the public for the general government and to replace their state governments in a greater degree of comparative respectability i do not think it for the interest of the general government itself  still less of the union at large that the state governments should be so little respected as they have been however i dare say that in time all these as well as their central government like the planets revolving round their common sun acting  acted upon according to their respective weights  distances will produce that beautiful equilibrium on which our constitution is founded and which i believe it will exhibit to the world in a degree of perfection unexampled but in the planetary system itself the enlightened statesman therefore will endeavor to preserve the weight and influence of every part as too much given to any member of it would destroy the general equilibrium the ensuing month will probably be the most eventful ever yet seen in modern europe it may     probably be the season preferred for the projected invasion of england it is indeed a game of chances the sea which divides the combatants gives to fortune as well as to valor its share of influence on the enterprise but all the chances are not on one side the subjugation of england would indeed be a general calamity but happily it is impossible should it end in her being only republicanized i know not on what principle a true republican of our country could lament it whether he considers it as extending the blessings of a purer government to other portions of mankind or strengthening the cause of liberty in our own country by the influence of that example i do not indeed wish to see any nation have a form of government forced on them but if it is to be done i should rejoice at its being a freer one permit me to place here the tribute of my regrets for the affecting loss lately sustained within your walls and to add that of the esteem  respect with which i am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson p march      james madison to james madison mad mss  p march      i wrote you last on the    since which i have received yours without date but probably of about the   th or   th an arrival to the eastward brings us some news which you see detailed in the papers the new partition of europe is sketched but how far authentic we know not it has some probability in its favor the french appear busy in their preparations     for the invasion of england nor is there any appearance of movements on the part of russia  prussia which might divert them from it the late birthnight has certainly sown tares among the exclusive federals it has winnowed the grain from the chaff the sincerely adamites did not go the washingtonians went religiously  took the secession of the others in high dudgeon the one sect threaten to desert the levees the other the evening parties the whigs went in number to encourage the idea that the birthnights hitherto kept had been for the general  not the president and of course that time would bring an end to them goodhue tracy sedgwick c did not attend but the three secretaries  attorney general did we were surprised the last week with a symptom of a disposition to repeal the stamp act petitions for that purpose had come from rhode island  virginia  had been committed to rest with the ways  means mr harper their chairman in order to enter on the law for amending it observed it would be necessary first to put the petitions for repeal out of the way and moved an immediate decision on them the rhode islanders begged  prayed for a postponement that not expecting that that question was to be called up they were not at all prepared but harper would shew no mercy not a moments delay should be allowed it was taken up and on a question without debate determined in favor of the petitions by a majority of  0 astonished  confounded when an order to bring in a bill for repeal was moved they began in   0 turn to beg for time   weeks one week   days   day not a moment would be yielded they made three attempts for adjournment but the majorities appeared to grow it was decided by a majority of    that the bill should be brought in it was brought in the next day  on the day after passed sent up to the senate who instantly sent it back rejected by a silent vote of    to    r i  n hampshire voted for the repeal in senate the act will therefore go into operation july   but probably without amendments however i am persuaded it will be shortlived it has already excited great commotion in vermont and grumblings in connecticut but they are so priestridden that nothing is expected from them but the most bigoted passive obedience no news yet from our commissioners but their silence is admitted to augur peace there is no talk yet of the time of adjourning tho admitted we have nothing to do but what could be done in a fortnight or three weeks when the spring opens and we hear from our commissioners we shall probably draw pretty rapidly to conclusion a friend of mine here wishes to get a copy of mazzeis recherches historiques et politiques where are they salutations  adieu wheat   0 flour   0 tobo    0 thomas jefferson mar      philadelphia james monroe to james monroe mon mss  philadelphia mar      dear sir— i have to acknolege the receipt of yours of feb           at length the charm is     broke and letters have been received from our envoys at paris one only of them has been communicated of which i enclose you a copy with the documents accompanying it the decree therein proposed to be passed has struck the greatest alarm through the merchants i have ever yet witnessed as it has not been known more than two or three days its particular operations are not yet developed it will probably drive our vessels out of the british trade because as they will not have the benefit of convoy they cannot bring a return cargo from great britain but on much higher insurance than the british vessels who will have convoy nor can they carry out produce but on much higher freight because they will be to return empty in which case the british will underwork them it seems then as if one effect would be to increase the british navigation unless indeed our vessels instead of laying themselves up in port should go to other markets with their produce  for return cargoes however it is not probable this state of things will last long enough to have any great effect the month of april i think will see the experiment of the invasion and that will be a short one you will see in baches paper of this morning the  th number of some pieces written by t coxe in which this proposed decree is well viewed how it will operate on our question about arming we do not yet know some talk of letters of marque  reprisal yet on the whole i rather believe it will not add to the number of voters for arming this measure with the decrees of the british courts that british subjects adopted here since the peace and     carrying on commerce from hence are still british subjects  their cargoes british property has shaken these quasicitizens in their condition the french adopt the same principle as to their cargoes when captured a privateer lately took near our coast an e indiaman worth   0000 d belonging to one of these lately emigrated houses is it worth our while to go to war to support the contrary doctrine the british principle is clearly against the law of nations but which way our interest lies is also worthy consideration the influence of this description of merchants on our government  on the public opinion is not merely innocent its absence would not weaken our union—the issue of the question on foreign intercourse has enabled us to count the strength of the two parties in the h of representatives it is        if all the members were present the whigs being a minority of   but in this computation all wavering characters are given to the other side jersey has laid itself off into districts which instead of an uniform delegation will give one chequered as the state is they will at their next election send whigs from two districts pennsylvania at her next election in october will add two more to the whig list let us hope that morgan  macher will give place to whig successors i do not know that this can be hoped for from our eastern shore this much i think tolerably certain besides the natural progress of public sentiment in other quarters  the effect of the events of the time we do not think then that the partizans of republican government     should despair—they do not yet talk of the time of adjournment though confessedly they have nothing to do yet i trust it will be early in the ensueing month—how far it may be eligible for you to engage in the practice of the law i know not on the question of your removal to richmond i may doubtless be under bias when i suppose its expediency questionable the expence to be incurred in the first moments will certainly be great could it be only deferred for a while it would enable you to judge whether the prospect opened will be worth that dislocation of your affairs or whether some other career may not open on you of these things nobody but yourself can judge it is a question too for yourself whether a seat among the judges of the state would be an object for you on all these points your friends can only offer motives for consideration on which none but yourself can decide avec connoissance de cause i really believe that some employment more than your farms will furnish will be necessary to your happiness you are young your mind active and your health vigorous the languor of ennui would in such a condition of things be intolerable make my most respectful salutations to mrs monroe  accept friendly adieux to yourself thomas jefferson mar       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia mar       i wrote you last on the  d instt yours of the  th is now at hand the public papers will give you the     news of europe the french decree making the vessel friendly or enemy according to the hands by which the cargo was manufactured has produced a great sensation among the merchants here its operation is not yet perhaps well understood but probably it will put our shipping out of competition because british bottoms which can come under convoy will alone be trusted with return cargoes ours losing this benefit would need a higher freight out in which therefore they will be underbid by the british they must then retire from the competition some no doubt will try other channels of commerce and return cargoes from other countries this effect would be salutary a very wellinformed merchant too a scotsman entirely in the english trade told me he thought it would have another good effect by checking  withdrawing our overextensive commerce  navign the fruit of our neutral position within those bounds to which peace must necessarily bring them that this being done by degrees will probably prevent those numerous failures produced generally by a peace coming on suddenly notwithstanding this decree the sentiments of the merchants become more  more cooled  settled down against arming yet it is believed the representatives do not cool and tho we think the question against arming will be carried yet probably by a majority of only   or   their plan is to have convoys furnished for our vessels going to europe  smaller vessels for the coasting defence on this condition they will agree to fortify southern harbors and build some galleys it has been concluded     among them that if war takes place wolcott is to be retained in office that the pt must give up mhenry  as to pickering they are divided the eastern men being determined to retain him their middle  southern brethren wishing to get rid of him they have talked of genl pinckney as successor to mhenry this information is certain however i hope that we shall avoid war  save them the trouble of a change of ministry the p has nominated j q adams commissioner plenipoty to renew the treaty with sweden tazewell made a great stand against it on the general ground that we should let our treaties drop  remain without any he could only get   votes against  0 a trial will be made today in another form which he thinks will give  0 or    against    or    declaring the renewal inexpedient in this case notwithstanding the nomination has been confirmed it is supposed the p would perhaps not act under it on the probability that more than a third would be against the ratification i believe however that he would act  that a third could not be got to oppose the ratification it is acknoleged we have nothing to do but to decide the question about arming yet not a word is said about adjourning and some even talk of continuing the session permanently others talk of july  august an effort however will soon be made for an early adjournment my friendly salutations to mrs madison to yourself affectionate adieux     thomas jefferson mar       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia mar       i wrote you last on the   th since that yours of the   th is received since that too a great change has taken place in the appearance of our political atmosphere the merchants as before continue a respectable part of them to wish to avoid arming the french decree operated on them as a sedative producing more alarm than resentment on the representatives differently it excited indignation highly in the war party tho i do not know that it had added any new friends to that side of the question we still hoped a majority of about   but the insane message which you will see in the public papers has had great effect exultation on the one side  a certainty of victory while the other is petrified with astonishment our evans tho his soul is wrapt up in the sentiments of this message yet afraid to give a vote openly for it is going off tomorrow as is said those who count say there are still   members of the other side who will come over to that of peace if so the numbers will be for war measures    against them    if all are present except evans the question is what is to be attempted supposing we have a majority i suggest two things   as the president declares he has withdrawn the executive prohibition to arm that congress should pass a legislative one if that should fail in the senate it would heap coals of fire on their head   as to do nothing  to gain time is everything with us i propose that they shall come to a resolution of adjournment in order to go home      consult their constituents on the great crisis of american affairs now existing besides gaining time enough by this to allow the descent on england to have its effect here as well as there it will be a means of exciting the whole body of the people from the state of inattention in which they are it will require every member to call for the sense of his district by petition or instruction it will shew the people with which side of the house their safety as well as their rights rest by shewing them which is for war  which for peace  their representatives will return here invigorated by the avowed support of the american people i do not know however whether this will be approved as there has been little consultation on the subject we see a new instance of the inefficiency of constitutional guards we had relied with great security on that provision which requires twothirds of the legislature to declare war but this is completely eluded by a majoritys taking such measures as will be sure to produce war i wrote you in my last that an attempt was to be made on that day in senate to declare an inexpediency to renew our treaties but the measure is put off under a hope of its being attempted under better auspices to return to the subject of war it is quite impossible when we consider all its existing circumstances to find any reason in its favor resulting from views either of interest or honor  plausible enough to impose even on the weakest mind and especially when it would be undertaken by a majority of one or two only whatever then be our stock of charity or liberality     we must resort to other views and those so well known to have been entertained at annapolis  afterwards at the grand convention by a particular set of men present themselves as those alone which can account for so extraordinary a degree of impetuosity perhaps instead of what was then in contemplation a separation of the union which has been so much the topic to the eastward of late may be the thing aimed at i have written so far two days before the departure of the post should anything more occur today or tomorrow it shall be added   d at night nothing more thomas jefferson mar       philadelphia james monroe to james monroe mon mss  philadelphia mar       the public papers will present to you the almost insane message sent to both houses of congress   or   days ago this has added to the alarm of the sounder and most respectable part of our merchants i mean those who are natives are solid in their circumstances  do not need the lottery of war to get themselves to rights the effect of the french decree on the representatives had been to render the war party inveterate  more firm in their purpose without adding to their numbers in that state of things we had hoped to avert war measures by a majority of   at this time those who court talk of its being reduced to a majority of   or   if a majority be with us at all this is produced by the     weight of the executive opinion the first thing proposed by the whigs will be a call for papers for if congress are to act on the question of war they have a right to information the  d to pass a legislative prohibition to arm vessels instead of the executive one which the president informs them he has withdrawn these questions will try the whig strength on the ground of war the  d to adjourn to consult our constituents on the great crisis of american affairs now existing this measure appears to me under a very favorable aspect it gives time for the french operations on england to have their effect here as well as there it awakens the people from the slumber over public proceedings in which they are involved it obliges every member to consult his district on the simple question of war or peace it shews the people on which side of the house are the friends of their peace as well as their rights  brings back those friends to the next session supported by the whole american people i do not know however whether this last measure will be proposed the late maneuvres have added another proof to the inefficiency of constitutional barriers we had reposed great confidence in that provision of the constitution which requires ⅔ of the legislature to declare war yet it can be entirely eluded by a majoritys taking such measures as will bring on war—my last to you was of the  th inst the last recd from you was of feb      0 thomas jefferson mar       philadelphia dr samuel brown to dr samuel brown j mss  philadelphia mar       dear sir— you were a witness before you left our side of the continent to the endeavours of the tory part among us to write me down as far as they could find or make materials o that mine enemy would write a book has been a well known prayer against an enemy i had written a book  it has furnished matter for abuse for want of something better mr martins polite attack on the subject of cresap  logan as stated in the notes on virginia had begun before you left us it has continued  still continues though after the perusal of the first letter had shown me what was to be the style of those subsequent i have avoided reading a single one a friend of mine having wished for a general explanation of the foundation of the case of logan i wrote him a letter of which i had a few copies printed to give to particular friends for their satisfaction  on whom i could rely against the danger of its being published i enclose you a copy as well for these purposes as that i think it may be in your power to obtain some information for me indeed i suppose it probable that general clarke may know something of the facts relative to logan or cresap i shall be much obliged to you for any information you can procure on this subject you will see by the enclosed in what way i mean to make use of it i am told you are preparing to give us an account of the general which for its matter i know  for its manner i doubt not will be highly interesting i am in hopes in connecting with it some account of kentuckey that your     information  his together will be able to correct  supply what i had collected relative to it in a very early day indeed it was to genl clarke i was indebted for what degree of accuracy there was in most of my statements i wish you to attend particularly to the overflowage of the

from dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson mar       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia mar       i wrote you last on the   st yours of the   th therein acknoleged is the last recd the measure i suggested in mine of adjourning for consultation with their constituents was not brought forward but on tuesday   resolutions were moved which you will see in the public papers they were offered in committee to prevent their being suppressed by the previous question  in the commee on the state of the union to put it out of their power by the rising of the commee  not sitting again to get rid of them they were taken by surprise not expecting to be called to vote on such a proposition as that it is inexpedient to resort to war against the french republic after spending the first day in seeking on every side some hole to get out at like an animal first put into a cage they gave up that resource yesterday they came forward boldly and     openly combated the proposition mr harper  mr pinckney pronounced bitter philippics against france selecting such circumstances  aggravations as to give the worst picture they could present the latter on this as in the affair of lyon  griswold went far beyond that moderation he has on other occasions recommended we know not how it will go some think the resolution will be lost some that it will be carried but neither way by a majority of more than   or   the decision of the executive of twothirds of the senate  half the house of representatives is too much for the other half of that house we therefore fear it will be borne down and are under the most gloomy apprehensions in fact the question of war  peace depends now on a toss of cross  pile if we could but gain this season we should be saved the affairs of europe would of themselves relieve us besides this there can be no doubt that a revolution of opinion in massachusetts  connecticut is working two whig presses have been set up in each of those states there has been for some days a rumor that a treaty of alliance offensive  defensive with g britain is arrived some circumstances have occasioned it to be listened to to wit the arrival of mr kings secretary which is affirmed the departure of mr listons secretary which i know is to take place on wednesday next the high tone of the executive measures at the last  present session calculated to raise things to the unison of such a compact and supported so desperately in both houses in opposition to the pacific wishes of the people  at the risque of their approbation     at the ensuing election langdon yesterday in debate mentioned this current report tracy in reply declared he knew of no such thing did not believe it nor would be its advocate the senate are proceeding on the plan communicated in mine of mar    they are now passing a bill to purchase    vessels of from    to    guns which with our frigates are to be employed as convoys  guarda costas they are estimated when manned  fitted for sea at   millions they have past a bill for buying one or more founderies they are about bringing in a bill for regulating private arming and the defensive works in our harbors have been proceeded on some time since an attempt has been made to get the quakers to come forward with a petition to aid with the weight of their body the feeble band of peace they have with some effort got a petition signed by a few of their society the main body of their society refuse it mclays peace motion in the assembly of pennsylvania was rejected with an unanimity of the quaker vote and it seems to be well understood that their attachment to england is stronger than to their principles or their country the revolution war was a first proof of this mr white from the federal city is here soliciting money for the buildings at washington a bill for  00000 d has passed the h r  is before the senate where its fate is entirely uncertain he is become perfectly satisfied that mr a is radically against the governments being there goodhue his oracle openly said in commee in presence of white that he knew the     government was obliged to go there but they would not be obliged to stay there mr a said to white that it would be better that the president should rent a common house there to live in that no president would live in the one now building this harmonizes with goodhues idea of a short residence i write this in the morning but need not part with it till night if anything occurs in the day it shall be added p m nothing material has occurred adieu thomas jefferson apr      philadelphia edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton j mss  philadelphia apr      dear sir— i have to acknolege the receipt of your favor of jany    and as the rising of congress seems now to be contemplated for about the last of this month and it is necessary that i settle mr shorts matter with the treasury before my departure i take the liberty of saying a word on that subject the sum you are to pay is to go to the credit of a demand which mr short has on the treasury of the us and for which they consider mr randolph as liable to them so that the sum he pays to short directly lessens so much the balance to be otherwise settled mr short by a letter received a few days ago has directed an immediate employment of the whole sum in a particular way i wish your sum settled therefore that i may call on the treasury for the exact balance i should have thought your best market for stock would have been here and i am     convinced the quicker sold the better for should the war measures recommended by the executive  taken up by the legislature be carried through the fall of stock will be very sudden war being then more than probable mr short holds some stock here and should the first of mr spriggs resolutions now under debate in the lower house be rejected i shall within    hours from the rejection sell out the whole of mr shorts stock how that resolution will be disposed of to wit that against the expediency of war with the french republic is very doubtful those who count votes vary the issue from a majority of   against the resolution to   or   majority in its favor so that the scales of peace  war are very nearly in equilibrio should the debate hold many days we shall derive aid from the delay letters received from france by a vessel just arrived concur in assuring us that as all the french measures bear equally on the swedes  danes as on us so they have no more purpose of declaring war against us than against them besides this a wonderful stir is commencing in the eastern states the dirty business of lyon  griswold was of a nature to fly through the newspapers both whig  tory  to excite the attention of all classes it of course carried to their attention at the same time the debates out of which that affair sprung the subject of these debates was whether the representatives of the people were to have no check on the expenditure of the public money  the executive to squander it at their will leaving to the legislature only the drudgery of furnishing the money they begin to     open their eyes on this to the eastward  to suspect they have been hoodwinked two or three whig presses have set up in massachusetts  as many more in connecticut the late war message of the president has added new alarm town meetings have begun in massachusetts and are sending on their petitions  remonstrances by great majorities against warmeasures and these meetings are likely to spread the present debate as it gets abroad will further show them that it is their members who are for war measures it happens fortunately that these gentlemen are obliged to bring themselves forward exactly in time for the eastern elections to congress which come on in the course of the ensuing summer we have therefore great reason to expect some favorable changes in the representatives from that quarter the same is counted on with confidence from jersey pennsylvania  maryland perhaps one or two also in virginia so that after the next election the whigs think themselves certain of a very strong majority in the h of representatives and tho against the other branches they can do nothing good yet they can hinder them from doing ill the only source of anxiety therefore is to avoid war for the present moment if we can defeat the measures leading to that during this session so as to gain this summer time will be given as well for the public mind to make itself felt as for the operations of france to have their effect in england as well as here if on the contrary war is forced on the tory interest continues dominant and to them alone must be left as they alone desire to     ride on the whirlwind  direct the storm the present period therefore of two or three weeks is the most eventful ever known since that of      and will decide whether the principles established by that contest are to prevail or give way to those they subverted accept the friendly salutations  prayers for your health  happiness of dear sir your sincere and affectionate friend p s compliments to mr taylor i shall write to him in a few days thomas jefferson april      philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia april      i wrote you last on the   th ult since which i have no letter from you these acknolegments regularly made and attended to will shew whether any of my letters are intercepted and the impression of my seal on wax which shall be constant hereafter will discover whether they are opened by the way the nature of some of my communications furnishes ground of inquietude for their safe conveyance the bill for the federal buildings labors hard in senate tho to lessen opposition the maryland senator himself proposed to reduce the  00000 d to onethird of that sum sedgwick  hillhouse violently opposed it i conjecture that the votes will be either    for     against it or        every member declares he means to go there but tho charged with an intention to come away again not one of them disavowed it this will engender incurable distrust the debate on mr spriggs     resolutions has been interrupted by a motion to call for papers this was carried by a great majority in this case there appeared a separate squad to wit the pinckney interest which is a distinct thing and will be seen sometimes to lurch the president it is in truth the hamilton party whereof p is only made the stalking horse the papers have been sent in  read  it is now under debate in both houses whether they shall be published i write in the morning  if determined in the course of the day in favor of publication i will add in the evening a general idea of their character private letters from france by a late vessel which sailed from havre feb   assure us that france classing us in her measures with the swedes  danes has no more notion of declaring war against us than them you will see a letter in baches paper of yesterday which came addressed to me still the fate of spriggs resolutions seems in perfect equilibrio you will see in fenno two numbers of a paper signed marcellus they promise much mischief and are ascribed without any difference of opinion to hamilton you must my dear sir take up your pen against this champion you know the ingenuity of his talents  there is not a person but yourself who can foil him for heavens sake then take up your pen and do not desert the public cause altogether thursday evening the senate have today voted the publication of the communications from our envoys the house of repr decided against the publication by a majority of    to    the senate adjourned over tomorrow good friday     to saturday morning but as the papers cannot be printed within that time perhaps the vote of the h of r may induce the senate to reconsider theirs for this reason i think it my duty to be silent on them adieu thomas jefferson apr      philadelphia james monroe to james monroe mon mss  philadelphia apr      i wrote you last on the   st of mar since which yours of the   th of march is received yesterday i had a consultation with mr dawson on the matter respecting skipwith we have neither of us the least hesitation on a view of the ground to pronounce against your coming forward in it at all your name would be the watchword of party at this moment and the question would give opportunities of slander personal hatred and injustice the effect of which on the justice of the case cannot be calculated let it therefore come forward in skipwiths name without your appearing even to know of it but is it not a case which the auditor can decide if it is that tribunal must be first resorted to i do not think scipio worth your notice he has not been noticed here but by those who were already determined your narrative and letters wherever they are read produce irresistable conviction and cannot be attacked but by a contradiction of facts on which they do not venture finding you unassailable in that quarter i have reason to believe they are preparing a batch of small stuff such as refusing to drink genl washingtons health speaking ill of him  00  the government withdrawing civilities from those attached to him countenancing paine to which they add connivance at the equipment of privateers by americans i am told some sort of an attack is preparing founded on the depositions of   or   americans we are therefore of opinion here that dr edwards certificate which he will give very fully should not be published but reserved to repel these slanders adding to it such others as the nature of them may call for mr dawson thinks he can easily settle the disagreeable business with m the difficulty  delicacy will be with g he is to open the matter to them to day and will write to you this evening it is really a most afflicting consideration that it is impossible for a man to act in any office for the public without encountering a persecution which even his retirement will not withdraw him from at this moment my name is running through all the city as detected in a criminal correspondence with the french directory  fixed upon me by the documents from our envoys now before the two houses the detection of this by the publication of the papers should they be published will not relieve all the effects of the lie and should they not be published they may keep it up as long and as successfully as they did and do that of my being involved in blounts conspiracy the question for the publication of the communications from our envoys is now under consideration in both houses but if published you cannot get them till another post the event of mr spriggs resolutions is extremely doubtful the first one now under consideration to wit  0  that it is not expedient to resort to war will perhaps be carried or rejected by a majority of   or   only consequently it is impossible previously to say how it will be all warmeasures debtors of our country will follow the fortunes of that resolution measures for internal defence will be agreed to letters from france by a vessel which left havre feb   express the greatest certainty that the french government classing us in all her measures with denmark  sweden has no more idea of declaring war against us than against them consequently it rests with ourselves present my best respects to mrs monroe  accept yourself friendly salutations  adieux p s i will hereafter seal my letters with wax  the same seal pay attention if you please to the state of the impression thomas jefferson apr      james madison to james madison mad mss  apr      so much of the communications from our envoys has got abroad  so partially that there can now be no ground for reconsideration with the senate i may therefore consistently with duty do what every member of the body is doing still i would rather you would use the communication with reserve till you see the whole papers the first impressions from them are very disagreeable  confused reflection however  analysis resolves them into this mr as speech to congress in may is deemed such a national  0  affront that no explanation on other topics can be entered on till that as a preliminary is wiped away by humiliating disavowals or acknolegments this working hard with our envoys  indeed seeming impracticable for want of that sort of authority submission to a heavy amercement upwards of a million sterl was at an after meeting suggested as an alternative which might be admitted if proposed by us these overtures had been through informal agents and both the alternatives bringing the envoys to their ne plus they resolve to have no more communication through inofficial characters but to address a letter directly to the government to bring forward their pretensions this letter had not yet however been prepared there were interwoven with these overtures some base propositions on the part of taleyrand through one of his agents to sell his interest  influence with the directory towards smoothing difficulties with them in consideration of a large sum  0000 £ sterl and the arguments to which his agent resorted to induce compliance with this demand were very unworthy of a great nation could they be imputed to them and calculated to excite disgust  indignation in americans generally and alienation in the republicans particularly whom they so far mistake as to presume an attachment to france and hatred to the federal party  not the love of their country to be their first passion no difficulty was expressed towards an adjustment of all differences  misunderstandings or even ultimately a paiment for spoliations if the insult from our executive should be first wiped  0  away observe that i state all this from only a single hearing of the papers  therefore it may not be rigorously correct the little slanderous imputation before mentioned has been the bait which hurried the opposite party into this publication the first impressions with the people will be disagreeable but the last  permanent one will be that the speech in may is now the only obstacle to accommodation and the real cause of war if war takes place and how much will be added to this by the speech of november is yet to be learnt it is evident however on reflection that these papers do not offer one motive the more for our going to war yet such is their effect on the minds of wavering characters that i fear that to wipe off the imputation of being french partisans they will go over to the war measures so furiously pushed by the other party it seems indeed as if they were afraid they should not be able to get into war till great britain will be blown up and the prudence of our countrymen from that circumstance have influence enough to prevent it the most artful misrepresentations of the contents of these papers were published yesterday  produced such a shock on the republican mind as has never been seen since our independence we are to dread the effects of this dismay till their fuller information adieu p m evening papers have come out since writing the above i therefore inclose them be so good as to return browns by post as i keep his set here the representatives are still unfaithful  0  thomas jefferson apr       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia apr       i wrote you two letters on the  th inst since which i have recd yours of the  d i send you in a separate package the instructions to our envoys  their communications you will find that my representation of their contents from memory was substantially just the public mind appears still in a state of astonishment there never was a moment in which the aid of an able pen was so important to place things in their just attitude on this depend the inchoate movement in the eastern mind and the fate of the elections in that quarter now beginning  to continue through the summer i would not propose to you such a task on any ordinary occasion but be assured that a welldigested analysis of these papers would now decide the future turn of things which are at this moment on the creen the merchants here are meeting under the auspices of fitzsimmons to address the president  approve his propositions nothing will be spared on that side spriggs first resolution against the expediency of war proper at the time it was moved is now postponed as improper because to declare that after we have understood it has been proposed to us to buy peace would imply an acquiescence under that proposition all therefore which the advocates of peace can now attempt is to prevent war measures externally consenting to every rational measure of internal defence  preparation great expences will be incurred  it will be left to those whose measures render them necessary to provide to meet them  0  they already talk of stopping all paiments of interest  of a land tax these will probably not be opposed the only question will be how to modify the land tax on this there may be great diversity of sentiment one party will want to make it a new source of patronage  expence if this business is taken up it will lengthen our session we had pretty generally till now fixed on the beginning of may for adjournment i shall return by my usual routes  not by the eastern shore on account of the advance of the season friendly salutations to mrs madison  yourself adieu thomas jefferson apr       philadelphia peter carr to peter carr j mss  philadelphia apr       as the instructions to our envoys  their communications have excited a great deal of curiosity i enclose you a copy you will perceive that they have been assailed by swindlers whether with or without the participation of taleyrand is not very apparent the known corruption of his character renders it very possible he may have intended to share largely in the  0000£ demanded but that the directory knew anything of it is neither proved nor probable on the contrary when the portuguese ambassador yielded to like attempts of swindlers the conduct of the directory in imprisoning him for an attempt at corruption as well as their general conduct really magnanimous places them above suspicion it is pretty evident that mr as  0  speech is in truth the only obstacle to negociation that humiliating disavowals of that are demanded as a preliminary or as a commutation for that a heavy sum of money about a million sterling this obstacle removed they seem not to object to an arrangement of all differences and even to settle  acknolege themselves debtors for spoliations nor does it seem that negociation is at an end as the ps message says but that it is in its commencement only the instructions comply with the wishes expressed in debate in the may session to place france on as good footing as england  not to make a sine qua non of the indemnification for spoliation but they declare the war in which france is engaged is not a defensive one they reject the naturalization of french ships that is to say the exchange of naturalization which france had formerly proposed to us  which would lay open to us the unrestrained trade of her west indies  all her other possessions they declare the  0th article of the british treaty against sequestering debts money in the funds bank stock c to be founded in morality  therefore of perpetual obligation  some other heterodoxes you will have seen in the newspapers some resolutions proposed by mr sprigg the first of which was that it is inexpedient under existing circumstances to resort to war with france whether this could have been carried before is doubtful but since it is known that a sum of money has been demanded it is thought this resolution were it now to be passed would imply a willingness to avoid war even by purchasing peace it is therefore postponed the peace party will  0  agree to all reasonable measures of internal defence but oppose all external preparations tho it is evident that these communications do not present one motive the more for going to war yet it may be doubted whether we are now strong enough to keep within the defensive line it is thought the expences contemplated will render a land tax necessary before we separate if so it will lengthen the session the first impressions from these communications are disagreeable but their ultimate effect on the public mind will not be favorable to the war party they may have some effect in the first moment in stopping the movement in the eastern states which were on the creen  were running into town meetings yet it is believed this will be momentary only and will be over before their elections considerable expectations were formed of changes in the eastern delegations favorable to the whig interest present my best respects to mrs carr  accept yourself assurance of affectionate esteem thomas jefferson april       james monroe to james monroe mon mss  april       i wrote you on the  th inst and on the   th i enclosed you a copy of the instructions  communications from our envoys in that of the  th i acknoleged the receipt of your last at hand of mar    the impressions first made by those communications continue strong  prejudicial here they have enabled the merchants to get a warpetition  0  very extensively signed they have also carried over to the warparty most of the waverers in the h of r this circumstance with the departure of   southern members  others going have given a strong majority to the other party the expences will probably bring them up but in the mean time great  dangerous follies will have been committed a salttax landtax  stoppage of interest on the public debt are the resources spoken of for procuring from   to   millions of dollars of preparatory expence i think it probable that france instead of declaring war will worry us with decrees a new one is proposed making neutral armed ships good prize such measures and the bottom of our purse which we shall get to even by the expences of preparation will still prevent serious war bankruptcy is a terrible foundation to begin a war on against the conquerors of the universe a governor secretary    judges are named for the missisipi territory of these two are agents for the land companies   are bankrupt speculators  the other unknown your matter with morris is well settled with respect to your accounts mr dawson will inclose you the difficulties objected by the department of state considering how much better items of an account can be explained vivâ voce how much more impressive personal remonstrance is than written we have imagined you will think it adviseable to come on yourself and have these matters settled or at least to narrow them down to a few articles as to which you may take measures from hence to procure vouchers from europe if necessary but of this you alone are the  0  competent judge present my affectionate salutations to mrs monroe friendly adieux to yourself p s wheat  flour not saleable at this moment tobacco old d   0  likely to rise thomas jefferson apr       james madison to james madison mad mss  apr       i wrote you last on the   th  then acknoleged your last at hand of the  d inst the sensations first occasioned by the late publications have been kept up and increased at this place a petition from the merchants  traders  others was so industriously pushed as to have obtained a very extensive signature the same measure is pursuing in new york as the election of their governor comes on next tuesday these impressions will just be in time to affect that we have no information yet of their effect to the eastward in the meantime petitions to congress against arming from the towns of massachusetts were multiplying they will no doubt have been immediately checked the ps answer to the address of the merchants here you will see in fenno of yesterday it is a pretty strong declaration that a neutral  pacific conduct on our part is no longer the existing state of things the vibraters in the h of r have chiefly gone over to the war party still if our members were all here it is believed the navalbill would be thrown out giles clopton  cabell are gone the debate began yesterday  tho the question will be lost the effect on the public mind   0 will be victory for certainly there is nothing new which may render war more palatable to the people on the contrary the warmembers themselves are becoming alarmed at the expences  whittling down the estimates to the lowest sums you will see by a report of the secretary at war which i inclose you that he estimates the expences of preparation at seven millions of dollars which it is proposed to lower to about   millions if it can be reduced to this a stoppage of public interest will suffice  is the project of some this idea has already knocked down the public paper which can no longer be sold at all if the expences should exceed   m they will undertake a land tax indeed a land tax is the decided resource of many perhaps of a majority there is an idea of some of the connecticut members to raise the whole money wanted by a tax on salt so much do they dread a land tax the middle or last of may is still counted on for adjournment colo innes is just arrived here heavily laden with gout  dropsy it is scarcely thought he can ever get home again the principles likely to be adopted by that board have thrown the administration into deep alarm it is admitted they will be worse than the english french  algerine depredations added together it is even suggested that if persevered in their proceedings will be stopped these things are not public—your letter by occasioning my recurrence to the constitution has corrected an error under which a former one of mine had been written i had erroneously conceived that the declaration of war was among the things confided by the constitution     to two thirds of the legislature we are told here that you are probably elected to the state legislature it has given great joy as we know your presence will be felt any where and the times do not admit of the inactivity of such talents as yours i hope therefore it is true as much good may be done by a proper direction of the local force present my friendly salutations to mrs madison  to yourself affectionately adieu thomas jefferson april         philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia april         dear sir—    the bill for the naval armament    vessels passed by a majority of about   to   in the h of r all restrictions on the objects for which the vessels should be used were struck out the bill for establishing a department of secretary of the navy was tried yesterday on its passage to the  d reading  prevailed by    against    it will be read the  d time today the provisional army of  0000 men will meet some difficulty it would surely be rejected if our members were all here giles clopton cabell  nicholas are gone  clay goes tomorrow he received here news of the death of his wife parker is completely gone over to the war party in this state of things they will carry what they please one of the war party in a fit of unguarded passion declared some time ago they would pass a citizen bill an alien bill  a sedition bill accordingly some days ago coit laid a motion on the table of the h of r for modifying the citizen     law their threats point at gallatin  it is believed they will endeavor to reach him by this bill yesterday mr hillhouse laid on the table of the senate a motion for giving power to send away suspected aliens this is understood to be meant for volney  collot but it will not stop there when it gets into a course of execution there is now only wanting to accomplish the whole declaration before mentioned a sedition bill which we shall certainly soon see proposed the object of that is the suppression of the whig presses baches has been particularly named that paper  also carys totter for want of subscriptions we should really exert ourselves to procure them for if these papers fall republicanism will be entirely brow beaten carys paper comes out   times a week    d the meeting of the people which was called at new york did nothing it was found that the majority would be against the address they therefore chose to circulate it individually the committee of ways  means have voted a land tax an additional tax on salt will certainly be proposed in the house and probably prevail to some degree the stoppage of interest on the public debt will also perhaps be proposed but not with effect in the meantime that paper cannot be sold hamilton is coming on as senator from n y there has been so much contrivance  combination in that as to shew there is some great object in hand troup the district judge of n y resigns towards the close of the session of their assembly the appointment of mr hobart then senator to succeed troup is not made     by the president till after the assembly had risen otherwise they would have chosen the senator in place of hobart jay then names hamilton senator but not till a day or two before his own election as governor was to come on lest the unpopularity of the nomination should be in time to affect his own election we shall see in what all this is to end but surely in something the popular movement in the eastern states is checked as we expected and war addresses are showering in from new jersey  the great trading towns however we still trust that a nearer view of war  a land tax will oblige the great mass of the people to attend at present the war hawks talk of septembrizing deportation and the examples for quelling sedition set by the french executive all the firmness of the human mind is now in a state of requisition salutations to mrs madison  to yourself friendship  adieu p m the bill for the naval department is passed thomas jefferson may      philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia may      i wrote you last on the   th since which yours of the   d of april is received acknoleging mine of the   th so that all appear to have been received to that date the spirit kindled up in the towns is wonderful these and n jersey are pouring in their addresses offering life  fortune even these addresses are not the worst things for indiscreet declarations and expressions of passion may be     pardoned to a multitude acting from the impulse of the moment but we cannot expect a foreign nation to shew that apathy to the answers of the president which are more thrasonic than the addresses whatever chance for peace might have been left us after the publication of the despatches is compleatly lost by these answers nor is it france alone but his own fellow citizens against whom his threats are uttered in fenno of yesterday you will see one wherein he says to the address from newark the delusions  misrepresentations which have misled so many citizens must be discountenanced by authority as well as by the citizens at large evidently alluding to those letters from the representatives to their constituents which they have been in the habit of seeking after  publishing while those sent by the tory part of the house to their constituents are ten times more numerous  replete with the most atrocious falsehoods  calumnies what new law they will propose on this subject has not yet leaked out the citizen bill sleeps the alien bill proposed by the senate has not yet been brought in that proposed by the h of r has been so moderated that it will not answer the passionate purposes of the war gentlemen whether therefore the senate will push their bolder plan i know not the provisional army does not go down so smoothly in the r as it did in the senate they are whittling away some of its choice ingredients particularly that of transferring their own constitutional discretion over the raising of armies to the president a commtee of the r have struck out his discretion and hang the raising of the     men on the contingencies of invasion insurrection or declaration of war were all our members here the bill would not pass but it will probably as the house now is its expence is differently estimated from   to   millions of dollars a year their purposes before voted require   millions above all the other taxes which therefore are voted to be raised on lands houses  slaves the provisional army will be additional to this the threatening appearances from the alien bills have so alarmed the french who are among us that they are going off a ship chartered by themselves for this purpose will sail within about a fortnight for france with as many as she can carry among these i believe will be volney who has in truth been the principal object aimed at by the law notwithstanding the unfavorableness of the late impressions it is believed the new york elections which are over will give us two or three republicans more than we now have but it is supposed jay is reelected it is said hamilton declines coming to the senate he very soon stopped his marcellus it was rather the sequel that was feared than what actually appeared he comes out on a different plan in his titus manlius if that be really his the appointments to the missisipi territory were so abominable that the senate could not swallow them they referred them to a commte to inquire into characters and the p withdrew the nomination  has now named winthrop sergeant governor steele of augusta in virginia secretary tilton  — two of the judges the other not yet named    as there is nothing material now     to be proposed we generally expect to rise in about three weeks however i do not yet venture to order my horses my respectful salutations to mrs madison to yourself affectionate friendship  adieu perhaps the prs expression before quoted may look to the sedition bill which has been spoken of and which may be meant to put the printing presses under the imprimatur of the executive bache is thought a main object of it cabot of massachusetts is appointed secretary of the navy it is said hamilton declines coming to the senate thomas jefferson may        philadelphia james lewis junior to james lewis junior j mss  philadelphia may        dear sir— i am much obliged by your friendly letter of the  th inst as soon as i saw the first of mr martins letters i turned to the newspapers of the day  found logans speech as translated by a common indian interpreter the version i had used had been made by genl gibson finding from mr martins style that his object was not merely truth but to gratify party passions i never read another of his letters i determined to do my duty by searching into the truth  publishing it to the world whatever it should be this i shall do at a proper season i am much indebted to many persons who without any acquaintance with me have voluntarily sent me information on the subject party passions are indeed high nobody has more reason to know it than     myself i receive daily bitter proofs of it from people who never saw me nor know anything of me but through porcupine  fenno at this moment all the passions are boiling over and one who keeps himself cool and clear of the contagion is so far below the point of ordinary conversation that he finds himself insulated in every society however the fever will not last war land tax  stamp tax are sedatives which must calm its ardor they will bring on reflection and that with information is all which our countrymen need to bring themselves and their affairs to rights they are essentially republican they retain unadulterated the principles of    and those who are conscious of no change in themselves have nothing to fear in the long run it is our duty still to endeavor to avoid war but if it shall actually take place no matter by whom brought on we must defend ourselves if our house be on fire without inquiring whether it was fired from within or without we must try to extinguish it in that i have no doubt we shall act as one man but if we can ward off actual war till the crisis of england is over i shall hope we may escape it altogether i am with much esteem dear sir your most obedient humble servant thomas jefferson may  0    james madison to james madison mad mss  may  0       no bill has passed since my last the alien bill now before the senate you will see in bache i shall make no comment on it the first clause was     debated through the whole of tuesday to judge from that we cannot expect above   or   votes against it we suppose the lower house will throw it out  proceed on that which they have prepared the bill for the provision of army is under debate it will probably pass or be rejected by a very minute majority if our members were here it would be rejected with ease the tax on lands slaves  houses is proceeding the questions on that will only be of modification the event of the n york elections is not yet absolutely known but it is still believed we have gained   more republicans to congress burr was here a day or two ago he says they have got a decided majority of whigs in their state h of r he thinks that connecticut has chosen one whig a mr granger  calculates much on the effect of his election an election here of town officers for southwark where it was said the people had entirely gone over to the tory side showed them unmoved the whig ticket was carried by ten to one the informations are so different as to the effect of the late dispatches on the people here that one does not know what to conclude but i am of opinion they are little moved some of the young men who addressed the president on monday mounted the black or english cockade the next day numbers of the people appeared with the tricolored or french cockade yesterday being the fast day the black cockade again appeared on which the tricolour also showed itself a fray ensued the light horse were called in  the city was so filled with confusion from about   to  0 oclock last night that it was dangerous     going out i write in the morning  therefore know nothing of the particulars as yet but as i do not send my letter to the post office till night i shall probably be able by that time to add some details it is also possible some question may be taken which may indicate the fate of the provisional army there is a report which comes from baltimore of peace between france  england on terms entirely dictated by the former but we do not hear how it comes nor pay the least attention to it p m by the proceedings in senate today i conclude the alien bill will pass    to  the provisional army has been under debate in the lower house a motion was made to strike out the first section confessedly for the purpose of trying the fate of the bill the motion was lost by    to    had all the members in town been present  the question in the house instead of the committee the vote would have been    against the bill     for it no further particulars about the riot appear

time the  st volunteer clause has been carried by a great majority but endeavours will be made to render it less destructive  less injurious to the militia i shall enclose you a copy of the landtax bill in the first moments of the tumult here mentioned in my last the cockade assumed by one party was mistaken to be the tricolor it was the old blue  red adopted in some places in an early part of the revolution war however it is laid aside but the black is still frequent i am a little apprehensive burr will have miscalculated on grangers election in connecticut however it is not yet known here it was expected hillhouse would have been elected their lt govr but treadwell is chosen we know nothing more certain yet of the new york elections hamilton declined his appointment as senator  jay has named north a quondam aid of steuben all sorts of artifices have been descended to to agitate the popular mind the president received   anonymous letters written probably by some of the war men announcing plots to burn the city on the fastday he thought them worth being known  great preparations were proposed by the way of caution  some were yielded to by the governor many weak people packed their most valuable movables to be ready for transportation however the day passed without justifying the alarms other idle stories have been since circulated  the popular     mind has not been proof against them the addresses  answers go on some parts of maryland  of this state are following the example of n jersey the addresses are probably written here those which come purely from the country are merely against the french those written here are pointed with acrimony to party you will observe one answer in which a most unjustifiable mention has been made of monroe without the least occasion leading to it from the address it is now openly avowed by some of the eastern men that congress ought not to separate and their reasons are drawn from circumstances which will exist through the year i was in hopes that all efforts to render the sessions of congress permanent were abandoned but a clear profit of   or   dollars a day is sufficient to reconcile some to their absence from home a french

this being merely a letter of business i shall only add assurances of the esteem  respect with which i am dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant      thomas jefferson may         philadelphia james monroe to james monroe j mss  philadelphia may         yours of apr       may       have been received in due time i have not written to you since the   th ult because i knew you would be out     on a circuit and would receive the letters only when they would be as old almanacs the bill for the provisional army has got through the lower house the regulars reduced to  0000 and the volunteers unlimited it was carried by a majority of    the     landtax is now on the carpet to raise   millions of dollars yet i think they must at least double it as the expenses of the provisional army were not provided for in it and will require of itself   millions a year i presume therefore the tax on lands houses  negroes will be a dollar a head on the population of each state there are alien bills sedition bills c also before both houses the severity of their aspect determines a great number of french to go off a shipload sails on monday next among them volney if no new business is brought on i think they may get through the tax bill in   weeks you will have seen among numerous addresses  answers one from lancaster in this state and its answer the latter travelling out of the topics of the address altogether to mention you in a most injurious manner your feelings have no doubt been much irritated by it as in truth it had all the characters necessary to produce irritation what notice you should take of it is difficult to say but there is one step in which two or three with whom i have spoken concur with me that feeble as the hand is from which this shaft is thrown yet with a great mass of our citizens strangers to the leading traits of the character from which it came it will have considerable effect  that in order to replace yourself on the high ground you are entitled to it is absolutely necessary you should reappear on the public theatre and take an independent stand from which you can be seen  known to your fellow citizens the he of repr appears the only place which can answer this end as the proceedings of the other house are     too obscure cabell has said he would give way to you whenever you should chuse to come in and i really think it would be expedient for yourself as well as the public that you should not wait until another election but come to the next session no interval should be admitted between this last attack of enmity and your reappearance with the approving voice of your constituents  your taking a commanding attitude i have not before been anxious for your return to public life lest it should interfere with a proper pursuit of your private interests but the next session will not at all interfere with your courts because it must end mar   and i verily believe the next election will give us such a majority in the he of r as to enable the republican party to shorten the alternate unlimited session as it is evident that to shorten the sessions is to lessen the evils  burthens of the government on our country the present session has already cost  00000 d besides the wounds it has inflicted on the prosperity of the union i have no doubt cabell can be induced to retire immediately  that a writ may be issued at once the very idea of this will strike the public mind  raise its confidence in you if this be done i should think it best you should take no notice at all of the answer to lancaster because were you to shew a personal hostility against the answer it would deaden the effect of everything you should say or do in your public place hereafter all would be ascribed to an enmity to mr a and you know with what facility such insinuations enter the minds of men i have not seen dawson since this answer     has appeared  therefore have not yet learnt his sentiments on it my respectful salutations to mrs monroe  to yourself affectionately adieu p s always examine the seal before you open my letters  thomas jefferson may       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia may       i wrote to you last on the   th since which yours of the  0th is received i must begin by correcting two errors in my last it was false arithmetic to say that two measures therein mentioned to be carried by majorities of    would have failed if the    absentees wherein a majority of   was ours had been present six coming over from the other side would have turned the scale and this was the idea floating in my mind which produced the mistake the  d error was in the version of mr as expression which i stated to you his real expression was that he would not unbrace a single nerve for any treaty france could offer such was their entire want of faith morality c the bill from the senate for capturing french armed vessels found hovering on our coast was passed in two days by the lower house without a single alteration and the ganges a  0gun sloop fell down the river instantly to go on a cruise she has since been ordered to new york to convoy a vessel from that to this port the alien bill will be ready to day probably for its  d reading in the     senate it has been considerably mollified particularly by a proviso saving the rights of treaties still it is a most detestable thing i was glad in yesterdays discussion to hear it admitted on all hands that laws of the u s subsequent to a treaty controul its operation and that the legislature is the only power which can controul a treaty both points are sound beyond doubt this bill will unquestionably pass the he of r the majority there being decisive consolidated and bold enough to do anything i have no doubt from the hints dropped they will pass a bill to declare the french treaty void i question if they will think a declaration of war prudent as it might alarm and all its effects are answered by the act authorizing captures a bill is brought in for suspending all communication with the dominions of france which will no doubt pass it is suspected they mean to borrow money of individuals in london on the credit of our land tax  perhaps the guarantee of gt britain the land tax was yesterday debated and a majority of   struck out the   th section of the classification of houses and taxing them by a different scale from the lands instead of this is to be proposed a valuation of the houses  lands together macon yesterday laid a motion on the table for adjourning on the   th some think they do not mean to adjourn others that they wait first the return of the envoys for whom it is now avowed the brig sophia was sent it is expected she would bring them off about the middle of this month they may therefore be expected here about the  d week of july     whatever be their decision as to adjournment i think it probable my next letter will convey orders for my horses and that i shall leave this place from the  0th to the   th of june for i have no expectation they will actually adjourn sooner volney  a shipload of others sail on sunday next another shipload will go off in about   weeks it is natural to expect they go under irritations calculated to fan the flame not so volney he is most thoroughly impressed with the importance of preventing war whether considered with reference to the interests of the two countries of the cause of republicanism or of man on the broad scale but an eagerness to render this prevention impossible leaves me without any hope some of those who have insisted that it was long since war on the part of france are candid enough to admit that it is now begun on our part also i enclose for your perusal a poem on the alien bill written by mr marshall i do this as well for your amusement as to get you to take care of this copy for me till i return for it will be lost by lending if i retain it here as the publication was suppressed after the sale of a few copies of which i was fortunate enough to get one your locks hinges c shall be immediately attended to my respectful salutations  friendship to mrs madison to the family  to yourself adieu p s the president it is said has refused an exequatur to the consul general of france dupont p p s this fact is true i have it this moment from dupont and he goes off with volney to france in two or three days   0 thomas jefferson june        philadelphia john taylor to john taylor  ed of       philadelphia june           mr new showed me your letter on the subject of the patent which gave me an opportunity of observing what you said as to the effect with you of public proceedings and that it was not unwise now to estimate the separate mass of virginia and north carolina with a view to their separate existence it is true that we are completely under the saddle of massachusetts and connecticut and that they ride us very hard cruelly insulting our feelings as well as exhausting our strength and subsistence their natural friends the three other eastern states join them from a sort of family pride and they have the art to divide certain other parts of the union so as to make use of them to govern the whole this is not new it is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep the rest in order and those who have once got an ascendancy and possessed themselves of all the resources of the nation their revenues and offices have immense means for retaining their advantage but our present situation     is not a natural one the republicans through every part of the union say that it was the irresistible influence and popularity of general washington played off by the cunning of hamilton which turned the government over to antirepublican hands or turned the republicans chosen by the people into antirepublicans he delivered it over to his successor in this state and very untoward events since improved with great artifice have produced on the public mind the impressions we see but still i repeat it this is not the natural state time alone would bring round an order of things more correspondent to the sentiments of our constituents but are there no events impending which will do it within a few months the crisis with england the public and authentic avowal of sentiments hostile to the leading principles of our constitution the prospect of a war in which we shall stand alone land tax stamp tax increase of public debt c be this as it may in every free and deliberating society there must from the nature of man be opposite parties and violent dissensions and discords and one of these for the most part must prevail over the other for a longer or shorter time perhaps this party division is necessary to induce each to watch and delate to the people the proceedings of the other but if on a temporary superiority of the one party the other is to resort to a scission of the union no federal government can ever exist if to rid ourselves of the present rule of massachusetts and connecticut we break the union will the evil stop there suppose the new     england states alone cut off will our nature be changed are we not men still to the south of that and with all the passions of men immediately we shall see a pennsylvania and a virginia party arise in the residuary confederacy and the public mind will be distracted with the same party spirit what a game too will the one party have in their hands by eternally threatening the other that unless they do so and so they will join their northern neighbors if we reduce our union to virginia and north carolina immediately the conflict will be established between the representatives of these two states and they will end by breaking into their simple units seeing therefore that an association of men who will not quarrel with one another is a thing which never yet existed from the greatest confederacy of nations down to a town meeting or a vestry seeing that we must have somebody to quarrel with i had rather keep our new england associates for that purpose than to see our bickerings transferred to others they are circumscribed within such narrow limits and their population so full that their numbers will ever be the minority and they are marked like the jews with such a perversity of character as to constitute from that circumstance the natural division of our parties a little patience and we shall see the reign of witches pass over their spells dissolved and the people recovering their true sight restoring their government to its true principles it is true that in the meantime we are suffering deeply in spirit and incurring the horrors of a war and long oppressions of enormous     public debt but who can say what would be the evils of a scission and when and where they would end better keep together as we are haul off from europe as soon as we can and from all attachments to any portions of it and if they show their power just sufficiently to hoop us together it will be the happiest situation in which we can exist if the game runs sometimes against us at home we must have patience till luck turns and then we shall have an opportunity of winning back the principles we have lost for this is a game where principles are the stake better luck therefore to us all and health happiness and friendly salutations to yourself adieu p s it is hardly necessary to caution you to let nothing of mine get before the public a single sentence got hold of by the porcupines will suffice to abuse and persecute me in their papers for months thomas jefferson june      philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia june      i wrote you last on the   st since which yours of the   th of may is received the alien bill when we had nearly got through it on the  d reading on a report from the committee of the whole was referred to a special committee by a vote of its friends    against    who thought it could be rejected on the question for the  d reading it is reported again very much softened and if the proviso can be added to it saving treaties it will be less objectionable than     i thought it possible to have obtained still it would place aliens not protected by treaties illegible absolute government they have brought into the lower house a sedition bill which among other enormities undertakes to make printing certain matters criminal tho one of the amendments to the constitution has so expressly taken religion printing presses c out of their coercion indeed this bill  the alien bill both are so palpably in the teeth of the constitution as to shew they mean to pay no respect to it the citizen bill passed by the lower house sleeps in a committee of the senate in the mean time callendar a principal object of it has eluded it by getting himself made a citizen volney is gone so is dupont the rejected consul the bill suspending intercourse with the french dominions will pass the senate today with a small amendment the real object of this bill is to evade the counterirritations of the english who under the late orders for taking all vessels from french ports are now taking as many of our vessels as the french by forbidding our vessels to go to or from french ports we remove the pabulum for these violations of our rights by the english undertaking to do the work for them ourselves in another way the tax on lands houses  slaves is still before the h of r they have determined to have the houses  lands valued separately though to pay the same tax ad valorem but they avow that when they shall have got at the number  value of houses they shall be free hereafter to tax houses separately as by an indirect tax this is to avoid the quotaing of which     they cannot bear the idea requeries under a quotaing law can only shift the burthen from one part to another of the same state but relieve them from the bridle of the quota  all requeries go to the relief of the states so odious is the quota to the n e members that many think they will not pass the bill at all the question of adjournment was lost by two votes had our members been here it would have been carried  much mischief prevented i think now they will make their session permanent i have therefore in my letters of today ordered my horses to be at fredsbg on the     shall probably be with you on the   th or   th i send you further communications from our envoys to these i believe i may add on good grounds that pinckney is gone with his family into the south of france for the health of his daughter marshal to amsterdam but whether coming here for instructions or not is a secret not entrusted to us  gerry remains at paris it is rumored  i believe with probability that there is a schism between gerry  his colleagues perhaps the directory may make a treaty with gerry if they can get through it before the brig sophia takes him off she sailed the  st of april it is evident from these communications that our envoys had not the least idea of a war between the two countries much less that their dispatches are the cause of it i mentioned to you in my last that i expected they would bring in a bill to declare the treaty with france void dwight foster yesterday brought in resolutions for that purpose  for authorizing general reprisals on the french armed vessels  such is     their preponderance by the number  talents of our absentees withdrawing from us that they will carry it never was any event so important to this country since its revolution as the issue of the invasion of england with that we shall stand or fall colo joness situation is desperate every day is now expected to be his last the petition for the reform of the british parliament enclosed in your last shall be disposed of as you desire and the first vessel for fredericksburg will carry your locks hinges pulleys  glass my respectful salutations to mrs madison  the family friendship  adieus to yourself thomas jefferson june      philadelphia archibald stuart to archibald stuart  philadelphia june      dear sir— i inclose you some further communications from our envoys at paris to the information contained in these i can add that by the latest accounts mr pinckney was gone into the south of france for the health of his family mr marshall to amsterdam and mr gerry remained at paris it appears that neither themselves nor the french government dreamt of war between the two countries it seems also fairly presumable that the douceur of  0000 guineas mentioned in the former dispatches was merely from x and y as not a word is ever said by taleyrand to our envoys nor by them to him on the subject it is now thought possible that gerry     may be pursuing the treaty for he was always viewed with more favor by the french government than his collegues whom they considered as personally hostile to them it seems they offered to pay in time for unjustifiable spoliations and insist on a present loan and it would be much more than an equivalent there seems nothing to prevent a conclusion unless indeed the bring sophia should arrive too soon  bring him away she sailed from hence the  st of april with positive orders to the envoys to come away in the meantime besides accumulating irritations we are proceeding to actual hostilities you will have seen in the papers the bills already passed and the measures now proposed every thing will be carried which is proposed nobody denies but that france has given just cause of war but so has gr britain  she is now capturing our vessels as much as france but the question was one merely of prudence whether seeing that both powers in order to injure one another bear down every thing in their way without regard to the rights of others spoliating equally danes swedes  americans it would not be more prudent in us to bear with it as the danes  swedes do curtailing our commerce and waiting for the moment of peace when it is probable both nations would for their own interest  honour retribute for their wrongs however the public mind has been artfully inflamed by publications well calculated to deceive them  them only and especially in the towns and irritations have been multiplied so as to shut the door of accomodation and war is now inevitable i imagine that france will do     little with us till she has made her peace with england which whether her invasion succeeds or fails must be made this summer and autumn the game on both sides is too heavy to be continued when she shall turn her arms on us i imagine it will be chiefly against our commerce and fisheries if any thing is attempted by land it will probably be to the westward our great expence will be in equipping a navy to be lost as fast as equipped or to be maintained at an expence which will sink us with itself as the like course is sinking great britain of the two millions of dollars now to be raised by a tax on lands houses  slaves virginia is to furnish between     00000 but this is not more than half of the actual expence if the provisional army be raised nor one tenth of what must be the annual expences i see no way in which we can injure france so as to advance to negociation as we must do in the end on better ground than at present and i believe it will thus appear to our citizens generally as soon as the present fervor cools down and there will be many sedatives to effect this for the present however nothing can be done silence and patience are necessary for a while and i must pray you as to what i now write to take care it does not get out of your own hand nor a breath of it in a newspaper i wrote to mr clarke some time ago mentioning that i had been here for six months advancing for all the nail rods for my nailery without the possibility of receiving any thing from it till my return that this will render it necessary to receive immediately on my return whatever sums my customers     may have in hand for me i yesterday received a letter from him informing me he had left staunton  with our approbation had turned over my matters to a mr john mcdowell as i am not acquainted with him nor as yet in correspondence with him will you be so good as to mention to him that i shall have great need of whatever sum he may have on hand for me as soon as i return and should be very glad if he could lodge it with colo bell by our july court at which i shall be or if no conveyance occurs he can send me a line by post to charlottesville informing me what sum i can count on his future orders for nails i shall be able to attend to in person i leave this for monticello on the  0th inst the adjournment of congress is not yet fixed thomas jefferson june       philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss  philadelphia june       yours of the  0th inst is received i expected mine of the   th would have been my last from hence as i had proposed to have set out on the  0th but on the morning of the   th we heard of the arrival of marshall at new york and i concluded to stay  see whether that circumstance would produce any new projects no doubt he there received more than hints from hamilton as to the tone required to be assumed yet i apprehend he is not hot enough for his friends livingston came with him from new york m told him they had no idea in france of a war with us that taleyrand sent passports to   0 him  pinckney but none for gerry upon this gerry staid without explaining to them the reason he wrote however to the president by marshall who knew nothing of the contents of the letter so that there must have been a previous understanding between taleyrand  gerry m was received here with the utmost eclat the secretary of state  many carriages with all the city cavalry went to frankfort to meet him and on his arrival here in the evening the bells rung till late in the night  immense crowds were collected to see  make part of the shew which was circuitously paraded through the streets before he was set down at the city tavern all this was to secure him to their views that he might say nothing which would expose the game they have been playing since his arrival i can hear of nothing directly from him while they are disseminating through the town things as from him diametrically opposite to what he said to livingston dr logan about a fortnight ago sailed for hamburg tho for a twelvemonth past he had been intending to go to europe as soon as he could get money enough to carry him there yet when he had accomplished this and fixed a time for going he very unwisely made a mystery of it so that his disappearance without notice excited conversation this was seized by the war hawks and given out as a secret mission from the jacobins here to solicit an army from france instruct them as to their landing c this extravagance produced a real panic among the citizens  happening just when bache published taleyrands letter harper on the   th gravely announced     to the he of r that there existed a traitorous correspondence between the jacobins here and the french directory that he had got hold of some threads  clues of it and would soon be able to develop the whole this increased the alarm their libelists immediately set to work directly  indirectly to implicate whom they pleased porcupine gave me a principal share in it as i am told for i never read his papers this state of things added to my reasons for not departing at the time i intended these follies seem to have died away in some degree already perhaps i may renew my purpose by the   th their system is professedly to keep up an alarm tracy at the meeting of the joint committee for adjournment declared it necessary for congress to stay together to keep up the inflammation of the public mind and otis expressed a similar sentiment since however they will adjourn the opposers of adjournment in senate yesterday agreed to adjourn on the  0th of july but i think the  st of july will be carried that is one of the objects which detains myself as well as one or two more of the senate who had got leave of absence i imagine it will be decided tomorrow or next day to separate congress now will be withdrawing the fire from under a boiling pot your commissions here are all in readiness but no vessel for fredericksburg has yet occurred my respectful salutations to mrs madison  the family  cordial friendship to yourself p m a message to both houses this day from the prt with the following communications     mar    pickerings letter to the envoys directing them if they are not actually engaged in negociation with authorized persons or not conducted bona fide  not merely for procrastination to break up  come home and at any rate to consent to no loan apr   talleyrand to gerry he supposes the other two gentlemen perceiving that their known principles are an obstacle to negociation will leave the republic and proposing to renew the negociations with gerry immediately apr   gerry to talleyrand disclaims a power to conclude anything separately can only confer informally  as an unaccredited individual reserving to lay everything before the government of the u s for approbation apr    gerry to the president he communicates the preceding and hopes the president will send other persons instead of his collegues  himself if it shall appear that anything can be done the presidents message says that as the instructions were not to consent to any loan he considers the negociation as at an end and that he will never send another minister to france until he shall be assured that he will be received and treated with the respect due to a great powerful free  independent nation a bill is brought into the senate this day to declare the treaties with france void prefaced by a list of grievances in the style of a manifesto it passed to the  d reading by    to       a bill for punishing forgeries of bank paper passed to the  d reading by    to   three of the    laurence bingham  read bank directors thomas jefferson aug       monticello samuel smith to samuel smith j mss  monticello aug       dear sir— your favor of aug   came to hand by our last post together with the extract of a letter from a gentleman of philadelphia dated july  0 cut from a newspaper stating some facts which respect me i shall notice these facts the writer says that the day after the last despatches were communicated to congress bache leib c and a dr reynolds were closeted with me if the receipt of visits in my public room the door continuing free to every one who should call at the same time may be called closeting then it is true that i was closeted with every person who visited me in no other sense is it true as to any person i sometimes received visits from mr bache  dr leib i received them always with pleasure because they are men of abilities and of principles the most friendly to liberty  our present form of government mr bache has another claim on my respect as being the grandson of dr franklin the greatest man  ornament of the age and country in which he lived whether i was visited by mr bache or dr leib the day after the communication referred to i do not remember i know that all my motions at philadelphia here and everywhere are watched      recorded some of these spies therefore may remember better than i do the dates of these visits if they say these two gentlemen visited me on the day after the communications as their trade proves their accuracy i shall not contradict them tho i affirm that i do not recollect it however as to dr reynolds i can be more particular because i never saw him but once which was on an introductory visit he was so kind as to pay me this i well remember was before the communication alluded to  that during the short conversation i had with him not one word was said on the subject of any of the communications not that i should not have spoken freely on their subject to dr reynolds as i should also have done to the letter writer or to any other person who should have introduced the subject i know my own principles to be pure  therefore am not ashamed of them on the contrary i wish them known  therefore willingly express them to every one they are the same i have acted on from the year      to this day and are the same i am sure with those of the great body of the american people i only wish the real principles of those who censure mine were also known but warring against those of the people the delusion of the people is necessary to the dominant party i see the extent to which that delusion has been already carried and i see there is no length to which it may not be pushed by a party in possession of the revenues  the legal authorities of the u s for a short time indeed but yet long enough to admit much particular mischief there is no event therefore however atrocious     which may not be expected i have contemplated every event which the maratists of the day can perpetrate and am prepared to meet every one in such a way as shall not be derogatory either to the public liberty or my own personal honor the letter writer says i am for peace but it is only with france he has told half the truth he would have told the whole if he had added england i am for peace with both countries i know that both of them have given  are daily giving sufficient cause of war that in defiance of the laws of nations they are every day trampling on the rights of all the neutral powers whenever they can thereby do the least injury either to the other but as i view a peace between france  england the ensuing winter to be certain i have thought it would have been better for us to continue to bear from france through the present summer what we have been bearing both from her  england these four years and still continue to bear from england and to have required indemnification in the hour of peace when i verily believe it would have been yielded by both this seems to be the plan of the other neutral nations and whether this or the commencing war on one of them as we have done would have been wisest time  events must decide but i am quite at a loss on what ground the letter writer can question the opinion that france had no intention of making war on us  was willing to treat with mr gerry when we have this from taleyrands letter and from the written and verbal information of our envoys it is true then that as with england we might of right     have chosen either peace or war  have chosen peace and prudently in my opinion so with france we might also of right have chosen either peace or war  we have chosen war whether the choice may be a popular one in the other states i know not here it certainly is not  i have no doubt the whole american people will rally ere long to the same sentiment  rejudge those who at present think they have all judgment in their own hands these observations will show you how far the imputations in the paragraph sent me approach the truth yet they are not intended for a newspaper at a very early period of my life i determined never to put a sentence into any newspaper i have religiously adhered to the resolution through my life and have great reason to be contented with it were i to undertake to answer the calumnies of the newspapers it would be more than all my own time  that of  0 aids could effect for while i should be answering one twenty new ones would be invented i have thought it better to trust to the justice of my countrymen that they would judge me by what they see of my conduct on the stage where they have placed me  what they knew of me before the epoch since which a particular party has supposed it might answer some view of theirs to vilify me in the public eye some i know will not reflect how apocryphal is the testimony of enemies so palpably betraying the views with which they give it but this is an injury to which duty requires every one to submit whom the public think proper to call into its councils i thank you my dear sir for the interest you     have taken for me on this occasion though i have made up my mind not to suffer calumny to disturb my tranquillity yet i retain all my sensibilities for the approbation of the good  just that is indeed the chief consolation for the hatred of so many who without the least personal knowledge  on the sacred evidence of porcupine  fenno alone cover me with their implacable hatred the only return i will ever make them will be to do them all the good i can in spite of their teeth i have the pleasure to inform you that all your friends in this quarter are well and to assure you of the sentiments of sincere esteem  respect with which i am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson sep       monticello archibald hamilton rowan to archibald hamilton rowan j mss  monticello sep       sir— to avoid the suspicions  curiosity of the post office which would have been excited by seeing your name and mine on the back of a letter i have delayed acknowleging the receipt of your favor of july last till an occasion to write to an inhabitant of wilmington gives me an opportunity of putting my letter under cover to him the system of alarm  jealousy which has been so powerfully played off in england has been mimicked here not entirely without success the most longsighted politician could not seven years ago have imagined that the people of this wideextended country could have been enveloped in such delusion and made so much afraid of themselves and their own power as to surrender it     spontaneously to those who are manœuvring them into a form of government the principal branches of which may be beyond their control the commerce of england however has spread its roots over the whole face of our country this is a real source of all the obliquities of the public mind and i should have had doubts of the ultimate term they might attain but happily the game to be worth the playing of those engaged in it must flush them with money the authorized expenses of this year are beyond those of any year in the late war for independence  they are of a nature to beget great  constant expenses the purse of the people is the real seat of sensibility it is to be drawn upon largely and they will then listen to truths which could not excite them through any other organ in this state however the delusion has not prevailed they are sufficiently on their guard to have justified the assurance that should you chuse it for your asylum the laws of the land administered by upright judges would protect you from any exercise of power unauthorized by the constitution of the united states the habeas corpus secures every man here alien or citizen against everything which is not law whatever shape it may assume should this or any other circumstance draw your footsteps this way i shall be happy to be among those who may have an opportunity of testifying by every attention in our power the sentiments of esteem  respect which the circumstances of your history have inspired and which are peculiarly felt by sir your most obedient and most humble servant     thomas jefferson oct      monticello wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas  j mss  monticello oct      dr sir— i entirely approve of the confidence you have reposed in mr brackenridge as he possesses mine entirely i had imagined it better those resolutions should have originated with n carolina but perhaps the late changes in their representation may indicate some doubt whether they could have passed in that case it is better they should come from kentucky i understand you intend soon to go as far as mr madisons you know of course i have no secrets from him i wish him therefore to be consulted as to these resolutions the post boy waiting at the door obliges me to finish here with assurances of the esteem of dr sir your friend  servt thomas jefferson oct       monticello stephens thompson mason to stephens thompson mason j mss  monticello oct       dear sir— i received lately a letter from mr callendar to which the inclosed is an answer after perusing it be so good to stick a wafer in it and after it is dry deliver it you will perceive that i propose to you the trouble of drawing for  0 d for mr callendar on my correspondent in richmond george jefferson merchant this is to keep his name out of sight make your draught if you please in some

such a draught from you without mentioning to him the purpose i have to thank you for your favor of july   from philadelphia i did not immediately acknolege it because i knew you would be come away the x y z fever has considerably abated through the country as i am informed and the alien  sedition laws are working hard i fancy that some of the state legislatures will take strong ground on this occasion for my own part i consider those laws as merely an experiment on the american mind to see how far it will bear an avowed violation of the constitution if this goes down we shall immediately see attempted another act of congress declaring that the president shall continue in office during life reserving to another occasion the transfer of the succession to his heirs and the establishment of the senate for life at least this may be the aim of the oliverians while monk  the cavaliers who are perhaps the strongest may be playing their game for the restoration of his most gracious majesty george the third that these things are in contemplation i have no doubt nor can i be confident of their failure after the dupery of which our countrymen have shewn themselves susceptible you promised to endeavor to send me some tenants i am waiting for them having broken up two excellent farms with    fields in them of  0 acres each some of which i have sowed with small grain tenants of any size may be accommodated     with the number of fields suited to their force only send me good people and write me what they are adieu yours affectionately thomas jefferson october      petition on election of jurors  october      to the general assembly of the commonwealth of virginia the petition of sundry persons inhabitants of the county of albemarle and citizens of the said commonwealth respectfully sheweth that though civil govmt duly framed and administered be one of the greatest blessings and most powerful instruments for procuring safety and happiness to men collected in large societies yet such is the proneness of those to whom its powers are necessarily deputed to pervert them to the attainment of personal wealth and dominion  to the utter oppression of their fellowmen that it has become questionable whether the condition of our aboriginal neighbors who live without laws or magistracies be not preferable to that of the great mass of the nations of the earth who feel their laws and magistrates but in the weight of their burthens that the citizens of these u s impressed with this mortifying truth when they deposed the abusive govmt under which they have lived founded their new forms as well particular as general in that fact     and principle that the people themselves are the safest deposit of power and that none therefore should be trusted to others which they can competently exercise themselves that their own experience having proved that the people are competent to the appointment or election of their agents that of their chief executive magistrates was reserved to be made by themselves or by others chosen by themselves as was also the choice of their legislatures whether composed of one or more branches that in the judiciary department sensible that they were inadequate to questions of law these were in ordinary cases confided to permanent judges reserving to juries only extraordinary cases where a bias in the permanent judge might be suspected and where honest ignorance would be safer than perverted science and reserving to themselves also the whole department of fact which constitutes indeed the great mass of judiciary litigations that the wisdom of these reservations will be apparent on a recurrence to the history of that country from which we chiefly emigrated where the faint glimmerings of liberty and safety now remaining to the nation are kept in feeble life by the reserved powers of the people only that in the establishment of the trial by jury however a great inconsistence has been overlooked in this and some others of the states or rather has been copied from their original without due attention for while the competence of the people to the appointmt even of the highest executive and the legislative agents is admitted  established and their competence to be themselves     the triers of judiciary facts the appointment of the special individuals from among themselves who shall be such triers of fact has not been left in their hands but has been placed by law in officers dependent on the executive or judiciary bodies that triers of fact are therefore habitually taken in this state from among accidental bystanders and too often composed of foreigners attending on matters of business and of idle persons collected for purposes of dissipation and in cases interesting to the powers of the public functionaries may be specially selected from descriptions of persons to be found in every country whose ignorance or dependance renders them pliable to the will and designs of power that in others of these states and particularly in those to the eastward of the union  this germ of rottedness in the constitution of juries has been carefully excluded and their laws have provided with laudable foresight for the appointment of jurors by selectmen chosen by the people themselves and to a like restitution of principle and salutary precaution against the abuse of power by the public functionaries who never did yet in any country fail to betray and oppress those for the care of whose affairs they were appointed by force if they possessed it or by fraud and delusion if they did not your petitioners pray the timely attention of their legislature while that legislature and with a heartfelt satisfaction the petitioners pronounce it are still honest enough to wish the preservation of the rights of the people and wise enough to circumscribe in time the spread     of that gangrene which sooner than many are aware may reach the vitals of our political existence and lest it should be supposed that the popular appointmt of jurors may scarcely be practicable in a state so exclusive and circumstanced as ours your petitioners will undertake to suggest one mode not presumg to propose it for the adoption of the legislature but firmly relying that their wisdom will devise a better they observe then that by a law already passed for the establishment of schools provision has been made for laying off every county into districts or precincts that this division which offers so many valuable resources for the purposes of information of justice of order and police may be recurred to for the object now in contemplation and may be completed for this purpose where it has not been done for the other and the inhabitants of every precinct may meet at a given time and place in their precinct and in the presence of the constable or other head officer of the precinct elect from among themselves some one to be a juror that from among those so chosen in every county some one may be designated by lot who shall attend the ensuing session of the federal court within the state to act as grand and petty jurors one of those from every senatorial district being designated by lot for a grand juror and the residue attending to serve as petty jurors to be in like manner designated by lot in every particular case that of the others so chosen in every county composing a district for the itinerant courts of this commonwealth so many may be taken by lot as shall suffice for grand and petty     juries for the district court next ensuing their election and the residue so chosen in each county may attend their own county courts for the same purposes till another election or if too numerous the supernumeraries may be discharged by lot and that such compensation may be allowed for these services as without rendering the office an object worth canvassing may yet protect the juror from actual loss that an institution on this outline or such better as the wisdom of the gen ass will devise so modified as to guard it against the intrigue of parties the influence of power or irregularities of conduct and further matured from time to time as experience shall develop its imperfections may long preserve the trial by jury in its pure and original spirit as the true tribunal of the people for a mitigation in the execution of hard laws when the power of preventing their passage is lost and may afford some protection to persecuted man whether alien or citizen which the aspect of the times warns we may want and your petitioners waiving the expression of many important considerations which will offer themselves readily to the reflection of the general assembly pray them to take the premises into deep and serious consideration and to do therein for their country what their wisdom shall deem best and they as in duty bound shall ever pray c     thomas jefferson oct   th    james madison to james madison j mss  oct   th    the day after you left us i sat down and wrote the petition i mentioned to you it is not yet correct enough  i enclose you a copy to which i pray your corrections and to return it by the next post that it may be set in motion on turning to the judiciary law of the u s i find they established the designation of jurors by lot or otherwise as now practised in the several states should this prevent in the first moment the execution of so much of the proposed law as respects the federal courts the people will be in possession of the right of electing jurors as to the state courts  either congress will agree to conform their courts to the same rule or they will be loaded with an odium in the eyes of the people generally which will force the matter through i will send you a copy of the other paper by richardson do not send for him

resolved that the several states composing the u s of america did are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government but that by a compact under the style  title of a constitution for the u s and of amendments thereto they constituted a general government for special purposes delegated to that government certain definite powers reserving each state to itself the residuary mass of right to their own selfgovernment and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are unauthoritative void  of no force that to this compact each state acceded as a state and is an integral party its costates forming as to itself the other party that the constitutional form of action for this commonwealth as a party with respect to any other party is by its organized powers  not by its citizens in a body that the government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself since that would have made its discretion  not the constitution the measure of its powers but that as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode  measure of redress   resolved that one of the amendments to the constitution having declared that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press the act of the congress of the u s passed on the  st day of july      intituled an act in addition to the act intituled an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the u s which does abridge the freedom of speech  of the press is not law but is altogether void and of no force   resolved that the constitution of the u s having delegated to congress a power to punish treason conterfeiting the securities  current coin of the u s and piracies  felonies committed on the high seas and offences against the law of nations and no other crimes whatsoever and it being true as a general principle and one of the amendments to the constitution having also declared that the powers not delegated to the u s by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people therefore also the same act of congress passed by congress on the   th day of july      and intituled an act in addition to the act intituled an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the u s as also the act passed by them on the day of june      intituled an act to punish frauds committed on the bank of the u s and all their other acts which assume to create define or punish crimes other than those so enumerated in the constitution are altogether void and of no force and that the power to create define  punish such other crimes is reserved and of right appurtains solely and exclusively to the respective states each within its own territory   resolved that it is true as a general principle and is also expressly declared by one of the amendments to the constitution that the powers not delegated to the u s by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people and that no power over the freedom of religion freedom of speech or freedom of the press being delegated to the u s by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states all lawful powers respecting the same did of right remain  were reserved to the states or the people that thus was manifested their determination to retain to themselves the right of judging how far the licentiousness of speech and of the press may be abridged without lessening their useful freedom and how far these abuses which cannot be separated from their use should be tolerated rather than the use be destroyed and thus also they guarded against all abridgment by the u s of the freedom of religious opinions and exercises  retained to themselves the right of protecting the same as this state by a law passed on the general demand of its citizens had already protected them from all human restraint and interference and that in addition to this general principle  the express declaration another  more special provision has been made by one of the amendments to the constitution which expressly declares that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech of the press thereby guarding in the same sentence and under the same words the freedom of religion of speech  of the press insomuch that whatever violates one either throws down the sanctuary which covers the others and that putting witholding libels falsehood and defamation equally with heresy  false religion are witheld from federal the cognisance of the federal tribunals that therefore the act of the congress of the u s passed on the   th day of july      intituled an act in addition to the act intituled an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the us which does abridge the freedom of the press is not law but is altogether void and of no force   resolved that alienfriends are under the jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the state wherein they are that no power over them has been delegated to the u s nor prohibited to the individual states distinct from their power over citizens and it being true as a general principle and one of the amendments to the constitution having also declared that the powers not delegated to the u s by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people the act of the congress of the u s passed on the day of july      intituled an act concerning aliens which assumes powers over alien friends not delegated by the constitution is not law but is altogether void  of no force   resolved that in addition to the general principle as well as the express declaration that powers not delegated are reserved another and more special provision inserted in the constitution from abundant caution has declared that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by the congress prior to the year   0  that this commonwealth does admit the migration of alien friends described as the subject of the said act concerning aliens that a provision against prohibiting their migration is a provision against all acts equivalent thereto or it would be nugatory that to remove them when migrated is equivalent to a prohibition of their migration and is therefore contrary to the said provision of the constitution and void   resolved that the imprisonment of a person under the protection of the laws of this commonwealth on his failure to obey the simple order of the president to depart out of the u s as is undertaken by the said act intituled an act concerning aliens is contrary to the constitution one amendment to which has provided that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law and that another having provided that in all criminal cases prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a public trial by an impartial jury to be informed of the nature  cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence the same act undertaking to authorise the president to remove a person out of the u s who is under the protection of the law on his own suspicion without accusation without jury without public trial without confrontation of the witnesses against him without hearing witnesses in his favor without defence without counsel is contrary to these provisions also of the constitution is therefore not law but utterly void and of no force that transferring the power of judging any person who is under the protection of the laws from the courts to the president of the u s as is undertaken by the same act concerning aliens is against the article of the constitution which provides that the judicial power of the u s shall be vested in courts the judges of which shall hold their offices during good behavior and that the sd act is void for that reason also and it is further to be noted that this transfer of judiciary power is to that magistrate of the general government who already possesses all the executive and a negative on all the legislative proceed   resolved that the construction applied by the general government as is evidenced by sundry of their proceedings to those parts of the constitution of the u s which delegate to congress a power to lay  collect taxes duties imposts  excises to pay the debt and provide for the common defence and welfare of the u s and to make all laws which shall be necessary  proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the u s or in any department or officers thereof goes to the destruction of all the limits prescribed to their power by the constitution that words meant by that instrument to be subsidiary only to the execution of limited powers ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers nor a part to be so taken as to destroy the whole residue of the instrument that the proceedings of the general government under colour of these articles will be a fit and necessary subject of revisal  correction at a time of greater tranquillity while those specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate redress   resolved that a committee of conference  correspondence be appointed who shall have in charge to communicate the preceding resolutions to the legislatures of the several states to assure them that this commonwealth continues in the same esteem for their friendship and union which it has manifested from that moment at which a common danger first suggested a common union that it considers union for specified national purposes and particularly for those specified in their late federal compact to be friendly to the peace happiness and prosperity of all the states that faithful to that compact according to the plain intent  meaning in which it was understood  acceded to by the several parties it is sincerely anxious for its preservation that it does also believe that to take from the states all the powers of selfgovernment  transfer them to a general  consolidated government without regard to the special delegations and reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact is not for the peace happiness or prosperity of these states and that therefore this commonwealth is determined as it doubts not its costates are to submit to undelegated  consequently unlimited powers in no man or body of men on earth that it ought not that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers the members of the general government being chosen by the people a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy but where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact casus non fœderis to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits that without this right they would be under the dominion absolute and unlimited of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them that nevertheless this commonwealth from motives of regard  respect for its costates has wished to communicate with them on the subject that with them alone it is proper to communicate they alone being parties to the compact  solely authorised to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised under it congress being not a party but merely the creature of the compact  subject as to its assumptions of power to the final judgment of those by whom  for whose use itself and its powers were all created and modified that if those acts before specified should stand these conclusions would flow from them that the general government may place any act they think proper on the list of crimes and punish it themselves whether enumerated or not enumerated by the constitution as cognizable by them that they may transfer its cognisance to the president or any other person who may himself be the accuser counsel judge  jury whose suspicions may be the evidence his order the sentence his officer the executioner  his breast the sole record of the transaction that a very numerous  valuable description of the inhabitants of these states being by this precedent reduced as outlaws to the absolute dominion of one man and the barrier of the constitution thus swept away for us all no rampart now remains against the will and the passions and the power of a majority in congress to protect from a like exportation or other more grievous punishment the minority of the same body the legislatures judges  governors  counsellors of the states nor their other peaceable inhabitants who may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights and liberties of the states and the people or who for other causes good or bad may be obnoxious to the views or marked by the suspicions of the president or be thought dangerous to his or their elections or other interests public or personal that the friendless alien has indeed been selected as the safest subject of a first experiment but the citizen will soon follow or rather has already followed for already has a sedition act marked him as its prey that these and successive acts of the same character unless arrested at the threshold necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood and will furnish new calumnies against republican government and new pretexts for those who wish it to be believed that man cannot be governed but by a rod of iron that it would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights that confidence is every where the parent of despotism free government is founded in jealousy and not in confidence it is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power that our constitution has accordingly so fixed the limits to which and no further our confidence may go and let the honest advocate of confidence read the alien and sedition acts and say if the constitution has not been wise in fixing limits to the government it created and whether we should be wise in destroying those limits let him say what the government is if it be not a tyranny which the men of our choice have conferred on the president and the president of our choice has assented to and accepted over the friendly strangers to whom the mild spirit of our country  its laws had pledged hospitality  protection that the men of our choice have more respected the bare suspicions of the president than the solid rights of innocence the claims of justification the sacred force of truth and the forms and substance of law  justice in questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution that this commonwealth does therefore call on its costates for an expression of their sentiments on the acts concerning aliens and for the punishment of certain crimes herein before specified plainly declaring whether these acts are or are not authorised by the federal compact and it doubts not that their sense will be so enounced as to prove their attachment unaltered to limited government whether general or particular  that the rights  liberties of their costates will be exposed to no dangers by remaining embarked in a common bottom with their own but that however confident at other times this commonwealth would have been in the deliberate judgment of the costates and that but one opinion would be entertained on the unjustiable character of the acts herein specified yet it cannot be insensible that circumstances do exist  that passions are at this time afloat which may give a bias to the judgment to be pronounced on this subject that times of passion are peculiarly those when precedents of wrong are yielded to with the last caution when encroachments of powers are most usually made  principles are least watched that whether the coincidence of the occasion  the encroachment in the present case has been from accident or design the right of the commonwealth to the government of itself in cases not illegible parted with is too vitally important to be yielded from temporary or secondary considerations that a fixed determination therefore to retain it requires us in candor and without reserve to declare  to warn our costates that considering the said acts to be so palpably against the constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration that that compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the general government but that it is to proceed in the exercise over these states of any  all powers whatever considering this as seizing the rights of the states  consolidating them in the hands of the general government with power to bind the states not merely in the cases made federal casus fœderis but in all cases whatsoever by laws not made with their consent but by other states against their consent considering all the consequences as nothing in comparison with that of yielding the form of government we have chosen  of living under one struck out deriving its powers by from its own will and not from our authority this commonwealth as an integral party does in that case protest against such opinions and exercises of undelegated  unauthorised power and does declare that recurring to its natural right of judging  acting for itself it will be constrained to take care of itself  to provide by measures of its own that no power not plainly  intentionally delegated by the constitution to the general government shall be exercised within the territory of this commonwealth that they will concur with this comm in considering the said acts so palpably against the const as to amount to an undisguised declarn that that compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the genl govmt but that it will proceed in the exercise over these states of all powers whatsoever that they will view this as seizing the right of the states  consolidating them in the hands of the genl govt with power assumed to bind the states not merely in the cases made federal but in all cases whatsoever by laws made not with their consent but by others against their consent that this would be to surrender the form of govmt we have chosen  to live under one deriving its powers from its own will and not from our authority that the costates recurring to their natural right in cases not made federal will concur in declaring these acts void and of no force  will each take measures of its own providing that neither these acts nor any others of the government not plainly  intentionally authorized by the country to the genl govmt shall be exercised within their respective territories   that the said committee be authorised to communicate by writing or personal conference at any times or place whatever with any person or persons who may be appointed by any one or more of the costates to correspond or confer with them  that they lay their proceedings before the next session of assembly that the members of the said committee while acting within the state have the same allowance as the members of the general assembly and while acting without the commonwealth the same as members of congress and that the treasurer be authorized on warrants from the governor to advance them monies on account for the said services fair copy   resolved that the several states composing the united states of america are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their     general government but that by a compact under the style and title of a constitution for the united states and of amendments thereto they constituted a general

correction at a time of greater tranquillity while those specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate redress   0  th resolved that a committee of conference and correspondence be appointed who shall have in charge to communicate the preceding resolutions to the legislatures of the several states to assure them that this commonwealth continues in the same esteem of their friendship and union which it has manifested from that moment at which a common danger first suggested a common union that it considers union for specified national purposes and particularly to those specified in the late federal compact to be friendly to the peace happiness and prosperity of all the states that faithful to that compact according to the plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and acceded to by the several parties it is sincerely anxious for its preservation that it does also believe that to take from the states all the powers of selfgovernment and transfer them to a general and consolidated government without regard to the special delegations and reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact is not for the peace     happiness or prosperity of these states and that therefore this commonwealth is determined as it doubts not its costates are to submit to undelegated and consequently unlimited powers in no man or body of men on earth that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers the members of the general government being chosen by the people a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy but where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact casus non fœderis to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits that without this right they would be under the dominion absolute and unlimited of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them that nevertheless this commonwealth from motives of regard and respect for its costates has wished to communicate with them on the subject that with them alone it is proper to communicate they alone     being parties to the compact and solely authorized to judge the last resort of the powers exercised under it congress being not a party but merely the creature of the compact and subject as to its assumptions of power to the final judgment of those by whom and for whose use itself and its powers were all created and modified that if the acts before specified should stand these conclusions would flow from them that the general government may place any act they think proper on the list of crimes and punish it themselves whether enumerated or not enumerated by the constitution as cognizable by them that they may transfer its cognizance to the president or any other person who may himself be the accuser counsel judge and jury whose suspicions may be the evidence his order the sentence his officer the executioner and his breast the sole record of the transaction that a very numerous and valuable description of the inhabitants of these states being by this precedent reduced as outlaws to the absolute dominion of one man     and the barrier of the constitution thus swept away from us all no rampart now remains against the passions and the powers of a majority in congress to protect from a like exportation or other more grievous punishment the minority of the same body the legislatures judges governors and counsellors of the states nor their other peaceable inhabitants who may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights and liberties of the states and people or who for other causes good or bad may be obnoxious to the views or marked by the suspicions of the president or be thought dangerous to his or their election or other interests public or personal that the friendless alien has indeed been selected as the safest subject of a first experiment but the citizen will soon follow or rather has already followed for already has a sedition act marked him as its prey that these and successive acts of the same character unless arrested at the threshold necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood and will furnish new calumnies     against republican government and new pretexts for those who wish it to be believed that man cannot be governed but by a rod of iron that it would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights that confidence is everywhere the parent of despotism—free government is founded in jealousy and not in confidence it is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power that our constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which and no further our confidence may go and let the honest advocate of confidence read the alien and sedition acts and say if the constitution has not been wise in fixing limits to the government it created and whether we should be wise in destroying those limits let him say what the government is if it be not a tyranny which the men of our choice have conferred on our president and the president of our choice has assented to and accepted over the     friendly strangers to whom the mild spirit of our country and its laws have pledged hospitality and protection that the men of our choice have more respected the bare suspicions of the president than the solid right of innocence the claims of justification the sacred force of truth and the forms and substance of law and justice in questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution that this commonwealth does therefore call on its costates for an expression of their sentiments on the acts concerning aliens and for the punishment of certain crimes herein before specified plainly declaring whether these acts are or are not authorized by the federal compact and it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as to prove their attachment unaltered to limited government whether general or particular and that the rights and liberties of their costates will be exposed to no dangers by remaining embarked in a common bottom with their own     that they will concur with this commonwealth in considering the said acts as so palpably against the constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration that that compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the general government but that it will proceed in the exercise over these states of all powers whatsoever that they will view this as seizing the rights of the states and consolidating them in the hands of the general government with a power assumed to bind the states not merely in the cases made federal casus fœderis but in all cases whatsoever by laws made not with their consent but by others against their consent that this would be to surrender the form of government we have chosen and live under one deriving its powers from its own will and not from our authority and that the costates recurring to their natural right in cases not made federal will concur in declaring these acts void and of no force and will each take measures of its own for providing that neither these acts nor any others of the     general government not plainly and intentionally authorized by the constitution shall be exercised within their respective territories          th resolved that the said committee be authorized to communicate by writing or personal conferences at any times or places whatever with any person or persons who may be appointed by any one or more costates to correspond or confer with them and that they lay their proceedings before the next session of assembly thomas jefferson november       john taylor to john taylor j mss  november       dear sir— we formerly had a debtor  creditor account of letters on farming but the high price of tobo which is likely to continue for some short time has tempted me to go entirely into that culture and in the meantime my farming schemes are in abeyance   0 and my farming fields at nurse against the time of my resuming them but i owe you a political letter yet the infidelities of the post office and the circumstances of the times are against my writing fully  freely whilst my own dispositions are as much against mysteries innuendoes  halfconfidences i know not which mortifies me most that i should fear to write what i think or my country bear such a state of things yet lyons judges and a jury of all nations are objects of rational fear we agree in all the essential ideas of your letter we agree particularly in the necessity of some reform and of some better security for civil liberty but perhaps we do not see the existing circumstances in the same point of view there are many consideration dehors of the state which will occur to you without enumeration i should not apprehend them if all was sound within but there is a most respectable part of our state who have been enveloped in the x y z delusion and who destroy our unanimity for the present moment this disease of the imagination will pass over because the patients are essentially republican indeed the doctor is now on his way to cure it in the guise of a tax gatherer but give time for the medicine to work  for the repetition of stronger doses which must be administered the principle of the present majority is excessive expense money enough to fill all their maws or it will not be worth the risk of their supporting they cannot borrow a dollar in europe or above   or   millions in america this is not the fourth of the expences of this year unprovided     for paper money would be perillous even to the paper men nothing then but excessive taxation can get us along and this will carry reason  reflection to every mans door and particularly in the hour of election i wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution i would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its constitution i mean an additional article taking from the federal government the power of borrowing i now deny their power of making paper money or anything else a legal tender i know that to pay all proper expences within the year would in case of war be hard on us but not so hard as ten wars instead of one for wars would be reduced in that proportion besides that the state governments would be free to lend their credit in borrowing quotas for the present i should be for resolving the alien  sedition laws to be against the constitution  merely void and for addressing the other states to obtain similar declarations and i would not do anything at this moment which should commit us further but reserve ourselves to shape our future measures or no measures by the events which may happen it is a singular phenomenon that while our state governments are the very best in the world without exception or comparison our general government has in the rapid course of   or  0 years become more arbitrary and has swallowed more of the public liberty than even that of england i enclose you a column cut out of a london paper to show     you that the english though charmed with our making their enemies our enemies yet blush and weep over our sedition law but i enclose you something more important it is a petition for a reformation in the manner of appointing our juries and a remedy against the jury of all nations which is handing about here for signature and will be presented to your house i know it will require but little ingenuity to make objections to the details of its execution but do not be discouraged by small difficulties make it as perfect as you can at a first essay and depend on amending its defects as they develop themselves in practice i hope it will meet with your approbation  patronage it is the only thing which can yield us a little present protection against the dominion of a faction while circumstances are maturing for bringing  keeping the government in real unison with the spirit of their constituents i am aware that the act of congress has directed that juries shall be appointed by lot or otherwise as the laws now at the date of the act in force in the several states provide the new england states have always had them elected by their select men who are elected by the people several or most of the other states have a large number appointed i do not know how to attend out of whom    for each cause are taken by lot this provision of congress will render it necessary for our senators or delegates to apply for an amendatory law accommodated to that prayed for in the petition in the meantime i would pass the law as if the amendatory one existed in reliance that our     select jurors attending the federal judge will under a sense of right direct the juries to be taken from among them if he does not or if congress refuses to pass the amendatory law it will serve as eyewater for their constituents health happiness safety

with this commonwealth in declaring as it does hereby declare that the said acts are and were ab initio null void and of no force or effect i should like it better health happiness and adieu end of volume viii     kentucky legislature in the house of representatives november  0th      the house according to the standing order of the day resolved itself into a committee of the whole on the state of the commonwealth mr caldwell in the chair and after sometime spent therein the speaker resumed the chair and mr caldwell reported that the committee had according to order had under consideration the governors address and had come to the following resolutions thereupon which he delivered in at the clerks table where they were twice read and agreed to by the house i resolved that the several states composing the united states of america are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government but that by compact under the style and title of a constitution for the united states and of amendments thereto they constituted a general government for special purposes delegated to that government certain definite powers reserving each state to itself the residuary mass of right to their own self government and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are unauthoritative void and of no force that to this compact each state acceded as a state and is an integral party its costates forming as to itself the other party that the government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself since that would have made its discretion and not the constitution the measure of its powers but that as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common judge each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress ii resolved that the constitution of the united states having delegated to congress a power to punish treason counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the united states piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offences against the laws of nations and no other crimes whatever and it being true as a general principle and one of the amendments to the constitution having also declared that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitation nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people therefore also the same act of congress passed on the   th day of july      and entitled an act in addition to the act entitled an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the united states as also the act passed by them on the   th day of june      entitled an act to punish frauds committed on the bank of the united states and all other their acts which assume to create define or punish crimes other than those enumerated in the constitution are altogether void and of no force and that the power to create define and punish such other crimes is reserved and of right appertains solely and exclusively to the respective states each within its own territory iii resolved that it is true as a general principle and is also expressly declared by one of the amendments to the constitution that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people and that no power over the freedom of religion freedom of speech or freedom of the press being delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states all lawful powers respecting the same did of right remain and were reserved to the states or to the people that thus was manifested their determination to retain to themselves the right of judging how far the licentiousness of speech and of the press may be abridged without lessening their useful freedom and how far those abuses which cannot be separated from     their use should be tolerated rather than the use be destroyed and thus also they guarded against all abridgement by the united states of the freedom of religious opinions and exercises and retained to themselves the right of protecting the same as this state by a law passed on the general demand of its citizens had already protected them from all human restraint or interference and that in addition to this general principle and express declaration another and more special provision has been made by one of the amendments to the constitution which expressly declares that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press thereby guarding in the same sentence and under the same words the freedom of religion of speech and of the press insomuch that whatever violates either throws down the sanctuary which covers the others and that libels falsehoods and defamation equally with heresy and false religion are withheld from the cognizance of federal tribunals that therefore the act of the congress of the united states passed on the   th day of july      entitled an act in addition to the act for the punishment of certain crimes against the united states which does abridge the freedom of the press is not law but is altogether void and of no effect iv resolved that alien friends are under the jurisdiction and protection of the laws of the state wherein they are that no power over them has been delegated to the united states nor prohibited to the individual states distinct from their power over citizens and it being true as a general principle and one of the amendments to the constitution having also declared that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people the act of the congress of the united states passed on the   d day of june      entitled an act concerning aliens which assumes power over alien friends not delegated by the constitution is not law but is altogether void and of no force v resolved that in addition to the general principle as well as the express declaration that powers not delegated are reserved another and more special provision inserted in the constitution from abundant caution has declared that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by the congress prior to the year   0  that this commonwealth does admit the migration of alien friends described as the subject of the said act concerning aliens that a provision against prohibiting their migration is a provision against all acts equivalent thereto or it would be nugatory that to remove them when migrated is equivalent to a prohibition of their migration and is therefore contrary to the said provision of the constitution and void vi resolved that the imprisonment of a person under the protection of the laws of this commonwealth on his failure to obey the simple order of the president to depart out of the united states as is undertaken by the said act entitled an act concerning aliens is contrary to the constitution one amendments to which has provided that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law and that another having provided that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a public trial by an impartial jury to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favour and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence the same act undertaking to authorize the president to remove a person out of the united states who is under the protection of the law on his own suspicion without accusation without jury without public trial without confrontation of the witnesses against him without having witnesses in his favour without defence without counsel is contrary to these provisions also of the constitution     it therefore not law but utterly void and of no force that transferring the power of judging any person who is under the protection of the laws from the courts to the president of the united states as is undertaken by the same act concerning aliens is against the article of the constitution which provides that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in courts the judges of which shall hold their offices during good behaviour and that the said act is void for that reason also and it is further to be noted that this transfer of judiciary power is to that magistrate of the general government who already possesses all the executive and a qualified negative in all the legislative powers vii resolved that the construction applied by the general government as is evinced by sundry of their proceedings to those parts of the constitution of the united states which delegate to congress a power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the united states or any department thereof goes to the destruction of all the limits prescribed to their power by the constitution—that words meant by that instrument to be subsiduary only to the execution of the limited powers ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers nor a part so to be taken as to destroy the whole residue of the instrument that the proceedings of the general government under colour of these articles will be a fit and necessary subject for revisal and correction at a time of greater tranquility while those specified in the preceding resolutions call for immediate redress viii resolved that the preceding resolutions be transmitted to the senators and representatives in congress from this commonwealth who are hereby enjoined to present the sameto their respective houses and to use their best endeavours to procure at the next session of congress a repeal of the aforesaid unconstitutional and obnoxious acts ix resolved lastly that the governor of this commonwealth bestand is hereby authorised and requested to communicate the preceding resolutions to the legislatures of the several states to assure them that this commonwealth considers union for specified national purposes and particularly for those specified in their late federal compact to be friendly to the peace happiness and prosperity of all the states that faithful to that compact according to the plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and acceded to by the several parties it is sincerely anxious for its preservation that it does also believe that to take from the

expressed in their resolution of february         i now lay before them a report on the privileges and restrictions on the commerce of the united states in foreign countries in order to keep the subject within those bounds which i supposed to be under the contemplation of the house i have restrained my statements to those countries only with which we carry on a commerce of some importance and to those articles also of our produce which are of sensible weight in the scale of our exports and even these articles are sometimes grouped together according to the degree of favor or restriction with which they are received in each country and that degree expressed in general terms without detailing the exact duty levied on each article to have gone fully into these minutiæ would have been to copy the tariffs and books of rates of the different countries and to have hidden under a mass of details those general and important truths the extraction of which in a simple form i conceived would best answer the inquiries of the house by condensing material information within those limits of time and attention which this portion of their duties may justly claim the plan indeed of minute details which have been impracticable with some countries for want of information since preparing this report which was put into its present form in time to have been given in to the last session of congress alterations of the conditions of our commerce with some foreign nations have taken place—some of them independent of war some arising out of it france has proposed to enter into a new treaty of commerce with us on liberal principles and has in the meantime relaxed some of the restraints mentioned in the report spain has by an ordinance of june last established new orleans pensacola and st augustine into free ports for the vessels of friendly nations having treaties of commerce with her provided they touch for a permit at corcubion in gallicia or at alicant and our rice is by the same ordinance excluded from that country the circumstances of war have necessarily given us freer access to the west indian islands whilst they have also drawn on our navigation vexations and depredations of a most serious nature to have endeavored to describe all these would have been as impracticable as useless since the scenes would have been shifting while under description i therefore think it best to leave the report as it was formed being adapted to a particular point of time when things were in their settled order that is to say to the summer of      i have the honor to be c to the

which cannot be considered in any other light than an uncandid artifice to prevent what would be a virtual censure of the presidents conduct he maintained that the treaty in all its commercial parts was still under the power of the h of r he contended that it was more in the spirit of the constitution for it to be rendered nugatory after it received the sanction of the p  s by the h of r refusing it their support than for its existence to be prevented for it to be stifled in embryo by their declaring upon application from the p to know their sentiment before he had given it his signature that they would withhold that support he compared the relation of the executive to the legislative department to that between the states and the congress under the old confederation the old congress might have given up the right of laying discriminating duties in favor of any nation by treaty it would never have thought of taking beforehand the assent of each state thereto yet no one would have pretended to deny the power of the states to lay such this doctrine i believe is all that is original in his argument the sophisms of camillus  the nice distinctions of the examiner made up the rest

intended to puzzle  the word wisdom in expressing the confidence of the house in the p was so artfully introduced that if the fraudulent design had not been detected in time the vote of the house as to its effect upon the p would have been entirely done away a resolution so worded as to acquit the p of all evil intention but at the same time silently censuring his error was passed by a majority of       to    some of the warmest of the victorious party talk of bringing forward a motion for a vote of applause to s t mason but the more moderate say their triumph is sufficient  it is supposed this will be dropped   from the original in the historical society of pennsylvania   from a copy courteously furnished by dr j s h fogg of boston   undated but probably written late in      christoph daniel ebeling was at this time preparing his biography and history of north america   from the original in the possession of the virginia historical society   edmund randolph   mann page   from this point begins the extract which is known as the mazzei letter it originally appeared in a florentine paper from the italian text was translated into french and printed in the moniteur and from that was retranslated into english first appearing in america in the minerva of may         as follows translated for the minerva from the paris monitor of january    florence january        from mr jefferson late minister of the united states in france and secretary of the department of foreign affairs to a citizen of virginia this letter literally translated is addressed to m mazzei author of researches historical and political upon the united states of america now resident in tuscany our political situation is prodigiously changed since you left us instead of that noble love of liberty and that republican government which carried us triumphantly thro the dangers of the war an anglomonarchioaristocratic party has arisen their avowed object is to impose on us the substance as they have already given us the form of the british government nevertheless the principal body of our citizens remain faithful to republican principles all our proprietors of lands are friendly to those principles as also the mass of men of talents we have against us republicans the executive power the judiciary power two of the three branches of our government all the officers of government all who are seeking offices all timid men who prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty the british merchants and the americans who trade on british capitals the speculators persons interested in the bank and the public funds establishments invented with views of corruption and to assimilate us to the british model in its corrupt parts i should give you a fever if i should name the apostates who have embraced these heresies men who were solomons in council and samsons in combat but whose hair has been cut off by the whore england in the original par la catin angleterre probably alluding to the womans cutting off the hair of sampson and his loss of strength thereby they would wrest from us the liberty which we have obtained by so much labor and peril but we shall preserve it our mass of weight and riches is so powerful that we have nothing to fear from any attempt against us by force it is sufficient that we guard ourselves and that we break the lilliputian ties by which they have bound us in the first slumbers which succeeded our labors it suffices that we arrest the progress of that system of ingratitude and injustice towards france from which they would alienate us to bring us under british influence c thus far the letter to which are subjoined in the french paper the following remarks this interesting letter from one of the most virtuous and enlightened citizens of the united states explains the conduct of the americans in regard to france it is certain that of all the neutral and friendly powers there is none from which france had a right to expect more interest and succours than from the united states she is their true mother country since she has assured to them their liberty and independence ungrateful children instead of abandoning her they ought to have armed in her defense but if imperious circumstances had prevented them from openly declaring for the republic of france they ought at least to have made demonstrations and excited apprehensions in england that at some moment or other they should declare themselves this fear alone would have been sufficient to force the cabinet of london to make peace it is clear that a war with the united states would strike a terrible blow at the commerce of the english would give them uneasiness for the preservation of their possessions on the american continent and deprive them of the means of conquering the french and dutch colonies equally ungrateful and impolitic the congress hastens to encourage the english that they might pursue in tranquility their war of extermination against france and to invade the colonies and the commerce of england they sent to london a minister mr jay known by his attachment to england and his personal relations to lord grenville and he conducted suddenly a treaty of commerce which united them with great britain more than a treaty of alliance such a treaty under all the peculiar circumstances and by the consequences which it must produce is an act of hostility against france the french government in short has testified the resentment of the french nation by breaking off communication with an ungrateful and faithless ally until she shall return to a more just and benevolent conduct justice and sound policy equally approve this measure of the french government there is no doubt it will give rise in the united states to discussions which may afford a triumph to the party of good republicans the friends of france some writers in disapprobation of this wise and necessary measure of the directory maintain that in the united states the french have for partizans only certain demagogues who aim to overthrow the existing government but their imprudent falsehoods convince no one and prove only what is too evident that they use the liberty of the press to serve the enemies of france the foregoing letter wears all the external marks of authenticity and yet it seems hardly possible an american could be capable of writing such a letter as the letter is circulating in europe we deem it just if a forgery to give mr jefferson an opportunity to disavow it upon this publication in america and jeffersons failure to repudiate it he was savagely attacked by the federal press he attempted no public explanation or palliation but to his friends see post letter to madison june        he sought to blame the translation for the stronger expressions and many years later in his letter to van buren june         he tried to explain away the apparent allusions to washington even becoming insincere in his endeavors to prove that his references did not allude to his former chief so far as this point is concerned it is only necessary to note that the criticism on washington in this letter is far less severe than jefferson was writing to others in these years and that washington himself took the references so wholly to himself that from the publication of this letter he ceased all correspondence and intercourse with his former secretary nor is it probable that jeffersons attempt to discredit the public version at the time was so much a repudiation of what he had written as it was a political desire to avoid the unpopularity of being known as the critic of one whom he had himself to acknowledge had such personal popularity that the people will support him in whatever he will do or will not do without appealing to their own reason or to anything but their feelings toward him  there seems to be a mistake in the original in this passage or we mistake the construction—translator   here in the margin of the copy is written apparently at

jefferson dec         monticello monticello dec         dear sir— the public  the public papers have been much occupied lately in placing us in a point of opposition to each other i confidently trust we have felt less of it ourselves in the retired canton where i live we know little of what is passing pamphlets i see none papers very few  the fewer the happier our last information from philada is of the   th inst at that date the issue of the late election seems not to have been known as a matter of fact with me however its issue was never doubted i knew the impossibility of your losing a single vote north of the delaware and even if you should lose that of pennsylva in the mass you would get enough south of that to make your election sure i never for a single moment expected any other issue  tho i shall not be believed yet it is not the less true that i never wished any other my neighbors as my compurgators could aver this fact as seeing my occupations  my attachment to them it is possible indeed that even you may be cheated of your succession by a trick worthy the subtlety of your arch friend of new york who has been able to make of your real friends tools for defeating their  your just wishes probably however he will be disappointed as to you and my inclinations put me out of his reach i leave to others the sublime delights of riding in the storm better pleased with sound sleep  a warmer berth below it encircled with the society of my neighbors friends  fellow laborers of the earth rather than with spies  sycophants still i shall value highly the share i may have had in the late vote as a measure of the share i hold in the esteem of my fellow citizens in this point of view a few votes less are but little sensible while a few more would have been in their effect very sensible  oppressive to me i have no ambition to govern men it is a painful and thankless office and never since the day you signed the treaty of paris has our horizon been so overcast i devoutly wish you may be able to shun for us this war which will destroy our agriculture commerce  credit if you do the glory will be all your own and that your administration maybe filled with glory  happiness to yourself  advantage to us is the sincere prayer of one who tho in the course of our voyage various little incidents have happened or been contrived to separate us yet retains for you the solid esteem of the times when we were working for our independence and sentiments of sincere respect  attachment   statement from memory of a letter i wrote to james madison copy omitted to be retained thomas jefferson jan      monticello monticello jan      yours of dec    is safely received i never entertained a doubt of the event of the election i knew that the eastern troops were trained in the schools of their town meetings to sacrifice little differences of opinion to the solid advantages of operating in phalanx and that the more free and moral agency of the other states would fully supply their deficiency i had no expectation indeed that the vote would have approached so near an equality it is difficult to obtain full credit to declarations of disinclination to honors and most so with those who still remain in the world but never was there a more solid unwillingness founded on rigorous calculation formed in the mind of any man short of peremptory refusal no arguments therefore were necessary to reconcile me to a relinquishment of the first office or acceptance of the second no motive could have induced me to undertake the first but that of putting our vessel upon her republican tack and preventing her being driven too far to leeward of her true principles and the second is the only office in the world about which i cannot decide in my own mind whether i had rather have it or not have it pride does not enter into the estimate for i think with the romans of old that the general of today should be a common soldier tomorrow if necessary but as to mr adams particularly i could have no feelings which would revolt at being placed in a secondary station to him i am his junior in life i was his junior in congress his junior in the diplomatic line and lately his junior in our civil government i had written him the enclosed letter before the receipt of yours i had intended it for some time but had put it off from time to time from the discouragement of despair to make him believe me sincere as the information by the last post does not make it necessary to change anything in the letter i enclose it open for your perusal as well that you may be possessed of the true state of dispositions between us as that if there be any circumstance which might render its delivery ineligible you may return it to me if mr adams could be induced to administer the government on its true principles quitting his bias for an english constitution it would be worthy consideration whether it would not be for the public good to come to a good understanding with him as to his future elections he is the only sure barrier against hamiltons getting in    the political progress is a work of value and of a singular complexion the authors eye seems to be a natural achromatic divesting every object of the glare of color the former work of the same title possessed the same kind of merit they disgust one indeed by opening to his view the ulcerated state of the human mind but to cure an ulcer you must go to the bottom of it which no author does more radically than this the reflections into which it leads us are not very flattering to the human species in the whole animal kingdom i recollect no family but man steadily and systematically employed in the destruction of itself nor does what is called civilization produce any other effect than to teach him to pursue the principle of the bellum omnium in omnia on a greater scale and instead of the little contest between tribe and tribe to comprehend all the quarters of the earth in the same work of destruction if to this we add that as to other animals the lions and tigers are mere lambs compared with man as a destroyer we must conclude that nature has been able to find in man alone a sufficient barrier against the too great multiplication of other animals and of man himself an equilibrating power against the fecundity of generation while in making these observations my situation points my attention to the welfare of man in the physical world yours may perhaps present him as equally warring in the moral one adieu yours affectionately   from the original in the possession of the virginia historical society   adams wrote to tristam dalton on jan         p s mr jeffersons letters and declarations are no surprise to me we laboured together in high friendship in congress in      and have lived and acted together very frequently since that time his talent and information i know very well and have everbelieved in his honour integrity his love of country and his friends i may say to you that his patronage of paine and freneau and his entanglements with characters and politicks which have been pernicious are and have long been a source of inquietude and anxiety to me as they have been to you but i hope and believe that his advancement and his situation in the senate an excellent school will correct him he will have too many french friends about him to flatter him but i hope we can keep him steady this is entre nous j a   the following is the last paragraph in the draft of this letter afterwards stricken out and changed as in the print i shall never forget the prediction of the count de vergennes that we shall exhibit the singular phænomenon of a fruit rotten before it is ripe nor cease to join in the wish of silas deane that there were an ocean of fire between us  the old world indeed my dear friend i am so disgusted with this entire subjection to a foreign power that if it were in the end to appear to be the wish of the body of my countrymen to remain in that vassalege i should feel my unfitness to be an agent in their affairs and seek in retirement that personal independence without which this world has nothing i value i am confident you set the same store by it which i do but perhaps your situation may not give you the same conviction of its existence   endorsed no copy retained the above is the sum   see letters to

by mr barnes by this days post you will therefore be pleased to proceed in the name of dr james currie for the three first notes amounting to   000 dollars you mention that discretionary powers must be given to some person in n york in order that you may be able to associate these gentlemen in a general compromise with some others for whom you will obtain judgment in july dr currie has given me full powers to act for him  i hereby give you full  discretionary powers to do for him whatever you may think for his interest i enclose you one of his letters to me sufficiently evidencing his committing the matter to me mr barnes is authorized by mr burwell to take the same steps for him which i do for dr currie he will therefore write to you this day dr currie has another claim by judgment recovered here against griffin  morris which may be the subject of a future letter to you perhaps after i shall have seen mr ingersoll his attorney now absent from town if congress mean to adjourn at all which i doubt i shall stay here till they adjourn if they do not after passing the land tax i shall consider it as evidence they mean to make their sessions permanent  shall then go home for the season i am with great  sincere esteem dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson june       philadelphia philadelphia june       dear sir— in my letter of may    i mentioned to you that dr currie had another demand by judgment against john tayloe griffin as principal  robert morris garnishee which should be the subject of a future letter to you i now enclose you a transcript by the record of the supreme court of this state it seems by this i have not examined the record with minute attention that the court have considered robert morris as holding property of griffins to the amount of £  0  pensva currency      0 dolls not due as stated on interrogatory till dec     00 but that interest at   per cent must have been payable annually as he confesses judgment for £      interest on that sum to dec      which was paid to mr ingersoll  a scire facias issued for the interest of the year      being £     has been issued since on this last nothing has been done as no effects here can be got at this interest therefore for the year       now also for the year      is due  immediately recoverable as to the principal i know not how the laws may be with you but in virginia where we have courts of chancery on the principles of that of england tho in a court of law the principal could not be demanded before due yet the chancery in consideration of the hazard in which it is placed by the change of circumstances of rob morris would either oblige him to give security or sequester any property of his which the plaintiff would point out if it be so with you then we may hope that the principal may be secured so as to be received in   00  the interest for        immediately recovered i will pray you however to have done for dr currie both as to principal  interest whatever your laws will authorize for the best i enclose you a letter from him referring you to me  i hereby give you as full powers to act herein as he has given to me i leave this place in the morning of the  0th  would thank you to be informed what prospect you think there is of these several matters if i am gone the letter will follow  find me at home i am with great esteem dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson nov         monticello monticello nov         dear sir— dr currie on whose behalf i troubled you last summer being anxious to learn something of the prospect he may have of recovering from robert morris i take the liberty of asking a line directed to me at this place where i shall still be long enough to receive it i should not have troubled you but that you expected early in the summer to be able to judge what could be done i am aware at the same time that the fever at new york may have disturbed all legal proceedings i did not mean to say a word on politics but it occurs that i have seen in the new york papers a calumny which i suppose will run through the union that i had written by doctr logan letters to merlin  taleyrand on retiring from the secretary of states office i determined to drop all correspondence with france knowing the base calumnies which would be built on the most innocent correspondence i have not therefore written a single letter to that country within that period except to mr short on his own affairs merely which are under my direction and once or twice to colo monroe by logan i did not write even a letter to mr short nor to any other person whatever i thought this notice of the matter due to my friends though i do not go into the newspapers with a formal declaration of it i am c   on outside of letter   since this letter to taylor was printed prof w p trent has called my attention to a note by george tucker in the southern literary messenger for may      iv     in which the expression imputed to taylor that it is not unwise now to estimate the separate mass of virginia and north carolina is stated to have been an error due to the fading of the letterpress copy the true reading being it is not usual now this correction was made at the suggestion of a descendant of taylors and no proof is produced beyond the mere assertion of mr tucker what is more the letterpress copy was one of those destroyed before the jefferson papers were purchased by the government so it is now impossible to verify the facts the correction however is so material that it seems necessary to note the assertion   from the original in the possession of the virginia historical society   see his letter of oct      to which this is an answer copy of a letter time not permitting a press copy this was immediately written from recollection  is nearly verbal—t j   see letters to madison of october         and to john taylor of november           this clause is struck out in ms   the text in the first column is from the rough draft and that in the second from a fair copy the facsimile is the text actually moved by breckenridge adopted by the kentucky legislature and sent to the other state legislatures as early as april         see ante p     jefferson was predicting and disapproving of possible alien and sedition bills and from that time his letters express the strongest dislike to those acts thoroughly opposed to disunion see letter to john taylor vii p   0 yet believing these federalist measures only initial steps towards a dictatorship or monarchy jefferson cast about him for some means of checking the project and finally hit upon the now famous doctrine of nullification of federal statutes by means of resolutions of state legislatures no one better realized the hazard of such a doctrine than its inventor as is indicated not merely by the guarded phrasing done with purpose as is shown by his letters to madison taylor and nicholas post but quite as much by the absolute secrecy with which his share in the whole attempt was kept for many years the resolutions were originally prepared for north carolina and their destination changed for reasons given in the letter to nicholas ante p     jefferson wrote to madison thomas jefferson november         monticello james madison monticello november         i enclose you a copy of the draught of the kentucky resolves i think we should distinctly affirm all the important principles they contain so as to hold to that ground in future and leave the matter in such a train as that we may not be committed to push matters to extremities  yet may be free to push as far as events will render prudent to taylor he wrote thomas jefferson nov         monticello john taylor monticello nov         for the present i should be for resolving the alien  sedition laws to be against the constitution  merely void and for addressing the other states to obtain similar declarations and i would not do anything at this moment which should commit us further but reserve ourselves to shape our future measures or no measures by the events which may happen the history of the resolutions jefferson stated in a letter to john cabel breckenridge thomas jefferson december         monticello john cabel monticello december         dear sir— your letter of december   th places me under a dilemma which i cannot solve but by an exposition of the naked truth i would have wished this rather to have remained as hitherto without inquiry but your inquiries have a right to be answered i will do it as exactly as the great lapse of time and a waning memory will enable me i may misremember indifferent circumstances but can be right in substance at the time when the republicans of our country were so much alarmed at the proceedings of the federal ascendancy in congress in the executive and the judiciary departments it became a matter of serious consideration how head could be made against their enterprises on the constitution the leading republicans in congress found themselves of no use there browbeaten as they were by a bold and overwhelming majority they concluded to retire from that field take a stand in their state legislatures and endeavor there to arrest their progress the alien and sedition laws furnished the particular occasion the sympathy between virginia and kentucky was more cordial and more intimately confidential than between any other two states of republican policy mr madison came into the virginia legislature i was then in the vicepresidency and could not leave my station but your father colonel w c nicholas and myself happening to be together the engaging the cooperation of kentucky in an energetic protestation against the constitutionality of those laws became a subject of consultation those gentlemen pressed me strongly to sketch resolutions for that purpose your father undertaking to introduce them to that legislature with a solemn assurance which i strictly required that it should not be known from what quarter they came i drew and delivered them to him and in keeping their origin secret he fulfilled his pledge of honor some years after this colonel nicholas asked me if i had any objection to it being known that i had drawn them i pointedly enjoined that it should not whether he had unguardedly intimated before to any one i know not but i afterwards observed in the papers repeated imputations of them to me on which as has been my practice on all occasions of imputation i have observed entire silence the question indeed has never before been put to me nor should i answer it to any other than yourself seeing no good end to be proposed by it and the desire of tranquility inducing with me a wish to be withdrawn from public notice your fathers zeal and talents were too well known to desire any additional distinction from the penning these resolutions that circumstance surely was of far less merit than the proposing and carrying them through the legislature of his state the only fact in this statement on which my memory is not distinct is the time and occasion of the consultation with your father and mr nicholas it took place here i know but whether any other person was present or communicated with is my doubt i think mr madison was either with us or consulted but my memory is uncertain as to minor details i fear dear sir we are now in such another crisis with this difference only that the judiciary branch is alone and singlehanded in the present assaults on the constitution but its assaults are more sure and deadly as from an agent seemingly passive and unassuming may you and your contemporaries meet them with the same determination and effect as your father and his did the alien and sedition laws and preserve inviolate a constitution which cherished in all its chastity and purity will prove in the end a blessing to all the nations of the earth with these prayers accept those for your own happiness and prosperity the resolutions with those of virginia of      and      produced an extensive pamphlet literature at the time a bibliography of which is a distinct desideratum and has since then been the cause of many publications the most interesting arguments on the questions involved are those of story calhoun van holst and johnston and minute histories of the kentucky resolutions have been written by r t durrett southern bivouac             0 and by e d warfield new york
