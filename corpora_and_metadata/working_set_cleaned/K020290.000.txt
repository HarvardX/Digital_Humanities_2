the critic or a tragedy rehearsed a dramatic piece in three acts as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  by richard brinsley sheridan esqr london printed for t becket adelphi strand mdcclxxxi  to mrs greville madam in requesting your permission to address the following pages to you which as they aim themselves to be critical require every protection and allowance that approving taste or friendly prejudice can give them i yet ventured to mention no other motive than the gratification of private friendship and esteem had i suggested a hope that your implied approbation would give a sanction to their defects your particular reserve and dislike to the reputation of critical taste as well as of poetical talent would have made you refuse the protection of your name to such a purpose however i am not so ungrateful as now to attempt to combat this disposition in you i shall not here presume to argue that the present state of poetry claims and expects every assistance that taste and example can afford it nor endeavor to prove that a fastidious concealment of the most elegant productions of judgment and fancy is an ill return for the possession of those endowments  continue to deceive yourself in the idea that you are known only to be eminently admired and regarded for the valuable qualities that attach private friendships and the graceful talents that adorn conversation enough of what you have written has stolen into full public notice to answer my purpose and you will perhaps be the only person conversant in elegant literature who shall read this address and not perceive that by publishing your particular approbation of the following drama i have a more interested object than to boast the true respect and regard with which  i have the honor to be madam your very sincere and obedient humble servant r b sheridan  prologue by the honorable richard fitzpatrick the sister muses whom these realms obey who over the drama hold divided sway sometimes by evil counselors it is said like earthborn potentates have been misled in those gay days of wickedness and wit when villiers criticizd what dryden writ the tragic queen to please a tasteless crowd had learned to bellow rant and roar so loud that frightened nature her best friend before the blustering beldams company forswore her comic sister who had wit it is true with all her merits had her failings too and would sometimes in mirthful moments use a style too flippant for a wellbred muse then female modesty abashed began to seek the friendly refuge of the fan awhile behind that slight entrenchment stood till driven from thence she left the stage for good in our more pious and far chaster times these sure no longer are the muses crimes but some complain that former faults to shun the reformation to extremes has run the frantic heros wild delirium past now insipidity succeeds bombast so slow melpomenes cold numbers creep here dullness seems her drowsy court to keep and we are scarce awake whilst you are fast asleep thalia once so ill behaved and rude reformed is now become an arrant prude retailing nightly to the yawning pit the purest morals undefiled by wit our author offers in these motley scenes a slight remonstrance to the dramas queens nor let the goddesses be over nice free spoken subjects give the best advice although not quite a novice in his trade his cause to night requires no common aid to this a friendly just and powerful court i come ambassador to beg support can he undaunted brave the criticks rage in civil broils with brother bards engage hold forth their errors to the public eye nay more even newspapers themselves defy say must his single arm encounter all by numbers vanquished even the brave may fall and though no leader should success distrust whose troops are willing and whose cause is just to bid such hosts of angry foes defiance his chief dependence must be your alliance dramatis personae dangle mr dodd sneer mr

intelligence  it is now confidently asserted that sir charles hardy  pshaw  nothing but about the fleet and the nation  and i hate all politics but theatrical politics  where is the morning chronicle   mrs dangle yes that is your gazette   dangle so here we have it    theatrical intelligence extraordinary  we hear there is a new tragedy in rehearsal at drury lane theater called the spanish armada said to be written by mr puff a gentleman well known in the theatrical world if we may allow ourselves to give credit to the report of the performers who truth to say are in general but indifferent judges this piece abounds with the most striking and received beauties of modern composition  so i am very glad my friend puffs tragedy is in such forwardness  mrs dangle my dear you will be very glad to hear that puffs tragedy    mrs dangle lord mr dangle why will you plague me about such nonsense  now the plays are begun i shall have no peace  is not it sufficient to make yourself ridiculous by your passion for the theater without continually teazing me to join you why cannot you ride your hobbyhorse without desiring to place me on a pillion behind you mr dangle   dangle nay my dear i was only going to read    mrs dangle no no you never will read any thing that is worth listening to  you hate to hear about your country there are letters every day with roman signatures demonstrating the certainty of an invasion and proving that the nation is utterly undone  but you never will read any thing to entertain one   dangle what has a woman to do with politics mrs dangle   mrs dangle and what have you to do with the theater mr dangle why should you affect the character of a critic i have no patience with you  havent you made yourself the jest of all your acquaintance by your interference in matters where you have no business are not you called a theatrical quidnunc and a mock maecenas to secondhand authors   dangle true my power with the managers is pretty notorious but is it no credit to have applications from all quarters for my interest  from lords to recommend fiddlers from ladies to get boxes from authors to get answers and from actors to get engagements   mrs dangle yes truly you have contrived to get a share in all the plague and trouble of theatrical property without the profit or even the credit of the abuse that attends it   dangle i am sure mrs dangle you are no loser by it however you have all the advantages of it  mightnt you last winter have had the reading of the new pantomime a fortnight previous to its performance and does not mr fosbrook let you take places for a play before it is advertised and set you down for a box for every new piece through the season and didnt my friend mr smatter dedicate his last farce to you at my particular request mrs dangle   mrs dangle yes but was not the farce damned mr dangle and to be sure it is extremely pleasant to have ones house made the motley rendezvous of all the lackeys of literature  the very high change of trading authors and jobbing critics  yes my drawing room is an absolute registeroffice for candidate actors and poets without character  then to be continually alarmed with misses and maams piping histeric changes on juliets and dorindas pollys and ophelias and the very furniture trembling at the probationary starts and unprovoked rants of wouldbe richards and hamlets  and what is worse than all now that the manager has monopolizd the operahouse havent we the signors and signioras calling here sliding their smooth semibreves and gargling glib divisions in their outlandish throats  with foreign emissaries and french spies for ought i know disguised like fiddlers and figure dancers   dangle mercy mrs dangle   mrs dangle and to employ yourself so idly at such an alarming crisis as this too  when if you had the least spirit you would have been at the head of one of the westminster associations  or trailing a volunteer pike in the artillery ground  but you  of my conscience i believe if the french were landed tomorrow your first enquiry would be whether they had brought a theatrical troop with them   dangle mrs dangle it does not signify  i say the stage is the mirror of nature and the actors are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time  and pray what can a man of sense study better  besides you will not easily persuade me that there is no credit or importance in being at the head of a band of critics who take upon them to decide for the whole town whose opinion and patronage all writers solicit and whose recommendation no manager dares refuse   mrs dangle ridiculous  both managers and authors of the least merit laugh at your pretensions  the public is their critic  without whose fair approbation they know no play can rest on the stage and with whose applause they welcome such attacks as yours and laugh at the malice of them where they cannot at the wit   dangle very well madam  very well   enter servant servant mr sneer sir to wait on you   dangle o show mr sneer up   exit servant plague on it now we must appear loving and affectionate or sneer will hitch us into a story   mrs dangle with all my heart you cannot be more ridiculous than you are   dangle your are enough to provoke    enter mr sneer  hah my dear sneer i am vastly glad to see you my dear here is mr sneer   mrs dangle good morning to you sir   dangle mrs dangle and i have been diverting ourselves with the papers  pray sneer will not you go to drury lane theater the first night of puffs tragedy   sneer yes but i suppose one shall not be able to get in for on the first night of a new piece they always fill the house with orders to support it but here dangle i have brought you two pieces one of which you must exert yourself to make the managers accept i can tell you that for it is written by a person of consequence   dangle so now my plagues are beginning   sneer aye i am glad of it for now you will be happy why my dear dangle it is a pleasure to see how you enjoy your volunteer fatigue and your solicited solicitations   dangle it is a great trouble  yet egad its pleasant too  why sometimes of a morning i have a dozen people call on me at breakfast time whose faces i never saw before nor ever desire to see again   sneer that must be very pleasant indeed   dangle and not a week but i receive fifty letters and not a line in them about any business of my own   sneer an amusing correspondence   dangle reading bursts into tears and exit what is this a tragedy   sneer no that is a genteel comedy not a translation  only taken from the french it is written in a style which they have lately tried to run down the true sentimental and nothing ridiculous in it from the beginning to the end   mrs dangle well if they had kept to that i should not have been such an enemy to the stage there was some edification to be got from those pieces mr sneer   sneer i am quite of your opinion mrs dangle the theater in proper hands might certainly be made the school of morality but now i am sorry to say it people seem to go there principally for their entertainment   mrs dangle it would have been more to the credit of the managers to have kept it in the other line   sneer undoubtedly madam and hereafter perhaps to have had it recorded that in the midst of a luxurious and dissipated age they preserved two houses in the capital where the conversation was always moral at least if not entertaining   dangle now egad i think the worst alteration is in the nicety of the audience  no double entendre no smart inuendo admitted even vanburgh and congreve obliged to undergo a bungling reformation   sneer yes and our prudery in this respect is just on a par with the artificial bashfulness of a courtezan who increases the blush upon her cheek in an exact proportion to the diminution of her modesty   dangle sneer cannot even give the public a good word  but what have we here  this seems a very odd    sneer o that is a comedy on a very new plan replete with wit and mirth yet of a most serious moral you see it is called the reformed housebreaker where by the mere force of humor housebreaking is put into so ridiculous a light that if the piece has its proper run i have no doubt but that bolts and bars will be entirely useless by the end of the season   dangle egad this is new indeed   sneer yes it is written by a particular friend of mine who has discovered that the follies and foibles of society are subjects unworthy the notice of the comic muse who should be taught to stoop only at the greater vices and blacker crimes of humanity  gibbeting capital offenses in five acts and pillorying petty larcenies in two  in short his idea is to dramatize the penal laws and make the stage a court of ease to the old bailey   dangle it is truly moral   enter servant sir fretful plagiary sir   dangle beg him to walk up   exit servant now mrs dangle sir fretful plagiary is an author to your own taste   mrs dangle i confess he is a favorite of mine because every body else abuses him   sneer  very much to the credit of your charity madam if not of your judgment   dangle but egad he allows no merit to any author but himself that is the truth on it  though he is my friend   sneer never  he is as envious as an old maid verging on the desperation of sixandthirty and then the insiduous humility with which he seduces you to give a free opinion on any of his works can be exceeded only by the petulant arrogance with which he is sure to reject your observations   dangle very true egad  though he is my friend   sneer then his affected contempt of all newspaper strictures though at the same time he is the sorest man alive and shrinks like scorched parchment from the fiery ordeal of true criticism yet is he so covetous of popularity that he had rather be abused than not mentioned at all   dangle there is no denying it  though he is my friend   sneer you have read the tragedy he has just finished havent you   dangle o yes he sent it to me yesterday   sneer well and you think it execrable dont you   dangle why between ourselves egad i must own  though he is my friend  that it is one of the most  he is here aside  finished and most admirable perform   sir fretful without mr sneer with him did you say   enter sir fretful ah my dear friend  egad we were just speaking of your tragedy  admirable sir fretful admirable   sneer you never did any thing beyond it sir fretful  never in your life   sir fretful you make me extremely happy  for without a compliment my dear sneer there is not a man in the world whose judgment i value as i do yours  and mr dangles   mrs dangle they are only laughing at you sir fretful for it was but just now that    dangle mrs dangle  ah sir fretful you know mrs dangle  my friend sneer was rallying just now  he knows how she admires you and    sir fretful o lord  i am sure mr sneer has more taste and sincerity than to  a damned doublefaced fellow   dangle yes yes  sneer will jest  but a better humored    sir fretful o i know    dangle he has a ready turn for ridicule  his wit costs him nothing    sir fretful no egad  or i should wonder how he came by it   aside mrs dangle because his jest is always at the expense of his friend   dangle but sir fretful have you sent your play to the managers yet  or can i be of any service to you   sir fretful no no i thank you i believe the piece had sufficient recommendation with it  i thank you though  i sent it to the manager of coventgarden theater this morning   sneer i should have thought now that it might have been cast as the actors call it better at drury lane   sir fretful o lud no  never send a play there while i live  harkee  whispers sneer   sneer writes himself  i know he does    sir fretful i say nothing  i take away from no mans merit  am hurt at no mans good fortune  i say nothing  but this i will say  through all my knowledge of life i have observed  that there is not a passion so strongly rooted in the human heart as envy   sneer i believe you have reason for what you say indeed   sir fretful besides  i can tell you it is not always so safe to leave a play in the hands of those who write themselves   sneer what they may steal from them hey my dear plagiary   sir fretful steal  to besure they may and egad serve your best thoughts as gypsies do stolen children disfigure them to make em pass for their own   sneer but your present work is a sacrifice to melpomene and he you know never    sir fretful that is no security  a dextrous plagiarist may do any thing  why sir for ought i know he might take out some of the best things in my tragedy and put them into his own comedy   sneer that might be done i dare be sworn   sir fretful and then if such a person gives you the least hint or assistance he is devilish apt to take the merit of the whole    dangle if it succeeds   sir fretful aye  but with regard to this piece i think i can hit that gentleman for i can safely swear he never read it   sneer i will tell you how you may hurt him more    sir fretful how    sneer swear he wrote it   sir fretful plague on it now sneer i shall take it ill  i believe you want to take away my character as an author   sneer then i am sure you ought to be very much obliged to me   sir fretful hey  sir    dangle o you know he never means what he says   sir frteful sincerely then  you do like the piece   sneer wonderfully   sir fretful but come now there must be something that you think might be mended hey  mr dangle has nothing struck you   dangle why faith it is but an ungracious thing for the most part to    sir fretful  with most authors it is just so indeed they are in general strangely tenacious  but for my part i am never so well pleased as when a judicious critic points out any defect to me for what is the purpose of showing a work to a friend if you dont mean to profit by his opinion   sneer very true  why then though i seriously admire the piece upon the whole yet there is one small objection which if you will give me leave i will mention   sir fretful sir you cannot oblige me more   sneer i think it wants incident   sir fretful good god  you surprise me  wants incident    sneer yes i own i think the incidents are too few   sir fretful good god  believe me mr sneer there is no person for whose judgment i have a more implicit deference  but i protest to you mr sneer i am only apprehensive that the incidents are too crowded  my dear dangle how does it strike you   dangle really i cannot agree with my friend sneer  i think the plot quite sufficient and the four first acts by many degrees the best i ever read or saw in my life if i might venture to suggest any thing it is that the interest rather falls off in the fifth    sir fretful  rises i believe you mean sir   dangle no i dont upon my word   sir fretful yes yes you do upon my soul  it certainly dont fall off i assure you  no no it dont fall off   dangle now mrs dangle didnt you say it struck you in the same light   mrs dangle no indeed i did not  i did not see a fault in any part of the play from the beginning to the end   sir fretful upon my soul the women are the best judges after all   mrs dangle or if i made any objection i am sure it was to nothing in the piece but that i was afraid it was on the whole a little too long   sir fretful pray madam do you speak as to duration of time or do you mean that the story is tediously spun out   mrs dangle o lud no  i speak only with reference to the usual length of acting plays   sir fretful then i am very happy  very happy indeed  because the play is a short play a remarkably short play  i should not venture to differ with a lady on a point of taste but on these occasions the watch you know is the critic   mrs dangle then i suppose it must have been mr dangles drawling manner of reading it to me   sir fretful o if mr dangle read it that is quite another affair  but i assure you mrs dangle the first evening you can spare me three hours and an half i will undertake to read you the whole from beginning to end with the prologue and epilogue and allow time for the music between the acts   mrs dangle i hope to see it on the stage next   dangle well sir fretful i wish you may be able to get rid as easily of the newspaper criticisms as you do of ours    sir fretful the newspapers  sir they are the most villainous  licentious  abominable  infernal  not that i ever read them  no  i make it a rule never to look into a newspaper   dangle you are quite right  for it certainly must hurt an author of delicate feelings to see the liberties they take   sir fretful no  quite the contrary  their abuse is in fact the best panegyric  i like it of all things  an authors reputation is only in danger from their support   mr sneer why that is true  and that attack now on you the other day    sir fretful  what where   dangle aye you mean in a paper of thursday it was completely illnatured to be sure   sir fretful o so much the better  ha ha ha  i would not have it otherwise   dangle certainly it is only to be laughed at for    sir fretful  you dont happen to recollect what the fellow said do you   sneer pray dangle  sir fretful seems a little anxious    sir fretful  o lud no  anxious  not i  not the least  i  but one may as well hear you know   dangle sneer do you recollect  make out something  aside sneer i will to dangle  yes yes i remember perfectly   sir fretful well and pray now  not that it signifies  what might the gentleman say   sneer why he roundly asserts that you have not the slightest invention or original genius whatever though you are the greatest traducer of all other authors living   sir fretful ha ha ha  very good   sneer that as to comedy you have not one idea of your own he believes even in your common placebook  where stray jokes and pilfered witticisms are kept with as much method as the ledger of the lostandstolenoffice   sir fretful  ha ha ha  very pleasant   sneer nay that you are so unlucky as not to have the skill even to steal with taste  but that you gleen from the refuse of obscure volumes where more judicious plagiarists have been before you so that the body of your work is a composition of dregs and sediments  like a bad taverns worst wine   sir fretful ha ha   sneer in your more serious efforts he says your bombast would be less intolerable if the thoughts were ever suited to the expression but the homeliness of the sentiment stares through the fantastic encumbrance of it is fine language like a clown in one of the new uniforms   sir fretful ha ha   sneer that your occasional tropes and flowers suit the general coarseness of your style as tambour sprigs would a ground of linseywolfey while your imitations of shakespeare resemble the mimicry of falstaffs page and are about as near the standard of the original   sir fretful ha    sneer  in short that even the finest passages you steal are of no service to you for the poverty of your own language prevents their assimilating so that they lie on the surface like lumps of marl on a barren moor encumbering what it is not in their power to fertilize    sir fretful after great agitation  now another person would be vexed at this   sneer oh but i would not have told you only to divert you   sir fretful i know it  i am diverted  ha ha ha  not the least invention  ha ha ha very good  very good   sneer yes  no genius ha ha ha   dangle a severe rogue ha ha ha but you are quite right sir fretful never to read such nonsense   sir fretful to be sure  for if there is any thing to ones praise it is a foolish vanity to be gratified at it and if it is abuse  why one is always sure to hear of it from one damned good natured friend or another   enter servant sir there is an italian gentleman with a french interpreter and three young ladies and a dozen musicians who say they are sent by lady rondeau and mrs fuge   dangle gadso they come by appointment dear mrs dangle do let them know i will see them directly   mrs dangle you know mr dangle i shall not understand a word they say   dangle but you hear there is an interpreter   mrs dangle well i will try to endure their complaisance till you come  exit servant and mr puff sir has sent word that the last rehearsal is to be this morning and that he will call on you presently   dangle that is true  i shall certainly be at home  exit servant now sir fretful if you have a mind to have justice done you in the way of answer  egad mr puffs your man   sir fretful pshaw sir why should i wish to have it answered when i tell you i am pleased at it   dangle true i had forgot that  but i hope you are not fretted at what mr sneer    sir fretful  zounds no mr dangle dont i tell you these things never fret me in the least   dangle nay i only thought    sir fretful  and let me tell you mr dangle it is damned affronting in you to suppose that i am hurt when i tell you i am not   sneer but why so warm sir fretful   sir fretful gadslife mr sneer you are as absurd as dangle how often must i repeat it to you that nothing can vex me but your supposing it possible for me to mind the damned nonsense you have been repeating to me  and let me tell you if you continue to believe this you must mean to insult me gentlemen  and then your disrespect will affect me no more than the newspaper criticisms  and i shall treat it  with exactly the same calm indifference and philosophic contempt  and so your servant  exit sneer ha ha ha poor sir fretful now will he go and vent his philosophy in anonymous abuse of all modern critics and authors  but dangle you must get you friend puff to take me to the rehearsal of his tragedy   dangle i will answer for it he will thank you for desiring it but come and help me to judge of this musical family they are recommended by people of consequence i assure you   sneer i am at your disposal the whole morning  but i thought you had been a decided critic in music as well as in literature   dangle so i am  but i have a bad ear  efaith sneer though i am afraid we were a little too severe on sir fretful  though he is my friend   sneer why it is certain that unnecessarily to mortify the vanity of any writer is a cruelty which mere dullness never can deserve but where a base and personal malignity usurps the place of literary emulation the aggressor deserves neither quarter nor pity   dangle that is ture egad  though he is my friend   scene ii a drawing room harpsichord etc italian family french interpreter mrs dangle and servants discovered interpreter je dis madame jai lhonneur to introduce

critical talents and transcendant judgment    sneer  dear sir    dangle nay dont be modest sneer my friend puff only talks to you in the style of his profession   sneer his profession   puff yes sir i make no secret of the trade i follow  among friends and brother authors dangle knows i love to be frank on the subject and to advertise myself viva voce  i am sir a practitioner in panegyric or to speak more plainly  a professor of the art of puffing at your service  or any body elses   sneer sir you are very obliging  i believe mr puff i have often admired your talents in the daily prints   puff yes sir i flatter myself i do as much business in that way as any six of the fraternity in town  devilish hard work all the summer  friend dangle never worked harder  but harkee  the winter managers were a little sore i believe   dangle no  i believe they took it all in good part   puff aye  then that must have been affectation in them for egad there were some of the attacks which there was no laughing at   sneer aye the humourous ones  but i should think mr puff that authors would in general be able to do this sort of work for themselves   puff why yes  but in a clumsy way  besides we look on that as an encroachment and so take the opposite side  i dare say now you conceive half the very civil paragraphs and advertisements you see to be written by the parties concerned or their friends  no such thing  nine out of ten manufactured by me in the way of business   sneer indeed    puff even the auctioneers now  the auctioneers i say though the rogues have lately got some credit for their language  not an article of the merit theirs  take them out of their pulpits and they are as dull as catalogues  no sir  twas i first enriched their style  twas i first taught them to crowd their advertisements with panegyrical superlatives each epithet rising above the other  like the bidders in their own auctionrooms from me they learned to enlay their phraseology with variegated chips of exotic metaphor by me too their inventive faculties were called forth  yes sir by me they were instructed to clothe ideal walls with gratuitous fruits  to insinuate obsequious rivulets into visionary groves  to teach courteous shrubs to nod their approbation of the grateful soil or on emergencies to raise upstart oaks where there never had been an acorn to create a delightful vicinage without the assistance of a neighbor or fix the temple of hygeia in the fens of lincolnshire   dangle i am sure you have done them infinite service for now when a gentleman is ruined he parts with his house with some credit   sneer service if they had any gratitude they would erect a statue to him they would figure him as a presiding mercury the god of traffic and fiction with a hammer in his hand instead of a caduceus  but pray mr puff what first put you on exercising your talents in this way   puff egad sir  sheer necessity  the proper parent of an art so nearly allied to invention you must know mr sneer that from the first time i tried my hand at an advertisement my success was such that for sometime after i led a most extraordinary life indeed   sneer how pray   puff sir i supported myself two years entirely by my misfortunes   sneer by your misfortunes   puff yes sir assisted by long sickness and other occasional disorders and a very comfortable living i had of it   sneer from sickness and misfortunes  you practiced as a doctor and an attorney at once   puff no egad both maladies and miseries were my own   sneer hey  what the plague   dangle it is true efaith   puff harkee  by advertisements  to the charitable and humane and to those whom providence has blessed with affluence   sneer oh  i understand you   puff and in truth i deserved what i got for i suppose never man went through such a series of calamities in the same space of time  sir i was five times made a bankrupt and reduced from a state of affluence by a train of unavoidable misfortunes then sir though a very industrious tradesman i was twice burnt out and lost my little all both times  i lived upon those fires a month  i soon after was confined by a most excruciating disorder and lost the use of my limbs  that told very well for i had the case strongly attested and went about to collect the subscriptions myself   dangle egad i believe that was when you first called on me    puff  in november last  o no  i was at that time a close prisoner in the marshalsea for a debt benevolently contracted to serve a friend  i was afterward twice tapped for a dropsy which declined into a very profitable consumption  i was then reduced to  o no  then i became a widow with six helpless children  after having had eleven husbands pressed and being left every time eight months gone with child and without money to get me into an hospital   sneer and you bore all with patience i make no doubt   puff why yes  though i made some occasional attempts at felo de se but as i did not find those rash actions answer i left off killing myself very soon  well sir  at last what with bankruptcies fires gouts dropsies imprisonments and other valuable calamities having got together a pretty handsome sum i determined to quit a business which had always gone rather against my conscience and in a more liberal way still to indulge my talents for fiction and embellishment through my favorite channels of diurnal communication  and so sir you have my history   sneer most obligingly communicative indeed and your confession if published might certainly serve the cause of true charity by rescuing the most useful channels of appeal to benevolence from the cant of imposition  but surely mr puff there is no great mystery in your present profession   puff mystery sir i will take upon me to say the matter was never scientifically treated nor reduced to rule before   sneer reduced to rule   puff o lud sir you are very ignorant i am afraid  yes sir  puffing is of various sorts  the principal are the puff direct  the puff preliminary  the puff collateral  the puff collusive and the puff oblique or puff by implication  these all assume as circumstances require the various forms of letter to the editor  occasional anecdote  impartial critique  observation from correspondent  or advertisement from the party   sneer the puff direct i can conceive    puff o yes that is simple enough  for instance  a new comedy or farce is to be produced at one of the theaters though by the bye they dont bring out half what they ought to do the author suppose mr smatter or mr dapper  or any particular friend of mine  very well the day before it is to be performed i write an account of the manner in which it was received  i have the plot from the author  and only add  characters strongly drawn  highly colored  hand of a master  fund of genuine humor  mine of invention  neat dialogue  attic salt then for the performance  mr dodd was astonishingly great in the character of sir harry that universal and judicious actor mr palmer perhaps never appeared to more advantage than in the colonel  but it is not in the power of language to do justice to mr king  indeed he more than merited those repeated bursts of applause which he drew from a most brilliant and judicious audience as to the scenery  the miraculous power of mr de louther bourgs pencil are universally acknowledged  in short we are at a loss which to admire most  the unrivalled genius of the author the great attention and liberality of the managers  the wonderful abilities of the painter or the incredible exertions of all the performers    sneer that is pretty well indeed sir   puff o cool  quite cool  to what i sometimes do   sneer and do you think there are any who are influenced by this   puff o lud yes sir  the number of those who go through the fatigue of judging for themselves is very small indeed   sneer well sir  the puff preliminary   puff o that sir does well in the form of a caution  in a matter of gallantry now  sir flimsy gossimer wishes to be well with lady fanny fete  he applies to me  i open trenches for him with a paragraph in the morning post  it is recommended to the beautiful and accomplished lady f four stars f dash e to be on her guard against that dangerous character sir f dash g who however pleasing and insinuating his manners may be is certainly not remarkable for the constancy of his attachments  in italics  here you see sir flimsy gossimer is introduced to the particular notice of lady fanny  who perhaps never thought of him before  she finds herself publicly cautioned to avoid him which naturally makes her desirous of seeing him  the observation of their acquaintance causes a pretty kind of mutual embarrassment this produces a sort of sympathy of interest  which if sir flimsy is unable to improve effectually he at least gains the credit of having their names mentioned together by a particular set and in a particular way  which nine times out of ten is the full accomplishment of modern gallantry   dangle egad sneer you will be quite an adept in the business   puff now sir the puff collateral is much used as an appendage to advertisements and may take the form of anecdote  yesterday as the celebrated george bonmot was sauntering down st jamessstreet he met the lively lady mary myrtle coming out of the park  good god lady mary i am surprised to meet you in a white jacket  for i expected never to have seen you but in a fulltrimmed unifor and a lighthorsemans cap  heavens george where could you have learned that  why replied the wit i just saw a print of you in a new publication called the camp magazine which by the bye is a devilish clever thing  and is sold at no   on the right hand of the way two doors from the printingoffice the corner of ivylane paternoster row price only one shilling   sneer very ingenious indeed   puff but the puff collusive is the newest of any for it acts in the disguise of determined hostility  it is much used by bold booksellers and enterprising poets  an indignant correspondent observes  that the new poem called beelzebubs cotillion or proserpines fete champetre is one of the most unjustifiable performances he ever read the severity with which certain characters are handled is quite shocking and as there are many descriptions in it too warmly colored for female delicacy the shameful avidity with which this piece is bought by all people of fashion is a reproach on the taste of the times and a disgrace to the delicacy of the age  here you see the two strongest inducements are held forth  first that nobody ought to read it  and secondly that every body buys it on the strength of which the publisher boldly prints the tenth edition before the had sold ten of the first and then establishes it by threatening himself with the pillory or absolutely indicting himseif for scan mag   dangle ha ha ha  gad i know it is so   puff as to the puff oblique or puff by implication it is too various and extensive to be illustrated by an instance  it attracts in titles and presumes in patents it lurks in the limitation of a subscription and invites in the assurance of crowd and incommodation at public places it delights to draw forth concealed merit with a most disinterested assiduity and sometimes wears a countenance of smiling censure and tender reproach  it has a wonderful memory for parliamentary debates and will often give the whole speech of a favored member with the most flattering accuracy but above all it is a great dealer in reports and suppositions  it has the earliest intelligence of intended preferments that will reflect honor on the patrons and embryo promotions of modest gentlemen  who know nothing of the matter themselves it can hint a ribband for implied services in the air of a common report and with the carelessness of a casual paragraph suggest officers into commands  to which they have no pretension but their wishes this sir is the last principal class in the art of puffing  an art which i hope you will now agree with me is of the highest dignity  yielding a tablature of benevolence and public spirit befriending equally trade gallantry criticism and politics  the applause of genius the register of charity the triumph of heroism the self defense of contractors the fame of orators  and the gazette of ministers   sneer sir i am completely a convert both to the importance and ingenuity of your profession and now sir there is but one thing which can possibly increase my respect for you and that is your permitting me to be present this morning at the rehearsal of your new trage    puff  hush for heavens sake  my tragedy  egad dangle i take this very ill  you know how apprehensive i am of being known to be the author   dangle efaith i would not have told  but it is in the papers and your name at length  in the morning chronicle   puff ah those damned editors never can keep a secret  well mr sneer  no doubt you will do me great honor  i shall be infinitely happy  highly flattered    dangle i believe it must be near the time  shall we go together   fuff no it will not be yet this hour for they are always late at that theater besides i must meet you there for i have some little matters here to send to the papers and a few paragraphs to scribble before i go looking at memorandums   here is a conscientious baker on the subject of the army bread and a detester of visible brickwork in favor of the new invented stucco both in the style of junius and promised for tomorrow  the thames navigation too is at a stand  misomud or antishoal must go to work again directly  here too are some political memorandums i see aye  to take paul jones and get the indiamen out of the shannon  reinforce byron  compel the dutch to  so  i must do that in the evening papers or reserve it for the morning herald for i know that i have undertaken tomorrow besides to establish the unanimity of the fleet in the public advertiser and to shoot charles fox in the morning post  so egad i have not a moment to lose   dangle well  well meet in the green room   exeunt severally end of act i act ii scene i the theater enter dangle puff and sneer as before the curtain puff no no sir what shakespeare says of actors may be better applied to the purpose of plays they ought to be the abstract and brief chronicles of the times therefore when history and particularly the history of our own country furnishes any thing like a case in point to the time in which an author writes if he knows his own interest he will take advantage of it so sir i call my tragedy the spanish armada and have laid the scene before tilbury fort   sneer a most happy thought certainly   dangle egad it was  i told you so  but pray now i dont understand how you have contrived to introduce any love into it   puff love  oh nothing so easy for it is a received point among poets that where history gives you a good heroic outline for a play you may fill up with a little love at your own discretion in doing which nine times out of ten you only make up a deficiency in the private history of the times  now i rather think i have done this with some success   sneer no scandal about queen elizabeth i hope   puff o lud no no  i only suppose the governor of tilbury forts daughter to be in love with the son of the spanish admiral   sneer oh is that all   dangle excellent efaith  i see it at once  but will not this appear rather improbable   puff to be sure it will  but what the plague a play is not to show occurrences that happen every day but things just so strange that though they never did they might happen   sneer certainly nothing is unnatural that is not physically impossible   puff very true  and for that matter don ferolo wiskerandos  for that is the lovers name might have been over here in the train of the spanish ambassador or tilburina for that is the ladys name might have been in love with him from having heard his character or seen his picture or from knowing that he was the last man in the world she ought to be in love with  or for any other good female reason  however sir the fact is that though she is but a knights daughter egad she is in love like any princess   dangle poor young lady i feel for her already for i can conceive how great the conflict must be between her passion and her duty her love for her country and her love for don ferolo wiskerandos   puff o amazing  her poor susceptible heart is swayed to and fro by contending passions like    enter under prompter under prompter sir the scene is set and every thing is ready to begin if you please    puff egad then well lose no time   under prompter though i believe sir you will find it very short for all the performers have profited by the kind permission you granted them   puff hey what   under prompter you know sir you gave them leave to cut out or omit whatever they found heavy or unnecessary to the plot and i must own they have taken very liberal advantage of your indulgence   puff well well  they are in general very good judges and i know i am luxuriant  now mr hopkins as soon as you please   under prompter to the music gentlemen will you play a few bars of something just to    puff aye that is right  for as we have the scenes and dresses egad well go to it as if it was the first nights performance  but you need not mind stopping between the acts  exit under prompter orchestra play then the bell rings soh stand clear gentlemen  now you know there will be a cry of down  down  hats off silence  then up curtain  and let us see what our painters have done for us  scene ii the curtain rises and discovers tilbury fort two sentinels asleep dangle tilbury fort  very fine indeed   puff now what do you think i open with   sneer faith i cannot guess    puff a clock  hark   clock strikes i open with a clock striking to beget an aweful attention in the audience  it also marks the time which is four oclock in the morning and saves a description of the rising fun and a great deal about gilding the eastern hemisphere   dangle but pray are the sentinels to be asleep   puff fast as watchmen   sneer is not that odd though at such an alarming crisis   puff to be sure it is  but smaller things must give way to a striking scene at the opening that is a rule  and the case is that two great men are coming to this very spot to begin the piece now it is not to be supposed they would open their lips if these fellows were watching them so egad i must either have sent them off their posts or set them asleep   sneer o that accounts for it  but tell us who are these coming    puff these are they  sir walter raleigh and sir christopher hatton  you will know sir christopher by his turning out his toes  famous you know for his dancing i like to preserve all the little traits of character  now attend   enter sir walter raleigh and sir christopher hatton sir christopher true gallant raleigh   dangle what they had been talking before   puff o yes all the way as they came along  i beg pardon gentlemen to the actors but these are particular friends of mine whose remarks may be of great service to us  dont mind interrupting them whenever any thing strikes you   to sneer and dangle sir christopher true gallant raleigh but o thou champion of thy countrys fame there is a question which i yet must ask a question which i never asked before  what mean these mighty armaments this general muster and this throng of chiefs  sneer pray mr puff how came sir christopher hatton never to ask that question before   puff what before the play began how the plague could he   dangle that is true efaith   puff but you will hear what he thinks of the matter   sir christopher alas my noble friend when i behold yon tented plains in martial symmetry arrayed  when i count over yon glittering lines of crested warriors where the proud steeds neigh and valorbreathing trumpets shrill appeal responsive vibrate on my listening ear when virgin majesty herself i view like her protecting pallas veiled in steel with graceful confidence exhort to arms when briefly all i hear or see bears stamp of martial vigilance and stern defense i cannot but surmise  forgive my friend if the conjectures rash  i cannot but surmise  then state some danger apprehends  sneer a very cautious conjecture that   puff yes that is his character not to give an opinion but on secure grounds  now then   sir walter o most accomplished christopher  puff he calls him by his christian name to show that they are on the most familiar terms   sir walter o most accomplished christopher i find thy staunch sagacity still tracks the future in the fresh print of the oertaken past  puff figurative   sir walter thy fears are just  sir christopher but where whence when and what the danger is  methinks i fain would learn  sir walter you know my friend scarce two revolving suns and three revolving moons have closed their course since haughty philip in despite of peace with hostile hand has struck at englands trade  sir christopher i know it well  sir walter philip you know is proud iberias king  sir christopher he is  sir walter  his subjects in base bigotry and catholic oppression held  while we you know the protestant persuasion hold  sir christopher we do  sir walter you know beside  his boasted armament the famed armada  by the pope baptized with purpose to invade these realms   sir christopher  is sailed our last advices so report  sir walter while the iberian admirals chief hope his darling son   sir christopher  ferolo wiskerandos hight   sir walter the same  by chance a prisoner has been taken and in this fort of tilbury   sir christopher  is now confined  it is true and often from you tall turrets top i have marked the youthful spaniards haughty mien unconquered though in chains  sir walter you also know   dangle  mr puff as he knows all this why does sir walter go on telling him   puff but the audience are not supposed to know any thing of the matter are they   sneer true but i think you manage ill for there certainly appears no reason why sir walter should be so communicative   puff for egad now that is one of the most ungrateful observations i ever heard  for the less inducement he has to tell all ths the more i think you ought to be obliged to him for i am sure you would know nothing of the matter without it   dangle that is very true upon my word   puff but you will find he was not going on   sir christopher enough enough  it is plain  and i no more am in amazement lost   puff here now you see sir christopher did not in fact ask any one question for his own information   sneer no indeed  his has been a most disinterested curiosity   dangle really i find we are very much obliged to them both   puff to be sure you are now then for the commander in chief the earl of leicester who you know was no favorite but of the queens  we left off  in amazement lost    sir christopher am in amazement lost  but see where noble leicester comes supreme in honors and command  sir walter and yet methinks at such a time so perilous so feared that staff might well become an abler grasp  sir christopher and so by heaven think i but soft he is here  puff aye they envy him   sneer but who are these with him   puff o very valiant knights one is the governor of the fort the other the master of the horse  and now i think you shall hear some better language i was obliged to be plain and intelligible in the first scene because there was so much matter of fact in it but now efaith you have trope figure and metaphor as plenty as nounsubstantives   enter earl of leicester the governor and others leicester how is this my friends is it thus your new fledged zeal and plumed valor moulds in roostedsloth why dimly glimmers that heroic flame whose redning blaze by patriot spirit fed should be the beacon of a kindling realm can the quick current of a patriot heart thus stagnate in a cold and weedy converse or freeze in tideless inactivity no rather let the fountain of your valor spring through each stream of enterprise each petty channel of conducive daring till the full torrent of your foaming wrath overwhelm the flats of sunk hostility  puff there it is  followed up   sir walter no more the freshning breath of thy rebuke has filled the swelling canvass of our souls and thus though fate should cut the cable of all take hands our topmost hopes in friendships closing line well grapple with despair and if we fall well fall in glorys wake  earl of leicester there spoke old englands genius then are we all resolved  all we are  all resolved  earl of leicester to conquer  or be free  all to conquer or be free  earl of leicester all  all all  dangle nem con egad   puff o yes where they do agree on the stage their unanimity is wonderful   earl of leicester then let us embrace  and now   sneer what the plague is he going to pray   puff yes hush  in great emergencies there is nothing like a prayer   earl of leicester o mighty mars  dangle but why should he pray to mars   puff hush  earl of leicester if in thy homage bred each point of discipline i have still observed nor but by due promotion and the right of service to the rank of major general have risen assist thy votary now  governor yet do not rise  hear me  master of horse and me  knight and me  sir walter and me  sir christopher and me  puff now pray all together   all behold thy votaries submissive beg that thou will deign to grant them all they ask assist them to accomplish all their ends and sanctify whatever means they use to gain them  sneer a very orthodox quintetto   puff vastly well gentlemen  is that well managed or not have you such a prayer as that on the stage   sneer not exactly  earl of leicester to puff but sir you havnt settled how we are to get off here   puff you could not go off kneeling could you  sir walter to puff o no sir impossible   puff it would have a good effect efaith if you could exeunt praying  yes and would vary the established mode of springing off with a glance at the pit   sneer o never mind so as you get them off i will answer for it the audience wont care how   puff well then repeat the last line standing and go off the old way   all and sanctify whatever means we use to gain them  exeunt dangle bravo a fine exit   sneer well really mr puff    puff stay a moment    the sentinels get up  st sentinel all this shall to lord burleighs ear   d sentinel it is meet it should  exeunt sentinels dangle hey  why i thought those fellows had been asleep   puff only a pretense there is the art of it they were spies of lord burleighs   sneer  but is not it odd they were never taken notice of not even by the commander in chief   puff o lud sir if people who want to listen or overhear were not always connived at in a tragedy there would be no carrying on any plot in the world   dangle that is certain   puff but take care my dear dangle the morning gun is going to fire  cannon fires dangle well that will have a fine effect   puff i think so and helps to realize the scene   cannon twice what the plague  three morning guns  there never is but one  aye this is always the away at the theater  give these fellows a good thing and they never know when to have done with it you have no more cannon to fire   prompter from within no sir   puff now then for soft music   sneer pray what is that for   puff it shows that tilburina is coming nothing introduces you a heroine like soft music  here she comes   dangle and her confidant i suppose   puff to be sure here they are  inconsolable to the minuet in ariadne  soft music enter tilburina and confidant tilburina now has the whispering breath of gentle morn bad natures voice and natures beauty rise while orient phoebus with unborrowd hues clothes the waked loveliness which all night slept in heavenly drapery darkness is fled now flowers unfold their beauties to the sun and blushing kiss the beam he sends to wake them the stripped carnation and the guarded rose the vulgar wall flower and smart gillyflower the polyanthus mean  the dapper daizy sweet william and sweet marjorum  and all the tribe of single and of double pinks now too the feathered warblers tune their notes around and charm the listening grove  the lark the linnet chafinch bullfinch goldfinch

mourned loves fatal dart  else would thou know that when the soul is sunk in comfortless despair it cannot taste of merryment  dangle that is certain   confidant but see where your stern father comes it is not meet that he should find you thus  puff hey what the plague  what a cut is here  why what is become of the description of her first meeting with don wiskerandos his gallant behavior in the sea fight and the simile of the canary bird   tilburina indeed sir you will find they will not be missed  puff very well  very well  tilburina the cue maam if you please  confidant it is not meet that he should find you thus  tilburina thou counselst right but it is no easy task for barefaced grief to wear a mask of joy  enter governor how is this  in tears  o tilburina shame is this a time for maudling tenderness and cupids baby woes  have thou not heard that haughty spains popeconsecrated fleet advances to our shores while englands fate like a clipped guinca trembles in the scale  tilburina then is the crisis of my fate at hand i see the fleets approach  i see   puff now pray gentlemen mind  this is one of the most useful figures we tragedy writers have by which a hero or heroine in consideration of their being often obliged to overlook things that are on the stage is allowed to hear and see a number of things that are not   sneer yes  a kind of poetical secondsight   puff yes  now then madam   tilburina i see their decks are cleared  i see the signal made the line is formed  a cables length asunder i see the frigates stationd in the rear and now i hear the thunder of the guns i hear the victors shouts  i also hear the vanquished groan  and now it is smoke  and now i see the loose sails shiver in the wind i see  i see  what soon you will see   governor hold

they have got to myself   tilburina indeed sir you will find it will connect very well   and your reward secure  puff o  if they hadnt been so devilish free with their cutting here you would have found that don wiskerandos has been tampering for his liberty and has persuaded tilburina to make this proposal to her father  and now pray observe the conciseness with which the argument is conducted egad the pro and con goes as smart a hits in a fencing match it is indeed a sort of smallsword logic which we have borrowed from the french   tilburina a retreat in spain  governor outlawry here

you live have two plots to your tragedy  the grand point in managing them is only to let your under plot have as little connection with your main plot as possible  i flatter myself nothing can be more distinct than mine for as in my chief plot the characters are all great people  i have laid my under plot in low life  and as the former is to end in deep distress i make the other end as happy as a farce  now mr hopkins as soon as you please   enter under prompter under prompter sir the carpenter says it is impossible you can go to the park scene yet   puff the park scene no  i mean the description scene here in the wood   under prompter sir the performers have cut it out   puff cut it out   under prompter yes sir   puff what the whole account of queen elizabeth   under prompter yes
