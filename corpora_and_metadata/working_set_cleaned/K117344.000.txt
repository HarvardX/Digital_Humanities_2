the journey from chester to london east gate chester   london printed for b white fleet street mdcclxxxii  advertisement the ground which is described in the following sheets has been for some centuries passed over by the incurious traveller and has had the hard fortune of being constantly execrated for its dullness to retort the charge and clear it from the calumny is my present business

before the journey to london in march    0 i began my annual journey to london at chester some improvements had taken place since my last account of the city a very commodious building has been erected in the yatchfield near the watergate street for the sale of the irish linen at the two fairs it surrounds a large square area on each side of which are piazzas with numbers of shops well adapted for the purpose  in digging the foundation for certain houses near the street were discovered some roman buildings and a large hypocaust with its several conveniences and some other antiquities particularly a beautiful altar engraven in moses griffiths supplemental plates to the tours in wales tab x  dedicated fortunae reduci et aesculapio much of its inscription is defaced but the rudder cornucopia rod serpent and various sacrificial instruments are in good preservation  on leaving the city i passed under the fine arch of the east gate a work owing to the munificence of lord grosvenor  boughton boughton a suburb in the parish of st oswald a little disjoined from this part of the city had before the dissolution an hospital tanner    for poor lepers as early as the beginning of edward ii from an eminence the retreat of the unfortunate brave is a view of very uncommon beauty of two fine reaches of the dee bounded on one part by meadows and hanging woods on the other terminated by part of the city the ancient bridge and over it a distant view of the cambrian hills  adjoining to that part of boughton which is within the liberties of the city is the township of boughton in the county of chester the inhabitants of which appear at the court of the dean and chapter of chester and pay there a chief rent but usually clame and dispose of the wastes  near the two miles stone i crossed the canal to christleton a pretty village seated as usual with those of cheshire on the freestone rock cristetone as it is called in the doomsday book was held before the conquest by earl edwin at that event probably it had a chapel or very soon after this manor had been bestowed by hugh lupus on robert fitz hugh one of his followers who gave the chapel of cristentune with the land belonging to it and the land of a certain peasant with the peasant himself to the abbey of chester dugdale mon i  0   his great great granddaughter isabel wife of sir philip burnet joined with her husband in suing the abbey for this and some other contiguous manors it is probable that the monks might have taken an advantage of a fit of remorse for some crime or the weakness of an illness to obtain this gift from her ancestor they thought fit to compromise the matter with her and on payment of two hundred pounds received in    0 the ninth of edward i a confirmation of the grant and at the same time full liberty was given to the abbot to make a reservoir of water and to convey it to the abbey  in the year      free warren william de birmingham had free warren given him of all his demesne lands in this village but it is apprehended he was only an inferior lord to the paramount privileges of the abbey in the saxon times every man was allowed to kill game on his own estate but on the conquest the king vested the property of all the game in himself so that no one could sport even on his own land under most cruel penalties without permission from the king by grant of a chase or free warren by this the grantee had an exclusive power of killing game on his own estate but it was on condition that he prevented every one else so that as our learned commentator judge blackstone observes this seeming favor was intended for the preservation of the beasts and fowls of warren which were roes hares and rabbits partridge rails and quails woodcocks and pheasants mallards and herons for the sport of our savage monarchs this liberty which they allowed to a few individuals being designed merely to prevent a general destruction  christleton passed from the birminghams in richard iis time to sir hugh brower sir hugh lost it by his attachment to the house of york and henry the ivth in the fourth year of his reign bestowed it on john manwaring of over peover an attendant on his son afterward henry v leicester      manwaring having no lawful issue bestowed this place on sir thomas le grosvenor lord of hulme but it passed immediately from him to john de macclesfield in the  0th of henry v one of his descendants alienated it in      or the   st of henry vi to humphrey afterward duke of buckingham henry lord stafford son to edward duke of buckingham sold it to sir william sneyde of keel and sir ralph sneyde to sir john harpur of swerston in derbyshire one of whose descendants sold it to thomas brock esquire the present lord of the manor the living is a rectory in the disposal of sir roger mostyn the church dedicated to st james  from hence i took the horseroad across brownheath by hockenball formerly the seat of a family of the same name the rising country to the left of this road appears to great advantage opposing to the traveller a fair front beautifully clumped with selfplanted groves  passed over a brook and reached the small town of tarvin which still retains nearly its british name terfn or the boundary and is so to the forest of delamere in doomsday book it is styled terve the bishop at that time held it it then contained six taxable hides of land the bishop kept on it six cowmen three radmen seven villeyns seven boors and six ploughlands the first were to keep his cattle the second to attend his person in his travels or to go wheresoever he pleased to send them the third by their tenure to cultivate his lands and the fourth to supply his table with poultry eggs and other small matters the ploughland or caruca was as much as one plough could work in the year this shows the establishment of a manor in those early times which i mention now to prevent repetition  in henry vis time the village and manor were estimated at l   a year and were held by reginald bishop of lichfield in the same manner as they were held by his predecessors under the prince of wales as earl of chester they continued possessed by them till the reign of queen elizabeth when they were alienated to sir john savage who procured for the town the privilege of a market the church is a rectory and still continues part of the sea of lichfield being a prebendary originally founded about the year      by alexander de stavenby bishop of that diocese it is valued at l      s   d the highest endowment of any prebend in that cathedral it is called the prebend of tarvin which presents to the living  the same prelate also bestowed this church on the viceprebendal church of burton in wiral anglia sacra i      and formed out of its revenues an hospital for shipwrecked persons this hospital was probably at burton tarvin being too remote from the sea for so humane a design  against the churchwall is a monument in memory of mr john thomasine thirtysix years master of the grammar school the epitaph deservedly celebrates the performances of this exquisite penman as highly excelling in all the varieties of writing and wonderfully so in the greek characters specimens of his ingenuity are treasured up not only in the cabinets of the curious but in public libraries throughout the kingdom he had the honor to transcribe for her majesty queen anne the icon basilike of her royal grandfather invaluable copies also of pindar anacreon theocritus epictetus hippocratess aphorisms and that finished piece the shield of achilles as described by homer are among the productions of his celebrated pen  as his incomparable performances acquired him the esteem and patronage of the great and learned so his affability and humanity gained him the good will of all his acquaintance and the decease of so much private worth is regretted as a public loss  from tarvin i travel on the great road and at about two miles distance leave on the right stapleford which retains the name it had at the conquest when it was held by radulpus venator from hugh lupus after a long interval it fell to the breretons in      or the second of richard ii it was held by sir william brereton of the king as earl of chester from that family it passed to the bruyns and was purchased by the late randle wilbraham esquire  two miles farther on the left stood utkinton hall the manor with kingsley and the baileywick of the forest of delamere was given by randle meschines earl of chester to randle de kingsley whose great granddaughter joan about the year      conveyed it to the dones richard done was possessed of it in      the sixth of edward ii he held it by a quarter part of a knights fee and the master forestership of mere delamere and mottram by himself and a horseman and eight footmen under him to keep that forest then valued at l 0  0 s   d  upon the failure of issue male of sir john done in the beginning of the last century the manor of utkinton came to his daughters and has been since held by them or persons claming under them mary the second daughter married in      john second son of sir randle crew of crew and elinor the younger to ralph arderne esquire  the dones of flaxyard in this neighborhood were another considerable family at constant feud with the former till the houses were united by the nuptials of the heir of flaxyard with the heiress of utkinton but at this time both those ancient seats are demolished or turned into farmhouses  from hence i soon reached torporley a small town seated on a gentle descent it had once been a borough town of which richard francis was mayor in the twentieth of edward i in the tenth of the same reign hugh de tarpoley had license to hold a market here every tuesday and a fair on the vigil the feast day and the day after the exaltation of the holy cross but he alienated this privilege with his property to reginald de gray chief justice of chester  in the eighth of richard ii this manor was divided into two moieties one of which was held by john done the other by reginald gray of the family of lord gray of ruthin  the manor and rectory of torporley are now divided into six shares four belong to the arderns one to the dean and chapter of chester and another to philip egerton esquire of oulton  the living is a rectory in the gift of john ardern esquire the church is dedicated to st helen the empress of constantius the daughter of coel a british prince a popular saint among us if we may judge from the number of churches under her protection that in question is of no great antiquity in respect to the building nor yet of beauty within is much waste of good marble in monumental vanity  the best are two monuments in the chancel seemingly copied from halflength portraits included in carved borders of marble in imitation of frames the figures are included in them in mezzorelievo the one of sir john done knight hereditary forester and keeper of the forest of delamere who died in      his figure is picturesque in a laced jacket and a horn in his hand the badge of his office which horn descended to the different owners of the estate and is now in the possession of john ardern esquire  when that nimrod james i made a progress in      he was entertained by this gentleman at utkinton who ordered so wisely and contentfully says king vale royal ii  0  his highnesss sports that james conferred on him the honor of knighthood he married dorothy daughter of thomas wilbraham esquire of woodhey who left behind her so admirable a character that to this day when a cheshire man would express some excellency in one of the fair sex he would say there is lady done for you  the other is of john crew esquire second son of sir randle crew of crew knight married to mary daughter of sir john done his face is represented in profile with long hair he died    0  his lady and her elder sister jane done an ancient virgin lie at full length in the utkinton chapel with long and excellent characters one lies recumbent the other reclined and strait laced which give little grace in statuary jane died in      mrs crew in    0 aged     sir john crew knight son of mr john crew lies reclined on an altartomb with a vast perriwig and a roman dress with a whimpering genius at head and feet sir john married first mary daughter of thomas wagstaff of tachbrook in warwickshire esquire and for his second mary daughter of sir willughby aston of aston baronet he died in      aged     i must not quit this place without letting fall a few tears as a tribute to the memory of its honest rector john allen whose antiquarian knowledge and hospitality i have often experienced on this great thoroughfare to the capital from the ancient rectorial house at the bottom of the town is an aweful view of the great rock of beeston backed by the peckfreton hills tempting me to take a nearer survey  the distance is about two miles in my way i crossed the canal at beeston bridge and called at the poor remains of beeston hall the manorhouse inhabited by the agent for the estate this place was burnt by prince rupert during the civil wars there is a tradition that he had dined that day with the lady of the house after dinner he told her that he was sorry that he was obliged to make so bad return to her hospitality advised her to secure any valuable effects she had for he must order the house to be burnt that night least it should be garrisoned by the enemy  this manor had been part of the barony of malpas and was held under the lords by the family of de bunbury who changed their norman name st pierre and assumed that of the place where they first settled  in      or the fiftysixth of henry iii henry de bunbury and margery his wife gave it to their nephew richard who made the place his residence and assumed its name it continued in his family for many generations sir george beeston possessed it in the fortyfourth of queen elizabeth at length by the marriage of margaret daughter of sir hugh beeston with william whitemore of leighton it was conveyed into that house and as suddenly transferred by bridget heiress of mr whitemore to darcie savage second son to thomas viscount savage of rock savage whose granddaughter another bridget brought it by marriage to sir thomas mostyn baronet with the lordships of peckfreton leighton and thornton in whose house they still remain this lady was a roman catholic tradition is warm in her praise and full of her domestic virtues and the particular attention that she showed in obliging her domestics of each religion to attend their respective churches her husband and she were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they died within a day or two of each other at gloddaeth in caernarvonshire and were interred in the neighboring church of eglwys rbos  at a small distance from the hall is the great insulated rock of beeston composed of sandstone very lofty and precipitous at one end and sloped down into the flat country at the other its height from beeston bridge to the summit is three hundred and sixtysix feet from the summit is a most extensive view on every part except where interrupted by the peckfreton hills the land appears deeply indented by the estuary of the dee and mersey and the canal from chester appears a continued slender line of water from that city to almost the base of this eminence to this beeston castle place its utility has been proved to all the marketwomen of the neighboring farmers who have the benefit of treckschuyts to convey their merchandise to their capital a few coals also come up and a little timber and these form the sum of their present commerce  this rock is crowned with the ruins of a strong fortress beeston castle which rose in the year    0 founded by randle blondeville earl of chester on his return out of the holy land for which purpose and for the building of chartley castle he raised a tax upon all his estates polychronicon cccvi  at that time it belonged to the lords of the manor of beeston from whom he obtained leave to erect his castle it devolved afterward to the crown for according to erdeswick polychronicon cccvi r hugh beeston purchased it from queen elizabeth and restored it to his lordship  it had been a place of very great strength the access about midway of the slope was defended by a great gateway and a strong wall fortified with round towers which ran from one edge of the precipice to the other across the slope but never surrounded the hill as is most erroneously represented in the old prince some of the walls and about six or seven rounders still ist a square tower part of the gateway is also standing thn this cincture is a large area perhaps four or five acres in xtent near the top is the castle defended on this side by an amazing ditch cut out of the live rock on the other by the upt precipice that hangs over the vale of cheshire  the entrance is through a noble gateway guarded on each e by a great rounder whose walls are of a prodigious thickness within the yard is a rectangular building the chapel of the place the drawwell was of a most surprising depth being sunk through the higher part of the rock to the level of beeston brook that runs beneath in the area just mentioned was another well both at this time are filled up but king remembered the first to have been eighty the other ninetyone yards deep although the last is said to have been half filled with stones and rubbish  we are quite unacquainted with the events that befell this strong hold for several centuries after its foundation slow aais     says that richard ii lodged here his great treasures during his expedition into ireland and garrisoned it with an hundred men of arms chosen and able who on the approach of henry duke of lancester yielded it to the usurper but other historians assert his treasures were placed in the castle of holt  the fortress certainly fell in ruins soon after this reign for ireland in his poem on the birth of edward vi speaks of it as such when he makes foam to alight on its summit and foretell its restoration  eplicuit dehine fana suas perniciter alas altaque fulmia  jovis atria victrix circuiens liquidi spatiosa volumina coeli tum quoque duspexit terram sublimis ocellcs sidereos sigens bisduni in moenia casiri etc thence to joves palace she prepared to fly with outstretchd pions through the yielding sky wide over the  of the ample space surveyed the subject earth and human race tae roal iii sublime in air she cast her radiant eyes where farfamd beestons airy turrets rise high on a rock it stood whence all around each fruitful valley and each rising ground in beauteous prospect lay these scenes to view descending swift the wondering goddess flew perched on the topmost pinnacle she shook her sounding plumes and thus in rapture spoke from syrian climes the conquering randolph came whose wellfought fields bear record of his name to guard his country and to check his foes by randolphs hands this glorious fabric rose though now in ruined heaps thy bulwarks lie revolving time shall raise those bulwarks high if faith to ancient prophecies be due then edward shall thy pristine state renew r w the castle was restored to its former strength between the days of leland and the sad contentions betwixt the king and parliament in the times of charles i it was first possessed by the parliament sig but on the   th of september      was taken by the royalists under the famous partizan captain sandford who scaled the steep sides of the rock and took it by surprise genethliacon eaduardi pr walliae l      steel the governor was suspected of treachery tried and shot to death  the parliament made a vigorous attempt to recover a place of such importance and besieged it for seventeen weeks during which time it was gallantly defended by captain valet at length on the approach of prince rupert the enemy abandoned the attack on the   th of march      ms account mr gross article beeston   in the following year it was taken after a most vigorous defense of eighteen weeks the defendants were reduced to the necessity of eating cats etc when the brave colonel ballard out of mere compassion to the poor remains of his garrison consented to beat a parley and obtained the most honorable conditions far beyond what would be expected in such extremity viz to march out the governor and officers with their horses and arms and their own proper goods which loaded two wagons the common soldiers with colors flying drums beating matches alight aproportion of cannon and ball and a convoy to guard them to flint castle on sunday the   th of march he surrendered the castle to sir william brereton and according to articles marched out with his men now reduced to about sixty rushworth vol i part   p      the fortress soon after underwent the fate of the other seats of loyalty  from beeston castle i continued my journey about two miles to bunbury a village bunbury and the seat of the parish church this was the boliberie of doomsday book which with several neighboring places in the ancient hundred of riseton now comprehended in that of ledesbury were possessed by robert fitzhugh the family who assumed the name of the place held it under him and his successors till humphrey dying without issue his sisters ameria and joan became coheiresses amerias share came to the patricks and from them to the st piers at length isabel daughter and heiress of uriam st pier brought it by marriage to sir walter  who sold his share of the advowson of the church to the famous sir hugh de calvely joans moiety came to her son alexander who still continued the name de bunbury sir hugh de calvely obtaining likewise the other share of the church erected here a college for a master and six chaplains for which purpose he obtained license dated march   th      from richard ii on paying to the king the sum of forty pounds it was instituted for the good state of the king and of sir hugh as long as they lived and on their death for the souls of them and their progenitors and those of all the faithful dugdale monast iii part   p

alienated his share to the bunburies in the thirtysecond of henry viii richard bunbury was lord of the manor from whom the family of the bunburies of stanny in wirral and the present sir charles is lineally descended  the church is a handsome building embattled church and the tower ornamented with pinnacles the architecture seems of the time of henry vii it is dedicated to st boniface from whom the place takes its name whether the patron was boniface an englishman first archbishop of mentz who died in     or pope boniface the first who died in     i cannot determine for both received their apotheosis  the church is distinguished by the magnificent tomb of sir hugh de calvely tomb whose effigies in white marble lies on it recumbent he is armed in the fashion of the times and to give an idea of his vast prowess his figure is represented seven feet and a half long he was the arthur of cheshire the glory of the county accordingly the most prodigious seats are recorded of him whether like milo he could kill a bull with a blow of his fist is not said but our ballads give sir hugh no more than the honor of devouring a calf at a meal his head rests on a helmet with a calfs head for the crest allusive to his name yet probably gave rise to the fable  sir hugh sprung from a neighboring hamlet of which i shall have occasion to speak from whence he took his surname according to the cast of the times he fought adventures in the military line and like a soldier of fortune first appeared a principal commander of the grandes compagnies tard venus or malandrins a species of banditti formed out of the disbanded soldiery of different nations on the captivity of king john at the battle of poitiers they amounted at lest to above forty thousand veteran troops they lived upon plunder yet were ready to join the side most adverse to france at the battle of auray in      sir hugh froissart i chapter ccxxvi served with a considerable body of them under the english general lord chandos and had the honor of turning the fortune of the day in which was taken the great de gueselin  in      sir hugh was won over by that illustrious general again at the head of the armies of france to join him in an expedition into spain to dethrone peter the cruel king of castile the enterprise was successful but on the express command of edward iii to lord chandos sir hugh de calvely and others of his subjects leaders of the companies to forbear hostilities rymer vi   0 against peter they deserted the quarrel they had espoused and on the appearance of the black prince in spain who to his disgrace took part with the tyrant sir hugh and a great body of the companies joined him the prince reinstated peter on the throne after the great victory of najara over his rival henry of trastamare to which the bravery of sir hugh and his troops was highly contributory on the recall of the black prince by his father in      sir hugh was left commander of the companies history gives him a royal consort in reward of his valor and marries him to the queen of arragon if at this period he took a most antiquated piece of royalty for i can find no other dowager of that kingdom unless leonora relict of alonso iv who became a widow in      was then alive there was no issue by this match salusbury pedigrees    but by his second wife heiress to mottram lord of mottram his line was continued  in      the last year of edward iii he was appointed to the important government of calais hist calais ii    in      he plundered and burnt la bas bentagne with several vessels which lay in harbor he also retook the castle of mark lost before by neglect in      he resigned the place to the earl of salusbury and was appointed by richard ii admiral of his fleet rymer vii       in      we find him governor of guernsey and the adjacent isles the last mention we find of him is in a cause that was to be determined in      ryneer vii      after which history is silent in respect to this hero fuller remarks it was as impossible for such a spirit not to be as not to be active probably old age might subdue his enterprizing soul for i find that he lived to the reign of henry iv two visitations of cheshire etc mss in my possession one in      the other in    0  but mention is made of the weak state of his body in rymers record of the cause this satisfies me that his royal consort was not syhilla fortia relict of perdo fourth king of arragon who lost her spouse in      as was suggested to me by a most ingenious friend   this tomb is kept always very neat which is owing to the piety of dame mary calveley of lea who in   0  left the interest of an hundred pounds to be distributed annually among certain poor of this parish on condition they attended divine service while they were able and swept the chancel and cleaned the monument  the ridley chapel founded in      belonging to the egertons of ridley is separated from the church by a woodwork skreen painted this had been their place of interment but nothing monumental remains unless the impression of a plate of a kneeling man against one of the walls  in the chancel is a recumbent figure of sir george beeston who died in   00 this monument was erected by his son sir hugh the last male of this ancient line who for some time survived his only son george he died in    0   at a small distance from bunbury i fell into the great road opposite to alpram a hamlet whose name is corrupted from the saxon alburgham in the doomsday book in aftertimes it was the seat of the pages now extinct  a little farther lies calvely long the property of that illustrious family now likewise lost the place was bestowed on a hugh by richard vernon baron of shipbrook about the time of richard i in edward the ilis time it came to the davenports by the marriage of arthur to catharine daughter and heiress of robert de calvely in which family it has continued till the present time  my road lay along the low unpleasant lane that led toward nantwich the prospect frequently deformed by the great fosses of the unfortunate canal falling in on each side of the road for it crosses at barbridge and is finished from thence to nantwich this was only a secondary consideration executed on the hopes of considerable profit in the carriage of salt and cheese the original and principal object was to continue the main trunk by church minshul to the great staffordshire canal near middlewich and by that means share in the freight of the goods of the opposite side of the kingdom but various causes have frustrated all hopes of that benefit and this part of the plan remains unattempted  at acton the prospect mends a little that village acton with its handsome new church stand on a small rising and command another great extent of flat beyond nantwich this place earl morkars before the conquest was possessed by morkar the gallant brother of the gallant earl edwin last earl of mercia at that time the hundred it lay in was called warmundestreu at present namptwich actune as it is styled in the doomsday book was a very considerable place there were eight hides of land taxable there were thirty ploughlands in the lords demesne three two servants thirteen villeyns and fifteen boors with seven ploughlands a mill for the use of the court  curiae and ten acres of meadow a wood six leagues long and one broad an aerie of hawks two presbyters who had a ploughland two aliens having a ploughland and a half a servant six villeyns seven boors with four ploughlands  this not only shows the greatness of this saxon manor but that it was the seat of morkar by the provision made for his support the tenants had likewise the right of pleas in the hall of their lord and one house in which nantwich where they might make salt without interruption in the time of the confessor the manor was valued at ten pounds a year at the conquest at only six it may be observed once for all that the troubles occasioned at that event and the ravages committed instantly sunk the value of the land  at the conquest this place was a member of the barony of which malhang or nantwich hugh second lord of nantwich bestowed the advowson of the living with the lands belonging on the abbey of cumbermere which he had founded in      dugdale monast ii       the third or last baron had only daughters among whom the estates were divided and acton sell to the share of alinora the eldest whose daughter joan marrying lord lovel it remained in that line as late as      the thirteenth of richard ii when it was possessed by sir john lovel it was afterward the property of the arderns sir leonard ardorn was lord of it in   0  the ninth of henry iv  in      the fourteenth henry vii and in      the thirtythird of henry viii it was in the heirs of ralph ardens in the reign of queen mary it was the property of the wilbrahams of woodhey in this parish and at present belongs to wilbraham tollemache esquire by virtue of the marriage of grace eldest daughter of sir richard wilbraham baronet with his ancestor lionel earl of dysart  about twenty years ago church the steeple and roof of the church were destroyed but the whole has since been restored in a very handsome manner one monument is in good preservation notwithstanding this church was a temporary prison after the battle of nantwich in the civil wars of charles i but the prisoners were of the party which respected these memorials of the dead  the most ancient is one in st marys chapel in memory of sir william manwaring of over pever and of badely in this neighborhood this knight before his departure on an expedition to guienne in      settled his estate and next year made his will by which he bequeaths his body to this church and orders a picture in alabaster to cover his tomb he also left to the same church part of christs cross which the wife of his halfbrother had shut up in wax and a competent salary for a chaplain to say a competent number of masses in st marys chapel for

tomb in acton church and flowing perriwigs cut out of the parian blocks or adding the great wig to the absurdity of the roman habit  the church had been long the place of sepulture of the houses of woodhey and badeley the vain attention of our forefathers to posthumous honors and superstitious rites is well exemplified from the probate of the will of william wilbraham of woodhey who died in      by which he bequeaths his body to be buried before the image of our lady in the chancel of the church of acton and bestows x  to be laid out on a tenor bell if the parish will provide the rest but if

distant anciently this place was known only by the name of which see skinners etymologicon notwithstanding the word does not appear to have any thing to do with salt yet which or wych is always applied with us to places where salt is found as droitwich nantwich etc and the houses in which it is made are called wych houses an anglosaxon word for district or habitation and a very common termination of a multitude of places here the british nant is added to show its low situation  immediately before the conquest its revenues were divided between the king and earl edwin after that event it was bestowed by the great proprietor of cheshire hugh lupus on william de malhedeng or de malhang a norman chieftain from whom it was called which malhang hugh erected it into a barony in favor of malhedeng and honored him with a seat in his parliament  this dignity continued only in him and his two sons hugh and william the last died without issue male of his three daughters alionora the eldest by marriage of her daughter joan conveyed her share to the lord lovels philippa the second to the audleys doctor gower and alda the third to the vernons barons of shipbroke  by these marriages the barony became divided into four reckoning the part which had been given by hugh malhang to the abbey of cumbermere and soon after by different alliances became split into multitudes of other shares  when entire it was under the government of the lord or his steward who were vested with the usual baronial powers this town had been governed by a bailiff but the election of that officer being dropped it is at present under the government of the constables it has likewise several other officers such as the rulers of walling who were guardians of the saltsprings and regulated all matters respecting their important staple of the place history of nantwich        after them came the aletasters whose office related to the assize of bread and drink  the next were the healthkeepers who attended to the right of the beamheath anciently called the creach and took care to preserve it from all encroachments or trespassers  the leavelookers superintended the markets inspected the weights and destroyed unwholesome meat of every kind these corresponded a good deal with the aediles cereales of the romans as the next officers the firelookers did to the triumviri nocturni they had the care of the chimnies and were to guard against all accidents that might arise from fire  the town is large but consists chiefly of old houses the weever which divides it in unequal parts is here a small stream and not navigable higher than winsford bridge the inhabitants of nantwich had many years ago an act for making this river navigable from that place to their town but they never carried the power into execution the chester canal is now completed from that city and finishes in a handsome broad basin near the road between acton and the town but at this time it remains an almost useless ornament to the country nor has it as might have been expected given the lest increase to the salttrade for which this ancient town was once so distinguished unfortunately for it the other salttowns lie more conveniently for commerce and abound almost to excess with that useful article  the chief trade of the place is in shoes which are sent to london here is a small manufacture of gloves but those of bonelace and stockings once considerable are now lost in the reigns of queen elizabeth and james i the tanning business brought much wealth into the town  the salt made from the adjacent brinesprings formed once a very important business in the reign of queen elizabeth here were two hundred and sixteen saltworks of six leadswalling each in      only two works of five large pans of wrought iron the duty produced from them amounts annually to near five thousand pounds from the whole district including the works at lawton and a small one at droitwich from eighteen to twenty thousand pounds the tax on this useful article is very considerable which it bears as being of most cheap fabric and most universal use it seems for that reason to have been one of the earliest taxes of the romans for ancus martius near   0 years before christ salinarum vectigal instituit aurelius victor c v  this tribute was continued on the britons when the romans possessed our isle  the latter also made salt part of the pay of their soldiers which was called salarium and from which is derived our word salary  the art of making salt was known in very early times to the gauls and germans it is not therefore likely that the britons who had in several places plenty of saltsprings should be ignorant of it the way of making it was very simple but very dirty for they did no more than fling the water on burning wood the water evaporated by the heat and left the salt adhering to the ashes or charcoal plinii hist not lib xxxi c   galliae germaniaeque ardentibus lignis aquam salsam infundunt   it is very probable that the britons used the spring of nantwich for this purpose numbers of pieces of halfburnt wood being frequently dug up in this neighborhood salinis was a place not far from hence one of the wiches but i am uncertain which the romans made use of the springs and made salt by much the same process as we do at present the salt produced was white it struck the natives who styled this place perhaps the first place where they saw salt of this kind heleddwen or the white brinepits to distinguish them from the springs which they used in so slovenly a fashion  the romans were acquainted with rocksalt but had not discovered it within the limits of italy there were mountains of salt in india spain afforded the transparent colorless rocksalt and cappadocia the deep yellow piiny libxxxi c   strabe lib xx  0   but the rocksalt of our island remained undiscovered till past the middle of the last century  the romans were conversant in the methods of producing this useful article from the brine fit et e putcis in salinas ingestis plin xxxi    which they practiced in our island and communicated their instructions to the natives salt was an early import into britain but it was only to the cassiterides strabo     and the neighboring parts which were remote from the saltsprings  these advantages are but sparingly scattered over great britain scotland and ireland are totally destitute of them in england there are several but few that contain salt sufficient to be worked thus there are some which rise out of the middle of the were in the bishopric of durham others in yorkshire cumberland lancashire and oxfordshire see campbels politic survey i    all those are neglected either on account of their weakness or in some places by reason of the dearness of fuel these in cheshire and those at droitwich in worcestershire with the small works at weston in staffordshire are the only places where any business is done droitwich and those in cheshire were worked by the romans and had the common name of salinae  from that period to the present they have been successively in use the saxons according to their idea of liberty divided them between the king the great people and the freemen thus at nantwich was one brinepit which gave employ to numbers of salinae or works eight of them were between the king and earl edwin of which the king had two shares of the profits the earl one edwin had likewise a work near his manor of aghton out of which was made salt sufficient for the annual consumption of his household but if any was sold the king had a tax of two pence and the earl of one penny  in this place were likewise numbers of works belonging to the people of the neighborhood which had this usage from ascensionday to the feast of st martin they might carry home what salt they pleased but if they sold any on the spot or anywhere in the county they were to pay a tax to the king and the earl but after the feast of st martin whosoever took the salt home whether his own or purchased from other works was to pay toll except the beforementioned work of the earl which enjoyed exemption according to ancient usage  it appears that the king and earl farmed out their eight works for they were obliged to give on the friday of the weeks in which they were worked xvi boilings of which xv made one sum of salt this is a measure which according to spelman amounts to a horseload oreight bushels the pans of other people from ascensionday to that of st martin were not subject to this farm on the friday but from st martins day to ascension they were liable to those customs in the same manner as those of the king and the earl  the welsh used to supply themselves from these pits before the union of our country with england henry iii in order to distress them during the wars he had with them took care to put a stop to the works and deprive them of this necessary article  all these saltworks were confined between the river and a certain ditch if any person was guilty of a crime within these limits he was at liberty of making atonement by a mulct of two shillings or xxx boilings of salt except in the case of murder or theft for which he was to suffer death if crimes of that nature were committed without the precinct the common usage of the county was to be observed  in the time of the confessor this place yielded a rent of xx pounds with all the pleas of the hundred but when earl hugh received it it was a waste  the germans had an idea of a peculiar sanctity attendant on saltsprings that they were nearer to heaven than other places that the prayers of mortals were nowhere sooner heard and that by the peculiar favor of the gods the rivers and the woods were productive of salt not as in other places by the virtue of the sea but by the water being poured on a burning pile of wood taciti annal xiii c      whether this notion might not have been delivered from the germans to their saxon progeny and whether they might not in aftertimes deliver their grateful thanks for these advantages i will not determine but certain it is that on ascensionday the old inhabitants of nantwich piously sang a hymn of thanksgiving for the blessing of the brine a very ancient pit called the old brine was also held in great veneration and till within these few years was annually on that festival bedecked with boughs flowers and garlands and was encircled by a jovial band of young people celebrating the day with song and dance hist nantwich  0   this festival was probably one of the relics of saxon paganism which mellitus might permit his proselytes to retain according to the political instructions he received from gregory the great bid lib i c     on his mission least by too rigid an adherence to the purity of the christian religion he should deter the english from accepting his doctrine in fact salt was from the earliest times in the highest esteem and admitted into religious ceremonies it was considered as a mark of league and friendship neither shall thou says the jewish legislator levit chapter ii v    suffer the salt of the covenant of thy god to be lacking from thy meat offering with all thy offerings thou shall offer salt homer gives to salt the epithet of divine both greeks and romans mixed salt with their sacrificial cakes in their lustrations they made use of salt and water which gave rise in aftertimes to the superstition of holy water only the greeks made use of an olive branch instead of a brush to sprinkle it on the objects of purification  next with pure sulphur

and bound up his wounds as well as they could  after the battle the prince demanded of the knights that were about him for the lord audley if any knew any thing of him some knights yt were there answered and said sir he is sore hurt and lies in a litter here beside by my faith said the prince of his hurts i am right forye go and know if he may be brought hider or else i will go and se him

 and what is  of greater public utility the  corn are prevented from exercising their infa  for the communication being opened between liver  and hall line of the canal being through countries abundant in grain it affords a conveyance of corn unknown to past ages at present nothing but a general dearth can create a scarcity in any part adjacent to this extensive work  these and many other advantages are derived both to individuals and the public from this internal navigation but when it happens that the kingdom is engaged in a foreign war with what security is the trade between those three great ports carried on and with how much less expense has the trader his goods conveyed to any part of the kingdom than he had formerly been subject to when the goods were obliged to be carried coastways and to pay insurance  i believe it may be asserted that no undertaking equally expensive and arduous was ever attempted by private people in any kingdom and in justice to the adventurers it must be allowed that considering the difficulties they met with owing to the nature of the works or the caprice of persons whose lands were taken to make the canal that ten years and a half was but a short time to perform it in and that satisfaction has been made to every individual who suffered any injury by the execution of the undertaking the profits arising from tonnage is already very considerable and there is no doubt but they will increase annually and notwithstanding the enormous sum of money it has cost in the execution the proprietors will be amply repaid and have the comfort to reflect that by the conclusion of this project they have contributed to the good of their country and acquired wealth for themselves and posterity  immediately after leaving stonefield stone reached the little town of stone a place remarkable for religious antiquity legend tells us that the beforementioned wulferus then a pagan put to death his two sons wulfad and rufin on suspicion of favoring the christian faith wulfad at this place rufin at burston about three miles distant over each stones were erected as usual in memory of the dead from whence the names of those places are derived wulfere after this unnatural deed was struck with the utmost remorse and by the influence of his queen and st cedda or chad who lived in a neighboring hermitage was converted to the religion he had so lately persecuted and by way of expiating his guilt among other works of piety founded at stone a college of canons regular college about the year   0 his queen ermenilda is said to have also founded a nunnery here on the invasion of the danes the religious were dispersed but on the abatement of the cruelty of those barbarians it is probable they returned or at left a new establishment was formed this is certain that religious were found here after the conquest for there is an idle tale of two nuns and a priest being slain there by enysan a norman this enysan of walton was the true refounder caution must be used in reading the histories of these times which are filled with pious romance little credit should also be given to the murder of the sons of wulfere the saxon chronicle is silent about the deed that prince was a convert to christianity and seems to have founded the house through the common motives of zeal  enysan on his reestablishment of this house filled it with canons from kenelworth priory and made it a cell to that place the staffords who were his superiors assumed the honor of this new foundation and a second robert de stafford about the year    0 rendered it free from kenelworth excepting the right of patronage and a yearly pension the church of this priory was the place of interment of several of this great family and numbers of magnificent tombs with their figures in alabaster lay there till the dissolution when they were removed to the augustines on stafford green i see on the roadside a fragment of a thick wall perhaps a remnant of the priory the church is quite new and is a very elegant building dedicated to st wulfad one of the supposed martyrs at the time of the suppression a tablet giving the whole history of the house was hung up in the priory it is related in old english meter but is so tedious that i must refer the readers who desire to peruse it to the cited author dugdale mon ii       as soon as i left stone aston i saw on the right a large house called aston originally the property of a branch of the heveninghams of suffolk walter the last of the line left two daughters the second who only had children conveyed by marriage the estate to sir james simeon who rebuilt the hall he also built in the garden a mausoleum in which i think he is interred the place is at present the property of edward weld esquire of lulworth castle in dorsetshire and descended to him of late years by virtue of a marriage of an ancestor with a daughter of this house in the reign of charles ii  the road from this place burston for several miles passes along a pretty vale watered by the trent bounded by two hills and much enlivened by the course of the canal about the third mile from stone i went by burston a small hamlet noted formerly for a chapel erected over the spot where rufin second son of wulfere was supposed to have been martyred and on that account in old times greatly frequented by the devout  about a quarter of a mile from hence on the top of a hill stands the church of sandon sandon this manor in the twentieth of william the conqueror was in the hands of the king who bestowed it on hugh lupus and he again gave it to william de malbanc or nantwich it passed from this family by the gift of adena eldest daughter of william grandson to the former to warren de verdon and by his daughter alditha to sir william stafford and by the marriage of margaret daughter of one of his descendants in the twelfth of edward iii to thomas of erdeswik it continued in possession of that family till the reign of james i in his time it was sold to george digby groom of the stole to that monarch by his halfbrother richard erdeswik charles lord gerard of bromley became master of it by marriage with a daughter of mr digby whose granddaughter by matching with william duke of hamilton conveyed it to lord archibald hamilton who in      disposed of it to lord harrowby a lawsuit concerning this place gave rise to the fatal duel in november      between james duke of hamilton and lord mohun in which both combatants lost their lives  the ancient mansion stood near the church within a moat but is now demolished and a beautiful house commanding a fine view was built by lord archibald hamilton on an eminence impending over the chester road the steep slope is beautiful clothed with plantations of recent date but extremely flourishing  the church is in the gift of lord harrowby before the dissolution it belonged to the abbey of cumbermere being bestowed on it by the founder hugh de malbanc  the monuments are curious the finest is in memory of the celebrated sampson erdeswik the learned antiquary of the county a faithful guide of all that concerned the families till his death which happened in   0  he might have spared himself the expense of a monument his work would have perpetuated his name he erected one in his lifetime and is represented recumbent a colossal figure in a jacket with short skirts and spurs on his legs above in two niches are his two wives kneeling the one was elizabeth dikeswel the other maria neale widow to sir everard digby and mother to the unfortunate victim to the gunpowder plot besides inscriptions to these ladies is a pedigree of the house for which as well as several other epitaphs of the erdeswiks the reader is referred to the appendix i shall only mention that the tombs are of the altarform and have the figures of the persons commemorated engraved on the stone  the inscription on a plain marble tomb in memory of mr digby of grorge digby once owner of the place is very worthy of preservation as it records a remarkable piece of history i shall give it here at length and add notes to the obscure parts  si quis hic jaceat roges viator

causabon and other protestant writers and in his book styled ecclesiasticus     he attacked james i in a very indecent manner dicterici soedatam  obtrectatoris sanguine the affront offered to our monarch induced mr digby and some other followers of the earl of bristol then ambassador to spain to attack scioppius in the streets of marid in     where they left him for dead as soon as he

pile is built round a court and great part of it curiously made of wood embattled at top and the sides carved in many places are the arms of the devereux the devices of the ferrars and garnishes and in saxon characters the initials of the founder w d walter devereux with the motto loial suis je over the door of the gateway is carved a head in profile with a crown above in the middle of the court stands a fountain and the whole building is surrounded with a moat the view within the court is faithfully shown in plot tab v  in several of the windows are painted glass in the great bowwindow of the hall are the horseshoes the ancient device of the ferrars in others the arms of that family the devereux garnishes and shirlies a bed is still preserved here the work of mary stuart who was for some time imprisoned in this house besides this at present there are no vestiges of its former grandeur within and without is a mortifying appearance of neglect and approaching decay a fire in july      completed its destruction   at a small distance from the house on a knowl are the poor remains of the castle castle consisting of the fragments of two rounders and a bit of a wall almost hid in wood this fortress was very soon permitted to fall in decay leland speaks of it as a ruin in his days when the power of the nobility was broken by the policy of henry vii numbers of the barons finding their castle no longer a protection to their insolence were glad to quit so incommodious a kind of habitation we often see as in the present instance an ancient mansion near the remains or on the site of a more ancient castle the times were so much bettered and monarchy had recovered so much rightful strength that the former became useless against their prince or their rival reguli who then began to acknowledge the power of law yet still some species of castellated mansion against popular commotions or the attacks of bands of robbers was requisite convenience and a sort of elegance was affected in their houses but a necessary suspicion still remained and safety provided for by the deep surrounding moat by the gateway and the strong door  chartley castle was built by randle blundeville earl of chester in    0 on his return from the holy land and to defray the expenses of this as also of beeston which he also founded a tax was levied on all his vassals by his death this part of his estate devolved on william ferrars earl of derby in right of his wife agnes third sister of randle  his son robert entering into the factious views of the barons received a defeat at chesterfield in      his estates were confiscated and the castle and manor bestowed by henry iii on hamon le strange but notwithstanding this he possessed himself of it by force and the king was obliged to order his brother edmund earl of lancaster to besiege the place which he took but not till after much loss on both sides edmund and the nobility who assisted in the siege thought proper to obtain his majestys pardon for the lives lost on the occasion ferrars himself received his pardon was divested of the earldom of derby but was suffered to retain this castle possibly being reduced so low as to be incapable of giving farther disturbance it continued in his line till the reign of henry vi when in      by the marriage of anne or agnes sole heiress to william lord ferrars to walter devereux sheriff of herefordshire it passed into another great race of peers the lady was at that time only eleven years and eight months old but by the kings special favor in      she had livery of her lands without further proof of her age this estate continued in his posterity the lords ferrars viscounts hereford and earls of essex till the year      when it fell to sir robert shirley by his marriage with dorothy youngest sister to robert earl of essex the noted parlementgeneral and is at present possessed by their descendant earl ferrers  in hopes of finding stow church in the neighboring parish church of stow the monumental honors usually attendant on great families i visited it at the small trouble of a miles ride i was disappointed for i found only one of this great line deposited in the place this is very frequent with a race of heroes whose active spirits carry them into scenes remote from their natal soil or bring themselves to fates that prevent possession of their parental sepulchers walter devereux the first lord ferrars fell in the field of bosworth fighting valiantly in behalf of richard and was buried among the undistinguished slain walter his descendant first earl of essex died lord lieutenant of ireland september   d      as supposed by poison and was interred at caermarthen his son the favorite of elizabeth fell a victim to his indiscretion and ambition perished by the ax and was flung among the attainted herd his son for a series of victories in the cause of liberty received from his grateful party the magnificent honors of a public funeral in the capital which his arms had defended  i found here only the tomb of walter first viscount hereford grandson of the first lord ferrers and founder of the house of chartley he served with honor in the french wars under henry viii and in the naval attack of conquet in      he was honored with the garter by his royal master and with the title of hereford by his successor his death happened in      he lies here under a fine monument erected in his lifetime his figure is represented in robes with the collar of the garter round his neck his head reposed on a plume of feathers wreathed round a helmet on one side of him is placed his first lady mary daughter of thomas marquis of dorset on the other his second margaret daughter of robert garnyche esquire of kyngeton in suffolk around the side is represented i suppose as mourners six female and six male figures the last begirt with swords  near this is another tomb of alabaster with the figures of two persons engravn on it but so cankered with age that neither inscription nor distinction of sex can be made out  on the chancel floor a brass plate preserves the memory of thomas newport steward of the household to walter first earl of essex and delivers his character in these terms qui charus charis fuerat qui firmus amicis en thomas newport conditur hoc tumulo qui felix ortu suit et morta beatus quem deus et coelum quem pia vota habent   from stow i hastened to the chester road wych weston which i reached at the hamlet of wych in the parish of weston on the trent whose spire steeple appears at a small distance on the other side of the road this place is productive of salt and has been long noted for its brinepits the property of earl ferrers  after going about two miles farther heywood i passed through great heywood a village bestowed by roger de melend alias long epee a worthless prelate in the reign of henry iii on his valet roger de aston whose family made it their residence till the marriage of a descendant with the heiress of tixal occasioned it to remove to the new acquisition in my memory the old seat was in possession of the whitbies it has since been reunited to the house of tixal by purchase the barn belonging to the manorhouse of heywood was of a most magnificent size but of late has been greatly reduced  the horsebridge over the trent its long bridge adjoining to heywood was not less remarkable for i remember it to have consisted of twoandforty arches but the number at present is much lessened there is a tradition that it was built by the county in a compliment to the last devereux earl of essex who resided much at chartley and being a keen sportsman was oftendeprived of his diversion for want of one i am not clear about the truth of this report there certainly had been a bridge here long before so that if there was any foundation for such a mark of respect it could only have been rebuilt after falling to decay  shugborough   from the middle is a view of very uncommon beauty vale of shugborough of a small vale varied with almost every thing that nature or art could give to render it delicious rich meadows watered by the trent and sow the first animated with milkwhite cattle emulating those of tinian the last with numerous swans the boundary on one side is a cultivated slope on the other the lofty front of cannock wood clothed with heath or shaded with old oaks scattered over its glowing bloom by the free hand of nature  it is more difficult to enumerate the works of art dispersed over this elysium they epitomize those of so many places the old church of colwich the mansion of the ancient english baron at welsely hall the greatwindowed mode of building in the reign of queen elizabeth in the house of ingestre the modern seat in oakedge and the lively improved front of shugborough are embellishments proper to our own country amidst these arise the genuine architecture of china in all its extravagance the dawning of the grecian in the mixed gothic gateway at tixal and the chaste buildings of athens exemplified by mr stuart in the counterparts of the choragic monument of lysicrates antiquities of athens chapter iv tab     and the octagon tower of andronicus cyrrhestes the same chapter iii tab     from the same hand arose by command of a grateful brother the arch of adrian of athens embellished with naval trophies in honor of lord anson a glory to the british fleet and who still survives in the gallant train of officers who remember and emulate his actions my much respected friend the late thomas anson esquire preferred the still paths of private life and was the best qualified for its enjoyment of any man i ever knew for with a most humane and the most sedate disposition he possessed a mind most uncommonly cultivated he was the example of true taste in this country and at the time that he made his own place a paradise made every neighbor partaker of its elegancies he was happy in his life and happy in his end i saw him about thirty hours before his death listening calmly to the melody of the harp preparing for the momentary transit from an earthly concert to an union with the angelic harmonies the unfinished improvements are carried on with great judgment by his worthy nephew and successor george anson esquire  among the great number of statues which embellish the place an adonis and thalia are the most capital there is also a very fine figure of trajan in the attitude of haranguing his army the number of rude etruscan figures in the garden show the extravagance of the earliest ages and the great antiquity of the art of sculpture in italy long before the romans became a people the beautiful monument in the lower end of the garden does honor to the present age it was the work of mr schemecher under the direction of the late mr anson the scene is laid in arcadia two lovers expressed in elegant pastoral figures appear attentive to an ancient shepherd who reads to them an inscription on a tomb  et in azcabia ego  the moral resulting from this seems to be that there are no situations of life so delicious but which death must at length snatch us from it was placed here by the amiable owner as a temple of the winds at shugborough memento of the certainty of that event perhaps also as a secret memorial of some loss of a tender nature in his early days for he was wont often to hang over it in affectionate and firm meditation the chinese house a little farther on is a true pattern of the architecture of that nation taken in the country by the skilful

to leland originally belonged to suckborrow with a long heard and who as some say gave it to the mitre of lichfield it must have been in very early times for the manor of haywood in which this is included belonged to the sea in  0   the twentieth of william the conqueror and so continued till the reign of edward vi who bestowed it on lord paget the house was till that time one of the palaces of the bishops the relics at present serve to give the appearance of reality of ruin to some beautiful grecian columns and other fragments of ancient architecture which were tacked to the front by the late mr anson  shugborough was frequently the house i had the happiness of making my headquarters from whence i made many an excursion to the neighboring places i beg the readers pardon for indulging myself with a recollection of what formerly gave me so much pleasure in the survey and for detaining him with the account of a short circuit rich in objects  i shall cross the sow and begin with tixal

lies ingestre ingestre or ingestrent a respectable old house seated on the easy slope of a hill and backed by a large wood filled with ancient oaks of vast size this makes part of the pleasureground the walks are partly bounded by enormous hedges of foresttrees and partly wander into the ancient wood beneath the shade of the venerable trees  this manor about the time of henry ii was the property of eudo de mutton in the reign of edward iii it was transferred to the family of the chetwynds by the marriage of isabel daughter of philip de mutton with sir john de chetwynd in which line it continues being at present owned by john chetwynd talbot esquire grandson of john lord chetwynd  the house is built in the style of the reign of elizabeth with great windows in the center and a bow on each side the last are of stone the rest of the house brick in the great hall over the fireplace is a very good picture of walter chetwynd esquire in a great wig and crossed by a rich sash this gentleman was distinguished by his vast knowledge in the antiquities of his country church and more so by his piety the present church of ingestre was rebuilt by him and was consecrated in august      a sermon was preached prayers read a child baptized a woman churched a couple married a corpse buried the sacraments administered and to crown all mr chetwynd made an offering on the altar of the

commanded by  william brereton and sir john gell victory notwithstanding  great inequality of numbers declared itself on the side of the yalists but it was purchased at so dear a rate that as lord arendon expresses a great victory had been an unequal recomence for the loss sustained in the general the earl fell in the tion neglected by his troops busied in the pursuit and left enoned by enemies he flew his first assailants and died valiantly fusing the offered quarter  after riding from ingestre three miles through very bad roads eached stafford a good town stafford containing about five thousand habitants seated on a plain bounded by rising grounds at a ry small distance the streets in general are well built the arketplace large ornamented with a handsome town hall with e windows in front it is built upon pillars and presents a cade with six arches intercolumniated with ionic pilasters is is the countytown and here the assizes are appointed to  held by a statute of the first of

ear  stafford consists of but a single parish churches with two churches that  st mary is a rectory in the gift of the king a large building th an octagon tower and formerly with a lofty spire rising from here is to be seen the tomb of sir edward aston the builder tixal who died in      and joan his wife their figures are presented in alabaster under a large canopy  the font is a singular piece of antiquity very clumsy but the sides and base most singularly carved into rude gothic figures  this church had been collegiate and was given a little before the year      by king stephen to the bishop and chapter of lichfield and coventry the patronage was granted in      by henry vi to humphrey duke of buckingham it was of exempt jurisdiction and consisted in the twentysixth of henry viii of a ean and thirteen prebendaries tanver      the deans house stood at the vese end of the church and serves at present for the school  the religious houses were the gray friars religious houses or franciscans at the north end of the walls founded according to erdeswik by sir james stafford of sandon it was valued at l      s  0 d per annum and granted in the thirtyfirst of henry viii to james leveson  the friars austins had a piece of ground given them on the green at the south end of the town by ralph lord stafford dagdales baron i     in order to found a house about the year      for his own souls sake those of his wives  katharine and margaret sir humphrey hastings knight and that of edward iii the tomb of his great line were removed to this church from stone at the dissolution but soon suffered to perish it was granted in the  of queen mary to thomas neve and giles isam  a priory of black canons founded by richard peche bishop of lichfield and covenery about the year    0 as others say by gevard stafford on land which he held from the bishop whom  complimented with the title of founder tanner      the prelate had a great affection for this house for on resigning his see he became a canon of it and here ended his days  sacra i     this house was dedicated to st thomas becker  ten years after his death  it maintained only seven religious whose revenues were l    a year on the tion it was granted to rowland lee bishop of lichfield  besides these were two hospitals and the free chapel of saint nuas in the castle  the town was defended partly by the river sow fortifications which bounds one half of it the rest was guarded by a wall and by a ditch supplied by the river with water it had formerly four gates of these two are yet standing the place never was defencible at last ever stood a siege sir william brereton the parliament general took it by surprise in may      with the loss only of a single man  the origin of stafford is very uncertain the first name of it is led to be betheney origin of stafford and that it had been the seat of an hermit called bertelin in high fame for his sanctity the earliest auhentic mention of the place is in the year     when ethelfleda saxon c  0  countess of mercia and sister of edward the elder built a castle her this lady had one child by her lord ethelred when baing the pangs of parturition with the joys of connubial rites azon like she determined to forbear for the future all commerce with him from thenceforth her delight was in arms in conquests and in securing her dominions such was her prowess that laying aside all feminine titles she received that of king as if countess and queen were inadequate to her heroism tour in wales   the site of this fortress is not precisely known doctor plot is of opinion that it lay within the entrenchments at billington at some distance from stafford and seems to found his conjecture from the lands wherein they are being still a remaining part of the demesne land of the barony of stafford hist staff      cambden attributes a tower to edward the elder founded in the year after that which was built by his sister and places it on the north side of the river a mount still remains near the new bridge called by speed castlehill at present named bullyhill on which it probably stood  the poor remains of the castle castle which was garrisoned in the civil wars stand on a little insulated hill a mile south from the town the keep was on an artificial mount the whole is surrounded with a deep fosse which on the south side has besides the additional strength of a high rampart this was founded by william the conqueror and was soon after demolished it is supposed that during the time it stood the custody of it was committed to robert de tonei younger son of roger standard bearer of normandy dugdales baron i     a follower of the conqueror who took from this circumstance the name of stafford it is conjectured that the king at that time reserved this manor to himself and that it was not included in the vast grant made by him to robert of eightyone manors in this county twentysix in that of warwick twenty in lincolnshire two in suffolk and one in each of those of worcester and northampton it appears that it continued in the crown till the second of edward ii when edmund lord stafford received the grant and held it in capite by barony together with that of bradeley and madeley by service of finding for forty days at his own charge three armed men with three equis coopertis horses harnessed for war as often as there should be war with wales or scotland blunts tenures    i do not affirm for certain the restorer of this castle mr erdeswic says it was ralph de stafford a distinguished warrior cotemporary with edward iii it was garrisoned by the king in the last civil wars was taken by the parliament forces and demolished in       about a quarter of a mile south of the castle in a low situation manorhouse stood the manorhouse of the family fortified by the same ralph for i find from dugdale baron i   0 that he had permission in      to make castles of his manorhouses at stafford and madeley this great family had in it barons earls and dukes and in the year      became extinct at that time humiliated into barens again the moat of their ancient residence is still to be seen surrounding a rectangular piece of ground the site of the house  my curiosity led me about two miles further to billington billington bury to examine the supposed site of the ancient stafford castle near the extremity of a high hill steeply sloping on three sides and commanding a most extensive and beautiful view i found a large sea surrounded in some parts with one in others with two deep fosses this had been a british post as it agrees with those we find in many parts of the kingdom but as it retains the name of billington bury it probably might have been occupied by the saxons whose posts are distinguished by the addition of borough bury and berry  the town of stafford is governed by a mayor recorder ten aldermen and twenty commoncouncilmen and was incorporated in the third of edward vi it first sent burgesses to parliament in      the twentythird of edward i they are elected by inhabitants paying scot and lot and are returned by the mayor willis iii  0   the borough still retains one ancient custom borough the privilege of borough english or the descent of lands within its liberty to the youngest sons of those who die intestate an usage which is supposed to have been originally founded on the presumption that the younger child was the most incapable of providing for itself  the barony was barony even at the conquest one of the greatest in england and afterward like other great seigniories styled the honor of stafford none were such originally but which were royal but were afterward bestowed in see on some nobleman as proved the case with this as mentioned in page    when it was given to edmund lord stafford with eightyone dependent manors with sixty knights sees viz nine in his demesne and fiftyone in service  after leading the town i crossed the wolverhampton navigation distances heywood to its junction with

described  cank wood on approaching cank wood heywood park i find on its confines heywood park a small house the property of lord paget remarkable for the beautiful woody dingles that wind into the sides of the forest when i was wandering through them i imagined myself engaged in those of my native country here i suppose to have been the park of red deer which leland says the bishop of lichfield had in his manor of shugborow i skirted part of the wood which here ends boldly almost driving the traveller into the sow this front has received from mr anson a wonderful change miraturque novas frondes  pines instead of oaks which waving over the head of the passenger would recall to his memory had he been abroad the idea of many an alpine scene  returning over heywood bridge i passed through the two hamlets of that name and within two miles of the first reached the church and village of colwich i must imagine the traveller colwich as well as myself blinded if we rode this space insensible of the most elegant view of the vale it is perfectly prodigal in its beauties and spreads at once every charm that can captivate the eye it shows here at once all that i before mentioned en detail  the parsonage and church of colwich contribute to the variety of the view from another station both are ancient this place had been the property of a family of the same name erdeswic  at let from henry iiis reign to about the beginning of elizabeth when it passed into that of leicester of tabley in cheshire by the marriage of the daughter of edward colwich leicesters cheshire  0  to peter

is also the burialplace of the ansons made a lantique in form of a catacomb i must not forget an inscription in memory of another sir william wolsely which does not commemorate his unlucky and singular end being drowned in his chariot on the  th of july      by the accidental breaking of a milldam in the village of longdon by a thundershower his four horses perished the coachman was saved being carried by the torrent into an orchard where he stuck till the water abated  bishton at a little distance from colwich is bishton wolsley bridge near which i cross the navigation again and instantly after the trent at wolsley bridge placed at the foot of the hangingwoods of wolsley park an enclosure of much native wild beauty the ancient mansion of the family of the same name lies low and near the river this manor is a member of heywood in the twentieth year of the conqueror nigellus the paternal ancestor of greslei held it of the bishop about the reign of henry ii it was a divided manor between richard hints and richard wolsley bedeswic soon after this they seem to have become sole proprietors  after riding a little way along the lichfield road i turned to the left and crossing

lord of colton soon after colton sir hardulph de gastenoys had either all or shared it with another for in the year      sir william gastenoys and anselm le marshal were joint lords of it after many generations a female  thomasine sole heiress and daughter of sir thomas gastenoys last male heir of the family by marriage with sir nicholas greislei about      transferred it to the house of drakelow

the country now alters for the worse and the soil becomes wet and miry about two miles distance from colton stands blithefield blithefield the respectable old seat of the respectable family of the

millisent heiress of robert lord stafford dugdale i     with hervey bagot from which match sprung a long line of peers of every rank the elder branch acquired this place by the marriage of sir ralph bagot before the reign of henry iv with elizabeth sole heiress of richard blithefield lineally descended from a saxon of the name of hereman or the warrior  the house is built round a court and still retains on the outside the simplicity of appearance of that of an ancient baron and within the old hospitality the best rooms are the hall the library and a large drawing room lately added the first

contemporary of his is painted in the same manner henry earl of huntington with the collar of the garter his beard forked the date      aet    this preserves a likeness of a very different character henry earl of huntington lord president of the north and one of the peers to whom the custody of the queen of scots was entrusted burleigh created a fortune by his prudence huntington dissipated his by being the dupe to the ministers of the rising fanaticism of the age which nurtured by such wooers of popularity as leicester essex and this noble peer in the next age attained strength sufficient to subvert the church it pretended to purify  a neighboring statesman sir walter aston of tixal sir walter aston is painted on board he appears with a firm countenance short hair and whiskers in a black dress laced with gold on the seams and graced with a triple gold chain sir walter was ambassador to spain in the time of the negotiations about the spanish match in the reign of james i and

to command in ireland in      and performed services worthy of his character but at length worn out by the ill usage of the ministry who withheld from him the necessary support he came over to england to lay his complaint before the queen he was artfully received and sent back with the promises of better usage grief or as others say poison administered by the instigation of leicester who loved his wife cut him off at the age of thirtyfive at dublin in      perhaps the infamy of dudleys character and the speedy and indecent marriage of the countess with that favorite might give rise to the scandal for an inquisition was made on his death and the report in consequence was that he died of the flux a disorder very frequent in ireland in those days  here are several portraits of different persons colonel richard bagot of this worthy house among them is colonel richard bagot governor of lichfield who fell in the cause of loyalty in the fatal battle of naseby he is dressed in a buff coat

beautiful portrait she is dressed simplex munditiis in pale brown satin white hood handkerchief apron and short ruffles a reproach to the unsuitable fantastic dress of these times which attempts to

there are multitudes of pictures by the best masters in this house they were all undergoing a removal therefore i avoid further mention of them until they are fixed in their permanent situations but i must not be silent about the collection of coins one of the most valuable and instructive in england the bequest of his beloved neighbor and friend thomas anson esquire  the park is at some distance from the house park the oaks are of a very great size a twintree was lately sold for l  0 and some single ones for half that sum and i am told that there are several now standing equally large  the

in      is mural and supersedes the ten commandments being placed over the altar the inscription tells us that he was a true assertor of episcopacy in the church and hereditary monarchy in the state which probably entitled him in those days to this sacred place on the outside of the church two modest heaps of turf parallel to each other mark the spot where the remains of the last amiable owners of the place repose whole merit survives in their successor  i found myself here not very distant from whichenoure hall and could not resist the desire of visiting the seat of the celebrated flitch the desperate reward of conjugal affection  in my road not far from blithefield i again met with the trent hermitage and the canal the last a most fortunate embellishment to the neat seat of mr lister of hermitage the proprietors with the respect they usually pay to gentlemen have before this house given it an elegant form and to add to the scenery luckily the aweful mouth of a considerable subterraneous course of the navigation opens to view and affords the amazing sight of barges losing themselves in the cavern or suddenly emerging to day from the other side  the church of hermitage seated on a small eminence church forms another beautiful object this belongs to the cathedral of lichfield and is styled the prebendary of hansacre a hamlet in this parish founded by bishop clinton  on the opposite side of the trent is maveston ridware a rectory maveston ridware whose church is dedicated to st andrew this had been the property of the mavestons at left from the time of edward i to that of henry iv the tomb of sir robert maveston or mauvesine in the parish church recals to memory a melancholy story in the beginning of the reign of the usurping henry when the kingdom was divided against itself two neighboring knights sir robert maveston and sir william handsacre of handsacre took arms in support of different parties the first to assert the cause of bolingbroke the last that of the deposed richard they assembled their vassals and began their march to join the armies then about to join battle near shrewsbury the two neighbors with their respective followers unfortunately met not far from their seats actuated by party rage a skirmish ensued sir william was slain on the spot sir robert proceeded to the field and met his fate with the gallant percy what a picture is this accident of the miseries of civil dissension what a tale is the following of the sudden vicissitude of hatred to love between contending families margaret one of the daughters and coheiress of sir robert maveston gave her hand to sir william son of the knight slain by her father and with her person and fortune compensated the injury done by her house to that of handsacre erdeswik   the other daughter elizabeth married sir john cawardine whose posterity was extinct here in the male line by the death of thomas cawardine esquire in       the tomb of sir robert is altarshaped his figure armed

hand on his sword both under arches in the wall  near the church is the gateway part of the ancient mansion of the family of mauvesin and on the other side of the trent beyond high bridge is a moated fragment of the rival house of handsacre  at the distance of about two miles from maveston kings bromley i passed by kings bromley before the conquest this manor had been the residence of the earl of

year      or the thirtieth of henry vi when it came by descent to prayers of baddeleigh in cheshire from him to one partridge who sold it to francis agard of ireland whose descendants possessed it for some generations when it was sold to john newton esquire of barbados in whose line it remains  from hence i passed by orgrave one of the seats of george anson orgrave esquire lately the property of the turtons afterward through the village of alrewas the manor was in possession of algar earl of mercia but on the forfeiture of his son the brave edwin was bestowed by the conqueror with the following on walter de somervil one of his norman followers  from hence i visited whichenoure or wichnor whichenoure manor where i crossed a bridge of the same name over the trent not far from the place where it receives the tame the roman road passes this way and on this marshy spot was formed upon piles of wood it runs from the east side of lichfield and points to the northeast much brass money has been found and as i am informed there are vestiges of a roman camp in whichenoure park  the church stands on an eminence church on the north side of the river the house is at a small distance and enjoys a most beautiful view i believe this to have been on the site of a very ancient mansion which leland observes to have been quite down in his days and that the seat was then below

present state of the flitch for the honor of the state matrimonial that it was in my power to continue the register of successful clamants from that preserved in the  0 th spectator but from the strictest enquiry the flitch has remained untouched from the first century of its institution to the present and we are credibly informed that the late and present worthy owners of the manor were deterred from entering into the holy state through the dread of not obtaining a single rasher from their own bacon  the first pessessor of this manor was sir walter de somervile a norman on whom it was bestowed by the conqueror it rested in his family till the death of the abovementioned sir philip de somervile who left two daughters joan wife of sir rhys ap griffith knight and maud married to edmund vernon this estate fell to the former and remained in the family till the last century when it was sold by mary daughter or widow to henry griffith to  offley esquire ancestor to the late owner who within these few years alienated it to the present john levet esquire  i cannot tell the precise year in which it was sold to mr offley but it appears that henry griffith was living in       in compliance with my original plan i took the same way in order to return into the great road soon after rudgley repassing the trent at colton bridge i reached rudgley a small town celebrated for its great annual fairs for horses of the coach breed  the church is a little north of the town church is dedicated to saint augustine and is a vicarage belonging to the chapter of lichfield opposite is a very ancient timberhouse belonging once to the chetwynds at present to mr anson on an eminence above the town is beautifully situated a large house formerly belonging to the westons greatly enlarged and improved by the present owner ashton curzon esquire  the ancient owners of rudgley were of the same name with the town some of the family had the honor of being sheriffs of the county in the reign of edward iii another was knight of the shire in the same period the name continued here till after the time of henry vi erdeswik mentions this to have been a manor belonging to the bishop of lichfield which i find was alienated to the king by bishop sampson in       the parish and village of longdon succeeds that of rudgley longdon the church lies out of the road on the left is a vicarage dedicated to st james and belongs to a prebendship of lichfield the village consists of scattered houses extending for a vast way on each side of the lane from whence the name this gave rise to a common saying in these parts the stoutest beggar that goes by the way cannot beg through long in a summers day   this village anciently was full of gentlemens seats a most useful species of population to the poor whose distresses seldom fail reaching the ears of mediocrity but whose cries rarely attain the height of greatness sir edward littleton had a house called chestal simon rudgley sheriff of the county in the time of edward iii had another the younger brother of the astons had a seat here from the reign of edward i the broughtons had broughton hall from the days of king john and adam arblaster possessed liswys now longball in      or the twentyfifth of edward iii in whose name it continued till of late when it was purchased by francis cob esquire  this manor is of vast extent above thirty other manors lordships and villages owe suit and service besides cank heywood and rudgley to the court leet which is held here every three weeks it once belonged to the bishop of lichfield but was alienated by bishop sampson  after winding up the steep of a high hill an advanced part of the forest of cank i turned out of the road to beaudesert beaudesert the princely seat of lord paget placed on the side of a lofty sloping eminence sheltered above and on each side by beautiful rising grounds and embosomed with trees commanding in front over the tops of far subjacent woods a most extensive and agreeable view so that it well vindicates the propriety of its name  this had been a place belonging to the bishops of lichfield which with the manors of longdon heywood berkswick cank rudgley and shugborrow were part of the spoils of that see wrested from it in the time of edward vi with the connivance of richard sampson then bishop who accepted in their stead certain impropriations of the value of an hundred and eightythree pounds a year these livings at that time were good rectories now poor vicarages or mercenary curacies annexed to the bishopric  the leviathan who swallowed these manors was sir william paget created by edward vi baron beaudesert he first appeared in the reign of henry viii and from a low beginning meritoriously rose to the dignity of secretary and ambassador to charles v and francis i in the next reign he was made chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and comptroller of the household and obtained a peerage in that of mary became lord privy seal and was restored to the order of the garter from which he had been degraded in the time of her predecessor at the accession of elizabeth at his own request he was permitted to retire from the service of the state being zealously attached to the religion of his former mistress fullers worthies   0  yet his zeal for the old religion produced in him no scruples about sharing in the plunder of the church the reforming somerset and the papal paget agreed in that single point his posterity derive from him an uncommon extent of interest and command  beaudesert was rebuilt by thomas lord paget in the reign of queen elizabeth it is a very handsome stone edifice in form of an half h of late most admirably improved and fitted up by the noble owner it is totally disengaged from the gateway walls and other obstructions that encumbered it in the days of plott see his plate viii p     and the grounds that environ it are laid with the simplicity that forms true grandeur  here is a gothic hall of eighty feet by twentyone a diningroom of fortytwo by twentyseven and a magnificent gallery of ninetyseven by seventeen the other apartments are small  in the drawing room is a fine

performance of holbeins  from the house i ascended to the summit of the hill castlehill on the verge of cank heath to an ancient british post called the castlehill it is encompassed with a vast rampart and two ditches the two entrances are opposite to each other and before the eastern are several advanced works it commands a vast view and was well situated for the purposes of a temporary retreat i refer the reader for an account of the uses of these entrenchments to my welsh tour vol i      for they are common to most parts of britain doctor plott ascribes this work to king canute but i suspect it to be of earlier origin  from hence is an extensive view of the chase cank forest or forest of cank or cannock which plott derives from the name of the danish prince canuti sylva this

half forget that here a forest grew r w  from castlehill i descended toward the great road and passed by fairwell church called ecclesia sanctae mariae dugdale  once conventual fairwell church belonging to a priory of benedictine nuns it originally was the property of canons regular or hermits but at the request of roger jeffry and robert brothers of farewell dugdale mon i     and with the consent of the chapter of lichfield was bestowed on the priory about    0 by roger de clinton bishop of litchfield who endowed it with the mill and all the lands between the brooks then called chistals and blache siche with other emoluments mentioned in his two grants henry ii was also a great benefactor to these nuns bestowing on them three ploughlands at fagereswell one at pipe and one at hamerwich and forty acres of land cleared from wood in the forest of cank the same         in      on the suppression of the lesser religious houses it was given to lichfield to increase and maintain

fairweld faurwell fagrewell and fagereswell   after a short ride i reached the summit of a long but gentle descent from which is a fine view of the city of lichfield lying at the foot of it the situation is delightful in a fertile and dry soil with small risings on almost every side the cathedral with its three spires is a most striking object  lichfield is a place of saxon origin lichfield and owes its rise to ceadda or chad the great saint of mercia i omit the legend of the thousand christians disciples of st amphibolus that were martyred here under dioclesian or the three kings slain at this place in battle as sculptured over thetownhall i take up its history about the year     when oswy king of the country established a bishopric here and made dwina or dinma the first prelate to him succeeded cellach and trumberct and on his demise st chad the famous ceadda this pious man at first led an eremitical life in a cell at the place on which now stands the church of his name and supported himself by the milk of a white hind in this place he was discovered by rufine the son of wolphere who was privately instructed by him till the time of his martyrdom beforerecited remorse and consequential conversion seized the pagan prince as some species of expiation he preferred the apostle to the vacant see he built himself a small house near the church and with seven or eight of his brethren during the interval of preaching read and prayed in private on the approach of his death flights of angels sang hymns over his cell miracles at his tomb confirmed the holiness of his life a lunatic that by accident escaped from his keepers lay a night on it and in the morning was found restored to his senses the very earth taken out of it was an infallible remedy for all disorders incident to man or beast bid hist lib iv c   ceadda was of course canonized a shrine was erected in honor of him great was the concourse of devotees the place increased and flourished  the history of our cathedrals is in its beginning but the history of superstition mixed with some truth and abundance of legend humiliating proof of the weakness of the human mind yet all the fine arts of past times and all the magnificent works we now so justly admire are owing to a species of piety that every lover of the elegance of architecture must rejoice to have existed  we are told that in the days of jaruman about the year     cathedral when founded the cathedral was founded  i shall not trouble the reader with a dry list of prelates but only mention those distinguished by some remarkable event that befell the sea during their days  in those of winfrid successor to st chad in     theodore archbishop of canterbury thought fit to divide the bishopric into two and to establish the other at sidnacester in lincolnshire the present stow winfrid disapproving this defalcation was deprived for contumacy the diocese might well bear dividing for at that time it contained the whole kingdom of mercia at present it comprehends all staffordshire except  which belong to worcester the larger part of  and about half shropshire  in the time of bishop adulf ossa king of the mercians procured liberty from the pope of erecting the fee into an archbishopick in     and to assign him for suffragans winchester hereford lgster leicester helmham and dunwick this honor died with adulf  a bishop peter in  0   the year succeeding the conquest removed the sea to st johns in chester where he died and was interred in  0    his successor robert de limesey smitten with the love of the gold and silver whartons augl sacr i     with which the pious earl leofric had covered the walls of his new convent at coventry in  0   removed the sea to that city and at once scraped from a single beam that supported a shrine  00 marks worth of silver william of malmsbury as quoted by dugdale hist warwick i       i now speak of a prelate of a different temper  citon to whose munificence both the church and city were highly indebted roger de clinton consecrated in      took down the ancient mercian cathedral we are not informed of the dimensions or nature of the building any more than we are of that built by this bishop it must have been according to the reigning mode of the times of the species of architecture usually called saxon with massy pillars and round arches there is not at present the left relic of this style but i am unacquainted with the accident or calamity which destroyed the labors of this pious prelate who took up the cross and died at antioch on a pilgrimage to the holy sepulcher  after a succession of twelve prelates walter de langton bishop langton treasurer of england was consecrated bishop of this see in      he was highly favored by edward i his prosperity was interrupted by the resentment of the prince who meanly revenged on the bishop a short imprisonment he had suffered in the time of his father for riotously destroying his deer after a persecution and confinement of above two years he emerged from all his difficulties and resumed his pastoral charge in a manner that did him great honor he may be considered as the third architect of this cathedral to him we are indebted for the present elegant pile he laid the foundation for our ladys chapel an edifice of uncommon beauty finished after his death with money left for that purpose he built the cloisters and expended l 000 upon a shrine for st chad he bestowed on the choir several rich vestments a chalice and two cups of beaten gold to the value of l 00 to the vicars choral he gave a standing cup and an annual pension of l 0 and procured for them and the canons great immunities in particular there was an order from the king to the justices of staffordshire that without trial they should hang upon the next gallows diverse persons that by force kept their lands from them this prelate also surrounded the close with a wall and ditch made the great gate at the west end and the postern at the south he gave his own palace at the west end of the close to the vicars choral and built a new one for himself at the east end he partly built or enlarged the castle at eccleshal and the manors of heywood and shugborow and the palace in the strand he finished his useful life in november      and was buried in the chapel of his own founding  the cathedral continued in the state it was left by bishop langton till the time of the dissolution when the rich shrine of st chad and other objects of similar devotion fell a prey to the rapacity of the prince the building continued in its pristine beauty till the unhappy wars of the last century cathedral fortified when it suffered greatly by three sieges the situation of the place on an eminence surrounded by water and by deep ditches and fortified with walls and bastions rendered it unhappily a proper place for a garrison  in      it was possessed by the royalists of the county under the earl of chesterfield when it underwent the attack rendered memorable by the death of lord brook commander of the parlementary forces his lordship in reconnoitring the cathedral in a wooden porch in dams street was shot into the eye by a musketball on march  d      this happened to be the festival of st chad the patron of the church the cavaliers attributed the direction of the fatal bullet to the influence of the saint in resentment of the sacrileges this nobleman was committing on his cathedral what share the saint had in this affair i will not pretend to say but the musket was aimed and the trigger drawn by a neighboring gentleman posted in the leads known by the name of dumb dyot the loss of lord brook gave very short respite to the garrison which was taken almost immediately after by sir john gell  in april in the same year it was attacked by prince rupert at that time it was commanded by colonel rouswel a steady governor over an enthusiastic garrison he defended the plac with vast resolution a breach was made by the blowing up o a mine the attack was made with great bravery but great loss at length the garrison gave up on the most honorable conditions clarendon ii      the colonel took care to plunder the church of the communionplate during the time the fanatics were in possession they used every species of profanation hunted a cat in it with hounds to enjoy the fine echo from the roof and brought a calf dressed in linen to the font and sprinkled it with water in derision of baptism mr greenes mss   the prince appointed colonel hervey bagot during the time this gentleman commanded at lichfield he received the following extraordinary challenge from a captain hunt a parlementary commander in tamworth mercurius aulicus p      bagot thou son of an egiption hoar meet me half the way to morrow morning the half way betwixt tamworth and litchfeald if thou dare if not i will whippe thee when soever i meet thee tamworth this december      the hunt   colonel bagot met him and after a brisk action whipped the fellow himself into his retreat and narrowly missed taking him  the governor who kept possession till the ruin of the kings affairs in      when the colonel and other commanders being satisfied that the king had not an hundred men in any one place in the field nor any garrison unbesieged surrendered on very honorable terms on the  0th of july to adjutant louthian articles of surrender   the state of this church after so many sieges may easily be conceived the honor of restoring it to its former splendour restored by bishop hacket was reserved for john hacket presented to this see in      on the very next day after his arrival he set his coachhorses with teams to remove the rubbish and in eight years time restored the cathedral to its present beautiful state at the expense of twenty thousand pounds br biogr iv      a ms with which mr green favored me makes the sum much less see appendix  one thousand of which was the gift of the dean and chapter the rest was done either at his own charge or by benefactions resulting from his own solicitations he died in    0 a very handsome tomb was erected in the choir to his memory with his effigies laid recumbent on it with a mitre on his head and in his episcopal dress  the west front is of great elegance adorned with the richest sculpture and till of late with rows of statues of prophets kings of judah etc and above all a very bad one of charles ii who had contributed to the repair of the church by a liberal gift of timber this statue was the work of a sir william wilson originally a mason from sutton coldfield who after marrying a rich wife arrived at the dignity of knighthood  the sculptures round the doors were very elegant but time or violence has greatly impaired their beauty  james ii when duke of york bestowed on this church the magnificent west window the fine painted glass was given of late years by dean addenbrook  the northern door is extremely rich in sculptured moldings rich north door three of soliage and three of small figures in ovals in one of the lowest is represented a monk baptizing a person kneeling before him probably the former is intended for st chad the latter for wulferus it is a misfortune that the ornaments of this cathedral are made of such friable stone that what fanaticism has spared the weather has impaired  in the front are two fine spires and a third in the center front of a vast height and fine proportion  the roof was till of late covered with lead but grew so greatly out of repair that the dean and chapter were obliged to substitute slates instead of metal on account of the narrow revenues left to maintain this venerable pile and after the strictest economy they will be under the necessity of contributing from their own income in order to complete their plan the excellent order that all the cathedrals i have visited are in does great credit to their members who spare nothing from their own incomes to render them not only decent but elegant  the body is lofty body supported by pillars formed of numbers of slender columns with neat foliated capitals along the walls of the ailes are rows of false arches in the gothic style with a seat beneath  the upper rows of windows in the body are of an uncommon form being triangular including three circles in each  in each transept are two places formerly chapels at present consistory courts and the vicars vestryroom  the choir merits attention choir on account of the elegant sculpture about the windows and the embattled gallery that runs beneath them on each side are six statues now much mutilated placed in beautiful gothic niches and richly painted the first on the left is st peter the next is the virgin the third is mary magdalene with one leg bare to denote her legendary wantonness the other three are st philip st james and st christopher with christ on his shoulders  the beauty of this choir is much impaired by the impropriety of a rich altarpiece of grecian architecture terminating this elegant gothic building  behind this is st marys chapel st marys chapel with a stone skreen the most elegant which can be imagined embattled at top and adorned with several rows of gothic niches of most exquisite workmanship each formerly containing a small statue beneath them are thirteen stalls with gothic work over each in this chapel are nine

ceolred saxon chr     king of the mercians and in later times here was placed the magnificent tomb on the site of the shrine of the first lord paget adorned with columns monuments with two kneeling figures of a man and woman between the front and back pillars these were destroyed in the blind fury of civil war as was another fine tomb of a lord basset of drayton who died in      few indeed

residence of the hastings who possessed this place in the time of edward i the present handsome seat is owned by  neale esquire  after a ride of two miles from hence coventry i entered coventry a great and ancient city the time of its foundation is unknown by the addition of tree a town it should seem as if it had been inhabited by the britons before the saxons added the word coven to it as is conjectured from a nunnery very anciently established here the site of the old town is supposed to have been on the north side of the present not only because great foundations are discovered about the spot called st nicholas churchyard but i may add from the tumulus near it on the atherston road called bars hill on which might have been a castelet  the certainty of there having been a convent here in the early times saxon nunnery depends on the authority of john rous leland iv     says it was founded by king canute who says that when the traitor edric ravaged this country in  0   he burnt the nunnery in this city of which a holy virgin st osburg had been abbess  on its ruins leofric fifth earl of mercia and his countess godeva founded a monastery at that period coventry must have been a considerable place and its number of inhabitants great otherwise the fair godeva could never have made so great a merit of riding naked through the town story of godeva to redeem it from the intolerable taxes and grievances it at that time labored under the cause must have been equal to the deed her husband long resisted her importunity in its behalf on account of the profits that accrued to him at length thought to silence her by the strange proposal she accepted it and being happy in fine flowing locks rode decently covered to her very feet with her lovely tresses the history was preserved in a picture about the time of richard ii in which were portrayed the earl and countess he holds a charter of freedom in his hand and thus addresses his lady i luriche leofric for love of thee do make coventre tollfree   legend says that previous to her ride all the inhabitants were ordered on pain of death to shut themselves up during the time but that the curiosity of a certain tailor overcoming fear took a single peep which is commemorated even at present by a figure looking out of a wall in the great street to this day the love of godeva to the city is annually remembered by a procession and a valiant fair still rides not literally like the good countess but in silk closely fitted to her limbs and of color emulating their complexion  after the conquest norman owners the lordship of this city fell by the marriage of lucia daughter to algar successor and son of edwin and grandson of leofric with her third husband randle meschine to the earls of chester leicester     cambden i      randle bestowed on it the same privileges that linsda enjoyed and bestowed great part of the city on the monks when henry iii took the earldom of chester into his hands the remainder of coventry fell to william de albany earl of arundel in right of his wife mabil daughter of hugh cevelio on the death of hugh earl of arundel in      it fell to roger de montalto who had married cecilia his youngest sister after that it was granted by his grandson robert in default of issue to isabel queen mother of edward iii with remainder to john of eltham afterward earl of cornwall and then to edward king of england it thus became annexed to the earldom of cornwall incorporated and became more immediately the object of royal favor edward iii in the eighteenth of his reign by letters dated the  0th of january made it a corporation consisting of a mayor and two bailiffs whom the inhabitants were to choose out of themselves the first mayor was john ward who was chosen in the year       henry vi in      bestowed on this city a very particular mark of his affection by erecting it with a considerable district around made a county into a county accurately laid down in mr beightons map of warwickshire  by the name of the city and county of coventry and ordered that the bailiffs from that time should be sheriffs so that at present it is governed by a mayor recorder two sheriffs ten aldermen thirtyone superior and twentyfive inferior commoncouncilmen henry came expressly to coventry heard mass in st michaels church presented the church with a gown of cloth of gold and then created the first sheriffs  the representatives are chosen by the citizens paying scot and lot and are returned by the sheriffs the city sent members the four first parlements of edward i that privilege was interrupted except the eighth of edward ii and twentieth and twentyfifth of edward iii till the thirtyfirst of henry vi when it was resumed  among all its privileges unfortunately for the magistrates it has that of life and death  two parlements have been held in this city parlements held here in the great chamber of the priory the first in   0  by henry iv which was styled parliamentum indoctorum not that it consisted of a greater number of blockheads than parlements ordinarily do but from its inveteracy against the clergy whose revenues it was determined not to spare whence it was also called the laymens parliament  the other was held in the chapter house of the priory in      by henry vi and was called parliamentum diabolicum by reason of the multitude of attainders passed against richard duke of york and his adherents  the trade of this city was originally the manufacture of cloth trade cloth and caps or bonnets andersons dict i      which arose to a great degree of consequence as early as      and continued till the last century when it was changed for the worsted business and for a long time the making and sale of shags camblets lastings tammies etc etc proved a very extensive and profitable trade but this gradually migrated into leicestershire and northamptonshire and at present only a few articles such as camblets and lastings constitute the woollen trade  i must remark that in the beginning or middle blue thread of the sixteenth century coventry had a vast manufacture of blue thread which was lost before the year      andersons dict i      so famous was it for its dye that true as coventry blue became proverbial  about eighty years ago ribands the silk manufacture of ribands was introduced here and for the first thirty years remained in the hands of a few people who acquired vast fortunes since which it has extended to a great degree and is supposed to employ at left ten thousand people and has likewise spread into the neighboring towns such as nuneaton and other places such real good results from our little vanities  there are about a dozen traders in coventry who have houses in london to which they send up weekly great quantities of ribands and before our unhappy breach with america a very extensive trade was carried on with the colonies but the homeconsumption has been always reckoned most material a few ribands are exported to spain portugal and russia but the french undersell us at those markets  within these few years four or five houses have begun to introduce the making of gauzes and for that purpose chiefly employ hands from scotland this branch is at present in its infancy another of broad silks was likewise set up which i am sorry to find does not go on with the expected success  the military transactions of this city are very few it was an open town for many centuries and of course incapable of sustaining a siege the walls were not begun till the year      walls and then by virtue of a license granted by edward iii twentyseven years before nor were they finished in less than forty they were built by money raised by taxes and by customs on the wine malt oxen hogs calves and sheep consumed in coventry these walls were of great strength and grandeur furnished with thirtytwo towers and twelve gates these continued till the   d of july      when great part of the wall and most of the towers and many of the gates were pulled down with certain circumstances of disgrace as a punishment for the disloyalty of the inhabitants in shutting their gates against their monarch charles i on the   th of august      his majesty after setting up his standard at nottingham had sent to this city to acquaint them that he meant to reside there for some time and desired quarters for his forces in and about the place the mayor and aldermen with many expressions of affection offered to receive the king but refused admittance to any of the soldiery incensed at this his majesty attacked the city city attacked by charles i and with his ordnance forced open one of the gates but was repulsed by the valor of the citizens and obliged to retire with loss vicars parliament chron      in the following month coventry was regularly garrisoned by the parliament whitelock     and remained in its possession during the whole war  i should have mentioned before that in the fifteenth century another monarch had been denied the possession of this city the great earl of warwick armed it against edward iv in    0 when he attempted entering on the side of gosford green the king amply repaid the insult on the citizens who perhaps acted by constraint he deprived them of their privileges and made them pay five hundred marks for the recovering of them by having the sword restored to them  before the building of the walls castle there had been from very early times a castle on the south side of the town near chylesmore with a park belonging to it this had been the residence of the kings and earls of mercia it afterward fell to the earls of chester and at length was vested in the royal line no vestige of it is now to be seen in its place is a very ancient wooden building the remains of the manorhouse of chylesmore probably built after the demolition of the castle  king stephen forcibly took this fortress from randle de gernons earl of chester the earl in      attempted to reduce it not by siege but by erecting a fort near it in order to distress the garrison by cutting off supplies the king twice attempted its relief the first time without success but in the second action he defeated the earl forced him to fly covered with wounds demolished and then demolished the castle leicesters cheshire ex gestis stephani       i shall take notice of the ecclesiastical history churches remains of religious houses and the public buildings in the course of my walk about the city in which i was accompanied by the reverend doctor edwards whose hospitality and politeness i have more than once had occasion to experience  coventry is seated on ground gently sloping on most sides city described its length from hillstreetgate to gosfordgate is about three quarters of a mile exclusive of the suburbs the streets in general are narrow and composed of very ancient buildings the stories of which in some impend one over the other in such a manner as nearly to meet at top and exclude the sight of the sky by the appearance of the whole it is very evident that it never underent the calamity of fire which deprecated as it ought to be is usually the cause of future improvement  the number of inhabitants taken at different periods numbers in the last two hundred years is very different before      they were found to have been   000 but on that violent convulsion the dissolution trade grew so low and occasioned such a dispersion of people from this city as to reduce them to  000 to remedy this evil edward vi granted the city a charter for an additional fair to this cause perhaps was owing the increase by the year      to   0  in      when the inhabitants were umbered from the apprehension of a siege they were found to amount to   00 dagdale i       0      by bradfords published by  in    0 survey of coventry made in      and      there appears to have been  0   houses and      people the accounts at present vary from  0000 to 0000 but from my enquiries the middle sum between both may come nearest the truth  the city is watered by the radford and the sherborn brooks which from n and s meet within the walls and after a short  bound the northeastern parts without the walls  we began our progress from the chester road sponne hospital for lepers on the western side of the city at the relics of sponne hospital consisting of the chapel and gateway it was founded for the lepers which happened to be in coventry by hugh ceveilioc earl of chester out of affection to william de auney a knight of his household afflicted with the leprosy here was also a priest to pray both for the living and the dead also certain brethren and sisters to pray with the lepers for the good estate of all their benefactors this hospital is said once to have belonged to the abbey of basingwerk in flintshire but at length was appropriated to the monk of coventry from whom it passed to the crown in the time of edward iv who gave it to the canons of studley in order to obtain their prayers for him and all his connections  that loathsome disorder which gave rise to this  appearance in england and number of other similar foundations was introduced into england in the reign of henry i and was supposed to have been brought out of egypt or perhaps the east by means of the crusades to add to the horror it was contagious which enhanced the charity of a provision for such miserables who were not only naturally shunned but even chaced by royal edict from the society of their fellow creatures edward iii drove from london all the lepers except fourteen who  dmittance into st giless hospital  all the lesser lazar houses in england were subject to the rich house at burton in leicestershire which again was subject to that in jerusalem anner     they were usually dedicated to st lazarus from whom they derived their name  a little farther is the entrance into the city sponne gate in my me under a venerable and magnificent gate called sponne gate  late years demolished in order to give admittance to the emous sponne gate wagons laden beyond the height of arches erected when war was our chief trade  immediately within the walls on the left stands the church of st john church of st john a very handsome building with a neat but not lofty tower placed in the center the inside is in form of a cross intersected by a short transept the windows high and form a long range with very narrow divisions this church was originally a chapel to the merchants gild the most ancient in coventry licensed by edward iii in    0 for a fraternity of brethren and sisters with a warden or master to be elected out of the body who might make chauntries bestow alms and do other works of piety constitute ordinances and purchase lands to the value of l 0 a year within the liberty of the city for the founding of a chauntry of six priests to sing mass every day in the churches of the holy trinity and st michael for the soul of king edward queen philippa their children and for the souls of the gild and others soon after isabel queen mother assigned the land on this spot then called bablake for the building a chapel in which masses were to be sung daily for the same purposes which was finished and dedicated in    0 at length in      license was given for celebrating divine service here provided it might be done without injury to the mother church dugd w i       on the dissolution its revenues were found to be l       s   d and that they supported a warden and eight priests who had chambers in the precinct a master of a grammar school two singingclerks and two singingboys and several poor men who had been brethren of the gild the church has of late years been rebuilt made a rectory by act of parliament in      and settled on the master of the free school of coventry ecton      behind this church is bablake hospital bablake hospital an old building with a court in the middle one part is occupied by bonds almshouses founded in   0  by thomas bond mayor of coventry in      for ten poor men and one poor woman with a priest to pray for the soul of the founder his grandfather father and all christian souls at that time the revenues were l      s   d in the first of edward viths time they were vested in the city and the revenues being improved at present they maintain eighteen old men and a nurse each of whom have three shillings a week a black gown and other emoluments dugd w i      about the year      an infernal ambition of becoming chief of the house seized one of the almsmen who to attain his end poisoned eight of his brethren five of whom instantly died on detection the wretch effected his own destruction by the same method and was buried with the usual marks of infamy had his fortune flung him into a higher station his deeds would have paralleled him with caesar borgia or his more monstrous father pope alexander vi  the other part of the building is allotted for the blue boys a foundation owing to a very singular accident mr thomas wheatly mayor of coventry in      and ironmonger and cardmaker by trade sent his servant oughton to spain to buy some barrels of steel gads which he thought he did in open fair when they were brought home and examined they were found to contain cochineal and ingots of silver mr wheatly kept them for a considerable time in hopes of discovering the owner for his servant did not know from whom he bought them at length he applied the profits as well as much of his own estate for the support of poor children  from thence my walk was continued along the west side of the

atherston  at the lower end of this street is the free school it sprung out of an hospital free school founded in the beginning of the reign of henry ii by laurence prior of coventry and his convent at the request of edmund archdeacon of coventry for the reception of the sick and needy at the dissolution john hales a gentleman who had large share in the plunder of the church and having neither wife or child converted this foundation which he had purchased at a very cheap rate into a free school and endowed it with cc marks a year in land at first the boys were instructed in the church of the white friars but the magistrates finding that mr hales had bought the lands but not the church took advantage of the flaw and removed the scholars to the present place and pulled down the church

without the priory gate is swanswell pool which supplies the city with water this did belong to the priory but was at the dissolution purchased by the corporation from the crown dugd w i       from hence i returned to the priory priory seated on the south side of the brook sherburn what bears that name is an uninhabited house of much later date than that monastery but built on some part of the site of this great foundation  about the year  0   earl leofric and his fair countess more than repaired the loss in  0   in the destruction of the famous saxon nunnery by founding in its stead a magnificent monastery they placed here an abbot and twentyfour monks of the benedictine order enriched the very walls and the church with massy gold and silver and endowed it with half the town and twentyfour manors all this they did with the advice of king edward the confessor and the reigning pope and dedicated the church to the honor of god and his blessed mother st peter st osburg and all saints the pious founders were buried according to the custom of the times in the porches for the distasteful custom of church interment did not prevale till long after  the first abbot was leofrin but that dignity was of short duration for on the removal of the sea of lichfield to this place in  0   by robert de limisie the office was suppressed the bishop being in such cases always esteemed supreme of the house williss abbeys i  0 in his stead a prior was appointed but without derogating from the honor of the house for the priors were barons in parliament as well as the preceding abbots and the place a mitred abbey this first prelate was more attracted by the wealth of the house than by any spiritual call for he at once scraped from a single beam five hundred marks worth of silver in order to carry on the intrigue at rome against the poor monks he reduced them to such short commons that he depressed their spirits discouraged all sorts of knowledge among them and in short rendered them too dejected to think of obtaining any redress  this was a prelude to greater misfortunes in the latter end of the following century hugh novani a norman became bishop he soon fell at variance with the monks who in a synod held before the high altar doubtless on some high provocation broke his head with the holy cross tantaene animis caelestibus irae  this enraged the proud prelate as he was called by those meek monks to lay his complaint against them at rome the pope attended to it expelled the ancient inhabitants and placed in their room a set of secular canons the monks now driven into the wild world had only the satisfaction of seeing their persecutor struck with deep remorse for in      lying on his deathbed in the abbey of bec in normandy he was seized with fierce horrors at his conduct toward those holy men implored forgiveness and desired their intercession with the almighty in his behalf he requested to be buried in the habit of the order that he might receive the benefit of its protection in the other world and finally consigned himself to purgatory ibi in diem judicii cruciandus  luckily at the time of this event thomas a monk of coventry happened to be at rome soliciting the cause of his brethren he so enraged innocent iii then pope by his importunities as to order him to withdraw the poor monk with tears replied another pope will come to whom i shall not sue in vain i therefore will patiently wait your death as i have that of your two predecessors here is a devil of a fellow says his holiness in high wrath to his attendants by st peter he shall not wait for my death so i will not put him off any longer but make out the purpose of his petition before i put a morsel more into my mouth dugdale w i       this troublesome affair ended they were replaced with double advantage their privileges as if by way of atonement for their short sufferings increased beyond all reason for in the time of edward iii they obtained that they and their tenants

say as many prayers as there were in it precious stones  and besides this an arm of st augustine of hippo which agelnethus archbishop of canterbury in  0 0 bought at rome from the pope for the small sum of c talents of silver and one of gold dugdale w i     goodwin      but even this arm had not power to ward off the blow given by the more irresistible one of henry viii who not content with the expulsion of its inhabitants and seizure of the revenues directed this noble pile to be levelled with the ground which he did notwithstanding the earnest prayers of its bishop rowland lee one of his most servile tools a deed equally wanton and impious  the loss is the more to be regretted as this cathedral is supposed to have been built on the model of that of lichfield and equally beautiful nothing remains except a fragment constituting part of a private house to be seen with difficulty and after some search the palace stood between the priory and saint michaels and was sold in      for its materials to nathaniel lacy and obadiah chambers for the sum of an hundred guineas the last prior thomas camsel in      was prevaled on to make a surrender of the house either through fear of

churches all standing within one coemetery st michaels church saint michaels at present is a specimen of the most beautiful steeple in europe a tower enriched with faintly figures on the sides an octagon rising out of it and that lengthened into a most elegant spire every part is so finely proportionable that it is no wonder that sir christopher wren spoke of it as a masterpiece of architecture the outside is extremely handsome the inside light and lofty consisting of a body and two ailes divided by four rows of high and airy pillars and arches the height of the steeple and length of the church are the same three hundred and three feet the width of the latter an hundred and four  in king stephens time this church was a chapel to the monks became afterward a vicarage and on the dissolution fell to the gift of the crown this trinity and st johns form the parishes of this great city so numerous are the dissenters  its beautiful steeple was begun in the reign of edward iii in      by two brothers adam and william bota at their own charges which amounted annually to one hundred pounds nor was it finished in less than twenty years by the style of architecture i agree with sir william dugdale that the present body was built in the reign of henry vi some ornament was also added to the steeple at the same time coventry seems to have been particularly favored by henry or to speak more properly of that meek prince by the heroine margaret for this city used to be styled the secret harbor of that queen  trinity church and its spire would be spoken of as a most beautiful building was it not eclipsed by its unfortunate vicinity to st michaels within are two epitaphs which i give for their singularity one is on philemon holland the famous translator he was

the former had sely betrayed a private conversation in which he said that mbray had dropped several expressions of a treasonable nature the accusation was denied and according to the barbarous sage of the times mowbray demanded the privilege of acquitng himself by single combat each of the dukes agreeable to the laws of chivalry flung down his glove which was taken up before the king and sealed polychronico xxi i suppose to prevent any future denal of the challenge the king appointed coventry for the place of combat and caused for that purpose a vast and magnificent theater to be erected on

to foreign armourers  i shall deliver in the words of his noble translator sir john bourchier lord    these two lords made provision for that was necessary for them for their battle the earl of derby the  of hereford sent his ssangers in to lombardy to the duke of myllayn sir gal for to have armure at his pleasure the duke agreed  the earls desire and caused the knight that the earl had sent  whose name was fraunces to se all the dukes armorye  when the knight had chosen such as he lyked than the duke rthermore for love of the earl of derby he sent four of the best armourers that were in

journey the charge of these two lords was great but the earl of derby was at most charge  the armor of the great men was uncommonly splendid and expensive usually inlaid with gold and silver with most elegant devices and patterns that of francis i in possession of mr wpe and that of george earl of cumberland at appleby castle exist as specimens of the great attention given to that circumstance besides beauty the utmost regard was paid to the essential requisite of its being proof this was to be the result of the  of the amourer not of artmagic for the combatants ere to clear themselves by

dependence on the power of satan and supplicated the prayers of the pious  ad roof unto my armor with thy prayers and with thy blessings steel my lances point  ii in a speech of hereford on this occasion    i shall give the consequence of this important affair in the very graphical words of honest holinshed who minutely describes the pomp and ceremony preceding the resolution taken by the unfortunate monarch which in the end cost him his crown and life  at the time appointed the king came to coventrie where the two dukes were ready according to the order prescribed therein coming thither in great arraie accompanied with the lords and gentlemen of their linages the king caused a sumptuous scaffold or theater and roial listes there to be erected and prepared the sundaie before they should fight after dinner the duke of hereford came to the king being lodged about a quarter of a mile without the town in a tower that belonged to sir william bagot to take his leave of him the morrow after being the day appointed for the combat about the spring of the day came the duke of norfolk to the court to take leave likewise of the king the duke of hereford armed him in his tent that was set up near to the lists and the duke of norfolk put on his armor betwixt the gate and the barrier of the town in a beautiful house having a fair perclois of wood toward the gate that none might see what was done within the house  the duke of aumarle that day being high constable of england and the duke of surrie marshal placed themselves betwixt them well armed and appointed and when they saw their time they first entered into the lists with a great company of men apparelled in silk sendal imbrodered with silver both richly and curiously every man having a tipped staff to keep the field in order about the hour of prime came to the barriers of the lists the duke of hereford mounted on a white courser barded with green and blew velvet imbroidered sumptuously with swans and antelopes of goldsmiths work armed at all points the constable and marshal came to the barriers demanding of him what he was he answered i am henry of lancaster duke of hereford which am come hither to do mine endeavor against thomas mowbraie duke of norfolk as a traitor untrue to god the king his realm and me  then incontinently he swear upon the holy evangelists that his quarrel was true and just and upon that point he required to enter the lists then he puts up his sword which before he held up naked in his hand and putting down his visor made a cross on his horse and with spear in hand entered into the lists and descended from his horse and set him down in a chair of green velvet at the one end of the lists and there reposed himself abiding the coming of his adversary  soon after him entered into the field with great triumph king richard accompanied with all the peerses of the realm and in his company was the earl of saint paul which was come out of france in post to see this challenge performed the king had there above ten thousand men in armor least some fraie or tumult might rise amongst his nobles by quarrelling or partaking when the king was set in his seat which was richly hanged and adorned a king at arms made open proclamation prohibiting all men in the name of the king and of the high constable and marshal to enterprise or attempt to approach or touch any part of the lists upon pain of death except such as were appointed to order or marshal the field the proclamation ended another herald cried behold here henry of lancaster duke of hereford appelant which is entered into the lists royal to do his devoir against thomas mowbraie duke of norfolk defendant upon pain to be found false and recreant  the duke of norfolk hovered on horsseback at the entry of the lists his horse being barded with crimson velvet imbrodered richly with lions of silver and mulberie trees and when he had made his oath before the constable and marshal that his quarrel was just and true he entered the field manfully saying aloud god and him that has the right and then he departed from his horse and sat him down in his chair which was of crimson velvet courtined about with white and red damask the lord marshall viewed their spears to see that they were of equal length and delivered the one spear himself to the duke of hereford and sent the other unto the duke of norfolk by a knight then the herald proclaimed that the traverses and chaires of the champions should be removed commanding them on the kings behalf to mount on horssebacke and address themselves to the battle and combat holinsheds chr       the duke of hereford was quickly horssed and closed his bauier and cast his spear into the rest and when the trumpet founded set forward courageously toward his enemy six or seven pases the duke of norfolk was not fully set forward when the king cast down his warder and the heralds cried ho ho then the king caused their spears to be taken from them and commanded them to repair again to their chaires where they remained two long hours while the king and his council deliberatlie consulted what order was best to be had in so weighty a cause finally after they had devised and fully determined what should be done therein the heralds cried silence and sir john bushie the kings secretary read the sentence and determination of the king and his council in a long roll the effect whereof was that henry duke of hereford should within fifteen days depart out of the realm and not to return before the term of ten years were expired except by the king he should be repealed again and this upon pain of death and that thomas mowbraie duke of norfolk because he had sown sedition in the relme by his words should likewise avoid the realm and never return again into england nor approach the borders or confines thereof upon pain of death and that the king would stae the profits of his lands till he had levied thereof such sums of money as the duke had taken up of the kings treasuror for the wages of the garrison of calis which were still unpaid  when these judgments were once read the king called before him both parties and made them to swear that the one should never come in place where the other was willingly nor keep any company together in any foreign region which oath they both received humbly and so went their ways the duke of norfolk departed sorrowfully out of the realm into almanie and at the last came into venice where he for thought and melancholy deceassed for he was in hope as writers record that he should have been borne out in the matter by the king which when it fell out otherwise it greeved him not a little the duke of hereford took his leave of the king at eltham who there released four years of his banishment so he took his jornie over into calis and from thence went into france where he remained  a wonder it was to see what number of people ran after him in every town and street where he came before he took the sea lamenting and bewailing his departure as who should say that when he departed the only shield defense and comfort of the commonwealth was vaded and gone  about two miles from coventry i crossed the little river sow at binly bridge a little beyond which stands the beautiful small church of the name dedicated to st bartholomew binly church formerly belonging to the monks of

small doors the entrance into the cells of the austere inhabitants  this religious house arose from the pious intentions of william lord zouch of harringworth in northamptonshire who obtaining in      fourteen acres of land in this place from sir baldwyn frevile the elder determined on that to erect a monastery of carthusians and endow it with ample revenues death prevented the execution but in his last illness he left sixty pounds toward a future establishment  the design was speedily completed by various pious persons richard luff a mayor of coventry and richard botoner a fellowcitizen bestowed four hundred marks on the churchchoir cloisters and three cells others followed their example richard ii on his return from scotland in      assumed the honor of being the founder and at the

rivers from its situation between them certainly it was a place of note at the conquest had in it sixteen ploughlands in the manor three with three slaves twenty villeyns a presbyter and ten boors and twelve acres of meadow it had been worth three pounds after that event improved to eight  this was part of the great possessions of the countess judith niece to the conqueror whom he had married to

obliged judith to a state of penitential widowhood during life  here are some remains of the priory priory inhabited by poor families the place is easily discovered by several gothic windows and a

with the poor monks about certain lands of theirs and causing the dispute to be referred to himself took occasion to dissolve the house and as stow says to be given to his own college but of this irreligious robbery done of no conscience but to patch up pride which private wealth could not furnish what punishment has since ensued by gods hand says mine author partly ourselves have seen for of those five persons two fell at discord between themselves and the one slew the other for which the survivor was hanged the third drowned himself in a well the fourth being well known and valued worth two hundred pounds became in three years so poor that he begged till his dyingday and the fifth called doctor allane being chief executor of these doings was cruelly maimed in ireland even at such time as he was bishop annals       the pious historian then traces the judgment to the cardinal who died under the kings displeasure to the colleges which occasioned the sacrilege that of ipswich being pulled down that of christchurch never finished under wolseys patronage and lastly to the pope who permitted these violences on religious houses for he was besieged in his holy see and suffered

and of the earl of winchelsea lord of the manor grace the east window  from daventry i visited the noted camps on boroughhill boroughhill or daneshill about a mile southeast of the town it is lofty and insulated the area is of an oblong or oval form about a measured mile in length and near two in circumference the whole is surrounded by two three or four deep trenches and the same number of great ramparts or banks according as the strength or weakness of the ground required these run on the margin of the hill and on the slope and having the entrance on the eastern and western sides opposite to each other  within the area near the middle is a bank which passes strait from the western side toward the eastern the remainder is destroyed farther on is the vestige of another running parallel these when entire would have formed a rectangular camp by the assistance of part of the ditches on the sides of the hill  near this camp are several tumuli of the sepulchral kind but since mr mortons time their number is evidently lessened for in his days he informs us there were eighteen  the northern end of the hill is formed into a third camp of a circular shape and of vast strength two ditches of prodigious depth with suitable ramparts and a deep entrance cross the area and fall into the general surrounding ditches which have been deepened to add to the strength of the third part there is likewise the imperfect remains of another ditch and bank on the outside a little south designed to add to the security  on the northwest part of the great rampart of this round camp is a great mount either exploratory or the spot where the chieftain pitched his tent  i must differ with mr morton about the makers of the first of these camps or posts which were the britons themselves it has every agreement with the multitudes of others scattered over the kingdom and suits exactly with the description left by tacitus of the method of defense used by our ancestors tunc montibus arduis et si qua clementer accedi poterunt in modum valli saxa praestruit i shall not here repeat what i have fully dwelt on in my tours in wales and scotland tour scotl      part ii     tour wales       this post was in all probability made use of when the victorious ostorius was traversing this island to quell the commotions he found on his arrival in britain it is evident that the britons at this period made use of the same species of defense which is proved to have been common to the whole country the iceni lodged themselves within a post of this kind against this very general locum pugnae delegere septum agresti aggere et aditu angusto ne pervius equis foret taciti annal lib xii c    but it did not avale the coritani of these parts had recourse to the strong hold of what i dare say they called ben avon or the head over the river one of the streams which form the nen the river of this country passing beneath  this post proved no obstacle to the conqueror he found it sit for a station he contracted its limits east into the shape of the camps of his people and made this a summer station as he did the warm bottom near the fort a winter station numbers of roman coins found on the spots evince the conjecture the romans as is frequently the case latinized the british name and formed from it their benvenna which i beg leave to place here rather than at wedon a place destitute of all classical traces  i must add that on the southeast side of boroughhill about two or three hundred yards below the ditches is a lesser camp surrounded by a fosse and bank mr morton guesses it to have been the receptacle of the carriages of the greater camp i imagine it to have been a procestria a sort of free post attendant often on camps where provisions and other necessaries were brought  as to the third division of the area of this hill it is probably saxon the words borough burgh berry and bury being the constant appellation left by the saxons to similar places it is my belief that every post of this nature occupied by that nation in our island had been originally british which they altered to their conceptions of strength and defense which was usually done by deepening the ditches raising the ramparts and clearing the area and often exalting one part into what was called the dunjeon or keep these places were stationary not properly camps for the ancient germans from whom these invaders were derived and whose customs they retained made use of no other defense to their camps than a barrier of wagons with which they formed the precinct omnes barbari says vegetius carris suis in orbem connexis ad similitudinem castrorum securas a supervenientibus exigunt noctes lib iii c  0  caesar twice bell gal lib   and lib iv mentions this custom among the german nations and i am told that even in later days this mode of defense has been used and called waggenburg or the camp of wagons  every thing on this hill must not be attributed to remote antiquity for charles i a few days before the fatal battle of naseby occupied this post and fortified it so possibly some of the entrenchments might be the work of the unfortunate monarch whitelock   0   i must not quit this place without mentioning a spot which i overlooked burnt walls this is what mr morton calls the burnt walls where many loads of walls and foundations have been dug up the precinct is about six acres and was moated round the water that filled the moat was conveyed from pools in daventry park a place not remote tradition says that within the area stood a seat of john of gaunt which is probable as this manor was once possessed by the earls and dukes of lancaster in edward iiis time annexed to that duchy and assigned to that great duke hist northampt      continue my journey turn a little out of my road on the left dodford church to dodford church and found there a tomb of a crosslegged knight armed in mail with both hands upon his sword as if in the attitude of drawing it on his shield are illblazoned vaire argent and azure two bars gules which denote the person here deposited to have been a keynes one of the ancient lords of the place and from the attitude of his legs to have lived during the fashionable madness of crusades  two ladies in hoods recumbent said to have been two sisters coheiresses of the manor and probably margaret and maud de ayote who were possessed of this

on the edge of leicestershire passes close by boroughhill and proceeds from wedon to toucester and stoney stratford where it enters the county of bucks  near the sixtyeighth milestone is the entrance to the new turnpikeroad to northampton which is above seven miles distant and on an eminence a little to the left is pleasantly seated the church and village of flore or flower  a little beyond on the right lies the village of wedon on the street wedon or weedon bec from which i choose to transfer the old bennevenna to boroughhill on account of deficiency of classical evidence at this place and the little difference of distance from the other stations  sufficient honor will remain to wedon in allowing it to have been the site of the royal palace of wulfere bridges     the mercian monarch afterward converted into a nunnery at the instance of his daughter st werburg who presided for a time over it here she performed the miracle of the wild geese who at her word forgot their nature were driven by her steward from their ravages among the corn into the grange and after receiving from her a severe check for their depredations were commanded to take wing and never appear in her demesns they obeyed in part but kept hovering about till one of their companions which had been stolen and some say eaten by a servant was restored on which they bid an eternal adieu to the fields of wedon cressys cb hist       this nunnery was destroyed by the danes but the memory of the foundress was preserved in lelands day by a fair chapel dedicated to that saint leland itin i      after the conquest roger de thebovil gave a moiety of lands in this monastery to the abbey of bec in normandy which was with many other grants to the same house confirmed by henry ii that abbey afterward became possessed of the whole when it was made dependent on their great cell or priory at okeburn in wiltshire vast privileges were bestowed in favor of the monks of this abbey such as exemption from suit and service to the county and hundred courts from toll passage and pontage and exemption from forest laws they had also free warren and right of determining in murder manslaughter etc etc all which perished at the dissolution of the priories and this manor as part of the possessions of okeburn was vested in the provost and fellows of eton college by henry vi in which it still continues hist northampt    in which mr bridges denies that there ever was a priory here as sir w dugdale and bishop tanner imagine   from hence i was led by my curiosity about two miles westward castle dikes to castle dikes in the parish of farthingstone remarkable for some ancient works attributed to the saxons they are placed on the brow of a steep hill commanding a vast view but at present so overgrown with thick woods that i had but a very indistinct sight of them they appeared to comprehend near thirteen acres of ground and to consist of strong holds divided from each other by a ditch of stupendous breadth and depth a plat called the castleyard stands to the southwest of these entrenched on all sides but the southwest comprehending about seven acres on which tradition says a town was situated  mr morton informs us that a vaulted room formed of squared stones was discovered in his time and beneath that another which falling in accidentally a smell resembling that of putrid carcases issued from it two or three rude sculptures were also discovered among the rubbish  it is conjectured that this place was burnt by the danes for vast masses of cinders mixed with pebbles and clay have been found in different parts and many of the stones had on them the marks of fire mr morton      there is no account left of the particulars of their ravages so this rests upon conjecture as well as the notion of ethelfleda having been founder of this place among her other great works performed in      on my return to the great road about two miles from the place i visited the church of stowninechurches stowninechurches to see the most elegant tomb which this or any other kingdom can boast of that of elizabeth fourth daughter of john lord latimer wife first to sir john danvers of dantrey wiltshire and afterward to sir edmund carry third son of henry lord hunsdon her figure is of white marble lying recumbent on a slab of black the attitude is the most easy possible that of one asleep her head covered with a loose hood reclines on a rich cushion one hand is placed on her breast the other lies on one side round her neck is a quilled ruff the fashionable stiffness of her embroidered stays is a disadvantage to this elegant sculpture her gown flows to her feet in easy folds and covers them she lies on a long cloak lined with ermine fastened at her neck with rich jewels at her feet is a griffin holding a shield of the familyarms the whole rests on a white marble altartomb with inscriptions and arms on the sides after informing us of her parentage marriages and

great nephew to the conqueror the last died in       from hence i descended to the great road the country hilly and clayey the quarries are of a coarse grit stone often filled with shells but of too shattery a nature to be used except in ordinary buildings a few miles farther is an eminence called forsters booth so named from a booth erected here by one forster a poor countryman it grew at length into a scattered street of several houses and carriers inns through which runs the watlingstreet road in a direct line to toucester four miles distant  this is a pretty considerable town seated on a plain toucester on a small stream called the tove from which the name is derived toucester or the castle on the tove the great tumulus on the east side of the town points out of the site of the speculum or watchtower the roman coins found in digging about prove it to have been an appendage to a roman station whose name has never reached us the saxons profited of this little fortress and added the fosse which surrounded it from them it received its present title of the bury or borough to which has been since added the double tautology of berry mounthill  the saxons called the town tofeceastre in the time of edward the elder it was almost ruined by the ravages of the danes but in     the king determined to restore it and for that purpose detached part of his forces who soon after their arrival were attacked by the danes resident in northampton and leicester sax chr  0   but assisted by the townsmen they repelled the barbarians and edward in order to prevent future insults fortified the whole place with a stone wall sax chr  0   but time has destroyed every vestige of it  this manor after various changes became the property of the famous sir richard empson one of the instruments of the avarice and oppression of henry vii who in   0  lost his head with edmund dudley on tower hill perhaps more deservedly than legally empson had been the son of a sievemaker in this town by his great abilities in the profession of the law he was promoted to the chancellorship of the duchy of lancaster but by his unbounded submission to the will of his rapacious master fell a victim in the next reign to the demands of an enraged nation at present the manor belongs to the earl of pomfret who derives it from his ancestor richard fermor a merchant of calais and a younger brother of the ancient house of fermors of oxfordshire  there was a church here at the conquest church which was given by the conqueror to the abbey of st wandragasile in normandy in the present is nothing remarkable excepting the tomb of william sponne archdeacon of norfolk and rector of this parish in the reign of henry vi who founded here a college and chantry for two priests to say mass for his soul and the souls of his friends at the dissolution it was worth l     s   d a year tanner      he was also a great benefactor to the town and his charities are still felt here governed by feoffees consisting of fifteen of the principal inhabitants  his figure is represented recumbent dressed in a red gown which reaches round his feet with ermine hood and sleeves beneath is another representation of him after death with a sunk nose and emaciated body and all the changes wrought by that fell monster on the human frame  the town is supported by the great concourse of passengers and by a manufacture of lace and a small one of silk stockings the first was imported from flanders and carried on with much success in this place and still more in the neighboring county of buckingham  i took a walk about a mile east of the town to see eastonneston eastonneston the seat of the earl pomfret the wings were built by sir christopher wren in      the center by hawkesmore

curious portraits and valuable statues the latter having been presented to the university of oxford by the late countess of pomfret grandaughter to the lord chancellor jeffries  this manor was purchased by the same richard fermor manor in    0 from thomas son of sir richard empson the ancient house stood below the church in a park enclosed by sir richard by license from henry vii at the time it came into the possession of mr fermor he lived here with boundless hospitality till the year    0 when for sending   d and a couple of shirts to one nicholas thane his confessor then in prison at buckingham for denying the kings supremacy he incurred the tyrants displeasure he fell under a praemunire and in his old age being stripped of all he had was forced to live with the parson of wapenham whom he had presented which he did for several years with consummate piety and resignation bridges   0   the recovery of part of his fortune was owing to a singular accident during his prosperous days he kept as usual in those days in the establishment of people of rank a fool or jester his was the noted will summers will summers who for his drollery was promoted to the same office

him ordered restitution collinss peerage v  0  but died before it could be effected his pious successor edward vi restored to him this manor that of toucester and some others of his estates and added many grants by way of compensation for the injury done him but all fell short of the great losses he had sustained from the cruel father he returned to his house which he enjoyed only two years dying in january       he seemed to have a presage of his end for on the day of his death he had invited a number of his friends and neighbors took his leave of them retired to his closet and was found dead

hero he also improved himself by foreign travel lived at home with vast splendour and hospitality and on june      0  his house had the honor of being the place of meeting between james i and his

a man in long hair above are three most awkward figures of kneeling women i must not quit the lady without saying she suffered with exemplary patience a long imprisonment and great confiscations on account of the loyalty of her family which were rewarded with a peerage in the person of her son sir william fermor  from hence i continued my journey southward and much of the way near the borders of whittlewood or whittlebury forest whittlebury forest which still continues wooded for several miles in length and of different extents in breadth in a most deep and clayey country much of the timber is cut in rotation but in parts toward the edge of buckinghamshire are considerable quantities of good oak this forest remained in the crown till the year      when henry fitzroy first duke of grafton was appointed hereditary ranger the present duke has an elegant house called wakefield lodge designed by w kent  originally built by mr claypole soninlaw to oliver cromwell and ranger of the forest this was one of the five tracts called walks viz wakefield shelbrook hazelbury shrob and hanger fourteen townships are allowed the right of common in the open coppices and ridings from the principle of justice that some reparation might be made to them for the damages sustained by the deer in this great tract here are two lawns i e spots enclosed with pales for pasture for the deer one is wakefield lawn the other sholbrook lawn which are secluded from the forest cattle  that fierce animal the wild cat is still met with in this forest in the reign of richard i the abbot and convent of peterborough had a charter for hunting in this place the hare the fox and the wild cat which was confirmed to them in      by henry iii morton      by these charters the wild cat should be added to the beasts of forest or of venerie which the book of st albans and old sir tristram in his worthy treatise of hunting confined to the heart the hynde the hare the boar and the wolf the heart and hind being separated because the season of hunting them was different yet they remain in species still the same beasts of the chase which was an inferior sort of forest were the buck the do the fox the martion and the roe manwoods forest laws      the fondness that seized the regular clergy for the pleasures of the chase did not appear till after the conquest the saxon clergy were expressly forbidden the amusement king edgar directs the priest to be neither a hunter nor hawker nor yet a tippler but to keep close to his books as becomes a man of his order leges saxon      the canon law still preserved its severity and forbad to spiritual persons the amusement of the chase this probably was rather designed to check what might by the excess estrange them from their sacred function the common law from a principle of good sense and humanity permitted the recreation from these arguments that nothing could contribute more effectually to the performance of their duty than good health resulting from fit exercise as nothing could disqualify them so greatly as the disorders arising from a sedentary life this indulgence probably soon ended in abuse in the twelfth century we find abelard unhappy in presiding over a monastery of huntsmen chaucer as i have before quoted flings a fine ridicule on the sporting monk finally the chase became so necessary an appendage to the ecclesiastical state that every see had a number of parks that of norwich thirteen and the sixth mortuary which the king clamed on the death of a prelate was his kennel of hounds  pass by potters pery potters pery a village which takes its name from the manufacture of coarse ware such as flowerpots etc which has been long carried on here the clay is yellowish pure and firm yet the pots made with it are very brittle unless glazed when they endure the weather as well as any  the postroad is still continued the whole way on or near the watlingstreet near potters pery i quitted it passenham through curiosity of visiting passenham about a mile or two distant on the banks of the ouze near this village edward the elder encamped here to cover his workmen who were employed in building the walls of toucester saxon chr  0   from being interrupted by the danes a square entrenchment is supposed to have been cast up by him and garrisoned for that purpose  the church is small church and without ailes

by the last an only daughter who conveyed the estate by marriage with william lord maynard into that family a younger branch of which possesses it as i apprehend at present  i regained the great road and passed through the hamlet of old stratford seated on rich meadows old stratford watered by the ouze which rises in this county not remote from brackly this place is reasonably supposed to have been the lactodorum or lactorodum of the itinerary as the distance suits extremely well and roman coins have been found in the neighboring fields antiquaries derive it from llech dwr and llech rhyd one signifying the stone on the water the other the stone on the ford see gale  0 and burton      a name bestowed on it by the britons probably because the bank of the river was marked by a military stone on this great military way i here cross the river into buckinghamshire which with bedfordshire and hertfordshire formed the country of the catticuchlani the present name is according to mr cambden taken from the quantity of beeches found in parts of it a word derived from the saxon bucken two arguments serve to confirm the assertion of caesar that this tree was not found in britain at the time of his invasion one is that the woods of it are merely local and confined to a very few of our southern counties the other is that the britons had no name for it but what they derived from the latin fagus for they styled it as we do still ffawydden and pren ffawydd  on crossing the ouze i entered stoney stratford stoney stratford a town built on each side of the watlingstreet it suffered greatly by fire on may the   th      which almost destroyed the whole place but it was soon restored by the vigor of english charity one church that of st giles has never been rebuilt the

benedictine nuns founded in the time of king stephen by roger de tonei the manor had been granted by the conqueror to ralph de tonei his predecessor was a saxon knight called thurnoth who with the true spirit of the times engaged with thirteen soldiers waldef and thurman to protect all passengers from the thieves and wild beasts which then infested the road and in time of war to protect the church of st albans with all their might leofftan abbot of that convent in the time of the confessor facilitated the undertaking by cutting down the great woods on the side of the watlingstreet which gave shelter to robbers he bestowed on thurnoth this manor who in return presented leofftan with five ounces of gold and a fair palfrey thurnoth at the conquest resisted the power of the norman invader who bestowed it on de tonei who directed that the same services should be strictly performed to the abbey chauncy     who by mistake calls this de tonei roger but in page     gives him his right name   about three miles further go through redburn a small town redburn built like the former on each side of the ancient road at this place was discovered the bones of st amphibalus the noble briton who lodging at the house of st alban at verulam proved the means of his conversion in the dioclesian persecution he was diligently sought after but st alban generously determined not to give up his guest promoted his escape by putting on his preceptors cloak and suffering himself to be seized by the soldiers in his stead bid de br eccl      amphibalus for a time evaded their fury but was at length seized and underwent a most cruel death weevers fun mon      on the spot on which his pious convert was martyred the christians stole the body and gave it a private interment at this place in      the relics were removed to st albans enshrined near those of his fellowsufferer and a prior and three monks with  0 s a year were appointed guardians of the sacred deposit i am sorry to find that after all the very existence of this saint is doubted for there are some who believe that the saint was no more than an amphibalus a long cloak which st alban before he went to execution threw about him which being at length personified was canonized and received into the calendar usher de br eccl       a cell consisting of a prior and a few benedictines from st albans was placed here it was

place quits the watlingstreet which runs direct on the right to verulanium the former can boast of no great extent of view but is bounded by beautiful risings varied with woods and enclosures dressed

the british marls then that they will last eighty years and that there is not an example of any person being obliged to marl his land twice in his life the same  an experienced farmer whom i met with

too favorable to the tenets which under him acquired strength in the following reign to subvert both church and state with the assistance of the contrary conduct of the indiscreet and furious land how difficult is the virtue of moderation abbot gloriously resisted the licensing of a slavish sermon preached by doctor sibthorp and fell into disgrace his office was suspended nor was it taken off till

dukes death became his successor in the public hatred without succeeding him in his credit at court clarendon i     his lust after power and his rapacity to raise a great fortune were unmeasurable yet the jealousy of his temper frustrated the one and the greatness of his expenses the other his imperious nature led him to give frequent offense yet his timidity obliged him to make humiliating concessions to the very people he had offended he had a strange curiosity to learn what the persons injured said of him the knowledge of which always brought on fresh troubles as he would expostulate with them for their severe sayings as if he had never given cause for them by which he would often discover the mean informant of his fruitless intelligence he died in march      in universal

nottingham in his robes with the seals in his hands chancellor nottingham and long deep brown hair this nobleman was lord chancellor in the reign of charles ii and in those dangerous times distinguished himself for his integrity and prudence in steering clear from a criminal compliance with the views of the court or humouring the unbounded faction of the popular side he brought the peerage into the family which rare to say has never been fullied by those who have derived the honor from him he received the seals in      died in       this concludes the list of portraits in the noble gallery of gorhambury scattered over the house are a few others which merit mention as persons eminent in their generation among them is one which ought properly to have led the van the head of sir nicholas bacon his dress a furred robe sir nicholas bacon he was a person of a very corpulent habit for which reason queen elizabeth used to say that her lord keepers soul lodged well to what i have given of him before i shall only add that he caught his death by sleeping in his chair with a window open he awoke disordered and reproving his servant for his negligence was told that he feared to wake him then replies the keeper your complaisance will cost me my life he died in       another head of his second wife in a close cap and white gown his second wife worked with oakleaves and acorns this distinguished lady was anne daughter of sir anthony cook of giddyhall in essex she had great abilities natural and acquired and was eminently skilled in greek latin and italian she had the honor of being appointed governess to edward vi chauncy i hertfordsh      to her instructions was probably owing the surprising knowledge of the excellent young prince she shared his education with her father doctor cox and sir john cheek complete hist engl ii      her sons anthony and francis were not a little indebted for the reputation they acquired to the pains taken with them by this excellent woman in their tender years br biegr i      when they grew up they found in her a severe but admirable monitor she translated from the italian the sermons of barnardine ochine and from the latin jewels apology for the church of england both which met with the highest applause she died in the beginning of the reign of james i and was buried in the neighboring church of saint michael ballards br ladies       a beautiful picture of lady margaret russel countess of cumberland daughter to francis earl of bedford and wife to george earl of cumberland and mother to the celebrated anne clifford a lady happier in the filial affections of her daughter than the conjugal tenderness of her husband who taken up with military glory and the pomps of tilts and tournaments paid little attention to domestic duties in her diary which is preserved in manuscript i find she suffered even to poverty and complains of her ill usage in a most suppliant and pathetic manner her lord felt heavy compunction on his deathbed i cannot help relating two of the minutiae of her journal she relates that anne clifford was begot on her the first of may      in channelrow house hard by the margaret countess of cumberland river thames and in skipton castle on bardon tower she felt a child stir in her belly she survived her lord  the dress of the portrait is very elegant her hair is

pearl  a halflength of sir george croke sir george croke one of the judges of the kings bench in the time of charles i in his robes distinguished for his knowledge of the laws he was one of the judges who had the honor of deciding against the illegality of ship money yet still on account of his eminent qualities preserved the favor of the court when sunk in years and petitioning for a retreat the king granted his request and rewarded his services with the sees and honor of chief justice during life lloyd ii      mundum vicit et deseruit says his epitaph aet    anno r c      anno domini       his lady is in black with a lawn ruff her portrait is dated      his lady lady croke should by no means be passed unnoticed especially as whitelock memorials    gives her the chief merit in her husbands decision in the case of ship money he had it seems resolved on the contrary side but appearing wavering was told by his wife that she hoped he would do nothing against his conscience for fear of any danger or prejudice to him or his family and that she would be contented to suffer want or any misery with him rather than be an occasion for him to do or say any thing against his judgment or conscience  i shall conclude with a very singular portrait on wood philip le bon duke of burgundy called sylvester de grimston a noble norman standard bearer to the conqueror at the battle of hastings and afterward his chamberlain he held lands in yorkshire of the lord roos among others that of grimston in holderness from whence he took the name the picture is ancient and curious but wants four centuries of the great period in which sylvester lived neither did that age afford any artists that could give even a tolerable representation of the human figure much less convey down a likeness of the fierce heroes of their times i premise this to show the impossibility of this portrait having been a copy of some original of this great ancestor the dress is singular a large bonnet with a very long silken appendage a green jacket hanging sleeves a collar of ss held in one hand his face beardless on the back of the picture is petrus xoi me fecit anno      the artist is unknown to me but the habit of the person is that of the date for i find in monfaucons monarchy francoise several persons of rank in the dress particularly philip le bon duke of burgundy between whom and this portrait there is so strong a resemblance of feature see the book cited vol iii p   0 tab xlix fig    that i do not hesitate to imagine that the gorhambury portrait is no other than one of this illustrious prince he was born in      died in      so that he was a youth when the picture was taken  i now resume my journey and in my way to st albans about a mile and a half distant pass by the site of st mary de la pre de pratis or the meadows an hospital for leprous women founded about    0 by warine abbot of st albans it afterward rose to a priory of benedictine nuns but fell in      when wolsey commendatory abbot obtained from clement viii a bull for its suppression and for annexing it to the abbey after which he got a grant of it for himself from the king who on the ruin of the cardinal gave it to sir ralph rowlet tanner       immediately after quitting this place verulamium i entered the celebrated verulamium at a spot distinguished by a great fragment of the ancient wall known by the name of gorhamburyblock which probably bounded one side of one of the portae or entrances being exactly opposite to that on the eastern part the precinct departs from the rectangular form of the romans this being among those which were laid out prout loci qualitas aut necessitas postulaverit vegetius lib i c     it inclines to an oval shape is placed on a slope and the lower side bounded by the river ver which in former times might have spread into a lake and given greater security to the town according to humphry lloyd commentariol     it gave also the name to the place gwerllan or the temple on the ver rightly bestowing on the britons a preoccupancy of it to the romans i shall not dispute the notions of the particular ford over which caesar crossed the thames when he penetrated into our island it probably was at or near coway stakes caesar leaves us no room to depart from that opinion as he expressly tells us that he led his army to the river thames toward the borders of the territories of cassivelaunus caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen tamain in finos cassivelauni execitum duxit bell gal lib v  preceding this he speaks of the fines cassivelauni as being a mari circiter lia passaum lxxx    the goldenlocked leader of the country of the cassi and these cassi are reasonably supposed to have been a clan of the cattieuchlani and to have inhabited the hundred of this county now called cashio in which verulamium stood but i must contend that the distance of that city is far too remote from the fordable parts of the thames to admit it to have been the town of the british leader destroyed by the invader it lies in the nearest line thirtyseven miles from those parts of the river a distance too great for the time given to caesar for his second campaign in britain the town or rather post which was forced by him was not remote from the camp occupied by him on the side of the river and most likely was that which is still very entire in the park of her grace the duchess dowager of portland at bulstrode about fifteen miles distance from the roman camp whose vestiges are still to be seen not far from the famous ford sylves paludibusque munitum  partly by length of time partly by constant cultivation this post has lost some of the characters ascribed by caesar to the town of cassivelaunus for it wants at present the marshy defense it had in his days  the town alluded to was within the territories of the british chieftain and one of the strong holds into which the britons were used to drive their cattle in time of danger this by cesars account was certainly not the most capital for his first relation informs us it only contained saits numerus pecorum a pretty considerable number of cattle notwithstanding his vanity a few lines lower swells his booty into magnus numerus a vast number levis hist br     near shepperton also near that place in a field called war close are found spurs swords bones and other marks of a battle see cambden i     but in all likelihood the first is the nearest to the truth  erulamium was the capital of this country and the residence of its princes i do not reckon cassivelaunus among them he was a chieftain of the cassi and for his great abilities elected general on the roman invasion if our british history is to be trusted he was a guardian to his nephews anarwy and tenafan stukely itin i     the last father to cunoboline whose coins are so frequent here was one of the british mints for we find the word ver on the coins but no princes name to distinguish the reign  after the romans had effected their conquest they added walls to the ordinary british defense of ramparts and ditches many great fragments of the former still remain proofs of the strength and manner of the roman masonry on the one side is a vast fosse on another two the walls are twelve feet thick where entire walls formed of flints bedded in mortar now grown into amazing hardness by intervals of about three feet distance are three and in some places four rows of broad and thin bricks or tiles which were continued the whole length of the walls which seem designed as foundations to sustain the layers of flints and lime while the last was in a moist state there were besides round holes which penetrated quite through see doctor stukelys admirable plan of this place  but these are either filled up or escaped my notice according to doctor stukelys measurement the area is five thousand two hundred feet in length and the greatest breadth about three thousand it is at present enclosed into fields but under the hedges in many places are vestiges of buildings and as i am told when it is under tillage the sites of the streets appear by the different color of the corn above them the watlingstreet comes to the porta decumana the gate on the western side and passes quite through the city there is another road goes on the outside of the south side a small military way like that which passed from turret to turret on severuss wall tour scotl      part ii p      for the convenience of external passengers  this place by its attachment to the conquerors acquired the privileges of a free borough a municipium a municipium or municipal city whose inhabitants enjoyed all the rights of the roman citizens for which reason such towns derive their name a muneribus capiendis their power to bear public offices they had their senators knights and commons magistrates and priests censors ediles questors and flamens  the attachment of this town to its new masters proved the cause of a heavy misfortune which befell it under the reign of nero boadicea sacked by boadicea widow of prasutagus king of the iceni enraged at the cruel indignity offered to her and her daughters raised an insurrection against the romans and their friends and repaid with the most dreadful cruelties the injuries they had received camolodunum londinium and verolamium suffered from the fury of the britons and seventy thousand citizens and allies fell by the edge of the sword this city was remarkable for its wealth taciti annal lib xiv c    etc  which was another incentive for the britons to attack it added to a particular animosity against a people who had forsaken the customs and religion of their ancestors  the place in a short time emerged from its misfortune and had the honor of producing albanus of st albanus the protomartyr of britain a wealthy citizen of verulamium and by privilege of rome also he had been a pagan but was converted by means of a guest whom he had sheltered during the great persecution of dioclesian as i have before related st alban suffered in the year  0  let not legend destroy the credibility of the martyrdom by assigning attendant miracles long after their cessation we are told that after he had refused to sacrifice to the heathen gods the usual test of the alleged crime of christianity he was as customary whipped with rods and then led to execution and beheaded on holmhurst where the town of st albans at present stands in his passage the torrent which then divided the place from verulamium like the red sea divided its waters and gave dry passage to the saint and his followers a fountain sprung up where the martyr kneeled one of the executioners relenting was converted and suffered with albanus another who performed the deed lost his eyes as a penalty for his cruelty for they dropped out of his head in the moment in which he gave the blow bid hist eccl lib i c   father cressy in his church history lib vi has given a much longer detail  st alban was interred on the spot and his remains were miraculously discovered several centuries after their interment  in     synod hold here this place was honored with a synod in which st germanus and lupus two french prelates assisted a chapel was erected about the year     by abbot ulsin in honor of the former on the spot in which he preached whose ruins were to be seen the beginning of this century  after the saxon invasion the name of the town was changed for that of verlamcester and watlincester the british hero uther pendragon after a long siege wrested it out of the hands of the saxons and held it during his life after which they soon recovered it but by reason of the cruel wars that raged during the contest between them and the britons the place became totally desolated  like the ancient deva tour in wales p  0   verulamium had its great vaults great vaults or subterraneous retreats strongly and artfully arched these are supposed by sir henry chauncy to have been designed as places of retreat in time of war for the women and children and for the concealing of the most valuable effects in   0 they were found to give shelter to thieves and prostitutes which caused eldred the eighth abbot to search after these sousterrains and found several ways and passages all which he caused to be destroyed but preserved the tiles and stones for the rebuilding the church then in ruins chauncy

the grave cressy lib xxv c    in     he erected on the spot the magnificent monastery for the maintenance of a hundred benedictine or black monks and in a parlementary council which he held in the same year bestowed on it most liberal endowments verulamium was now reduced to the state elegantly described by spencer assuming the character of the genius of the place i was that city which the garland wore of britains pride delivered unto me by roman victors which it wore of yore though naught at all but ruins now i be and lie in mine own ashes as ye see verlame i was what boots it that i was since now i am but weeds and wasteful grass   ruins of time  before i quit these ancient precincts i must note the church of st michael church of st michael built within them by the same pious

the monument of the great lord verulam his figure is of white marble placed sitting in a chair reclining in the easy attitude of meditation he is dressed in robes lined with fur and a highcrowned hat

i      offa had recourse to the usual expiation of his crime that of founding a monastery when the grateful monks to conceal the infamy of their benefactor call down a vision from heaven as a motive to his piety but offa did not trust to this solely he made a penitential pilgrimage to rome and by the merit of his monastic institution at st albans readily obtained absolution its great privilege and not only procured for the house exemption from the tax of peter pence but power to collect the same for its own use through the whole province of hertford a privilege which no person in the realm the king himself not excepted ever enjoyed by the same bull his holiness granted that the abbot or monk whom he appointed archdeacon should have pontifical jurisdiction over the priests and laymen of the possessions of this church and that no person whatsoever save the pope himself should offer to interfere it was by the charter of the king to be free from all taxes repair of bridges and castles

ordered that the church should be reputed the parish church of the place and be served by a rector to be nominated by the mayor and burgesses of the town  the abbots lived in splendour suitable to their rank and revenues they dined in the great hall at a table to which there was a flight of fifteen steps the monks served up the dinner in plate and in their way made a halt at every fifth step where there was a landing and sung on each a short hymn the abbot usually sat alone in the middle of the table and when any persons of rank came he sat toward the end of the table after the monks had waited some time on the abbot they sat down at two other tables placed on the sides of the hall and had their services brought in by the novices who when the monks had dined sat down to their own dinners antiquarian repertory iii  0   the church church in its present state is a most venerable and great pile its form that of a cross with a tower at the intersection the length is six hundred

ruins of verulamium all the stone tiles and timber he could find death put a stop to his intention his successor eadmer resumed the task of getting together the materials and in his search found great quantities of curious antiquities such as altars urns etc which the pious man broke to pieces as heathen abominations he also as is said discovered several books some in british others in latin and a great one in a language and character unknown to any but an old priest this was found to be the authentic life of st alban which was carefully treasured up being a confirmation of what bid had wrote on the same subject the other books being only accounts of heathen mythology inventions of the devil were instantly condemned to the flames stevens i       a famine stopped the design of the new church under the abbot leofric the troubles that ensued under the remaining saxon monarchs and the unsettled state of the kingdom at the conquest occasioned the plan to lie dormant till the year  0

stones and roman tiles  many other parts afterward were pulled down alterations and rebuilt in the style of the times and i suspect that in general the present windows are long posterior to those coeval with the walls being painted and of a taste of another age the windows in the great tower and perhaps the range along the nave are of time intervening for they differ from the mode of each of the others i find this confirmed in the lives of the abbots john first of the name who died in      pulled down the frontwall which was built of old tiles so strongly cemented with mortar that it proved a work of great labor master hugh goldcliff a most excellent workman was employed who consulting more the ornaments of sculpture of images and flowers neglected the security of his building so that it fell down and was left unfinished during the life of this good abbot mat paris  0    his successor william of trampington had the honor of completing his design he not only rebuilt that front but made new windows and put glass into them so as to give more light to the church he also raised the steeple much higher covered it with lead and died full of good works in      the same  0    0     in the abbacy of john of whethamstead this church received the most considerable alterations to avoid prolixity i omit the numerous works of that most munificent abbot i shall only note the change he made in the exterior part by enlarging and glazing the windows on the north side of the church which was before dark and by causing a large window to be made at the west end of the north ae which was as destitute of light as the other part stevens i      john died in      before which time the narrow windows had been changed for those more expanded lightsome and less painted  it is in the inside

is large and in general town filled with ancient buildings it originally sprung from a few houses built by king offa for the convenience of the officers and servants of the monastery about the year   0 it was so increased that king ethelred at the intercession of abbot ulfin gave it a grant of a market and the rank of a borough in the doomsday book it appears at the conquest to have been rated for ten hides the arable was sixteen ploughlands in demesne three hides two ploughlands and another may be made there were four aliens sixteen villeyns and thirteen boors having thirteen ploughlands fortysix burgesses the toll and other rents of the town eleven pounds fourteen shillings a year three mills forty shillings a year meadow two ploughlands in quantity wood to feed a thousand hogs in pannagetime and seven shillings rent the total twenty pounds at that time in that of edward the confessor twentyfour there are now twelve cottagers a park of deer and a fish pond  the town was always considered as part of the demesne of the abbey and at the conquest it was part of its possessions richard i by charter confirmed it to them with a market and all the liberty attending a borough the abbot holding as he alleged of the king in capite and holding the burgesses as demesned men of the abbey this tenure the burgesses wished to force from him which they attempted by the following stratagem  in the thirtyfifth of edward i they had sent representatives to parliament and also in the first and second of edward ii but in the fifth of the same reign the sheriff of hertfordshire by the contrivance of the abbot to save the expense had omitted the usual summons this the burgesses complained of asserting that they held of the king hoping thereby to get released of the services they owed their lord abbot or if they succeeded in sending members to be freed of those which they owed the king both of which expectations in the opinion of mr madox were illfounded antiquities of the exchequer i   0  burgesses were returned to parliament the fifth of edward ii and in the second fourth and fifth of edward iii after which the load or the privilege as it was respectively thought by the disputants ceased at the time of the dissolution the town with the other possessions of the abbey fell to the king henry viii and from him to his heir edward vi who by letters patent dated may   th      incorparated made the town of st albans a body corporate by the name of the mayor and burgesses and granted to the said mayor and burgesses and their successors the said profits and other franchises they to hold the premises in free burgage and to render yearly to the crown xl as a feefarm at the feast of st michael madox i       these were changed by charles ii into a mayor recorder twelve aldermen and twentyfour assistants the members are returned by the inhabitants and freemen about a thousand in number and the returningofficer is the mayor willis notit parl iii      the remarkable events which befell this town in earlier times were as usual of the sanguinary kind during the rage of the barons wars in the reign of henry iii the burgesses fortified the place and defended it with strong gates well secured they were particularly jealous of horsemen therefore refused passage to all cavaliers the constable of hertford displeased at this prohibition in a bravado boasted that he would enter the town with three youths knights and four of his best villeins he did so and walking up and down with great insolence asked his companions which way the wind was the townsmen alarmed at the question thought he designed to fire their houses in a summary way they executed justice by knocking down and beheading him his youths and villeins placing their heads on poles at the corners of their streets the king resented this invasion of his prerogative and fined the town in a hundred marks which was immediately paid chauney       in the reign of richard ii they underwent a mortification of a far heavier nature in      after the bloody insurrection of wat tyler a court of justice was held here by the famous sir robert tresilian john ball a priest of coventry was tried and executed several of the inhabitants had favored the rebels or taking advantage of the turbulence of the mes had demanded from the abbot a release from all their services several of them were condemned and put to death and orders given that their bodies should remain on the gallows in terrorem the burgesses in contempt of the king took them down but when a discovery was made richard in a rage commanded the townsmen to make chains and hang the putrid carcases on the same places they took them from which disgusting and horrible as the task was they were obliged to perform holinshed       in the civil wars between the houses of york and lancaster first battle at st albans this town was the scene of dreadful carnage here was shed the first blood in that fatal quarrel as soon as ever the weak henry or rather his queen and ministers found themselves free from the power of his rival the duke of york they armed their forces and marched from london to st albans to meet their enemy who was advancing toward them with a mighty host they met on the   d of may      the peaceful prince sent out a herald to york strictly commanding him to keep the peace as became a dutiful subject and to avoid effusion of blood yorks answer was humble yet resolute demanding the duke of somerset and other delinquents to be delivered into his hands that justice might be executed on them for the miseries they had brought on the realm somerset who had been regent of france was charged in particular with the loss of normandy the king determined to stand the event of the day rather than give up his friends his banner was placed in st peters street orders were issued by henry but most probably by the bloody margaret that no quarter stow     should be given to his opponents the yorkists began the attack in three places the famous john lord clifford defended the barriers with his accustomed valor the kingmaking warwick who at this time espoused the cause of york collected his force and broke in through the gardens into holywellstreet stow      his soldiers shouted his tremendous name the duke of york entered at the same time and a dreadful fight ensued victory declared in his favor numbers of the nobility and gentry with about eight hundred common men fell on the side of henry the valiant clifford usually called the old though only forty years of age the earl of northumberland son to the noted hotspur and the great duke of somerset were slain the last lost his life beneath the sign of the castle to fulfill the prophecy thus delivered by shakespeare let him shun castles safer shall he be on the sandy plains than where castles mounted stand henry vi part ii act   hulles chronicle lxxxvi    numbers of the nobility were wounded and numbers fled till the fury of the battle was over none were executed by the victor the barbarity of civil feuds had not yet taken place provoked by the reciprocal cruelties which speedily followed  henry wounded in the neck by an arrow which hurtled in showers on him retreated to a poor cottage where he was found by the conquerors they asked forgiveness on their knees which the humane prince readily gave on condition they would stop the carnage he became their prisoner and they of course became governors of the kingdom the abbey escaped plunder for fortunately the king did not make it his headquarters  the king from this time to the year      remained a mere shadow of royalty entirely under the directions of the yorkists his queen was driven from him under the terror of a proscription that spirited woman did not employ her time in prayers or counting her beads like her weak husband but by the assistance of her northern friends raised a potent army fought and slew the duke of york at the battle of wakefield on december  0th    0 and marching toward london gave occasion to a second battle at st albans  the earl of warwick second battle at st albans now in possession of the king hastened from london with the captive monarch and took post in st albans margaret attempting to pass through the town was repulsed by a storm of arrows directed from the marketplace but she quickly forced her way through a lane into st peters street the conflict became then very bloody and after great slaughter both parties quitted the town and continued the battle with the animosity usual in civil feuds on bernard heath north of st albans as far as the village of sauntbridge and even beyond it at a place called no mans land stow      there a corpse de reserve of warwicks army to the number of four or five thousand made so vigorous an onset on the lancastrians as to render the victory for some time doubtful at length the treachery or cowardice of a captain lovelace who commanded the kentishmen

conduct of simon mountfort and abolished the university of northampton bridges       the town is extremely finely situated on an eminence tows described gently sloping to the river which bounds it on the south as it also does on the west the streets are in general strait and very handsomely built the great marketplace is an ornament to the town few can boast the like much of the beauty of northampton is owing to the calamity it sustained by fire on september  0th      when the greatest part was laid in ashes the houses were at that time chiefly wooden twentyfive thousand pounds were collected by briefs and private charity toward its relief and the king gave a thousand tons of timber out of whittlewood forest and remitted the duty of chimneymoney in this town for seven years so that it was soon rebuilt and changed its wooden edifices for more secure and ornamental houses of stone  the church of all saints fell a victim to the flames the old church was a large pile churches with a tower in the center it was rebuilt with great magnificence and is a considerable ornament to this pretty town the portico is very elegant supported in front by eight columns of the ionic order the body stands on four lofty columns and has a neat dome in the middle the roof beautifully stuccoed this church and that of st peter were bestowed on the priory of st andrew by simon de st liz the founder all saints is at present in the gift of the members of the corporation who are inhabitants of the parish  the church of the holy sepulcher was supposed to have been built by the knights templars on the model of that at jerusalem the imitative part is round holy sepulcher with a nave issuing from it in the round part is a peristyle of eight round pillars thirteen feet eight inches high and twelve feet three in circumference the capitals consist of two round fillets the arches sharp and plain the space from the wall to the pillars is eleven feet the diameter from the inside of one pillar to that of the opposite is twentynine feet two inches in the center of the area stands in the church at jerusalem the supposed sepulcher see sandyss travels  and it is probable a model might be placed in those which we find of the same kind in our island for besides this the temple church in london and st sepulchres in cambridge are built on the same plan the steeple and some other parts of that in question have been added after the building of the circular church  st peters church is a singular building st peters two corners of the tower are ornamented with three round pillars above these are two and above them one all gradually lesser than the others the middle of the tower is ornamented with small round arches which are continued along the outside of the body of the church and have a good effect within are two rows of round arches carved with zigzag work the pillars which support these are alternately single and quadruple a small monument commemorates john smith

infirmary not on account of the beauty or magnificence of the house for it is laudably destitute of both but because the subscription which supports it does honor to the province by proving the benevolence of its inhabitants that of      amounted to near eight hundred pounds and the number of patients perfectly cured from its foundation in      to the former year is not fewer than thirteen thousand one hundred and fifty  the county hall is a very handsome building county hall and ornamented in the manner which gives dignity to courts of justice the vulgar are affected with external show and never pay half the respect to a judge scampering in boots and bobwig up the stairs of a barnlike court as they would to the same person who adds solemnity to his merit and assumes the garb suited to his character  the jail is at a small distance from the sessions house jail and was originally a house built by a sir thomas haselwood and sold by him to the justices of peace  the town or guild hall is an ancient building in which the corporation transacts its business northampton was incorporated by henry ii henry iii gave it power of choosing annually a mayor and two bailiffs to be elected by all the freemen but henry vii ordered by charter charter that the mayor and his brethren late mayors should name fortyeight persons of the inhabitants with liberty of changing them as often as was found necessary which fortyeight with the mayor and his brethren and such as had been mayors and bailiffs were annually to elect all future mayors and bailiffs there are besides a recorder chamberlain and town clerk the mayor late mayor and one other member of the corporation nominated by the mayor aldermen and bailiffs are justices of the peace within the town for one year the mayor recorder or his deputy and one justice are necessary to form a sessions they have power in criminal causes to try all offenders but wisely leave all but petty larcenies to the judges of the great sessions bridges       northampton is among the most ancient boroughs in the parliament held at acton burnel in the time of edward i it was one of the nineteen trading towns which sent two members each every

large structure surrounding a handsome square court with a beautiful skreen the work of inigo jones bounding one side more is attributed to that great architect some is more ancient than his time yet

northampton his genius was so extensive that in his youth he at once kept four different tutors in employ who daily had their respective hours for instructing him in the different arts they professed in the civil wars he was the great rival of lord brooks whom he drove out of his own county of warwick and was a most successful opponent to the earl of essex he brought two thousand of the bestdisciplined men in the army to the royal standard at nottingham at length fell in staffordshire in march      desperately fighting forgetting as is too frequently the case with great minds the difference between the general and common man  his eldest son james earl of northampton is in armor his son james and with a great dog near him he inherited his fathers valor and was wounded in the

him and lord bruce would make one imagine that he would have appeared with peculiar luster in the field of action during the civil wars but fortune fung him but once into the bloody scenes of that period he fought with distinguished bravery at edgehill and retook the royal standard after its bearer sir edward verney was slain might not the weight of the sanguinary conflict at tergose rest heavy on his mind and make him shun for the future scenes of destruction for he could do it with unimpeached reputation certain it is that his lordship acted chiefly in the cabinet was a faithful servant to

wiltshire but raised himself by the most laudable of means that of merit after the battle of worcester in which his elder brother was engaged he fled with him to france and was entertained by henry lord percy then lord chamberlain to our exiled monarch to young fox was committed the whole regulation of the household who as lord clarendon observes was well qualified with the languages and all parts of clerkship honesty and discretion as was necessary for such a trust and indeed his great industry modesty and prudence did very much contribute to the bringing the family which for so many years had been under no government into very good order on the restoration he was made clerk of the green cloth and on the raising of the two regiments the first of the kind ever known he was appointed paymaster and soon after paymastergeneral to all the forces in england in      he was made one of the lords of the treasury and in the same year first commissioner in the office of master of the horse and in      had interest to get his son charles then only twentythree years old to be appointed sole paymaster of the forces and himself in      sole commissioner for master of the horse james ii continued to him every kind of favor yet sir stephen made a very easy transition to the succeeding prince and enjoyed the same degree of courtly emolument james thought he might have expected another return from this creation of the stuarts accordingly excepted him in his act of grace on the intended invasion of       sir stephen made a noble use of the gifts of fortune he rebuilt the church of early his native place built an hospital there for six poor men and as many poor women erected a chapel there and handsome lodgings for the chaplain and endowed it with l    a year he founded in the same place a charityschool he built the chancel of a church in the north of wiltshire which the rector was unable to do he also built the church of culford in suffolk and pewed the cathedral of salisbury but his greatest act was the founding of chelsea hospital which he first projected and contributed thirteen thousand pounds toward the carrying on alleging that he could not

and rode through the park easton mauduit and after a mile and a half reached easton mauduit one of the seats of the earls of sussex a large but low old house with a quadrangle in the middle this place

henry yelverton sir henry appears in the same habit with the father the date is      aet  0 he proved as distinguished a lawyer as his father but was less fortunate in falling on more dangerous times he owed his rise to the profligate favorite ker earl of somerset on the disgrace of his patron sir henry had gratitude enough to refuse to plead against him lloyds worthies ii     notwithstanding his office as solicitorgeneral might have been a plea for doing it when he was attorney general he fell under the displeasure of the court  he was charged by the commons with making out the patents for the monopolies so justly complained of in that reign in his defense he suffered to escape some indiscreet truths which were interpreted as if his delinquency was not disagreeable to the king and the then favorite buckingham the rage of the court was directed against him he was fined in ten thousand marks to the king and five thousand to buckingham who instantly remitted the last carte iv     perhaps the favorite might fear him it having been said that one cause of his disgrace was the refusal of making out patents to the degree which the duke desired wilson  whose brother was deeply concerned in this plunder of the public a mean letter to buckingham and a submission in the star chamber acknowleging errors of negligence ignorance and misprision restored him to favor cabala  0  etc

supported on each side by two fulllength figures of almsmen in black gowns and hoods with great white beards the arch resting on their heads this probably alludes to some charitable foundation with which i am unacquainted in front beneath sir henry is an altar at which kneel two men in armor and two in cloaks and five women it does not appear that either sir christopher or sir henry left a number of children equal to those expressed on their respective tombs  in my return i saw at little billings the poor remains of the mansion of the great family of the longvilles little billings john de lungville was declared lord of the place in      this was he who founded the augustines in northampton it continued in the name till the time of queen elizabeth or james i when that succession expired in the person of sir edward longeville  not far from hence i visited cliffords hill in the parish of houghton parva a vast artificial mount having once on it a specula or watchtower the coins

guarded morton       reach northampton and after a short stay pass over the river into the suburbs called the south quarters and into the parish of hardingstone on each side is a fine range of meadows

of doctor london the kings commissioner and got from him the character of a gudde agyd woman of her house being in a gudde state and what was more substantial a pension of forty pounds a year  between this place and the town in    0 encamped henry vi and his insolent nobility immediately before the bloody battle of northampton the king or rather queen depending on the strength of their entrenchments and warlike engines returned a haughty answer to the humble proposals sent by the earls of march and warwick battle of northampton these spirited commanders led their troops instantly to the attack and forced the camp favored by the treachery of edmund lord gray of ruthen who on some disgust changed sides and assisted the enemy in forcing their way into the works ten thousand talle

dissension humphrey duke of buckingham john earl of shrewsbury john viscount beaumont thomas lord egremont and sir thomas lucy were among those who fell multitudes of my countrymen also perished on that day xxiv xxv the battle was fought july  th  the slain were buried either in the church of this convent or in the hospital of st john  on the roadside queens cross on an ascent near this place stands one of the pledges of affection borne by edward i to his beloved eleanor who caused a cross to be erected on the spot wheresoever her body rested in its way from hareby in lincolnshire where she died in    0 to westminster the place of her interment it is kept in excellent repair is of an octagonal form and stands on a base of seven steps coats of arms and an open book adorn the lower compartments above in six gothic niches are as many female figures crowned above them are four modern dials facing the four cardinal points and above those is the cross  around this spot are frequently found roman coins and medals from which it is conjectured that this might have been the site of eltavon eltavon or eltabon from the british ael a brow and avon a river and is supposed to have been the eltanori or eltavori of the geographer of ravenna morton northampton  0  gales iter br com      the dry and elevated situation and its vicinity to a river makes it very probable that this was a roman station at left a summer camp  near this place on the summit of the hill called hunsborough hunsborough are some ancient works of a circular form i e conforming to the shape of it consisting of a fosse and double rampart with a single entrance mr morton morton     attributes this to the danes and imagines it to have been a summercamp of one of the plundering parties which infested the kingdom of mercia about the year     another was raised about the same time at temsford in the county of bedford for the same purpose this has very much the appearance of a british post but as there is great similitude between the early fortifications of the northern nations i will not controvert the opinion of that ingenious author yet i have probability on my side as he admits that the danes had possession of hamtune i e northampton in     i think they would scarcely trouble themselves with raising these works so near their former quarters which for any thing that appears was as open to them in     as in the former year  about five miles from queens cross i turned a little out of my road to see horton church horton church remarkable for a fine monument of william lord parr

before the house consists of a hundred and twentyeight acres and on the sides are others of great extent the woods are vast and cut into walks extensive and pleasing several pretty pieces of water the view of the ouze and its verdant meadows and the old respectable house of tyringham with its church on the opposite side are no small embellishments to the place  this manor at the time of the compilation of the doomsdaybook was held by robert de nodavirs or de nouers under odo bishop of baieux earl of kent and halfbrother to the conqueror the de nouers the de nouers became possessed of it in their own right in the time of henry ii perhaps earlier mr cole  but the first i meet with is radulphus and his son almaric who lived in      the thirtyseventh of henry iii it continued in that

    the nevylls remained owners of it till the reign of henry viii when maria nevylls only daughter of michael nevyll on the death of her two brothers became possessed of it and she bestowed it with her person mulshos on thomas mulsho of thingdon in the county of northampton the same     a respectable family i find sheriffs of the name as early as the time of richard ii and one of that house

his time digbys but eumenides tenuere faces de funere raptas eumenides stravere torum she had not been married three years before her husband was snatched from her by an ignominious and merited death for his deep concern in the plot which thanks to the charity of the times is execrated by each religion it is very probable that a mind so tinctured with bigotry as his was soon devoted itself to the most desperate resolutions for the restoration of the ancient church he foresaw the certain consequences of ill success and preparing against the event took every method to preserve his infant son from suffering from the fault of the father before he committed any acts of treason he secured to his heirs his estates in such a manner as to put it out of the power of the crown to profit by their confiscation wrights antiq rutlandshire       this illustrious line was the chief of the digby family the peers of that name springing from younger branches the origin is saxon the first of whom notice is taken is aelmar who had lands at tilton in leicestershire in  0   the twentieth of william the conqueror they afterward took the name of digby from a place in lincolnshire and became owners of stokedry in rutlandshire which till the acquisition of gothurst was their usual residence by the marriage of everard digby esquire in the reign of king henry vi with agnes daughter of francis clare of wyssenden and stokedry esquire this gentleman with three of his sons fell in the bloody field at towton fighting in the cause of the house of lancaster collins peerage vii       most of the particulars relative to this great family digby pedigree i owe to the friendship of my worthy neighbor watkin williams esquire who favored me with the use of the famous genealogy of the digbys of

  i now return to the period when the family emerged from its misfortune and in the person of sir kenelm the son of the last sir evarard was restored to its former honor by the uncommon merits of the successor he married venetia daughter of sir edward stanley of tongue castle shropshire knight of the bath his eldest son kenelm was slain in      in the civil wars at st neots his second son john succeeded to the estate and survived his father many years he left by his wife margaret daughter of sir edward longueville of wolverton in this county baronet two daughters the eldest margaret maria married sir john conway of boddruddan in flintshire the younger charlotta married richard mostyn of penbedw in the same county esquire these two gentlemen in   0  sold this manor with stoke goldington and the advowson of both the churches to george wright esquire son of the lord keeper sir nathan wright in whose posterity it still remains by the preceding owners the relics of sir kenelms collection came into my country but the leaving behind the two beautiful busts of lady venetia impress no favorable idea of their taste  some portraits portraits belonging to the former possessors still keep a place in the house in the parlour is a fulllength of old mr digby old mr digby father to the unhappy sir everard he is represented in a close black dress a laced turnover ruff and with lace at his wrist his hair black his beard round with one hand on his sword the other  his lady his lady mary daughter of francis neile esquire of prestwold and keythorp in leicestershire and widow to the staffordshire antiquary sampson erdeswik her dress is black pinked with red has a high foretop adorned with jewels a thin upright ruff round kerchief a farthingale with gloves in her hand  their son sir everard the victim to bigotry is here at fulllength in a black mantle and vest the sleeves slashed and pinked with white large turnover and turnups at his wrists one hand holds his gloves the other is gracefully folded in his mantle  a remarkable portrait sir kenelm of a young man of large size in a quilled ruff white jacket black cloak purple hose flowered belt a bonnet with a white feather in it flowered belt with one hand on his sword above him in a tablet is represented a lady in a most supplicatory attitude with a lute in one hand and a purse in the other offering it to him he stands by her with averted look one hand on his breast and with an air which shows his rejection of her addresses and horror at the infamy of mercenary love and as if uttering to her the words inscribed near to him his majora this portrait is inscribed on the back john digby but from the romantic circumstance attending it the dress and the likeness to other pictures of sir kenelm i cannot help supposing it to be his   this is a portrait of the famous sir kenelm in his youthful days that prodigy of learning credulity valor and romance whose merits although mixed with many foibles entirely obliterated every attention to the memory of his fathers infamy the circumstance of the lady painted along with him is a strong confirmation of the truth of the story related by lloyd that an italian prince who was childless earnestly wished that his princess might become a mother by sir kenelm whom he esteemed as a just model of perfection it is probable that the princess would not have disobeyed the commands of her lord but whether the painting alludes to our knights cruelty on this occasion or whether it might not describe the adventure of the spanish lady recorded in an elegant old ballad ancient songs and ballads ii      i will not pretend to determine  in the long room above stairs lady venetia is the picture of his beloved wife venetia anastatia stanley in a roman habit with curled locks in one hand is a serpent the other is on a pair of white doves  she is painted at windsor in the same emblematic manner but in a different dress and with accompaniments explanatory of the emblems the doves show her innocence the serpent which she handles with impunity shows her triumph over the envenomed tongues of the times we know not the particulars of the story lord clarendon must allude to her exculpation of the charge whatsoever it was when he mentions her as a lady of an extraordinary beauty of as extraordinary same lord clarendons life     in the same picture is a genius about to place a wreath on her head beneath her is a cupid prostrate and behind him is calumny with two faces flung down and bound a beautiful compliment on her victory over malevolence her hair in this picture is light and differs in color from that in the other i have heard from a descendant of here is that she affected different hairdresses and differentcolored eyebrows to see which best became her  sir kenelm was so enamoured with her beauty that he was said to have attempted to exalt her charms and preserve her health by a variety of whimsical experiments among others that of feeding her with capons fed with the flesh of vipers i am told that the great snail or pomatia br zool iv no     is found in the neighboring woods which is its most southern residence in this island it is of exotic origin tradition says it was introduced by sir kenelm as a medicine for the use of his lady  and that to improve her complexion he was perpetually inventing new cosmetics probably she fell a victim to these arts for she was found dead in bed may  st      in the thirtythird year of her age she was buried in christchurch london under a large insulated bust of lady venetia digby tomb of black marble with her bust on the top this perished in the great fire but the form is represented in the pedigreebook and from that engraven in the antiquaries repertory  both the pictures are the performances of vandyck in this at gothurst are two of her sons of a boyish age and in the dress of the times  here are besides two most beautiful busts of the same lady busts of lady venetia in brass whether by le soeur or fanelli i am not certain one is in the dress of the times an elegant laced handkerchief falls over her shoulders leaving her neck bare her hair is curled braided twisted and formed on the hind part of her head into a circle beneath which fall elegant locks on this bust is inscribed uxorem vivam amare voluptas defunctam religio  the other is a lantique the head is dressed in the same manner only bound in a fillet the drapery covers her breast but so artificially as not to destroy the elegancy of the form  i know of no persons who are painted in greater variety of forms and places than this illustrious pair possibly because they were the finest subjects of the times mr walpole is in possession of several most exquisite miniatures of the lady by oliver bought from the heirs of boddrudan and pembedw at a very high price the most valuable is one in a gold case where she is painted in company with her husband there is another said to be painted after she was dead and four others in watercolors  the same gentleman is in possession of a beautiful miniature of her mother lady lucy percy purchased at the same time she is dressed like a citizens wife and with dark hair  among other portraits lord keeper wright is a fulllength of the lord keeper sir nathan wright in his robes and a head of sir joseph jekyll with a long wig and robes the first received his appointment in the year   00 unfortunately for him as successor to lord summers whose precipitate dismission in favor of a tory hardly allowed time for reflection on the impropriety of the choice sir nathan kept his place till the year   0  when he was dismissed not without disgrace more through defect of ability than want of integrity but contemned by both parties  sir joseph was a very different character a staunch whig and a man of great abilities and worth he died master of the rolls in      his wig was probably none of the best if we are to trust these complimentary lines of pope epilogue to the satires  a horselaugh if you please on honesty a joke on jekyll or some odd old whig who never changed his principle or wig   the church is at a little distance from the house church is new and very neat having been rebuilt in pursuance of the will of george wright esquire son of the keeper the figures of father and son face you as you enter the church the first in his robes the other in a plain gown both furnished with enormous parian perriwigs  in the old church was a gravestone lying in the chancel supposed to have been laid over john de nouers who lived in the time of edward iii the inscription was in french communicated by mr cole from churchnotes taken in        jo de novers gist ici diev de salme eit merci amen  from gothurst i crossed the ouze to the respectable old house of tyringham tyringham once the seat of a family of the same name which stands very high in point of antiquity giffard de tyringham gave the church of tyringham to the priory of tickford near newport pagnel in      sir roger was one of the knights who attended edward i into scotland and roger his son was sheriff of this county as early as the fifteenth of richard ii in      or the fifteenth of edward ii roger de tyringham was appointed to superintend the estates forfeited in this county on the earl of lancasters rebellion rymer iii      a sir john tyringham had the honor of losing his head in the cause of henry vi being with several others put to death unheard in      for the murder of the duke of york that is for being present at the battle of wakefield where that prince fell by some unknown hand it continued in this ancient family till      when on the death of sir william tyringham it devolved to john son of edward backwell alderman of london who had married his only daughter  the house has been neglected for some time but not wholly unfurnished several familyportraits still continue there such as a head of lady tyringham portraits in a yellow laced cap and ruff of the same kind with that in which the famous mrs turner went to be hanged for her concern in overburys murder  a very curious picture fulllength of an aged lady in a great quilled ruff and gauze cap distended behind with an enormous gauze veil falling to the ground a black gown spotted with white jewels in form of a cross on her breast another on her arm and great strings of pearl round her wrists she stands beneath a canopy on which is a crown and coat of arms  another of a young lady leaning on a chair in a gauze cap falling back yellow petticoat flowered with red and a feathersan  a halflength of colonel backwell in blue gold sleeves and frogs a sash and a battle in view  a small portrait of edward backwell edw backwell esquire he is represented in long hair and a flowered gown with a table by him i have a fine print of him given me by the late mr backwell one of his descendants he was says mr granger an alderman of london and a banker of great ability industry and integrity and of most extensive credit but ruined in the reign of charles ii by the infamous project of shutting up the exchequer he retired to holland where he died and was brought over to be interred in the church of tyringham where he lies embalmed a glass is placed over his face so his visage may possibly be seen to this time  i could not but admire a spirited picture of a falcon stooping at bitterns  in the hall is a curious table of an ashcolored marble i should call it a polynesious marble being veined like a chart filled with little islands nicely shaded at their edges  as my curiosity led me to explore the kitchen i found on the walls the rude portraits of me following fish recorded to be taken in the adjacent river in the years belowmentioned  a carp in        feet   inches long a pike in          a bream       a salmon    0 a perch   0 a shad in           these are the records of rural life important to those who were perhaps happily disengaged from the bustle and cares attendant on politics and dissipation  the adjacent church is dedicated to st peter and united with filgrave it is in the gift of mr backwell the village of tyringham is quite depopulated and the church of filgrave dilapidated but the inhabitants of that parish make use of the church of tyringham  about a mile farther go through the village of lathbury lathbury near which is the church and a large old house  a little farther is newport pagnel in former times of dangerous approach newport pagnel by reason of the overflowing of the ouze this small town stands between that river and the lovet near their junction soon after the conquest it was the property of william fitzausculph dugdale baron i      from him it passed to the paganels or painels in the reign of william rufus who continued possessed of it above a century leland mentions them as lords of the castle of newport pagnel ireland itin i     on the death of gervase pagnel in the reign of richard i this manor became the property of john de somerie by marriage with hawise daughter of gervase dugdale baron i     his son ralph gave king john a hundred pounds and two palfreys for livery of this lordship and did homage for it in the reign of henry iii roger de somerie forfeited his lands for neglecting on summons to receive the honor of knighthood the same p     the king then granted the farm of this place to walter de kirkham for life quitting him of suits to county and hundred and of aid to sheriffs and his bailiffs and that when the king or his heirs should tallage their manors and demesnes the said walter might by himself and to his own use tallage the said manor in like form as it might be tallaged if it were in the kings hand madox antiq exch i      but i find that it afterward reverted to the someries in the reign of edward ii it was conveyed to thomas de botetourt by his marriage with joan one of the sisters of john de somerie last male heir dugdale baron ii     i now lose sight of the succession and can only say that it continued a place of strength till the civil wars of the last century when its strength was demolished or according to the phrase of the time slighted by order of parliament in      whitelock           it flourishes greatly lace manufacture by means of the lace manufacture which we stole from the flemings and introduced with great success into this county there is scarcely a door to be seen during summer in most of the towns but what is occupied by some industrious palefaced lass their sedentary trade forbidding the rose to bloom in their sickly cheeks  the church is dedicated to st peter and st paul church was an impropriation belonging to the neighboring abbey of tickford and is in the gift of the crown  here were three hospitals founded in early times that by john de somerie hospitals about the year    0 still survives for three poor men and the same number of poor women having been refounded by anne of denmark and from her is called queen annes hospital the vicar of newport for the time being is appointed master tanner      about eight miles from newport at the fortyfour milestone at hogstyhouse enter the county of bedford on woburn sands seated on the extremity of the range of hills which traverse the east end of the former county woburn sands and contain the parishes of the three brickhills near the road side are the noted pits of fullers earth that invaluable substance fullers earth which is supposed to give that great superiority to the british cloth honestly worked over that of other nations  the beds over this important marl are firstly several layers of reddish sand to the thickness of six yards then succeeds a stratum of sandstone of the same color beneath which for seven or eight yards more the sand is again continued to the fullers earth the upper part of which being impure or mixed with sand is flung aside the rest taken up for use the earth lies in layers under which is a bed of rough white freestone about two feet thick and under that sand beyond that the laborers never have penetrated  the great use of this earth is cleansing the cloth or imbibing the tar grease and tallow which are so frequently employed by the shepherds in healing the external diseases which sheep are liable to neither can the wool be worked spun or woven unless it be well greased all this grease must be gotten out before the cloths are fit to wear other countries either want this species of earth or have it in less perfection the british legislature therefore have from the days of charles i guarded against the exportation under severe penalties the romans attended to the fulling business by their lex metella which was made expressly to regulate the manufacture keque enim pigebit hanc quoque partem attingere cum lex metella extet fullonibus dicta quem c flaminius l aemilius censores dedere ad populum ferendam adeo omnia mjoribus curae fuere ergo ordo hic est primum

the umbrica the two first were white the latter might be allied to ours crescit in macerando it swells in water plin ibid  a property of the true marls but the application of earths in the woollen manufacture and for the cleansing purposes was of very early times  but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appears for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap malachi iii     at a small distance from hence lies the little town of woburn woburn town in which is a free school founded by francis i earl of bedford and a charityschool for thirty boys by wriothesly duke of bedford the church was built by the last abbot of woburn willis ii    and church belonged to that religious house having been a chapel to birchmore a church long since demolished this place is of exempt jurisdiction under the patronage of the adjacent great family ecton      the steeple is oddly disjoined from the church the chancel has been very elegantly fitted up with stucco by the late duke the pulpit is a pretty piece of gothic carving probably coeval with the abbey  a neat monument of sir francis stanton is preserved here tombs who with his lady is kneeling at an altar  in the south aile stood a gray marble robbed of the figure of a priest under a large canopy and four coats of arms with the inscription entire  hic jacet johs morton filius quonda johes

in the east window were the arms of robert vere earl of oxford impaling samford the last in right of his wife alice daughter and heiress to gilbert lord samford chamberlain to elinor consort to edward i these two particulars i collect from mr coles papers   at a little distance from the town was situated the abbey abbey founded in      by hugh de bolebec a nobleman of great property in this neighborhood who inspired by god made a visit to the abbot of fountains to advise with him about his pious design dugale monast i      the abbot encouraged him to proceed and hugh erected the buildings endowed them and peopled them with monks of the cistercian order and placed over them as first abbot alan brought from the monastery of st mary at york willis ii    the place prospered by several benefactions and at the dissolution was found according to dugdale to be possessed of revenues to the amount of l       s   d a year or to l  0    s    d according to speed tanner     the last abbot robert hobbs was hanged at woburn in march      for not acknowleging the kings supremacy the monastery and its revenues in      were granted by edward vi to lord russel soon after created earl of bedford by the same prince no one profited so greatly by the plunder of the church as this family the fortune even to the present time does principally originate from gifts of this nature to the grant of woburn it owes much of its property in this county and in bucks to that of the rich abbey of tavistoke vast fortunes and interest in devonshire and to render them more extensive that of dunkeswell was added the donation of thorney abbey gave him an amazing tract of fens in cambridgeshire together with a great revenue melchburn abbey i should have before said increased his property in bedfordshire the priory of castle hymel gave him footing in northamptonshire and he came in for parcels of the appurtenance of st albans and mountgrace in yorkshire not to mention the house of the friars preachers in exeter with the revenues belonging to the foundation and finally the estate about covent garden with a field adjoining called the seven acres on which long acre is built appertenances to the convent of westminster the first a garden belonging to the abbot  the superstitious will stand amazed that no signal judgment has overtaken the children of sacrilege yet no house in britain has thriven more than the house of russel  the house is situated in a very pleasant park well wooded house but defective in water the several pieces being too much divided and the dams too conspicuous the present house was built by the late duke excepting a paltry grotto by inigo jones which shows that his taste was superior to such childish performances and the great stables which were part of the ancient cloisters and still preserve their pillars and vaulted roof the offices are also the work of the late duke and form two magnificent but plain buildings at a small distance from the mansion  this house is a treasure of paintings of portraits of the great portraits now illustrious by their figure they make in the eyes of posterity undazzled with their wealth rank power or qualifications mental or corporeal which concealed their failings and made them pass at lest unnoticed openly by their cotemporaries they now undergo a posthumous trial and like the egyptians of old receive censure or praise according to their respective merits  the first which struck me was a lady who defied the strictest scrutiny a small fulllength in widows weeds with her head reclined on one hand and a book by her rachel lady russel with a countenance full of deep and silent sorrow the sad relict of the virtuous lord russel and daughter to the good and great wriothesly earl of southampton i imagine her in the third month of her affliction filled with the following meditation  lord let me understand the reason of these dark and wounding providence that i sink not under the discouragement of my own thoughts i know i have deserved my punishment and will be silent under it but yet secretly my heart mourns because i have not the dear companion and sharer of my joys and sorrows i want him to talk with to eat and sleep with all these things are irksome to me now the day unwelcome and the night so too all company and meals i would avoid if it might be yet all this is that i enjoy not the world in my own way and this sure hinders my comfort when i see my children before me i remember the pleasure he took in them this makes my heart to shrink can i regret his quitting a lesser good for a bigger o if i did steadfastly believe i could not be dejected but i will not injure myself to say i offer my mind any inferior consolation to supply this loss no i most willingly forsake this world this vexatious troublesome world in which i have no other business but to rid my soul from sin secure by faith and a good conscience my eternal interest with patience and courage bear my eminent misfortunes and ever hereafter be above the smiles and frowns of it and when i have done the remnant of the work appointed me on earth then joyfully wait for the heavenly perfection in gods good time when by his infinite mercy i may be accounted worthy to enter in the same place of rest and repose where he is gone for whom only i grieve lady russels letters letter vi   i now turn my eyes to a lady whose felicity consisted in a different fate in being early cut off from the embraces of a capricious tyrant lady jane seymour whose inconstancy and whose lusts would probably have involved her in misery had not heaven in its mercy taken her to itself lady jane seymour the lady in question became queen to henry viii in      and was released from him by death      the portrait expresses the elegance of her person she is dressed in red with great gold network sleeves and rich in jewels her print among the illustrious heads does her little justice  that gloomy insipid pair philip ii and his consort mary philip and mary are painted in small fulllengths by sir antonio more the first of these ungracious figures is dressed in a black jacket with gold sleeves and hose the queen sitting in a blackandgold petticoat and furred sleeves her black conic cap is faced with gold and jewels a rich chain of great pearls and small vases red and gold are other ornaments to our bigoted sovereign the date is      sir antonio was sent from spain to draw her picture so has placed them in a scene of awkward courtship for they were not married till the following year  another remarkable portrait by the same painter ed courteney earl of devonshire is that of edward courteney last earl of devonshire of his name who for his nearness in blood to the crown was imprisoned by the jealous henry from the age of ten till about that of twentyeight his daughter mary set him at liberty and wooed him to share the kingdom with her he rejected her offer in preference to her sister elizabeth for which and some false suspicion of disaffection he suffered another imprisonment with elizabeth he was soon released he quitted the kingdom as prudence directed and died at the age of thirty at padua  he is represented as a handsome man with short brown hair and a yellow beard a dark jacket with white sleeves and breeches behind him is a ruined tower beneath him this inscription expressive of his misfortunes en puer et insons et adhuc juvenilibus annis annos bis septem carcere clusus eram me pater his tenuit vinclis quae filia solvit sors mea sic tandem vertitur a superis fourteen long years in strict captivity tyrantcondemnd i passed my early bloom till pity bade the generous daughter free a guiltless captive and reverse my doom r w  sir philip sydney is painted in the twentysecond year of his age sir philip sydney in a quilled ruff white slashed jacket a threequarter length he was a deserved favorite of queen elizabeth who well might think the court deficient without him for to uncommon knowledge valor and virtuous gallantry was joined a romantic spirit congenial with that of his royal mistress his romance of arcadia is not relished at present it may be tedious but the morality i fear renders it disgusting to our age it is too replete with innocence to be relished sir philip was to the english what the chevalier bayard was to the french un chevalier sans peur et sans reproaches both were strongly tinctured with enthusiastic virtue both died in the field with the highest sentiments of piety  i lament that the portraits are not placed in chronological order i must give them as i found them isabella isabella duchess of grafton daughter to henry bennet earl of arlington and wife to the first duke of grafton is represented a halflength in white with long flowing hair very handsome  in one of these apartments is a head of the duke of monmouth duke of monmouth   a capital picture of the plague the dead bodies appear infectious by the attitudes of the living to increase the horror the artist has placed a live infant by its dead mother a circumstance not unknown in the dreadful pestilence in london of      by nicholas poussin  a fine view of pout neuf with numbers of figures by wovermans  in the green drawing room is a fine landscape by claude lorrain with a view of the sea the figures are shepherds and shepherdesses  david

with suffering him to depart wholly uninformed  the first i shall point out is a head of lord william russel lord william russel the sad victim to his virtuous design of preserving our liberties and constitution from the attempts of as abandoned a set of men as ever governed these kingdoms true patriotism not ambition nor interest directed his intentions posterity must applaud his unavailing engagements with due censure of the machiavelian necessity of taking off so dangerous an opposer of the machinations of his enemies the law of politics gives sanction to the removal of every obstacle to the designs of statesmen at the same time we never should lessen our admiration and pity of the generous characters who fell sacrifices to their hopes of delivering purified to their descendants the corrupted government of their own days to attempt to clear lord russel from the share in so glorious a design would be to deprive him of a most brilliant part of his character his integrity and ingenuity would not suffer even himself to deny that part of the charge let that remain unimpeached since he continues so perfectly acquitted of the most distant design of making assassination a means or of intriguing with a foreign monarch the most repugnant to our religion and freedom to bring about so desired an end  over the door is sir nicholas bacon in a black dress furred see p     of this

left the senate of venice protectors of her and the child with which she was pregnant at the time of that event the infant son lived only ten months and the venetian state considered itself as heir to the kingdom in right of its daughter catherine apprehensions arose that the turkish emperor bajazet and the christian monarch ferdinand had designs on it they determined to frustrate both and sent george cornaro brother to the queen to assist her in the government by his eloquence he succeeded in the arduous task of persuading a lady out of her love of power he promised her regal state in her native county she accepted the terms and erected the venetian standard in her capital and on her arrival at venice was met by the whole senate and the ladies of rank and received during life every

which still retains nearly the original form it was alienated by john the first earl of that title between the years    0 and    0 to lord viscount fitzwilliam his lordship sold it in the year      to lady gowran grandmother to the present lord ossory  from hence is a very short ride to houghton park houghton park formerly part of the estate of ampthill as soon as that honor was alienated from the crown the earl of elgin pulled down the old castle houghton and built what is now called houghton house and enclosed the park which goes by that name and then old ampthill park became only the second park to the seat the house is seated on a bold eminence and commands a fine view two of the fronts are very beautiful each has an elegant portico and loggio above on the intervening space are variety of ciphers devices and crests such as bears and ragged staves staves and palms crowned lions and crowns and beards of arrows or hedgehogs and porcupines in an old edition of the arcadia date      is a hedgehog or porcupine as a crest to the top of a frontispiece a proof perhaps of a sydney being concerned in the plan  some of these certainly relate to the sydnies this gave rise to the assertion of the editor of cambden that it was built by the countess of pembroke sydneys sister pembrokes motherand that the model was contrived by her brother the incomparable sir philip sydney in his arcadia from the letters on the south front i r with a crown over them it is evident that the house was built in the time of james i and as there is great reason to suppose that inigo jones was the architect it is possible that he might have been recommended by that lady wife to william earl of pembroke one of inigos great patrons from whose designs the earl built the noble front of his seat at wilton let this be admitted we are not to wonder at seeing the devices of her beloved brother ornamenting a place with which she might have no connections but those of friendship  the portico and loggio are of stone and ornamented with columns of the doric and ionic orders the rest of the house is of brick the fronts are unequal one being a hundred and twentytwo feet in extent the other only seventythree feet six inches  the house and manor were purchased by the late duke of bedford from charles earl of aylesbury and with it the stewardship of the honor of ampthill hold under the crown  this place

returning the same way over the lea i could not but reflect on the different appearance this tract made to what it did in the days of king alfred when it was navigable for ships to the thames alfreds

and though she died as it were in a corner in so private a condition the loathsomeness of her death made it as conspicuous as on a housetop for that part of her body which had been the receptacle of

herself in her own ordure in her bed took delight in it thus her affections varied for nothing could be found sweet enough to augment her beauties at first and nothing stinking enough to decypher her loathsomeness at last pardon the sharpness of these expressions for they are for the glory of god who often makes his punishments in the balance of his justice of equal weight with our sins wilsons
