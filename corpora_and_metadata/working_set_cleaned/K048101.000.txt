a satirical dialogue between a sea captain and his friend in town humbly addressed to the gentlemen who deformed the play of othello on th  rs  y m  the  th    0 at the thtre ryl in dry lne to which is added a prologue and epilogue much more suitable to the occasion than their own  ne suitor ultra crepidam london printed for and sold by j river under st dunstans church fleet street  price sixpence  a more suitable occasional prologue by ebeneazer pentweazel while heedless fops affecting to be sage with awkward attitudes disgrace the stage ours be the task to paint the simple elves and show the race of triflers in our selves for this unmindful of the cynic tribe the wrinkled forehead or the illnaturd gibe dauntless we deign to face the unruly pit so famed for clamor petulance and wit merits our own  from no peculiar cause therefore be sure we have  our own applause heedless of what the selfish miser says we venture sense  for poverty and praise a thousand pounds a trifling sum for bays yet this you will say is wrong  we answer no twas always right and ever will be so but soft what noise was that approached mine ear help hoa my friends my friends  alas i fear some dire event our sad presumption waits fly from this spot and intercept the fates for lo methinks descending from on high the ghost of injured shakespeare draws nigh with aspect stern behold the bard advance his eyes resentments fiercer rays elance justice before him wields her flaming sword and only waits the bards assenting word beside him poesy knitts her angry brow and seems to ruminate a dreadful vow behind a numerous frightful train appear rending with doleful shricks the ambient air furnished with whips and stings to scourge us hence and murder us ere we can murder sense they come  ye mystic forms which wreck the soul and thou much injured bard  nay do not scowl nor vent thy heightened rage on me alone there is more behind  i am not the only one illusion all  it is fled  and i am at rest  twas but the fancy of a guilty breast sure it is the very error of the moon revenge grows harsh and murders out of tune i cannot do it by heaven  i cannot do it yet she must die  ay that is beyond dispute the muse shall die  else she will betray more men or may be play her tricks with us again so let us fairly do it here to night put out the light  and then put out the light come on my lads  nay hang me if i sham her and when we have killed her  let the audience damn her a satirical dialogue between a sea captain and his friend in town gent well met noble captain youre welcome on shore pray when did you land  capt last night  gent not before  capt no by g  d twas a wonder i landed so soon for the wind has blown hard since the change of the moon  gent pray what news do you bring from the african coast  capt why good news i think  i had surely been lost if neptune the sovereign god of the sea had not interposed twixt eolus and me but what is the most talked of in this famous city where the people are all so polite and so witty so extensive the place it must something afford  gent why faith honest captain i know not a word that is worth my relating yet list and you will hear though twill rather chagrine you than please you i fear our gentry of late to their honor be it spoke who think themselves wiser than all other folk have acted like people bereft of their senses for gentilitys lost when the player commences  capt the player commences why what do you mean  gent have patience good captain i will open the scene you must know that in london some people there are so fond of the greatness that waits on a playr that at once they turned actors themselves to expose to the pity of friends and the censure of foes  capt lord what could induce them such madmen to be  gent oh you know the french phrase a la mode de paris sir the french have performed alluding to an account in the paper of a play performed by some young noblemen in france    capt oh then it is all well the english must follow them though twere to hell where if cerberus did not the french men affright but would let them go visit the regions of night each monkey would after them like a brave fellow  gent as they have done now by playing the fool  and othello there is a fable i learned it at school years ago i will relate it i think it is quite apropo on a time as fame says the apes acted a play tho i know not the date of the year or the day nor is it material since it was enacted and for apes twas done better than could be expected the asses soon heard on it and they must needs try yet they used this precaution that none should be by but those who were really asses indeed for says they they may laugh if we do not succeed but our gentry so confident bold and conceited never used this precaution but fairly admitted an audience of critics to see their fine play  capt then the asses in fact acted wiser than they pray how was it received were the hearers quite civil  gent ay or else the whole play had gone souse to the devil good manners obliged them sometimes to applaud tho they little deserved it   capt i believe so by gd and pray what expense might attend this affair  gent why fifteen hundred pounds our papers declare  capt fifteen hundred do you say why gd dam my blood so much money spent to do no sort of good how much more commendable would it have been since objects of pity so frequent are seen with benevolent hands to have given it to those and not paid so dearly themselves to expose  gent faith captain youre right my opinions the same for in every respect they are greatly to blame now if i was an actor this method i would take the stage and its drudgery both i would forsake turn gentleman now as the gentry turn players and exhibit a taste far genteeler than theirs  epilogue why what a trick they have played me here egad pray isnt it enough to make one mad such idle things these men  dull dronish rogues to make us tender souls speak epilogues but yet i partly guess what they are about and faith i will tell for wit and truth will out you too may guess  but this i know the case is the chaps are all ashamed to show their faces but shames the effect of guilt  it is most certain no wonder then they have sneaked behind the curtain and send me here to gild a dirty cause to tickle your goodnatures for applause if i dont mawl em for it let them mawl me i will teach the scurvy knaves civillity well but good audience did you like the play ha now you shake your heads  and well you may for sure such wretches never trod the stage unless it were to lull a nodding age well for my part it pleased me to the life to hear oath  llo bawl so for his wife wife what wife  he had a wife last summer and has so still  he is only parted from her but that is a c  tly fault  no more of that they both consented so twas tit for tat suppose he had lost her  why this mighty pother his monkey f  t can help him to another but soft methinks i hear him rave behind bear witness all  he swears he will beat me blind why let the great and mighty hero come and beat his fill  he cannot beat me dumb i will have my way in spite of friends or foes i
