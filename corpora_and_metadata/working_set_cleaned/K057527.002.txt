volumes vol ii  london printed for william lane leadenhallstreet mdcclxxxvi  the adventures of anthony varnish chapter xvi description of the family  the soldier gives an account of his life  he endeavors to prove that honor is a sufficient substitute for happiness  i retire to bed  join the soldier and his family  more ways of living than one  the soldiers stratagems to eke out a scanty pittance  their success  as soon as we had all retired within the cabin our company was reinforced by the arrival of the farmers daughter who had just returned from a neighboring fair where she had been to sell some spunyarn in which employment her father and she passed the greatest part of their time in order to make a small addition by their industry to that pittance to which it had pleased heaven to reduce them  when we had assembled round the hearth the loquacious soldier taking some tobacco from a leather pouch which he carried in his pocket between his finger and thumb and depositing it in his lower jaw between his lip and his teeth began to inform us who he was and the reasons that had induced him to pay a visit to that part of the country  when i first took it in my head to enter the army as a private says the soldier i was about the age and size of this here lad at the same time giving me a violent pat on the head  i remember the time just as well as if it was but yesterday though may hap i havent made many a hard campaign since that time  but no matter for that every man is not born with a silver spoon in his mouth and if so be as how i have done my duty why ant i as good as another hey father says he addressing himself to the host  but damme what signifies  it will be all the same a hundred years hence as corporal crab used to say  well as i was saying when i listed in the army it was in the month of june at clonmel in the county of tiperary and a fine body of men our regiment were damme as ever faced an enemy in the field of battle  but this will not do by g  d  ram me into a ginshop as our corporal used to say but i am growing confoundedly dry i am none of your fellows damme not i that can talk without drinking  here said the talkative son of mars holding out the mug take this and fill it full of the righteous  i cannot do without it by the lord harry  i must wet the whistle  i am just as dull if i want drink as a mounseer without soup meagre  aye that is a brave girl says he taking the mug from the young woman come my lass putting the vessel to his mouth here is long life to you if you die tomorrow as our corporal used to say  what was i saying when i left off  oh i recollect  why we were ordered to cork that we might be in readiness to meet the transports which were coming round there from the channel to take us and five more regiments to north america to fight the rebels  we got got into the boats at three in the morning and fell down the river to the ships that were moored off kinsale and a brave set of boys there was do you see as ever the sun shone upon  we mustered i remember near four thousand though i believe four hundred never lived to return but no matter for that we must all die some time or other and is not better to die in battle with a bullet through your head fighting for your king and country as our corporal used to say than to sneak into the other world with a potecarys shop in your guts  damme i am no flincher  here is your good health daddy says the soldier drinking  i remember continues this son of gunpowder we had a quick passage we crossed the atlantic and arrived at new york just forty days after the time of our embarkation  i recollect too that our general would scarcely give us time to refresh ourselves after the voyage when he ordered us up into the country where we marched and countermarched after the enemy but i dont know how it was but damme we always arrived a day too late  but no matter for that  here is success to the army says he drinking and afterward giving me the mug  come you dog says he why dont you drink  why youre down in the mouth  damme you will never grow tall if you dont drink in compliance with his solicitations i took another draught while i was performing of which he kept crying take a good pull  by g  d it is better for you than mothers milk  well as i was saying our arms were idle for want of use till we were ordered to force the trenches of the rebels at bunkershill   at the mention of bunkershill i perceived the tears trickling from the eyes of the venerable old landlord chase one another in big round drops adown his furrowed face why what is the matter father says the soldier  ah replies the host i lost a son in that engagement who had he been living would have solaced and relieved me in my old days  what was his name says the soldier  john foster says the other  jack foster says the knight of the brown musket  by g  d i knew him as well as my own brother  he belonged to our grenadiers and as clever a fellow he was as ever stood in shoeleather  i remember he was shot through the heart as he was leaping into the yankees trenches  why man he and i were comrades and were quartered together at peg browns who kept a hucksters shop in boston  at this part of the story the old mans faculties forsook him and overcome by grief with the assistance of his daughter after wishing us a good nights rest he retired to bed   it was in boston continues the soldier that i picked up my wife and a clever b  tch she is as ever pillaged a field of battle  she was formerly married to a sergeant of our regiment but having his head shot off by a cannonball why damme the next day she married me  didnt you moll says he looking round for his companion who had stole away to bed with her child in the beginning of the soldiers story  why what the devil is she gone to bed already  never out of her road by g  d  but as for that matter molls an old campaigner and if ever she wants any thing for asking for why she ought to be damned as our corporal says  so here is my service to you my lad says the facetious narrator drinking again   well how should you like to be a soldier continues my companion addressing himself to me  i frankly replied not at all at which he testified a great deal of surprise and said why damme have you no ambition you dog  why no i replied not to lose my limbs as you have done the soldier having but one arm  oh damn this is a trifle says he lifting up the remaining stump besides i should not have lost this but for a mere accident upon my inquiring into the nature of it he informed me that he lost his precious arm at the springing of a mine where ninetenths of the party he belonged to were blown to pieces in the air upon which i told him without any equivocation that i had determined never to be a soldier as i had a particular veneration for peace health and a whole skin  i am sorry my lad says this modern belisarius that you have so pitiful a way of thinking  by the lord you have no more idea of glory than a captain in the city militia nor no more spirit than a tailor  now look at me  you see me here a poor fellow wading through the world with one of my wings lopped off  but no matter for that that is nothing more than the fortune of war as our corporal used to say and is many a brave mans lot as well as mine do you see but if so be as how that had not been the case why damme by this time i should have been a greater man than ever  but i will say nothing for boasting is the language of poltroons and beneath a gentlemansoldier to make use of so my little hero here is to ye you putting the mug to his mouth  oh oh damme says he turning the mug bottom upwards we are all aground by g  d   by this time the young woman had returned from attending upon her father and intimating to the storytelling soldier that it was high time to think of going to bed he thought proper to take the hint and asking the girl to show him the hammock where his wife had turned in he took up his sword and knapsack and taking me by the hand went out of the room scratching his head and shaking himself all the way to solace his yoke fellow and give his tongue a respite until morning  as soon as the beams of phoebus penetrated through a little window and informed the tenants of the cabin that it was time to rise we all got up and having adjusted our traveling baggage began to march taking the readiest way to come into the high road that leads to the metropolis and the soldier and his wife having the same place of destination we made a pleasant party of three and agreed to bear each other company  as we walked along the soldier took frequent opportunities of sounding me upon the strength of my purse which when he learned was almost exhausted having only a crooked sixpence and a few halfpence left his looks became gloomy and thoughtful and we were laying our heads together to concert a plan for the procuring a comfortable breakfast when we espied a carriage coming toward us followed by three servants on horseback at the sight of which my companions countenance began to wear a pleasant aspect and bidding me make what haste i could behind a hedge he told me that he would soon procure some loose cash from the quality in the coach which was approaching us now very fast i immediately obeyed his orders and got with great precipitation on the other side of the ditch whence i resolved to watch his motions narrowly not knowing rightly what construction to put upon his words but i was soon released from my perplexity by observing my fellowtraveller who had so contrived to twist his left leg and the remaining arm that he appeared when limping which he did to admiration like a poor dislocated wretch who had not the power of putting his hand to his head or helping himself in any manner whatever and in this woebegone state he placed himself in the middle of the road to be ready at all points to encounter the coach and to lay warm siege to the hearts of the company within  as soon as the carriage arrived within a few paces of the soldier we all perceived with joy that the majority of the company were females there being three young beauties within accompanied by an elderly gentleman whom we guessed to be their father but my senses were now occupied in observing the artful maneuvering of the jocund son of mars for limping up to the side of the carriage to all appearance with infinite labor on his part and pulling off his hat he accosted them in the following pitiable strain  ah my sweet young ladies long life to you all  and cannot you find in your fair bosoms one spark of pity for a poor maimed soldier with a wife and six small children  yes my good gentlewomen cries his faithful helpmate this boy in my arms is one of them  we left the other five in the last town behind us as a pledge for nineteenpence halfpenny all true upon my honor says the soldier and unless you or some other welldisposed christians contribute to our relief we must perish for hunger  how came you by those wounds friend says the gentleman in the coach  i lost this precious limb replies the soldier exhibiting his stump in the defense of an officers wife who was a passenger on board our transport whom the spaniards wanted to make a prisoner of off cape finistere because why my sweet madam says he to one of the young ladies who had put her head out of the coach to look at the young child she was like yourself heaven bless you as beautiful as wenus  ah poor man says the lady evidently the more interested in his success by the soldiers last welltimed remark upon her person  i and nine more of my comrades continued the military impostor were taken prisoners as we boarded the spanish frigate sword in hand my good master when we were put in irons till the ship bore away for barcelona then they hauled us ashore and we lay fifteen months a fortnight and three days on the damp floor of a spanish prison with no other covering than an old blanket full of varmint and no food but stale onions black bread and stinking water your honor  as the female heart is generally susceptible of the soft pangs of sympathy when listening to the misfortunes of the brave and the irish ladies being equal to any upon earth in gentleness generosity and compassion it is no wonder that the young gentlewomen in the carriage should unite to lift the supposed burden of care and want from the shoulders of the gallant veteran  indeed he had no sooner finished the relation of this wellwove catalogue of woe than they joined in concert to implore the old gentleman to give him a shilling upon his expressing an opinion that he thought it too much they pulled out their purses as in unison and gathering six pence a piece threw it to the soldiers wife who picked it from the road while he exhibited in silent gesture as if overpowered with their bounty some wellconceived attitudes expressive of pantomimic gratitude as the coach drove away from this accidental farce which was performed so much to the honor of the ladies and in my opinion the degradation of the soldier  my companion had the grace to watch until the carriage by descending a hill got entirely eclipsed from our view when calling to me to come forth by the wellknown summons of fox come out of your hole i leaped into the path on the side of the highway while he replaced his knapsack which he had taken off for the more convenient performance of the part he meant to play and after buckling it in proper order we set off on our peregrinations once more having no object now that could so materially affect our contemplation as the fight of an alehouse for which we all looked out with as much ardour as mariners do for land when their water and provisions are exhausted  chapter xvii a proof of my credulity  my inquiries are followed by a family quarrel  a familiar dialogue in low life  arrive at a public house  diamond cut diamond or the soldier too much for the israelite  arrive at a farm house  another proof of the soldiers address in thieving  we were all three pacing along the middle of the high road to the tune of the grenadiers march which the soldier was whistling in quick time while his eyes glistened with pleasure at the success which had attended his last maneuver and every now and then he cast them toward me with a leer as much as to say dont you think me a damned clever fellow when i interrupted the progress of the tune by observing that i was a little surprised how any person could retain so great a share of animal spirits who had experienced so many and such reiterated hardships  what you mean the spanish prison and the stinking water says my companion upon my replying yes he burst out into a fit of immoderate laughter which he repeated looking in my face two or three times successively at last the violent part of his merriment subsiding he asked me with a grave countenance if i believed it  i told him to be sure the circumstances appeared to me so natural that i could think of nothing else upon which he undeceived me by telling me very heartily that the whole from beginning to end was neither more or less than a confounded lie  what have you no children in pledge neither said i  not one upon my soul said he nor a brat in the world except this young bastard at my wifes back and if any one has a mind to take him into pledge why all that i say to the matter is that i will be damned if i would take the trouble to redeem him in a hurry  how dare you call my child a bastard you loblolly son of a whore cries the enraged wife  no abuse moll replies the other holding up the remaining arm in a threatening position because why do you see if you do i will bring you to the halberd by g  d so mind me that if you have a guard for your bones my girl  you and your halberd may go to hell together you lousy scabberoon rascal says the irritated trull with her cheeks as red as scarlet with indignation was it for this i left jack furlow to take up with such a lying thieving pimping mustbehanged dog as you  you know you scoundrel that i have it in my power to bring you to the gallows you leering hound  at this last intimation the soldier thought proper to appease his comrade with all the soothing in his power  come come moll says he why are you in such a damned passion  you know i was but in jest  take care to crack your jests in proper time then replies she  how does this youth know who or what i am  nay nay moll rejoins the soldier there is enough said if i i have affronted you why damme i am sorry for it  bastard indeed mutters the lady  why set in case as how i did call bob a bastard moll replied the knight of the brown musket you know the things natural enough  i now took an opportunity of putting an end to this polite colloquy between the soldier and his trull by pointing to a public house that awaited our entrance at a small distance from the place of disputation here we found the landlord and a jew pedlar in a warm contest about the origin of christianity and they contended the matter with so much heat that although i knew but very little of the subject i readily concluded they were both in the wrong the landlord was so engaged in his argument that he took no sort of notice of our entering the kitchen until my comrade by touching him upon the shoulder put him in mind of his duty upon which he started up and begging pardon for his inattention placed us a long stool by the fireside when we took our feats without any farther ceremony  what have you to drink landlord says the soldier  every thing replies the other  have you any good whiskey if you have bring us a naggen apiece says the dealer in gunpowder  i think without vanity i may say that i have the very best whiskey in the country rejoins boniface i am sure i ought brother soldier for i pays ready money for every drop that comes into my house  no trust for me  it was always a saying of mine never trust but when needs must  oh damn your palaver landlord cries the thirsty soldier bring but the sort do you see and leave us to praise it upon which delicate suggestion the host instantly disappeared   i suppose gentlemans you have quite tired the gentlewomans says the jew for she looks monshtrously jaded  oh by g  d friend says her helpmate it is not so easy a matter as you may imagine to knock moll up  i only shust spoke says the jew i hope no offensh  oh not at all says the other  damme i like you  give your hand my honest israelite  we must be better acquainted  witch all my heart says the jew  will you join in our mess we are only taking a sup of the righteous this morning to warm our stomachs man  here take a taste says the soldier giving the pewter measure to the jew which upon putting to his lips he exclaimed i vow to god it ish raw spirits  raw replies the other aye to be sure damme i hate to spoil a good thing by mixing it  but what have you got mordecai in that there box by your side  oh a choich collection of knives shishhors and rashors  perhaps your lady would like a pair of shishhors i can show her a pair thatsh fit for any lady in the land  and besides heresh a nice pair of earrings they are washed to be shure but what shignifies that they look as well as gold both of which articles the soldiers trull accepted from the jew with looks of great complacency and would of the whole contents of his box had he offered them for sale  for the shishhors i shall charge you becaush youre a friend only  oh damn the price cries the soldier interrupting him well talk of that by and by  here my honest fellow take another sup i desired the landlord to make it weaker for your palate  youre vashly kind sir upon my verashity says the other drinking  your good healsh sir and yoursh madam and yoursh my fine boy  which road do you take says the soldier to the pedlar  i am going up towarsh town says the other  that is lucky says the soldier then well travel together i have a cousin that lives in a village about twelve miles distant which we must pass through  he is a great brewer very rich and has a particular regard for me and because i have taken a liking to you damme i will carry you with me to his house and i will be bound that he shall purchase three parts of your cargo  i am exshtremely obliged to you says the other  oh damme dont talk of that i am but a poor soldier myself it is true but then what signifies that i have the heart of a general by g  d as our corporal says  come then as we are to travel together why it is time we thought of marching cries the consumer of salt petre at the same time bracing on his knapsack  your liquor comes to two and twenty pence says the landlord  oh oh damme i forgot that says the soldier but however the jew will discharge it i have got no change at present and i will repay him at the next place we come to upon which the itinerant hardwareman with some manifest signs of repugnance to the business pulled out the money and paid the amount which being accomplished we all set forward in the pursuit of our several occupations  as we journied along the soldier entertained the jew with an account of his rescuing a brother israelite in america from the hands of some cataban indians who had seized him as he was crossing a swamp in order to furnish a detachment of light horse with trinkets and other necessaries who were quartered within a league of albany  that wash very good upon my wordsh says the jew and you will be rewarded hereafter for protecting one of our peoplesh  oh says the other a good action rewards itself besides my heart has always warmed to a jew do you see ever since one of your tribe one moses manasses gave some old clothes to relieve a comrade of mine that was sick in cork says the soldier at the same time winking his eye at me  oh i dare shay as how i knows the man replies the jew it musht be a relation of little solomon manashes the pomatummerchant in dukes place  oh damme the very same says the other i have heard him mention solomons name a hundred times he was his uncle by the mothers side and a devilish clever fellow he was my little girgashite replies he looking at me and thrusting his tongue in his cheek with a grin  oh devilish clever says the jew he was the best maker of dutch sealingwax in all hounsditch  by this time we were overtaken by two empty cars which were returning to the next town after having carried some straw to a gentlemans seat up the country and being all of us a little inclined to be lazy we procured a seat upon the cars through the mediation of the lame soldier for the promise of a quart of ale to the driver on our arrival at the next alehouse accordingly we all mounted upon the vehicle and having had but an indifferent nights rest i presently fell asleep and did not awake till i was pulled by the legs by my companion who informed me that the cars would go no farther  when i alighted from the carriage i perceived the jew and the soldiers trull had got a considerable way before us and upon my expressing some astonishment my military companion told me that they were resolved to push on smartly to be able to reach the next town before dark which place had been previously settled by all parties as a general rendezvous  as we trudged along the merryhearted soldier did not fail to entertain me with stories of sieges and battles and hairbreadth escapes interlarded with witticisms which he delivered in a manner and dialect peculiar to himself  some people says he in my situation would be damnably down in the mouth without any money in my pocket except a couple of crooked sixpences and not an ounce of provision of any kind in my knapsack for moll and me to travel upwards of forty miles but that does not affect me for when one expedient fails do you see why i try another  i am resolved to get money when i want it why if i can get it honestly do you see me so much the better but at any rate i will get it  i am none of your mealymouthed rascals that want to be asked twice to what is good  but stop what have we here  some quality on horseback by all that is lucky  and after bidding me get out of the way he took a piece of soap from his pocket and placing it under his tongue he watched till they were come pretty near when he fell flat upon his back and began to beat the ground with his head and hands and presently foamed at his mouth prodigiously  as the seeming violence of his distress could not fail to attract their notice they all rode up while he acted the part of a man sorely afflicted with the epilepsy or falling sickness the company which consisted of two ladies on horseback attended by a young gentleman about sixteen years of age and an officer in his uniform with two servants in livery seeing the supposed melancholy condition of my comrade ordered their servants to assist the poor soldier as the bait had sufficiently taken and the company were viewing him with strong marks of commiseration he thought proper to grow better and sitting up affected to stare about him as not knowing where he was which was attributed by the pitying circle to the convulsions which he had undergone  after being questioned as to his name regiment the cause of his disorder and other corresponding circumstances he told them with a look in which he counterfeited all the wildness of extreme despair the same account word for word that i heard him relate on the same morning to the company in the carriage of the spanish prison and its evils and which he afterward assured me was a circumstantial falsehood but the man was right in one sense for he told his tale of misery with such an artless affectation of truth and sincerity that they threw him in silver and halfpence to the tune of seventeen pence after he had fervently prayed to heaven to bless them for their charity and benevolence they rode off and he stooped with alacrity to gather the misapplied offerings of their deluded liberality  by the time he had pocketed the donations of the generous and humane travelers who doubtless thought that they were doing an action peculiarly grateful to heaven i jumped from the ditch where i had lain hid during the soldiers masterly operation and joined him company when giving me a tremendous slap upon the shoulder he burst into a loud laugh and asked me what i thought of the last maneuver upon my face denoting wonder and amazement he cried out with great exultation oh you dog if you keep me company i will teach you how to live  it is not done by working no damme let the foolish part of the world work and them that are fond of it say i for my part of the story i never was in love with work in my life and what is more by g  d i dont believe i ever shall  by the succession of artifices which my conscientious fellowtraveller had put in practice to delude the generous and benevolent since i had the good fortune to associate with him i could not avoid looking upon him with a kind of horror and antipathy inasmuch as a knowledge of the infamous means he made use of to awaken the sentiments of pity in the hearts of the good and worthy would effectually steel them in future against the supplications of real misery whenever they might have the pain to encounter it however i had resolved to disguise my ideas of his character as much as possible and by affecting a compliance with his humors endeavored to glean some wholesome experience without endangering either my manners or my morals  as we paced along to overtake our companions who by this time had got the start of us by at least a mile we came within sight of a farmhouse to which the onearmed veteran proposed going for the purpose of asking a ruddyfaced damsel who stood at the door the hour of the day upon his asking the question she replied with great civility that she would go and see the moment that the girl had turned her back i observed my colleague looking about the yard with the eyes of argus at last espying a wellfed duck that came waddling toward us his chops watered with desire and bidding me wait at the door he stepped on one side and with an admirable alertness struck the duck on the head with a thick oak sapling which he carried with him by way of walkingstick and ere i had well time to contemplate the transaction he had it deposited in his knapsack when the young girl returned and informed us it was almost six oclock the soldier finding that the evening was so far advanced told me that we must stir our stumps for that we had a good three miles to go over before we should enjoy the comforts of either bub or grub by which polite epithets i had been already taught to distinguish the difference between meat and drink  chapter xviii we overtake the jew  he is affronted by the landlord  a battle  the bloody consequences  we enjoy the fruits of my companions dexterity  make the israelite drunk  he is charged with committing a robbery  the puhlican enraged and drawn into a scrape by the malpractices of the soldier  phoebus had just descended to the enjoyment of his beloved thetis when we arrived at the town of  and found isaac for that was the jews name watching for us at the door of a house dedicated for the purpose of entertaining the weary sojourner  upon the soldiers making an inquiry after his female messmate the jew told him that she was smoking her pipe by the kitchenfire whither we all repaired immediately and as the demon hunger had caused strange commotions in the intestines of us all it was proposed by the jew that we should get something to allay it upon which the publican told our friend isaac that he could give him as delicious a slice of bacon as ever was broiled on a turfsire  a slice of vat cries the enraged child of circumcision who took this proposal of the landlord as a direct insult  why a slice of bacon cries the other  gives me leave to tell you sir replies the descendent of moses that you are a very impertinent short of a fellow  why i will tell you what friend says the host it is true i am obliged to every gentleman for their custom but what then why i will not receive uncivil language from the best man in the county and if you repeat such language again friend damme i will shave your face for you with an oaken razor alluding to the jews beard which ornamented his lower jaw from ear to ear as black and bristly as a hogs back  whatch that you shay says the jew rising from his seat you will shave me may i never enter the synagogue alive but if you touch a hair of my beard but i will  what will you do cries the landlord strutting up to him  well done isaac cries the soldier slapping him on the back and pushing him forward never mind by g  d i will stand by you which assurance of support spirited the israelite so far that going up to the landlord with his arms enfolded he repeats now shir i shay you are an impertinent fellow and moreoverish i have a great mind  here the jews sentence like the story in hudibras was abruptly broke off in the middle by the incivility of the publican who on hearing the word impertinent a second time grappled a threelegged stool that stood in his way with an intent to knock the israelite on the head which isaac perceiving dropped instantly upon his knees and was looking most piteously up to the soldier for relief when he received such a terrible kick in the mouth from his adversary as fairly drove him four yards backward into the fire where he lay to all appearance bereft of life with the blood gushing from his ears mouth and nostrils and his head leaning against an iron pot which hung over the fire with some potatoes boiling for the family  when i perceived the dreadful issue of this adventure i got hold of one of poor isaacs arms and the soldier taking hold of the other we drew him out of the fire but he still remaining motionless we deposited him upon some straw and then left him to recover his senses at leisure  meanwhile the soldier pulling the dead duck from his knapsack gave it to the host to get dressed which office he set about with wondrous alacrity when the maimed warrior cast his eye upon isaacs box which taking to the window he opened without ceremony and made free with a japanned tobaccobox and a case of razors  we were surrounding the fire listening to the remarks of the laughterloving veteran which were all made at the expense of poor isaac when the landlord informed us that supper was ready we all obeyed the word of command instantaneously and entering into a small whitewashed room scarcely high enough for any of us to stand upright found the duck smoking on the table encircled with a great quantity of potatoes and accompanied with two quarts of fine ale that mantled in the glass like genuine burgundy  as we were proceeding to an instant demolition of the purloined fowl we heard isaac calling out vociferously were ish my boxsh were ish my boxsh upon which the soldier went out and having washed the israelites face with a wet towel prevailed upon him to come in and sup upon a fine duck which he assured him upon his honor his cousin the brewer had sent him as a present when he heard he was in town  upon the strength of this importunity isaac consented to make one at the mess and having taken his seat at the festive board every man began to play his part and indeed we did it so dexterously that in less than ten minutes we had entirely cleared the table not only of the duck but of at least a stone weight of potatoes which accompanied the delicious morsel by way of a damper  i observed with attention the cadaverous visage of the jew whenever the landlord entered the room which changed from its natural hue very much resembling yellow oker to that of a deadly pale his lips quivered and his little black eyes shadowed with a monstrous pair of overgrown eyebrows which appeared to be more than half buried in his scull were inflamed with malice and revenge and indeed his whole frame seemed to undergo an agitation that sufficiently denoted the anguish and perturbation of his mind every time that the brawny host left the room a circumstance which the jew attended to with great watchfulness he did not fail to utter the severest denunciations of vengeance and upon the soldiers telling him that it was a great misfortune that he was not born a christian the jew replied with heat and praysh my good friend what bettersh should i have been if ish had been born a christian  why you would not retain all this animosity against the landlord says the soldier because if so be that youre struck on one cheek it commands you for to turn the other  oh it dosh dosh it rejoins the other why then give me leavesh to tell you master soldier you christians dont appear to me by your practish to be mush the better for your education   aye how do you make that out mosy says the soldier  why dont they hang the peoplesh from our shinagog in london without merchy replied the pedlar and all so shall got shave me merely because they buy a little plate and jewelsh by way of a bargainsh  aye aye you mean mosy says the soldier because they buy stolen goods and so you complain do you see because they hang the jews for being consarned in a robbery  why if it was not for that how would you for instance be able to travel about in safety  why thatsh very true upon my soul  heresh your healsh my good friend says the jew drinking to the military disputant whom he regarded now as a miracle of discernment and integrity  by the got of my fatheresh added he if it was not for the happinesh of your shochiety i would not stay another hour under the roof of this bloodyminded publicansh  in this jocund manner did the jew and the soldier pass their time in an agreeable teteatete until one in the morning by which hour the israelites rational faculties were all dormant or in other words he was made completely drunk having sacrificed to bacchus so powerfully that all those ideas which usually swam uppermost in his understanding such as extortion deception malice and a variety of other passions of the same amiable complexion were now totally obliterated from the tablet of his memory and lay drowned not in the lethean lake so famed by ovid yet full as effectually in homebrewed ale in this beastly state of negative existence did his bosomfriend the wily destroyer of gunpowder drag him to bed with his feet trailing along the ground as insensible of motion as if he had been a dead body actually drawn from the field of battle  after the soldier had properly disposed of the body of this circumcised acquaintance he returned for his box of pedlary wares and taking it with him under his arm wished us a good night when we all retired to our several apartments to rest  having drunk a much greater quantity of liquor than usual i was obliged to rise in the middle of the night to grope about for a convenience when i was diverted from my purpose by a terrible outcry of thieves thieves murder here is a villain wanting to ravish me when my terrors had a little subsided i perceived the landlord making toward me in his shirt with a candle in his hand inquiring where the noise came from which we quickly ascertained by the same outcries being repeated and breaking open the door of the room in which the soldier his trull and the jew were contained we saw the former leaning over the bed in the act of pinioning down the unfortunate jew who lay there half awake muttering hebrew which we conceived by his attitudes and the rolling of his eyes to be prayers while the trull was exclaiming ah you villain what want to ruin me you impudent thief while my dear husband was here too you dog but by the blessing of the holy you eternal vagabond i will make you know your lord g  d from tom bell at the end of which pious denunciation she laid hold of isaacs beard and pulled it with such vigor that before the miserable devil could disentangle himself from her gripe she had torn a handful of the bristly ornament of his chin away by the roots  she had no sooner quitted her hold than her precious helpmate seizing him by the shirt in attempting to drag him out of bed tore it to the bottom but failing in that endeavor he pulled down the bedclothes which isaac held between his remaining teeth as long as he was able and wielding his stick began to beat the mahogany carcass of the jew without an idea of compassion but isaac not relishing that kind of exercise leaped out of bed with the celerity of a do and before his assailant could well turn round had secreted himself in the chimney where he remained uttering yells and lamentations more dismal than were ever made by nebuchadnezzar during his residence in the wilderness  from the knowledge i had of my companions artifices and the extraordinary methods by which he seemed to eke out a subsistence i had no doubt but that this attempt on the chastity of his lady which was imputed to the jew was no other than a preconcerted scheme between this amiable pair to bring the israelite into trouble and take advantage of his consternation and in the sequel i found that my suspicions were but too well founded  upon the reiterated promises of the landlord that his person should be unmolested the griefladen descendent of mordecai ventured to leave his unsavory retreat and made his appearance covered and defiled with foot and trembling with the several impulses of feat and cold like an aspenleaf  after inquiring for his clothes he dressed himself in the best manner he was able and at intervals was talking to himself in a language that we could not comprehend when the landlord taxed him with the crime that was laid to his charge and was painting the heniousness of the offense and that the laws of the land would even justify the soldier in taking away his life in such a situation when the mortified isaac fell upon his knees and protested that he was innocent of the crime of having attempted to debauch any mans wife and striking his breast with great emotion he swore dat ish cots truth so shall cot save me so shall cot damn me  the jew finding himself environed now with enemies on all sides determined to get out of the house as fast as possible and set about it with as much industry as was ever exercised by ulysses or any of his companions to make their escape from the dangerous cave of polyphemus after scrambling for his tattered vestments the next grand object that engrossed his imagination was the box which contained all his portable merchandise and by the help of which under the management of an infinite deal of cunning did he fondly hope to be one day able to sit down blessed with wealth gleaned from the uncircumcised among his brethren of the synagogue who eat and drink in filth and abomination agreeable to the law of moses  but alas the hours that he had unluckily spent in the company of my exemplary fellowtraveller the soldier were doomed by fate to be unpropitious to poor isaac and indeed it was predestined that he should suffer so much that i ardently wish the evils that attended him on that memorable day may be considered as sufficiently expiatory for his former malpractices  when after a search of one hour he had recovered his box he opened it with great trepidation and avidity to see if every thing was safe when lo to his unspeakable mortification he missed full threefourths of its contents he had no sooner made the discovery than the roof echoed with his cries and execrations  oh by the cot of my fatheresh but i am robbed of all my propertish cries the miserable isaac and feeling in his pocket at the same time he found his purse had decamped also when he added in heartrending notes of deeptoned woe  and my monish my monish so help me cot ish lost my monish  during the whole of this transaction the soldier was employed in telling the landlord that he knew isaacs pranks of old and that he was sure instead of being robbed himself as he was complaining that he had actually purloined something belonging to the publican and in order to escape that and paying his reckoning he had raised this artificial outcry about a loss which he had never experienced  fate and trot says the landlord your story is very likely and i am much obliged to you for the hint for though i never had a jew lodge with me before by my soul i always heard they were a set of damned rogues  isaac still continuing obstinate to the text he first set out upon and making a terrible outery about his losses threatened to have the landlord before a justice of the peace in the morning and by certain nods winks and insinuations gave us to understand that he verily believed he had a hand in the business which so nettled the host that he instantly collared the terrified israelite without ceremony and swore he would search him instantly for he believed that instead of being robbed of the articles he was making such a hideous yell about he had secreted some of his property and swore for the slurs he had thrown upon his character that if he found any thing belonging to him concealed about his person of the value of tenpence he would hang him like a dog at the next assizes  with the assistance of his other guests he threw the jew upon the floor and putting his hand in his coatpocket pulled out a tremendous slice of fat pork in weight moderately speaking about five pounds which the soldier had previously conveyed into his pockets while he was bustling about his losses  upon this incontestible proof of his guilt the landlord seized the jew as his prisoner and tying his arms behind him with a strong cord forced him into the cellar where he remained a close captive until the morning when they took him from his dungeon to carry him before a justice of the peace with a face as rueful as ever was exhibited  the story of the robbery had by this time gained so much ground that a great number of boys had gathered round the door waiting with anxious expectation for the appearance of the persecuted israelite who was no sooner conducted into the street than they set up a roar of exultation and continued to torment the poor wretch with the bitterest sarcasms upon his religion and the nature of the theft as the bacon was carried before him elevated on a pole amidst the shouts of the surrounding multitude all which indignities isaac bore in silence with a patient shrug until they arrived at the magistrates  when they were proceeding to the examination of the culprit it was discovered that the principal evidence was wanting  in short the soldier having a natural repugnance to the smell of justice had taken an opportunity during the bustle occasioned by the progress of so comical a cavalcade to decamp a la sourdine or in other words he moved off without beat of drum and left the deluded publican to make the best of the circumstance and to depend for his escape from the perplexities that then surrounded him on his own talents and ingenuity  chapter xix my arrival at dublin  astonishment at the magnificence of the buildings  accosted by a seaofficer  enter into his service  my master is arrested  i am charged with a commission which i execute with dexterity  my master is enlarged by the good offices of a friend  new way of manning the navy  having conceived a most insuperable aversion to my military companion in consequence of the viciousness of his disposition which had been manifested on so many occasions in the short time that i had the honor of his acquaintance i secretly rejoiced at his retreat and determined for the future to be more guarded and circumspect in the choice of my associates  being now within a few miles of the capital i set forward with all possible haste in order to reach it before the evening which i should have found a difficulty in effecting if i had not rode upon a car that was carrying corn to the dublin market for at least six miles of the road  when i first entered the city every thing around me struck me with amazement having been used from my infancy to see the societies of mankind comprised within the narrow compass of a country town i had no idea of all that bustle noise and confusion which characterises the metropolis of a commercial kingdom  the streets carriages and public buildings appeared like so many objects raised by the power of enchantment  i had strolled through several streets totally ignorant of the best method to pursue and wrapped up in contemplation and wonder when the wind in my bowels and the gnawing in my stomach put me in mind that it was absolutely necessary i should eat and this suggestion called forth a hundred others equally disagreeable for the reader will recollect that i had before lost every farthing i was worth in the wide world  i remained for some minutes absorbed in reflection when not knowing whither to direct my weary steps in search of either a meal to eat or a lodging to sleep in i burst into a flood of tears and was actually standing in the middle of the street a public spectacle of want and wretchedness when i received a familiar slap upon the shoulder accompanied with damn ye jack what do you snivel for you dog upon my turning round i perceived a gentleman about thirty years of age with a goodhumoured countenance well dressed an oak sapling under his arm and a cockade in his hat he inquired into the cause of my sorrow with a degree of attention and curiosity that sufficiently assured me his heart was influenced by the soft dictates of humanity though his language and his manners savoured somewhat of roughness  when he was acquainted with the particulars of my life he told me that i had been obliged to weather some hard gales to be sure considering i was little better than a cockboat at present and not much ballast onboard  but what of that my lad says the generous stranger who knows but you may be the better for it as long as you live  come give me your hand  if you have a mind to live with me do you see as my servant why you shall be welcome and enter into present pay and good quarters  what do you say you dog  is it a match  i thanked him for his friendship and told him if he pleased that i would follow him throughout the wide world and indeed at the instant i spoke my heart accorded perfectly with my professions as i was much attached to his interest from the open and sincere manner in which he accosted me  after following my new master for near a mile we stopped at a genteel house in the neighborhood of collegegreen which i soon found was his place of residence when he informed his landlady that he had hired me as his servant at the same time ordering me to get my supper and go to bed as he had no doubt but i was greatly fatigued and that he should have occasion for me early in the morning indeed there required but little pressing on his part to oblige me to execute so agreeable an order for what with fasting and exercise my guts were actually in a state of open rebellion however the next morning i entered upon my new state of servitude and felt the most eager desire for my masters rising under whose banners i proposed living for the future with the utmost degree of ease and tranquillity  the servants of the house with whom i had supped the preceding evening gave him the most amiable character imaginable and i learnt from them that the name of my benefactor was odriscol and lieutenant of a man of war who had obtained leave of his captain who then lay at portsmouth to pay a visit to his relations in ireland they farther informed me that i might expect to be very comfortable in my new situation as mr odriscol possessed every virtue under heaven but one which was economy to which necessary ingredient in the human composition he was so utter a stranger that he very frequently supplied the wants of the necessitous and importunate and left himself without a shilling  it was near eleven before i was summoned by the bell to prepare my masters breakfast which i understood from the servants of the family was generally cold beef and grog which is a beverage peculiarly palatable to seamen made of rum water and sugar when i entered my masters chamber he accosted me with well tony you dog how did you sleep  was the hammock convenient  but i suppose as how that what with traveling and the cargo of fresh provisions you stowed in your hold last night you would have slept at the main topmast head of a man of war in the bay of biscay  but come have they told you what sort of a breakfast i eat  when i answered in the affirmative and informed him that i had laid it for him in the dining room he sallied out in his nightgown and slippers and sitting down at the table attacked the beef and bread with the appetite of an alderman after he had demolished about two pounds of solid beef and drunk a quart of grog he ordered me to take away the things and get my own breakfast  i hope you dont want tea says my master  i assured him that i should always think myself extremely happy with a piece of beef and bread for my breakfast  aye you dog that is right says the lieutenant i turned off my servant a day or two ago because he could not do without tea and be damned to him  for my part tony i detest tea i think it a weed that has already done a damned deal of mischief to old england and i believe in my heart can never possibly do any good either to the body politic or natural  my master was proceeding in vehement exclamations against the pernicious tendency of tea when his discourse was interrupted by the arrival of a brotherofficer after the mutual exchange of a few salutations which appeared much higher tinctured with sincerity than refinement he dressed and giving me a few general orders these sons of neptune went forth arm in arm  i had now leisure to reflect upon the comforts that i enjoyed in my new employment which contrasting with my former situation with calomel and the subsequent miseries i had experienced made me as completely blessed in imagination as i believe it possible for a human creature to be  at length the hour arrived that it was usual for my master to come home to dinner when not seeing him it was conjectured by the family that he had met with some engagement accidentally which had prevented him however the evening came and we heard nothing of the lieutenant which created some alarms upon his account in the breasts of all the people of the house to whom he had particularly endeared himself by the goodness of his heart and the affability of his manners  at last night approached and yet we heard no tidings of my master now every one appeared interested for his welfare the mistress of the house knowing the warmth of his disposition entertained an idea that he might have got into some ugly affray which had ended in a duel and he perhaps poor sweet gentleman as she phrased it had lost his life  but our fears on that score all subsided about eleven oclock when a man with a stern and forbidding aspect knocked at the door and asked for lieutenant odriscols servant at the same time informing the family that my master was arrested for a bond of two hundred pounds and now lay in confinement at a spunginghouse in thomasstreet  the horror which i felt and indeed every person in the house on hearing the above intelligence may be more easily conceived than described however recollecting the orders of my master i followed the grimlooking conductor to the officers house who had arrested him  when i came to that dreary abode of misery i passed through two doors covered over with plates of iron the keys of which were kept by a tall rawboned man whose countenance was so terrific in my idea that i trembled with apprehension as i passed by him to my master whom i found in a small filthy room sitting by the fireside leaning upon a greasy oak table with his head reclined upon his hand and discoursing with an illlooking fellow who sat opposite whom i afterward found to be the bailiff himself with the most perfect composure and familiarity  when i entered the room the lieutenant ordered me to sit down and calling for pen ink and paper he wrote a letter which having sealed up he privately informed me of the place where the person lived to whom he had directed it at the same time assuring the officer that his friend would satisfy him for the debt the instant he should arrive to which this human harpy replied i am very glad to hear it master for why now should i wish to keep a goodnatured gentleman as you seem to be do you see locked up here  to be sure i get a trifle by the wine but what signifies all that  but i perceive as how that our bottles out  here you bet cries the bailiff  upon which the fellow who had conducted me to the house told his employer that his wife was below stairs cooking the gentlemans supper  here then says the ferocious chief take this here bottle down to the bitch and tell her to send another full of claret  bid her to send the right sort  do you hear peter  you understand me says the bailiff at the same time tipping his understrapper a wink  aye aye says the other and instantly disappeared when the bailiff resuming the thread of his conversation proceeded  as i was saying master suppose i do get a trifle by the wine it is all nothing do you see me because why the taxes eat us up  here his elegant apology was interrupted for by this time my master having sealed and directed the letter gave me positive orders to deliver it into none but the gentlemans own hands and to return to him with all possible haste  when i read the superscription i found it directed to a captain pennant who lived at one of the quays leading down to the waterside i literally obeyed my masters injunctions and by good luck got a man to show me to the captains house i knocked at the door and inquired if such a person lodged there and if he was at home upon which i was showed up stairs and found the lieutenants friend with five or six more gentlemen of the navy sacrificing warmly to bacchus and drowning the sorrows of the day in a capacious bowl of rumpunch  when i had delivered my letter which the captain read with signs of evident emotion he showed it to his companions who upon perusing it started from their seats and proposed an instantaneous visit to my master but being opposed in this project by the interposition of their chief they desisted the captain at the same time ordering me to go back to the lieutenant immediately and inform him that he would follow me with a wet sail and procure his release in less than an hour  as i conceived these to be the tidings of joy i hurried back to the spunginghouse as fast as my legs could carry me and informed my master of the issue of my errand upon which he ordered more wine and treated the bailiff and his people with as much as they could drink till at last the principal himself fell asleep in his chair and the rest of his infernal group began to reel under the influence of the purple god  i had not returned above half an hour when we heard a bustle at the outer door which increased to that violence at last as roused the attention of the bailiff who had by this time fallen asleep presently in rushes captain pennant followed by seven or eight stout seamen who instantly secured the grim member of the law and two of his people the third who stood sentinel at the door foreseeing the nature of the captains visit who was no other than the commander of a pressgang at that time stationed in dublin for the purpose of procuring recruits to man the navy flew up stairs followed by two sailors who touched the skirt of his coat just as he got out upon the leads of the house and in endeavoring to leap over to the top of the opposite mansion he made a false step and fell down from an eminence four story high into a blind alley which separated the two houses and pitching plump upon his head fractured his scull and died upon the spot  as for the bailiff and his followers the sailors after stripping and tying them together forced them into a hackneycoach which happened to be passing by and making the coachman get up behind the sailors mounted on the box and roof and drove the carriage down to the waterside where a boat was waiting into which they forced the unfortunate bailiff and his adherents and lodged them safe in the hold of a tender that lay in dublin bay at the silent hour of two in the morning my master the captain and myself going to the house of a friend in his neighborhood where it was proposed that he should remain until an opportunity offered of his going onboard the first packet that sailed for england his remaining any longer in dublin after that adventure being considered by his friends as a measure attended with too much danger  chapter xx we go onboard a liverpool packet  the effects that the novelty of my situation had upon my mind  description of the passengers  dispute between a fishmongers lady and a methodist preacher  the great benefit of military men to the ladies in a mixed society  a dispute that proves the necessity of travelers keeping their religious principles to themselves  the whole company alarmed with danger  the admonitions of the fieldpreacher against swearing  a miserable catastrophe  my master having received notice that a liverpool packet would sail in the evening we instantly set about a preparation for our watery expedition the lieutenant spent the remaining part of the day in taking leave of his friends among whom none had a warmer place in his esteem than captain pennant i found from their discourse that the intimacy had subsisted ever since they were at school and that they had both served together in the capacity of midshipmen onboard the dreadnought man of war and likewise that the debt for which my master had been arrested was not of his own contracting but what he had brought upon himself in consequence of his benevolence having given his bond to relieve the family of a friend in the deepest distress upon the most solemn assurances from the person relieved that he never should be a sufferer by his goodnature as he should have the means of taking up the bond long before it became due  a sailor having been dispatched from the captain of the packet to inform us that the vessel would fall down the river on the turn of tide which would happen in half an hour we were obliged to manage our affairs accordingly the lieutenant to avoid the possibility of being known having previously dressed himself in a suit of womens apparel which the captain had got from his landlady for the purpose  a coach being called to the door in stepped my master the captain and another gentleman with a large cargo of sea stores consisting of a cold boiled ham a pair of fowls bread brandy and claret  when we arrived at the place of our destination at georges quay and were putting our provisions in the boat i felt the most unpleasing regret at the idea of leaving my native land perhaps for ever and though not quite sixteen years of age so forcibly did the idea distress me and so much did the love of my country cling about my heart that i actually wept with my distress but turning my head round to look at the rest of the passengers and observing that they all appeared in a state of perfect indifference as to that event i thought the amiable emotions of patriotism were unmanly and secretly wiped away the tears that bedewed my cheeks unnoticed by my master or the rest of the company  after indulging a silent reverie for a few minutes my curiosity was thoroughly roused by the novelty of the objects that surrounded me and the pleasures of my sight had completely dissipated the anxieties of thought i now for the first time in my life found myself sailing on the bosom of the water surrounded by a number of persons of all ages conditions and descriptions the boat which we were in appeared to me ready to sink with the weight of its burden and when i inquired of one of the sailors how far we were to proceed in that manner and understood that the packet lay at the distance of at least a league from the place of our embarkation i felt a cold sweat on all my limbs and notwithstanding the force of my curiosity i could not help wishing myself back a hundred times however after a safe and agreeable sail of about half an hour down the liffey with the waters beautifully illumined by the setting sun the sheds of clontarf forming a charming back ground at a distance and the horizon bounded by the purple majesty of the hill of howth we arrived at the side of the packet as the sailors onboard were busy in unbending the sails preparatory to our voyage  as the passengers rose from their seats in order to embark onboard the vessel i had a fair opportunity of surveying their persons the number in the boat was nearly fifty out of which i could easily distinguish about onethird to be cabinpassengers the rest were mostly irish haymakers or what in that country are called spalpeens who were going over to england to perform the drudgeries of agriculture and be ready against the ensuing harvest  when the captain had got them all onboard he made them immediately descend one by one into the hold or bottom of the vessel where i understood they were to remain until the packet arrived at liverpool in company with four horses and a broodmare which were slung in the center as their associates when they had all descended to their wooden couch the mate of the packet fastened down the hatchway and left them to shift for a bed below as well as they were able  the company in the cabin consisted now of seventeen persons among whom was a celebrated comedian returning from his theatrical engagements in dublin a methodist preacher who had been propagating the gospel in ireland agreeable to the doctrine of john wesley a liverpool attorney a scotch physician an officer of horse a young connaught noviciate who was going to study divinity in the irish college at paris a quaker from waterford with his wife a customhouse officer a fishwoman from georgesquay a young gentleman going out as a cadet in the east india companys service with a pawnbrokers widow and her two daughters my master habited as a young lady with a black bonnet and cloak and myself  after a vast deal of altercation about priority in regard to the beds in the cabin it was at last settled that the ladies should have the preference and the men shift for themselves a determination that seemed perfectly agreeable to all the company except the exciseman who grumbling at the decision observed that it was but just as they all paid equally for their accommodation that they should all fare alike  he was proceeding in his remark with great bitterness when the officer approaching him with a stern brow told him that the ladies had done him the honor to put themselves under his protection and upon the strength of such authority he requested them to take possession of those beds which were most agreeable to themselves  at this laconic intimation the exciseman thought proper to drop the subject and skulking into a corner by himself the ladies proceeded to fix upon their place of repose which was an inner room detached from the cabin by a glass door into which they all entered my master included and getting into their several beds prepared themselves in the best manner they were able to encounter that dreadful sickness which a certain qualmishness in their stomachs informed them was very rapidly approaching  as for the rest of the tenants of the cabin they betook themselves to their several quarters with the utmost alacrity and happy was he who could scud the fastest for having weighed anchor and the vessel being under way she began to roll in the waves from one side to the other to the great annoyance of the squamish sons of fresh water with which the vessel was crowded  night began to spread her sable mantle over one half of this habitable globe when the captain coming into the cabin told his passengers that we had cleared the lighthouse at the entrance of the harbor and were now going right before the wind in the bay with as fine a gale as heart could wish  he had scarce made this declaration when in tacking about the ship gave a terrible plunge which so alarmed the methodist that putting his head out of his birth he asked the captain if he was sure we were all safe if not he begged him for the love of god to tell him that he might have time to say his prayers and intercede with the almighty for the precious souls of the children of sin onboard who had never known the comforts of the new birth  oh never mind trifles replies the tarpawling i will be damned but youre as safe here as in your own bed  oh dont swear you monster of impiety cries the preacher when such wickedness and profanation is onboard i should not marvel if we all went to the bottom  he had scarce uttered the last syllable when the fishwoman who slept in the inner apartment opened the door with her hand and put out her head which notwithstanding the assistance of a dirty woollen nightcap appeared as unamiable and hideous as the sign of the saracens being covered with carbuncles all over which made her look at a distance somewhat like a fiery meteor or blazing countenance with a pair of small gray eyes that shone with unusual fury upon this occasion  when this fishdealing amazon had opened the door she accosted the captain of the packet in the following eloquent admonition  here is a pretty rig blast my limbs that i am to pay my goodlooking guinea for sleeping here and be disturbed by that canting lousy mustbedamned scoundrel  out upon thee thou vile daughter of satan cries the methodist  out upon me indeed cries the other out upon yourself you dirty cowardly snivelling hypocritical rascal  i defy thee thou ungodly woman replies the preacher and if you dont turn aside from the path of abominations you will become as polluted as the whore of babylon  at the mention of the word whore the fishmongers lady losing all patience leaped from her bed with the agility of a greyhound and flying across the cabin would have left the poor methodist no reason to pride himself upon his admonitions had not the captain apprehensive of the consequences interposed and assured her that he was certain the gentleman in black did not mean to offend her  how dare he call me whore then replies the enraged female i to whose character no one dares say black is the white of my eye  i did not mean to call you whore says the other  who did you call whore then says the oistervender  why the pope of rome cries the methodist he is the great scarlet whore of iniquity that like a bottomless gulf swalloweth up the blind and the unwary  and how dare such a fellow as you treat his holiness with irreverence cries the young noviciate touched to the quick at the last declaration of the preachers by my conscience friend you ought to have that tongue of yours cut out of your head for making use of expressions so disrespectful to the sublime head of the catholic religion so you ought  this last acrimonious remark operated upon the mind of the methodist like a spark of fire upon a train of gunpowder for in his religious opinions he was inflexible as adamant and would indeed have considered himself as a blessed martyr to the faith that he professed had he died in the act of denying the popes supremacy strengthened with this enthusiasm he instantly turned about to answer the young champion of his holiness who lay in a compartment immediately above him there being three one over the other erected on each side of the vessel to contain beds for the accommodation of the passengers  as soon as the preacher had turned himself round he began to inveigh most bitterly against the encroachments of popery on the liberties of mankind and was actually proceeding with all the vehemence he was able to scandalize the infallible father and his followers when the exciseman who slept in the upper tier of beds being seized with a sudden fit of sickness and to avoid bemiring his own nest with the nauseous contents of his stomach pops his head over the side of the cabin and instantly discharged on the most moderate calculation at least a quart of foetid liquids plump into the face of the angry methodist who lay upon his back with his mouth wide open railing with all the fury of a bigot against the young priest in petto who had offended him and was collecting all the force of his lungs to give a strong emphasis to the words scarlet whore which he had repeated before with uncommon energy when the exciseman unluckily disemboguing at that instant the greatest part of the solid matter falling into the saints mouth made the best of its way down his throat and fairly choking up all the passages of speech left the miserable disciple of john wesley an object of pity and abhorrence  it was some minutes before he could make his case known to the cabinboy who lay sleeping before the fire which when he had effected at last with infinite difficulty the young retainer of neptune with great composure lighted a candle and seeing the forlorn state of the itinerant son of regeneration instantly went upon deck and in the twinkling of an eye brought down a mop and a bucket of salt water with the former he rubbed off the filth from the face of the unhappy wight and completed the act of purification by dashing the latter into his face without either moderation or mercy but not performing the last operation with all that adroitness and dexterity which it undoubtedly required a great part of the briny application running down his bosom into the bed left him as fairly deluged in salt water as if the ship had sunk to the bottom of the channel  as soon as he had recovered the use of the organs of speech he set up a dreadful yell that made the cabin ring which the major part of the passengers taking for a signal that the packet had met with some accident and was foundering at sea leaped from their beds half dead with fear and horror and ran after one another upon deck like so many sheep through a broken fence to see their danger and if possible swim for their lives the man at the helm astonished at the unusual appearance of so many persons upon deck in their shirts in the middle of the night took them for apparitions and was so appalled with fear that quitting his rudder he made the best of his way up the shrouds and left the vessel to the mercy of the waves till the captain who was sleeping in the steerage hearing of the accident and outcry ran up and finding the helm deserted was almost frantic with madness and proceeded to utter a volley of dreadful oaths which the preacher no sooner heard than he began to admonish him for his wickedness and though half dead himself with cold he could not resist so favorable an opportunity of reclaiming a sinner and bringing him once more into the paths of peace for this pious purpose he had mounted upon the hatchway of the vessel and began to exhort the ferocious commander to think of the perils of his situation and not risk the salvation of his precious soul in such an hour of danger by expressions that were fraught with sin and unholiness and lifting up his hands with great fervency he was reminding them of the instability of their situation and uttering that quotation from holy writ which runs thus now you see me and in a little time you shall not see me when the vessel gave a violent heave which not only drove the preacher from his temporary rostrum but unfortunately pitched him headforemost into the hold of the packet where he alighted with prodigious alacrity amidst a number of poor creatures from munster who lay there huddled together on their passage to england for the purpose of making hay intermixed with the horses who were so much offended with the rude and unwelcome visit of the puritan that one of them who lay most convenient for the occasion gave him such a tremendous kick upon his posteriors as fairly drove him three yards distance against the side of the ship where he lay uttering the most piteous yells that were ever heard to issue from the lungs of a human being  chapter xxi the storm subsides  the discomfiture of the itinerant preacher  unlucky consequences of my masters disguise  a convivial party formed in the cabin  an unfortunate disaster among the passengers  they continue to practice upon the methodist  a mistake occurs which throws new lights upon the subject  as soon as the general consternation had a little subsided and the company had congratulated each other upon their supposed escape from imminent death a general inquiry was made as to the fate of the poor apostle when lo he was brought down to his birth in the cabin in such a lamentable state that it was the general opinion of the passengers that a final stop was put to his arduous labors in future and that his religious peregrinations in this world would be no more however he was put to bed with infinite caution where he soon fell asleep and convinced us by the inelegant tones of his snoring that he determined to remain among us some time longer  the different parties were now courting a little rest and endeavoring to compose themselves as much as possible when the demon of discord determined that our passage should be attended with little else than broils and battles thought proper once more to throw his flaming brands into the bosom of our society for just as the different organs of the company were put in tune by the somnific hand of morpheus and playing a great variety of cadences in treble tenor and bass a noise issued from the interior cabin particularly appropriated to the use of the ladies that discomposed the nasonic band and instantly broke asunder all the delicate ties of harmony though we could not exactly distinguish the immediate cause of the dispute the words shocking indecent and abominable were easily to be distinguished as they seemed to be delivered with great heat and anger  upon the captains making his appearance and inquiring into the nature of the disturbance we found the cause to be exactly thus  the pawnbrokers widow who assumed an uncommon share of delicacy in the whole tenor of her behavior since she came on shipboard was situated it seems in the inner apartment just opposite to my master who passing for a woman in consequence of his apparel was stationed among them a place which he more eagerly embraced thinking that in such a disguise and in so retired a situation he should run no possible risk of being discovered however fate so contrived it that it happened otherwise for the calls of nature in some particulars irresistible forced my poor master to get out of his birth to perform certain rites which it is wholly impossible can be done by proxy and it was in one of these critical situations that the delicate lady abovementioned happened to espy my master and she was no sooner convinced of the certainty of his being a man by perhaps a too curious observation on her part than she immediately began to reprobate his assurance as she called it in terms of the bitterest malignancy in which she was presently joined by the rest of the females who declared one and all that they would never set foot onboard the packet again  at this moment the captain entered and endeavored to pacify them as well as he was able and prevailed upon the lieutenant after some entreaties to give up his birth which in some measure restored tranquillity among us  upon the entrance of my master into our cabin in disguise it gave rise to a thousand jokes which were circulated with great freedom at the expense of the lady who had caused all this commotion  the good humor that seemed to prevail among three or four of the most convivial of the passengers induced them to a proposal of immediately getting up and by clubbing their seastores to make a party at eating and drinking in order to amuse the time until a prosperous gale should drive them to the british shore  the lieutenant sang the comedian repeated a variety of speeches from our most celebrated plays to the manifest diversion of the company the physician favored us with a discourse on the materia medica and the attorney informed us of a great cause he had obtained in ireland for the widow of a marine officer whose husband was shot in the act of fighting for his country onboard a kings ship in the mediterranean at the same time assuring us that the only motive he had for prosecuting the matter was a desire to have justice done to the distressed which last insinuation roused the attention of the customhouse officer who swore if that really was the case the attorney must have altered his practice most cursedly for that to his certain knowledge there was not a practitioner in the kingdom who had a keener eye to the profits of his profession  this sarcastic remark of the exciseman seemed to call forth all the natural choler of the attorney who retorted the charge with interest and told him he supposed because he had been continually robbing the king his master of his dues and plundering his subjects he imagined every other profession was equally infamous and dishonorable  there was a spirit of rancour and truth in this last observation which worked upon the feelings of the exciseman so far as to induce him to lift up a stool that stood near him to chastise the aggressor which had the meditated blow taken place would in all human probability have deprived the law of one of its noble members but he quickly perceiving the hostile intentions of the assailant crept under the table to avoid the impending storm with the agility of a monkey and remained there till the fury of the exciseman was appeased by the attorneys apology which he made without hesitation in terms of the most abject humiliation  just at this instant the cabinboy came down among us and exclaimed with great exultation land land upon which the fishwoman thrusting her head out of her birth roared out oh for gods sake dont talk to me of land but bring me the pot upon which the boy whose duty it was to administer that necessary utensil whenever the patients could not do it for themselves made haste to accommodate the fishselling nymph who not thinking he had hurried himself so fast in her service as he ought was attempting to scold him in her own language and had actually got out the first syllable of the laconic word scoundrel when her sickness overpowered her eloquence and she fairly deluged the young master of the ceremonies with the foul contents of her overloaded stomach  when the poor boy who had fallen down under the weight of the salute got up to shake himself he looked like one of the naiads of fleetditch and in all probability would have been stifled with the unsavory scent had not one of the sailors with infinite dexterity seized up a pail of water which stood in the cabin and washed off the filthy ornaments from the young gentlemans head who was restored once more to a state of purification  by this time the methodist whose situation had become extremely irksome to him got up and joined the company who had met round the table in hopes by listening to the spirit of their lively conversation to forget his own disgrace his intention was no sooner manifested than these sons of pleasantry made way for his accommodation and insisted in spite of his entreaties to the contrary that he should sit at the head of the table and give the company a sermon for the good of their souls this invitation which the preacher received in a literal sense was highly grateful to his disposition and pleasing to him in a spiritual light for he had long broiled in secret at the impiety of their discourse and would most willingly have corrected their manners but the recollection of the recent misfortunes he had experienced from his former endeavors to bring the captain of the packet into the road of salvation was still uppermost in his imagination and he thought it the more prudent step to conceal his disapprobation than venture the loss of his life a second time  they had scarcely fixed the wandering saint in his new situation when his health and success to his mission was proposed by all the company except himself to be drunk in a full bumper to partake of which token of good fellowship he at last consented with evident marks of repugnance  during the time that was spent in persuading the preacher to take off his glass the attorney who sat at his right hand contrived to substitute a large glass of brandy instead of that which had been appropriated to his share which the poor itinerant swallowed completely before he found out his mistake but he had no sooner lodged it in the recesses of his stomach than he made many wry faces and complained bitterly of the imposition but the noise of his remonstrances was soon drowned by his associates who having by this time sacrificed to bacchus with the zeal of true votaries had become halfseasover and so far were they from being disposed to listen to his complaints that they absolutely compelled him to drink glass for glass with this difference that while they were quaffing weak punch the methodists glass was continually strengthened by a large infusion of strong spirits which the conscientious attorney kept by him for that excellent purpose till the blinking of the preachers eyes sufficiently informed the joyous circle that they had overset his understanding or in other words had fairly done his business nay so much had the liquor thrown the good man off his guard that he actually proposed to sing a song which being greedily acceded to by the company he gave them a ditty which he learned in the days of sin ere the potent workings of the spirit had effected his regeneration and the efforts of grace had entirely subdued the old man within him  when he had finished his song he received the applause and thanks of the surrounding group who now determined to crown him like a bacchanal and stripping off his wig they contrived to make a sort of wreath for his head but the poor preacher not used to receive such high tokens of honor sunk under the weight of them in his chair and falling fast asleep lay with his mouth wide open snoring most tremendously he had not enjoyed his slumber above a quarter of an hour when the company were informed the vessel was in sight of liverpool and upon a sailors roaring out that he saw the new lights the sound instantly vibrated in the ears of the drunken methodist who started from his sleep with the phrensy of a madman and reeling about the cabin asked with great vociferation who had any thing to say against the new lights if they had he declared himself ready to defend them against all the arguments that could be brought to their prejudice by any child of satan whatever from martin luther down to father oleary  chapter xxii the packet arrives at liverpool  take a place in the stage for london  description of our fellowtravellers  an accident that happened on the road  we stop at coventry and quit the stage  meet a sailor on his journey from plymouth  when we arrived in the harbor of liverpool my master made what haste he could onshore giving me orders to follow him to the inn with his baggage it was late in the evening when we disembarked and i was preparing to make the most haste i could to obey the lieutenants instructions and thank my stars that had once more brought me on terra firma when a rude fellow saluted me with great incivility and demanded to know where i was going with my trunk i instantly told him if he had a mind to know he must follow me upon which he informed me that such behavior might do in dublin but that he would teach me better manners and immediately seizing my masters trunk forced it from me at the same time honoring me with the familiar appellation of bogtrotting idle scoundrel this last piece of rudeness roused me to a state of desperation and i was preparing to chastise his insolence when a countryman of mine who had overheard the whole business informed me that it was my best way to make it up in the best manner i could for that my opponent was an officer of the port in the execution of his duty i answered if he was performing his duty he should at least do it without insulting his betters betters cried the enraged officer and whose betters do you call yourself you irish son of a whore at the same time assuring the company that i was a notorious smuggler who wanted to run some prohibited goods and offered a bet of a guinea to any of the standersby that my trunk was full of contraband commodities it was in vain that i assured him to the contrary and as i began to find that i had acted wrong in the first instance i wanted to repair it by every submission in my power but i mistook the road to the officers favor for the more i humbled myself the more insolent and insufferable was his behavior and i certainly should have stood for an hour longer arguing with him upon the honesty of my intentions had not my countrymen whispered me in the ear to give him a shilling i instantly took the hint and the moment he felt the splendid coin touch his palm his muscles relaxed into a goodhumoured smile and he told me with a loud laugh that i and my box now might go to hell together  that he had at first taken me for a smuggler but upon a closer acquaintance with me why he had found his mistake and taking me by the hand told me he believed i was a damned honest fellow and that if he knew the house i was going to he would come and drink a pot of beer to our better acquaintance i accepted his offer told him the sign of the inn and taking my trunk upon my shoulder set forward to meet my master who i found had been waiting for me with great impatience having taken a place in the stage for himself which was to set out for london in a few hours and intended that i should ride on the outside  the first thing that occupied the lieutenants attention was to shake off his temporary metamorphosis and once more to appear in his real character which he effected with great expedition and i had the trunk adjusted and packed just time enough for the coach which had drove round to the front door to receive its new tenants  when we came to the machine we found a violent contest for precedence had taken place between an elderly gentlewoman about fifty who measured at least three yards round the waist and a diminutive woman who from the severity of her aspect bore strong credentials of being a neglected virgin however after a number of tossings of the head flirts with the fan and a prodigious interchange of maams and misses it was determined by the master of the coach that the overgrown gentlewoman should have the preference upon the strength of her name being entered first on the books  after them followed my master and the captain of a westindiaman who had just arrived at liverpool with his cargo and was going up to london to the ships owners  while the inside passengers were regulating themselves i mounted the roof of the coach where i was soon joined by a jocose sailor an irish weaver a young woman who was going to town to her friends and an old man who was muffled up close in a frieze great coat  in this manner we set forward and as i felt my situation very precarious i took especial care to grasp fast hold of an iron which is nailed to the top of the machine for the advantage of those persons who prefer the benefit of the prospect to the ease of riding within  we had not proceeded above nine miles when an accident happened that discomposed the economy of the whole stage system for our coachman who wanted to show his dexterity in turning the narrow corner of a village missed his aim most confoundedly and whether it was owing to his want of address in the business or the ungovernable spirit of the horses i will not take upon me to determine but certain it is that he completely overset the machine in the very worst part of the road that it could possibly have happened  the violence of the shock luckily pitched me farther than my messmates for i alighted upon a dunghill without receiving any considerable injury except a slight bruise but fortune was not quite so complaisant to my companions who were plunged deep into a stinking slough that a neighboring farmer had kept time immemorial for the purpose of mixing the manure for his land the sailor and the weaver made shift to disengage themselves from the unsavory lake but it was far otherwise with the poor young woman who had been thrown into the thickest part of the composition where she lay in a miserable condition like an amphibious monster one half of her body being buried in the mud from her head to her hips and the rest kicking in the vacant air tacitly asking the assistance of all welldisposed christians to rescue her from a situation in which if she remained but a few minutes longer all human aid would alas have been ineffectual  as for the old man who had shared the same unhappy destiny he made shift to crawl out more like a rat three parts drowned than a human creature not having the smallest vestige left to ascertain the nature of the animal tribe he belonged to except that he walked erect and made use of two legs instead of four  nor was the consternation within the coach a whit less productive of disasters for the company there had been thrown by the accident all in a heap where they lay intermingled in a rancorous state of enmity and discordance hissing and annoying each other like so many vipers at the bottom of a glass in a chymists shop window  the noise of this sudden catastrophe having reached the people of the village they poured forth in numbers to the assistance of the unfortunate travelers and the first step they took was to open the coachwindow that lay uppermost from which aperture they endeavored to drag out the fat gentlewoman beforementioned by the legs but the poor fellow who was most forward in the service had good reason to repent his zeal in her favor for she not knowing the intention of the visit no sooner felt a man attempt to get hold of those delicate members than she gave him a most villainous kick in the eye which stunned the poor devil so much that he fell senseless to his motherearth but the party being instantly reinforced they renewed the attack and brought out the fusty amazon by main force but not before she had secured the cap and headdress of the lady who remained within with whom it seems she had been maintaining a bloody quarrel but had totally overcome her by dint of personal prowess and brought out these emblems of triumph in her hand which she brandished about to the infinite diversion of the spectators  after an hours industry on the part of the coachman the affairs were tolerably adjusted and the company were once more preparing to enter the vehicle except miss tippet for that i understood to be the ladys name who had been so mauled and defeated withinside the machine  she had determined to return to liverpool where she kept a milleners shop and to bring an action of assault and battery against her opponent whom we now found to be a tallowchandlers widow who was her next door neighbor  after this denunciation of vengeance from the enraged maker of caps we set forward once more and by the time we arrived at coventry from the scene of our disgrace in the interval of which nothing material happened my master was either so sickened with his companions or fatigued with that mode of conveyance that he signified his intention to the coachman of proceeding no farther and after bidding adieu to his fellow sufferers and giving the coachman a shilling to reward him for not quite breaking our necks we took up our quarters at the principal inn in the city at the entrance of which my master perceived an old seaman sitting at the door taking out some tobacco from a leathern pouch as the features of the man were familiar to the lieutenant he asked him where he came from last to which the sailor replied from plymouth and that he was almost foundered on the journey as the voice of distress never touched his ear unnoticed this was the best possible expedient the old tar could have made use of to have his wants supplied for he instantly ordered the weary tarpawling to follow him into the parlour where he made him sit down and partake of those refreshments which he had ordered for his own particular accommodation  chapter xxiii the sailor gives a history of his adventures  the vicissitudes of a seafaring life  an occurrence that proves many accidents happen between the cup and the lip  the spirit of true philosophy to be found in all stations  my master stops in coventry  i obtain leave to see a play  when the spirits and strength of the seaman were recruited by the good cheer he had enjoyed from the lieutenants bounty he gave the following account of himself at his particular instigation  why master says the greyheaded tar as for the matter of that my life is no great things  i have experienced to be sure i suppose like most part of the world sometimes joy and sometimes otherwise  i have been beaten about in many a hard gale of distress and when i thought my hulk was near foundering why a lucky breeze has sprung up and drove me into the port of happiness  as for instance now this morning i was cold hungry and tired and i didnt know where to get a bit of bread in the varsal world that is do you mind me between this and the payoffice for there i hope to get shiners enough and i knew it was no matter to be telling the people of these parts that i was a seaman in distress for they look upon a wornout old sailor as little better than a brute beast  but we cannot expect otherwise for the matter of that for how should they know what belongs either to good manners or humanity when they never were at sea  but we cannot make a silk purse of a sows ear as the saying is so we must take the world as it runs sometimes rough sometimes smooth ebb and flood hey master  but to come to the point i have been to sea man and boy for the last forty years of my life  i cannot say that i entered into the service because why i was pressed onboard a tender as i was going down one morning to carry some victuals to my poor mother who then lay ill and lodged in an alley near wapping but she is dead now and god rest her soul i say  well as i was saying they stowed me in the hold of a tender whence i was put onboard a frigate that lay at the mouth of the river and was under sailing orders to cruise against the spaniards for we were then at war you must know with the mounseers  though i was a little downhearted at first my spirits soon began to revive for my comrades told me that they expected to take some rich prizes and if that was the case why i should make my fortune this was joyful news to me and so far from being backward in the business my heart beat with impatience till an opportunity should offer of our coming to close quarters with the enemy  and we were not long disappointed for the men at the masthead seeing a sail we immediately cleared decks and bore down upon the vessel after a run of two hours we discovered her to be a ship of almost double our force and would have tacked about but as it was impossible to escape her then why we resolved to give her as warm a reception as we were able and damme to it we went ding dong and after a battle of two hours we obliged the enemy to sheer off we should have boarded her indeed but half our crew being killed and the other half desperately wounded we could not muster hands enough to man the longboat so we were forced to relinquish our prize in the moment of victory which was a damned hard case master considering as how she was a spanish galloon deep laden with the riches of peru  our rigging and ship were so tattered with the heavy cannon of the enemy that we were obliged to make the first convenient harbor to refit which we luckily did in a day or two  i forgot to tell you that i received a shot as i was standing at one of the guns which went clean through my shoulder and so i was ordered among the wounded to the hospital where after remaining three months i was pretty well recovered and as soon as i had sufficient strength to do my duty was turned over to a thirdrate which was to compose part of a fleet of observation  i remained onboard six months when we returned to gosport and as our ship was ordered to the east indies i was advised to give a will and power to some friend in the town to receive my wages and prizemoney in case i should be killed in an engagement or die at sea i accordingly followed their advice and left it with my landlord tom handspike who kept a ginshop on portsmouthcommon  when our ship was properly victualled we set sail and after being beat about for upwards of two years we once more paid a visit to old england where i resolved to settle on my arrival for life and with part of my wages to set myself up in trade but here i reckoned without my host for my landlord turned out to be a damned big villain  he had gone to the payoffice hearing that our vessel was daily expected and taking a forged letter to prove that i was killed on the coast of brazil received every penny of my money  i was cursedly dispirited at this accident not knowing where to get sufficient to buy me a dinner when i met with an old shipmate who reading the situation of my affairs in the lines of my face lent me a guinea with which i went and regaled myself and at the same time inquired after an old sweetheart of mine who lived in that neighborhood i soon found her out and renewed our former courtship and we were to have been married shortly after but going one morning to buy the weddingring i was hailed by a pressgang who hurried me away a second time in spite of my protection which i had procured for my security at portsmouth as for complaining i soon found that all was needless so i bent my disposition to my fate as well as i could and we sailed for the west indies where i experienced more hurricanes in half a year than i had before in my long voyage to the indies  a flux and fever breaking out among the crew carried off great numbers and the climate was found at last so destructive and our ships company so much reduced that we were ordered home by the admiral and arrived in a dismal state at spithead where the fever seized me in a most violent manner i lay for six weeks in such a condition that nobody expected me to live but by gods help i recovered at last and had the mortification to find that the expenses of my illness had reduced me to my last guinea and i was the more chagrined as i wanted to buy some clothes to appear as decent as i could as i intended to make the best of my way to london to marry little sall and then to settle for life howsomever i made a shift with the little money i had and the credit i had procured at a slopshop to cut a tolerable figure  when i was completely rigged i set out for wapping but having no shiners left i was obliged to walk the greatest part of the way and arrived there in the evening but burn my old shoes if the neighbors didnt tell me that little sall had married a journeymantailor the week before i own i was grieved to the soul at finding her falsehearted but nevertheless i plucked up a good heart damme we should always have a good heart you know master let things go as they may and resolved never to think of matrimony again  no more i have master for from that hour to this i have been tossed about upon the wide seas which boisterous as they are i sometimes think more constant than a womans mind  as i now thought of nothing else than passing a sailors life why i have roamed about the world in all quarters sometimes onboard a merchantman and sometimes fighting for my country and what man master would not like to fight for his country if so be as how he could get any thanks for it when he is done  here am i just relieved from a french prison where i was kept on a damned short allowance for nine long months till i was exchanged and brought to plymouth from which place i have now been traveling in hopes of getting my wages in london  to be sure i have encountered some cursed hard rubs in the way but what of that every thing must have an end you know master it will be all the same a hundred years hence it is a long lane that has no turning  why lord help your honor i knew you were a seaman when i first clapped my two looking eyes upon you  there is a certain generosity in the face of an honest tar which is not to be found in the rest of mankind  damme they are all so envious of each other that their passions destroy their feelings and they have no more notion of assisting a fellow creature than an attorney egad has of going to heaven  here the seaman having finished the account of his life my master gave him a guinea to drink the kings health which the other accepted with warm tokens of gratitude and took his leave  the lieutenant expressing a strong curiosity to see the town the master of the inn offered to accompany him which proposal he readily embraced and out they sallied for that purpose having first given me permission to make what use of my time i thought proper till his return  as i was sauntering along the street i saw a crowd gathered about a man with a drum who was holding forth to the multitude which surrounded him with their mouths wide open as curiosity was ever one of my strongest passions i made what haste i could to learn the propensity of his eloquence when i came to the spot he immediately sent a child to me with a playbill which announced the performance of the evening to be hamlet prince of denmark as i had always a natural love for poetry of every denomination i determined not to let slip so favorable an opportunity of indulging that inclination especially as i had previously obtained my masters leave to make use of my time in any way most agreeable to myself  chapter xxiv i go to a tragedy  a great nose more honored in a strolling company than great abilities  evil consequence of illiterate critics  the ghost proves his materiality  a family quarrel  the melancholy issue of public disputes  accordingly i suffered myself to be carried away by the invitation of the dramatic herald and inquiring for the gallery entered the theater along with many others brimful of eager expectation to see the performance the theater was constructed with great ingenuity out of an old stable and the only distinction made between the different places of boxes pit and galleries was by means of a board nailed across  as the audience which was composed of a motley assemblage of different characters and ages became riotous an old man with one eye came into the orchestra which was made out of a large box with the lid taken off after he had bowed respectfully to the company he pulled from under his coat the instrument of harmony and played with excellent discretion the wellknown and celebrated tune of buttered peace but the audience growing particularly clamorous for roast beef this halfsighted musician complied with their request  from his appearance and execution he called strongly to my mind the old gentleman whom i have formerly mentioned as the orpheus that moved the bear to dance a fandango when i had the honor of being first introduced behind the scenes of a traveling company in ireland  but the bell ringing from within indicated to the company that the play was going to begin and agreeably to the summons the curtain was drawn and discovered francisco and bernardo in close conversation it was soon noticed by the noisy part of the audience that bernardos nose was of an uncommon size and indeed it resembled more a protuberance of mulberries which hung in rich clusters than a human feature i soon found that this gentleman was the most conspicuous personage of the drama for he received more distinction on account of that amazing ornament than all the rest of the actors put together  when the ghost made his appearance it had a visible effect on the majority of my neighbors in the gallery some of whom were almost petrified with awe at the dreadful solemnity of the object but as our admiration is built upon comparison of one thing with another so did the ghastly appearance of the royal dane operate to make the succeeding scene more captivating  the reader will easily conceive that i can mean no other than the brilliant court of denmark which burst upon our sight with as much grandeur as the wardrobe could furnish assisted by all the credit that the company could procure in the town for tinsel tiewigs clean linen and potlids  as soon as young hamlet came forward all eyes were centered upon him for he had long been considered as the roscius of warwickshire i observed he made three solemn strides then enfolded his arms and stood still for which uncommon excellence he received the loud applause of the audience  i was going to inquire of a person who sat next me into the reason of their applauding him so much above the rest when my notice was riveted upon a comical fellow who sat near me roaring out here comes nosey which appellation i soon found to belong to my friend polonius who was the identical being that had five minutes before personated bernardo with so much honor  the unexpected salute of my friend in the gallery so discomposed the muscles of the whole court of copenhagen that in spite of their best efforts to appear grave a simper became universal and it was some time before her danish majesty could recover herself sufficiently to reprove the young prince for his unseemly melancholy however every thing went on very smoothly until hamlet began his first soliloquy but he had scarce uttered his wish that his too too solid flesh would melt than a countryman who sat in the pit bawled out noa noa friend you neednt wish any more of thy flesh to melt why mon youre as thin as a whippingpost already and indeed though the observation was rather malapropos in point of time it was strictly justifiable on the score of truth for the poor fellow who played the character had not flesh enough upon his whole carcass to give a cat a breakfast however this interruption was warmly resented by the friends of the performer and a battle would have taken place in the pit had it not been for the interposition of the manager who had condescended to perform the king himself he came round from the stage among the combatants and whether it was by the persuasion of his tongue or the influence of his dignity i will not determine but he certainly restored peace to the theater and the players were ordered to proceed  every thing now went on in the proper routine of business except in the scene between laertes and ophelia when it was very palpable that the young lady had been imprudent enough to drink too much that afternoon indeed she had hurt her memory so much by the sacrifices she had been making to bacchus that she scarcely remembered a single word of her part and in one particular passage when the prompter neglected to assist the fallibility of her memory she forgot her dignity so far as to damn him for a lazy son of a b  h however the indecorum was committed by a lady and consequently permitted to pass without censure  but shortly she was relieved from that temporary embarrassment by the entrance of old polonius the purple majesty of whose nose was a neverfailing source of mirth whenever he came forward three times did he attempt to give the celebrated instructions to his son laertes and was as often obliged to desist from the roars of laughter that issued whenever he opened his mouth at last they were fairly obliged to conclude the scene without it and poor laertes was dismissed to france without the benefit of those solid apophthegms of wisdom and experience  at the commencement of the second act attention seemed to have resumed her throne and every thing jogged on tolerably quiet till the closetscene between hamlet and his mother when the ghost made his enter with prodigious majesty i should have before observed that the wardrobe of this company being rather scanty it was absolutely necessary to make a coat of mail for the spirit in question there being no suit in their cabinet of wearables to effect this in a hurry they were obliged to sew a few pieces of pasteboard together which when covered with old playbills made a very tolerable succedaneum for the want of something more resembling the supposed habit of the departed dane and indeed considering everything the poor ghost acquitted himself tolerably well until the moment he was preparing to take his leave when unluckily in facing about to the queen to enforce the directions to the young prince to persevere in his conduct toward his mother he was under the necessity of standing with his breech to the audience now the point of good manners which might have been invaded by this maneuver would have been overlooked with great good humor but the infringement on decency that it occasioned could not for it must be observed that the ghastly shade wore a black pair of breeches under his coat of mail which were rendered something the worse by the depredations of time indeed so much so that between the legs there was a rent of most capacious magnitude out of which a remnant of the spirits shirt hung in a most ungraceful manner  this breach in the galligaskins of the ghost was no sooner perceived by the motley audience than an universal uproar ensued accompanied by incessant roars of laughter  the poor fellow felt himself embarrassed and finding that his person was the center of the joke turned himself to the right and to the left but without the desired effect at last mustering up an unusual degree of courage he stepped forward and attempted to address the audience but was most violently repelled with groans and hisses at length finding all his endeavors ineffectual to learn the state of their wishes he was preparing to walk off but had not got above a yard from the sidescene when an unlucky spark who occupied one of the sideboxes set a large pointer which he had with him at the miserable remains of departed majesty whom he caught hold of just as he was slipping off the stage by the shirt which hung out behind and which he shook to the unspeakable diversion of the company fairly dragging the unfortunate spirit to the center of the stage before he quitted his hold irritated to a degree of madness at this insult to his dignity which was more than flesh and blood could endure and eager for revenge he tore off his paper armor in a twinkling which indeed was tantamount to his stripping in buff for the little shirt that he had left and which composed the whole stock of linen that belonged to this calamitous son of thespis had been completely torn away by the fangs of the animal that had annoyed him and coming to the point of the stage offered to box the best man in the company for a gallon of beer but the ghosts challenge not being readily accepted he misinterpreted their forbearance into a spirit of cowardice in the audience and began to abuse them in terms which sufficiently proved that his godfathers and godmothers had completely taught him the vulgar tongue in the most extensive sense of the phrase  before he had proceeded far in his passionate address to the spectators he was stopped by a domestic enemy who by her great zeal in endeavoring to regulate his behavior put a period to the dramatic entertainments of the evening this heroine was no other than the unfortunate ghosts wife who personated her majesty of denmark for that night and hearing of the misbehaviour of her spouse hurried to the scene of action with a full determination to punish her yoke fellow for this breach of decency which she wisely apprehended would be the ruin of her benefit which was to have taken place the next evening the furious lady totally regardless of the dignity of the character she had assumed in the play rushes on her illfated husband and by a welldirected blow which unhappily alighting on his eye levelled the vaunting spirit with the stage but though it was evident that the salutation had disconcerted it by no means subdued him for springing immediately from the boards with great facility he returned the compliment with such address as made the blood royal of denmark flow most copiously through the apertures of her majestys nose now the audience beginning to interfere warmly in the dispute leaped upon the stage and dividing into different factions each supported the object they thought most aggrieved but the majority turning eventually in favor of the lady she gave her miserable husband such a drubbing as almost deprived him of existence for he lay extended upon the scene of action sightless and forlorn like one who was shortly to pay a long visit to the stygian shore  but it was ordered by the inflexible destinies that the perils of that evening should not end here for while the amazonian queen was panting with her victories and receiving the applause of her surrounding admirers the manager of the company entered with two constables and charged her majesty with a breach of the peace and instantly ordered her to the countyjail to remain there until time chance or circumstance should enable her to satisfy him for the robes of royalty she had utterly destroyed in the engagement and other properties which he estimated at a very considerable amount  it was at this instant that the misguided heroine began to perceive that she had been acting a very unprofitable part  it was in vain for her to hope for relief for those very persons who had been most instrumental in extolling her prowess as a bruiser were now most forward in ridiculing her distresses  as the husband in the awful eye of the law is considered as forming a material part of his wife the wretched ghost was lifted from the ground to accompany his lady to prison as being responsible for her errors to which place they were conveyed amid the shouts of an unfeeling multitude who inevitably desert the objects that have delighted them when their power to amuse exists no more  the poor queen as she was hurried away turned about and surveyed the scene of slaughter with such a piteous look as brought the following lines to my recollection the tempest over and the wild waves allayed the calm sea wonders at the wrecks it made   chapter xxv we arrive at the metropolis  i am discharged from the lieutenants service  accosted in the street by a singular character  dine at a flying ordinary  account of my new companion  when this theatric feud had subsided i returned home and found my master had retired to bed and left orders for me to be up early in the morning as he intended to set out for london by break of day i obeyed his directions and about five oclock the next day he hired a postchaise into which he took me as a companion and we set forward for the metropolis where we arrived the same night after a journey of twelve hours in the prosecution of which nothing unaccountable happened  we took up our first nights lodging at the inn where we were conducted by the boy who drove us and i was awakened the next morning by a confusion of voices in the street that in my opinion put all comparison at defiance i lay for some time endeavoring to make out the sense of their cries but that i found totally impossible as every syllable they delivered was to me as unintelligible as if they had been spoken in hebrew  but if my wonder was moved by the strange voices i heard how much more was it excited when i got up by the astonishing objects that i saw  at first sight the whole world seemed to me to be concentered in that amazing city for in no other manner could i account for the prodigious hurry of business that was evidently carrying on in all corners of the town and the swarms of people that crowded upon each other in succession  the more i contemplated that vast theater of regular confusion the more was i inclined to liken it to an extensive beehive into which the industrious members brought their honey for the advantage of the commonwealth  the second morning that i had passed at the inn my master called me into the parlour and gave me to understand that his private affairs would oblige him to go to chatham the next day and as he was not quite certain of the time that he might return he advised me to look about for another service at the same time paying me my wages up to that month and making me a present of a handsome compliment over and above the amount as a small reward as he expressed it for my good behavior in his service and to prove that even in the smallest particulars he was not unmindful of my welfare he accompanied his favors with a letter of recommendation to a relation of his who lived in one of the new streets in westminster that in case he was delayed in the country by accident or otherwise i might not want a friend to give me a good character  at this last instance of his attention i could not avoid bursting into tears and i even offered to serve him for nothing rather than be separated from a master to whose interest i was so firmly attached by the strongest ties of duty and affection but as my application on this head was fruitless i was obliged to wander forth in search of a new employment with a narrow purse and a melancholy heart  after walking up and down the streets of the metropolis for some hours i found myself in the neighborhood of a place which on inquiry i learned to be the seven dials as my curiosity had been highly gratified by the numerous novelties that had presented themselves to my observation in the perambulations of the morning i began to think of indulging another foolish propensity which was briefly that of eating for i found that a rebellion was forming in my intestines and which if not speedily overcome would endanger the state or in other words i should be confoundedly sick  as i stood gaping about to find out a proper place to satisfy that irresistible demon called hunger i was accosted very civilly by a person who from his appearance altogether struck me as an oddity  his dress consisted of a frock that still bore the remnants of finery but appeared to have been originally made for the accommodation of another person a dirty silk waistcoat with some tarnished lace a pair of buckskin breeches and boots his hair which was rather scanty and as gray as my grandmothers was twisted and turned up behind under a round hat the brims of which seemed to have been narrowed by the niggard hand of economy for the laudable purpose of making it retain its black edge as long as possible as he stood with his back toward me at first sight i guessed him to be a smart young buck about twenty years of age but when he faced about to enter into conversation i perceived him to be verging on the borders of fifty and that all his smiles and complaisance of which he possessed a great store had not been able to defend him against the inroads of time for the different muscles of his visage were harrowed deep with the fell lines of care which intersected each other at right angles  the polite address of this civil original at once surprised and pleased me for upon my informing him that i was a stranger and wanted to know a proper place to eat in he eagerly caught hold of my hand and exclaimed with a laugh curse me but that is lucky for us both for i have been meditating upon the same thing this half hour at the same time advising me to follow him but we had not proceeded many paces when he suddenly turned about and inquired with great earnestness if the captain was strong as i did not understand the nature of his question i stared at him with a little surprise when he told me with a smile that he only wished to know how i stood for cash i immediately pulled out the sum total of my wages upon eyeing which he exclaimed with the most lively transports oh damme you are strong  you can afford to dine like an alderman i see  come with me and i will introduce you to a house in the next street where you shall eat like a prince and associate with none but gentlemen  i would have answered this rapid address being fearful that he meant to bring me into too much expense but he did not give me that opportunity for darting along with the celerity of an arrow from a bow he beckoned me to follow him and in a few minutes we arrived at a house where beef mutton and veal decorated the outside of the windows and from the door of which issued such savoury steams as made me anticipate in thought the delicious joints that waited our disposal within  upon our entering this receptacle of the hungry we were immediately ushered into a back room in the center of which was a large round wooden table and on its confines sat a number of persons of all ages countries and complexions we had scarcely saluted the company when a dozen tongues bellowed forth at once how are you count and i should have been at a loss to know the person to whom so dignified a title was addressed in such a place if i had not seen my companion acknowledge himself as the person alluded to by various significant bows and grins which he exercised toward his inquiring friends in a manner perfectly peculiar to himself and unlike the rest of mankind  as by this time our quota of beef was placed before us with all the appendages of salt mustard etc my friend advised me to fall to and follow his example but i not doubting in the least that i had got into the society of some nobleman in disguise was in a manner petrified with fear and sat aukwardly first surveying my plate and then my companion my apprehensions having quite taken away my appetite for fear i should be guilty of some impropriety before so respectable a personage but it was far otherwise with my associate for though he had been accommodated with a plate of much greater magnitude than mine and sat in a manner absolutely entrenched behind beef and cabbage yet wonderful to tell in the course of five or six minutes he made shift to demolish the whole with the most perfect ease and composure and afterward called for a slice of pudding which he dispatched with the same facility then taking up his hat he winked to the company and pulling me on one side whispered that he was going into the next square where an aunt of his lived who by the by would leave him more thousands than he had fingers and that he should return immediately but in case that he met with a certain nobleman whom he expected to see and should be detained longer than ordinary advised me to be under no sort of apprehension on that account as he made it a point to dine at that house whenever he was disengaged from the beau monde  though i could not well understand the nature of such an apology from a man of his seeming importance to an humble being like me yet i made one of my best bows and told him i should always think myself honored to be blessed with his society he appeared to take this declaration in good part and squeezing my hand wished the company a good day and instantly vanished from our sight  he was scarcely out of the house when i had the mortification to hear a thousand remarks made upon my friend the count one observed at the same time looking at me with a significant leer that the count was at home  aye damme says a second tell me did you ever know him out of his way  no replies a third unless he stumbles upon a sheriffs officer  what has he a dislike to the servants of justice says a fourth  not absolutely so rejoins a fifth it is only a sort of natural antipathy peculiar to that nobleman  every man has his objects of aversion and it is well known the counts dislike is chiefly levelled at tailors attorneys and bumbailiffs  though i did not clearly comprehend the meaning of all their discourse yet i understood sufficiently to inform myself that some of their expressions were not quite so respectful as i thought a gentleman of his amiable manners was entitled to and i was actually preparing to leave the room when one of the persons who sat opposite to me asked with great seeming concern how long i had had the honor of being enrolled among the counts friends upon which i related the adventure of our meeting in the next street and the kind method that he had taken to show me a house of entertainment to satisfy the cravings of my stomach  aye aye replies the person who questioned me the count it must be allowed is a very civil gentleman but he generally thinks fit to confine this essential part of his good breeding to strangers  and foreigners you will allow cries another  yes rejoins the person who spoke first but that gentleman is no foreigner  done for a guinea he is replies the other  done says his antagonist and immediately addressing himself to me with great earnestness asked with many apologies for his impertinence where i was born i told him without hesitation in ireland  there damme gentlemen roars the person who proposed the wager i knew i was right by g  d  right says the other how can that be  we all know that ireland is but an extraneous part of england  is not it sir says he looking me full in the face  yes sir replied i half dead with confusion  upon which there was a general roar of applause and each of the opponents taking me by the hand which they shook with great violence in token of their approbation declared that i was a damned honest fellow and they should be proud to be better known to me i received this condescension in good part and made them a low bow  here the discourse took another turn in pursuing which they handled the character of the count with so little mercy that i began to entertain some doubts of his quality  but all these ideas which i began to form to his disadvantage vanished at the approach of the lady of the house who informed me that i owed her fivepence for my eatables and eightpence for the counts when i pulled out my scanty pittance and discharged the reckoning happy in having an opportunity of dining with a person of such distinction at so cheap a rate for as i heard the landlady mention his title i had no longer any mistrust relative to his character in life and assuming a little effrontery i asked the gentleman who sat next me if the count was a man of fortune  oh prodigious answered the other  his estate is in england i presume sir says i  no says a queerlooking old man whom i had not noticed before it is neither here nor there friend i was calling all my geographical learning to my aid to find out that country when another observed that to his certain knowledge he was in possession of some of the finest lands in all sclavonia  oh then i suppose he is a german nobleman replied i  he is says the other and one of the most ancient in the whole circle of the empire  upon which i got up took my hat and saluted the company which mark of respect on my part they all returned with tenfold interest and then i issued forth from the house highly gratified at the honor of so distinguished an acquaintance which i resolved to cultivate with all the address in my power  chapter xxvi a grain of prudence more profitable than a pound of vanity  the curiosity of the public is no proof of their sagacity  popular rage more dreadful than the sting of the law  a great man in distress  my reason blinded by my ambition  our reception at a porterhouse  elated with my success and prodigiously vain of those abilities which had been the primary cause as i imagined of attaching so great a man to my interest i began to form a thousand schemes for the improvement of my fortune and could not help reviving the memory of my poor father and mother who had taken such care of my education that should any of the counts friends think proper to employ me in the capacity of a steward or otherwise i was entirely fit for their service  i had strolled through several streets so absolutely wrapped up in my my reflections on my future greatness that i scarce heeded or knew where or on what purpose i was going till i came to the corner of a lane when an accident happened that broke asunder the texture of my reveries  i was walking along with my arms enfolded in each other and my head reclining on my breast in deep contemplation when i received a blow from the end of a ladder which two men were bringing round the corner that not only stunned and deprived me in an instant of all powers of sensation but by the force of the blow drove me backwards at least ten paces when i unluckily staggered against a tub that stood at the edge of the cellar of a public house where some draymen were starting porter which giving way accompanied me in the fall which was at least six feet perpendicular and i fell plump into an empty butt which stood ready to be drawn up  the noise which the tub and i had occasioned in our descent drew together all the people out of the alehouse to explore the cause when lo poor tony was discovered lying motionless at the bottom of the vessel every means was immediately put in practice to relieve me from so uncomfortable a situation and having dragged me up the stairs once more into the regions of day they brought me into the middle of the taproom where a barber who was present undertook to bleed me while another poured a glass of brandyhot down my throat in order to restore me to my strength and spirits  whether it was owing to the operations of nature or the beneficial effects of the prescriptions of my physicians that i recovered remains to this hour undetermined but certain it is that my spirits were reestablished and i was again enabled to pursue those avocations in life which were eventually to lead me into the temple of fortune  as i walked along the pain in my head which my late disaster had occasioned in a great measure reduced that felicity i should otherwise have enjoyed in consequence of the pleasurable notions i had conjured up in my brain since my rencounter with the sclavonian beau  but i hardly knew to what point of the compass i was steering when i arrived at a large stone gate through which an immense number of coaches and carts were passing without intermission and my ears were dinned with a continual noise and uproar made up of the bawling of dustmen the rattling of carriages and the oaths and execrations of coachmen and carmen contending for priority of place with as much vehemence and bitterness as if the contest was the most important circumstance of their lives  as i stood contemplating that scene of blasphemy i was surrounded by a number of idle people who were listening to the strains of a balladsinger the tenor of whose song i perceived administered great pleasure to the auditory around her i had scarcely been attentive above two minutes before i heard sufficient to make me blush from ear to ear with confusion and skulking unperceived from the crowd i made the best of my way down the street lamenting the defects of a police that permitted such public incitements to debauchery wounding the morals of the rising generation and annoying the ears of modesty to be sung about the greatest avenues of the capital with impunity  full of these reflections for the public good i strayed along the path till my progress was interrupted by a collection of men women and children who were gaping with their mouths wide open at a wonderful piece of mechanism affixed against a church where two automaton figures they informed me would strike the quarters i was wonderfully incited to be present at the operation and placing myself in the center just opposite the scene of action waited for the accomplishment of my desires with the most ardent curiosity but ere that event took place the whole assembly was thrown into confusion by the detection of a pickpocket who had been making somewhat too free with the purse of a lady that formed a part of the inquisitive group  when the culprit was brought forward his appearance was altogether such as struck me with astonishment for conceive what my surprise must be who had always thought that a thief bore his credentials to roguery in his forehead to behold a slim young man dressed at all points in the utmost extravagance of the fashion and who protested his innocence in terms of the most elegant language handled by a merciless mob as one of the fraternity of the lowest order of human villains nay i was in my own mind so perfectly convinced of the falsehood of the charge that i felt myself frequently impelled to step forward in his defense and i actually should have done so if a very respectable gentleman had not declared that he was the most notorious pickpocket about town  as i was eager to be present at the punishment of a delinquent whom the laws of the land seem tacitly to exclude from their protection i followed the tattered cavalcade who proceeded with their prisoner close guarded to the waterside where after taking him to some neighboring barges that were laden with coals they plunged him unrestrained by a single emotion of pity into the sable stream where he was forced to remain for upwards of twenty minutes floundering for his life amidst a congregation of filth disembogued from all corners of the metropolis and interlarded with dead cats drowned puppies stinking fish and other offensive matter more abhorrent to the sense of smelling than all the essence of pandoras cabinet when he had undergone a sufficient share of punishment for his malpractices a tenderhearted waterman touched with a generous sense of human woe took the poor devil into his boat and rowed away with the fallen understrapper of mercury amid the discordant groans of the million that crowded the shores of old thames  as the evening was now approaching very fast i thought it prudent to make the best of my way back to the inn being a stranger in town and not knowing where to procure a lodging immediately i was on my way thither resolving to get up early the next morning to deliver my letter to my late masters friend in westminster and afterward to meet the count agreeable to appointment at the eatinghouse near the seven dials  but luckily as i came to the foot of blackfriers bridge i met my noble acquaintance once more the rencounter happened as follows  i saw a mob of people collecting very fast at a little distance from the place i was passing and hearing some very high words pass i walked up to inquire into the cause when i beheld a woman of a very vulgar appearance who had fastened one hand in the collar of a gentleman whom she was dragging along the pavement while with the other she was threatening to knock him down if he made the least resistance and he in the most piteous manner was entreating the crowd to take his part  i was pushing the people on one side to inquire more fully into the matter when i beheld to my utter grief and surprise that the unfortunate hero was no other than the very individual count who had behaved with such politeness to me in the preceding part of the day i was so enraged to see the only gentleman i had met with since my landing in england who in my opinion possessed either tenderness or urbanity treated in such a rude manner that i instantaneously lifted up my stick to strike the furious amazon to the earth in order to liberate my friend but i presently found my arms were pinioned behind me by the mob who reprobated my conduct for endeavoring to rescue a man who had refused to pay his lawful debts this charge made me fire with such rage that i could not avoid telling the fellow who advanced it that it was a lie for the gentleman was my friend and not only a man of honor but likewise of great fortune this last expression roused the attention of the woman who had him in custody and she instantly retorted he a man of fortune  he be damned a poor halfstarved wouldbe gentleman  the devil take such mungrels i say  why dont he pay me my bill  answer me that  and so he will i am sure replied i if your demand is a just one  just says the furious gentlewoman and who are you pray that take upon you to dispute the justice of the matter i should be glad to know  will you pay his bill for him  aye my dear friend do said the count and i shall be for ever devoted to your service  it is but a trifle only nine shillings and seven pence upon my soul  yes says his persecutress and it has been due these nine months for my hard labor  here the count desired to speak to me and whispered in my ear that it was a trifling bill for washing which he had incurred just before his last remittance from abroad and that ever since it had slipped his memory but he requested me for the love of god to pay the money if i had it about me and not let him suffer such a public disgrace any longer  i felt my bowels of compassion incline very much to serve the disastrous nobleman and involuntarily pulled out all the cash i had left except one guinea which i had formerly sewed up in the waistband of my breeches to stand my friend in case of any sudden emergency when the scarletfaced laundress saw me pull out my money in obedience to the counts entreaties she quitted her prey and i paid her the amount of her bill when she had fingered the cash after looking in my face with a significant eye she burst into a loud laugh and taking her leave wished me joy of my new acquaintance  as this disagreeable business was now settled and the count emancipated from his fears we thought of retiring to some house in the neighborhood to settle the plan of operations for the ensuing day  i was looking about me in search of a beerdrinking caravansera when my facetious associate taking me under the arm informed me that he would conduct me to a house not very far from us where the porter was good and the company excellent  as we proceeded along i ventured to make my companion acquainted with the reduced state of my finances and the little hope i had of recruiting it until i should get into some service at the word service the count stared and said he conceived it impossible that a person of my accomplishments could think of subjecting himself to the whims and caprice of the first prince in christendom besides added he your education i perceive is liberal your manners polite and your person irresistible  damme adds the count putting a glass to his eye and surveying me from head to foot if i ever saw a prettier tighter lighter more genteel bit of humanity in the three kingdoms  oh zounds continues he you must put the notion of servitude entirely out of your head unless it is that of the ladies  why man says he i will introduce you to a circle of the firstrate toasts in the capital all prodigious fortunes and there is no doubt but you may marry the first woman you take a liking to  though i was charmed to ecstasy with the counts extravagant flattery of my person and mental endowments of which i conceived no very contemptible idea myself yet i could not resist pointing out to my companion some small impediments which i imagined fate would throw in my way to bar the progress of my good fortune namely that of proper clothes to appear in but i had scarcely hinted my doubts when he kindly informed me that his wardrobe was entirely at my service where i might pick and choose out of all the colors of the rainbow at the same time asking me what color i thought most advantageous to my complexion and upon my answering i thought blue was as becoming as any he told me with a face of deep concern that he was cursedly mortified that the blue could not be had for he had given it away but the morning before to a halfpay lieutenant with a wife and seven children  oh my dear sir rejoined i dont trouble yourself the scarlet will do very well  the scarlet you said says the count  yes i replied if it was agreeable to him  why my dear friend rejoins the beau it is perfectly agreeable but damn it at present it is totally impossible for i lent that very coat last week to a gentleman of my acquaintance to go to the opera his own tailor you must know having disappointed him though the scoundrel knew he was to be introduced that evening to a young beauty from devonshire with a fortune of thirty thousand pounds  well well sir the first that comes to hand then will satisfy me added i  will it  damme now but that is kind says the count squeezing my hand this is behaving like a true friend you shall certainly be welcome to the first fuit that comes to my hands i assure you  the repeated excuses of my companion added to a certain shabbiness of attire awakened some doubts in my mind relative to his quality which i could not entirely stifle notwithstanding his apparent goodbreeding and superabundant complaisance but as my knowledge of the world was as yet very limited and foolishly imagining that the language of the tongue could be coined in no other mint but the heart i did not know but the counts attachment to old clothes was somewhat like mine to an old friend because he could put them on and off without much ceremony however coming at last to the corner of a narrow court badly paved and offensively dirty we turned up it and entered a public house by a descent of three steps from the street here i found likewise that my friend to borrow a phrase of his own was perfectly at home for the whole congregation recognizing his person immediately saluted him by the familiar appellation of count how are you i must own that the unbridled familiarity of such a vulgar group toward a person of his rank in life gave an additional wound to my faith relative to his quality and importance and i resolved to seize the first opportunity of satisfying my scruples upon that head  chapter xxvii a proof of the ease with which great men can reconcile themselves to low company  the pleasures of conviviality  my apprehensions of sleeping in the street removed by the counts friendship  amused with a tale of a tub  find myself made an egregious ass  by the smiles of the landlady toward my companion i perceived that he was no less than a warm favorite in her eye for she came out of the bar in which she had hitherto been engaged accommodating a tailors lady with a pint of geneva and ushered us into a back room the door of which was scarcely opened when there issued forth such abundant volumes of smoke as could hardly be surpassed in the avenues of the infernal regions  when we had taken our seats in this den of oblivion for the appellation of room it certainly did not deserve the clouds began to dissipate that had made every object in the room impervious to my view and i found myself flanked on each side with a society of mirthinspiring mortals who by the trifling assistance of a pipe and a song seemed to have totally excluded care from their magic cavern after i was formally introduced to the society by my friend as an honest fellow and a bon vivant we took our seats round the table of anacreon and the president of the evening commanded silence for a favorite catch which was delivered in high style by three of the members after this followed a sentiment which as it savoured infinitely more of wit than decency i shall forbear to repeat  when it came to the counts turn to sing he instantly gave them the wellknown ditty of death and the lady in character and interlarded it with such inimitable strokes of comic humor and expression of countenance as made me well nigh burst with laughter at the conclusion of this effort of the counts the whole circle congratulated him upon the extensiveness of his risible powers  now it came to my turn to make an offering at the shrine of comus and i was requested by the president in the name of the company to favor them with a song i made every apology to excuse the performance which my ingenuity could suggest but found myself so hard pressed by the entreaties of my companions that i must have complied if a goodnatured young man who sat at my left hand and who perceived the embarrassment the request had thrown me into had not voluntarily offered with my permission to become my substitute as this proposal was backed by a few welltimed observations by the count i was excused and the business of the evening went forward as usual  when it grew late and the company began to drop off one by one i communicated to my boon associate the necessity i was under of going to bed and likewise told him of the engagement i had to fulfill the next day but he comforted me by the assurance that he would take care and find me a proper nights lodging with this declaration i remained satisfied as i was convinced that he must know the town much better than i possibly could who had scarcely breathed in it above twentyfour hours  as the bowl of punch over which we held this argument was now demolished it was proposed to fill another to which i offered some slight objections that were instantly overruled by the count who wholly regardless of my remarks ordered it to be replenished and then whispering in my ear informed me that he would introduce me to the friendship of the young fellow who kindly sang in my room who he assured me was a person well worth my acquaintance and who would prove of great service to me in the pursuits which he intended i should follow as soon as i had received a little of the polish necessary to cut any thing like a capital figure in life i thanked him for this new instance of his regard and agreeably to his word he recommended me in the most forcible manner to the protection of his friend having previously whispered him as i supposed to excuse the bashfulness of my demeanor  were i to set down one half of the compliments which were paid to the graces of my person by the count and my new ally during the demolition of the punch you would naturally imagine that i was the vainest of all human beings for while one was praising the ringlets of hair that flowed loosely down my back the other discovered that i had the bestturned ancle and the neatest leg he ever saw observations to which i gave full credit as i really had some cause to value myself upon the symmetry of my limbs and so much was i bewildered by the excessive incense of their flattery that i did not perceive what was going forward till the landlady had absolutely made another bowl and placed it on the table before us now the apprehensions for my health overcame every other consideration for not being accustomed to keep such late hours and besides finding that the fumes of the liquor had mounted into my upper story or in other words that my brain was affected i made a motion for departing but this the count absolutely forbade and painted the dangers so forcibly which a stranger to the manners of the town had to expect from walking at such a late hour of the night alone that i trembled in idea and began to use every persuasion to induce him to accompany me which at last he promised to comply with as soon as he had demolished the liquor which so invitingly courted his embraces  here the count took an opportunity of informing our common friend to what purpose he meant to dedicate my personal accomplishments which was no other than to have me introduced to the notice of some ladies of fortune and distinction of his acquaintance and by the aid of a little maneuvering enforced by the beauties of my person to snap up some young tit of quality whose fortune would make me independent for life i was so elated with this uncommon zeal of the count for my happiness that my eyes swam with tears of gratitude and joy  i thanked him in the most extravagant and lively terms of language promising to obey his directions in every particular of my life and would have prostrated myself at his feet and called upon heaven to reward his friendly heart had he not absolutely insisted upon the contrary  now the watchman giving us notice that it was between two and three oclock in the morning it was judged expedient to pay our reckoning and depart in peace and upon the landladys approach with her bill i told her we would settle as soon as our companion returned for upon our mentioning the word payment i had observed he took his hat and slipped out of the room here she thought proper to set me right by assuring me that the gentleman we alluded to had been gone home above these ten minutes and probably that she might not set eyes upon him for three months to come and if she never did again she should not break her heart upon receiving this unwelcome intelligence i asked who was to pay his part to which she replied that was a matter we should have settled among ourselves before he thought proper to decamp  that she should look to me for the money which i must pay her immediately for she had a heavy bill to make up for her distiller whom she expected to call the next day and could not afford to lose her moderate profits in compliment to any vagabond upon earth  finding no resource left but by paying the money i asked for her bill which amounting to six shillings and ninepence more than i had in my pocket i turned about to consult the count what measure we must follow in this miserable dilemma when to my utter astonishment i found he was gone also however imagining that he would shortly return i sat in the utmost impatience meaning that he should pass his word with the woman of the house for the remainder but having sat a considerable time and no count appearing i told the woman that i had not money sufficient to discharge the bill totally but that i would give her what i had and that my friend should be answerable for the remainder  what friend pray says the lady of the bar  the count answered i  the count replied she in accents of disdain yes yes he is a pretty fellow indeed to pass his word  why my good friend i dont know whether youre serious or not but give me leave to tell you that i would not take his word no nor his oath neither for six farthings much less for six shillings  here my choler rose to hear my friends character so villanously traduced and assuming all the importance i was able i told her she ought to be ashamed of mentioning the name of so accomplished a gentleman with disrespect  a gentleman indeed replied the angry hostess a rascal you mean  why he is as poor as a halfpay officer and does not eat a dinner above three times a week and that is at the expense of some credulous fool or another  at this relation of the landladys the blood forsook my cheeks and an universal panic seized my whole frame for comparing the positiveness of her assertions with the apparent poverty of my companion and the shabbiness of his habiliments i could not help giving full credit to her tale though it was at the expense of my discernment as a man and my dearest hopes for ever the woman perceiving my situation and the callow innocence of my mind offered to take what money i had about me and a pledge for the remainder until it should be convenient for me to call to discharge the whole i was happy to comply even with this accommodation of the matter and after giving her all my cash and depositing my silver shoebuckles for the rest i took my leave and wandered forth in the streets of an unbounded and flagitious metropolis to whose customs i was almost an entire stranger at the dismal hour of three in the morning without a penny in my pocket or a friend to direct my steps and continually ruminating on the complicated vices of mankind which i found were hourly spread to delude the unthinking and unwary  chapter xxviii i go to the assistance of a woman in distress  pay an unseasonable visit to the roundhouse  almost frightened to death with the apprehensions of being hanged  another rencounter  am carried before a justice and relieved from my troubles  apostrophe on my last guinea  as i went along musing on the iniquities of the world my ears were assailed with the cries of a female i no sooner heard the voice of distress than my feelings took the alarm being always eager to remove the sorrows of any but particularly a womans when i came to the place of action i found a poor creature on the ground struggling with a man who struck at her several times but the moment her eyes caught my approach she prayed for the love of jesus that i would assist her on such an occasion i never wanted any other monitor than my humanity and guided by that impulse i entered into her quarrel with such zeal and activity that in less than ten minutes i laid her oppressor breathless at my feet  the noise of our combat had attracted the notice of some watchmen who gathering round us made an inquiry into the nature of such a breach of the peace at that dead hour of the night i was going to inform them of the true state of the matter when the vanquished hero who lay bleeding in the street charged the watch to take me into custody as a villain who wanted to rob and murder him the words had scarcely escaped his lips when i was secured by these honest descendents of time who tally regardless of all my protestations to the contrary conveyed me to the watchhouse accompanied by the wretch who had accused me with his face and clothes besmeared all over with blood as for the girl in whose defense i had thus risked my life and liberty she had thought proper to decamp as fast as possible from the scene of the affray having solid reasons to dislike the society of a watchman and a natural antipathy to the inside of a house of correction  when we had made our entrance into the watchhouse i was brought before the constable of the night whom we found in an inner room enjoying himself with a pot of porter and a pipe and assisted in the duties of his holy office by a drunken buck who had taken up his nights lodging in the roundhouse to see life and enjoy a bit of sun when the fellow whom i had beaten had exhibited his charge against me in which he was supported by the watchmen the constable assuming all the magisterial dignity he was able turning to me said well you dog what have you to say in your defense frightened out of my senses at being brought to a tribunal of justice i confessed the whole matter from beginning to end and had the consolation to understand from the inebriate gentleman who sat by the watchhouse fire and who perceived my ignorance of the town that i should certainly be hanged for that there was not a shadow of doubt but the man would die if he had taken a pistol and shot me through the head it could not have more completely deprived me of the powers of sensation  i stood for some minutes motionless as a statue at length my tears made way for my relief and i wept with the utmost contrition for the horror of an act that would not only take away the life of a fellow creature but involve my own in its dreadful consequences  i had scarcely dried my eyes when a man of a very genteel aspect entered with a ragged prostitute whom he charged with having privately robbed him of his watch it appeared in the course of her examination that she had conveyed it to a watchman who it seemed went shares in her profits and who advised her in case the gentleman should return and claim his property to charge him as having attempted to use her ill and by that means oblige him not only to relinquish all farther claim to the trinket they had pilfered but to purchase his release at a very considerable amount but the gentleman who was a rigid observer of the laws was so far from being intimidated by the threats of the woman or the apprehensions of appearing publicly on such a business in a court of justice that he made it a point to have her secured in spite of the maneuvers of her friend and his fraternity upon her confessing the whole affair and giving up the watchman as her colleague who restored the gentleman his watch upon a previous promise of pardon he consented to let her go declaring at the same time that he should have found an uncommon satisfaction in bringing so infamous a villain as the rascally retainer of time to public justice  as the petty feuds of the night are not to be discussed in watchhouses without some copious oblations to the shrine of bacchus the gentleman in conformity to so laudable and established a custom ordered a bottle of wine over which the constable the buck and himself sat discoursing for an hour to the great joy of all the disturbers of the night for the presiding magistrate was a man of such a convivial kidney as would not be called from the enjoyment of his bottle to settle the claims of justice if they were even demanded by the first man in the kingdom  after passing a most comfortless and horrid night about nine in the morning i was taken up to one of the rotationoffices and examined relative to the bloody charges exhibited against me  i trembled all the way and went to this mocktribunal of legislative authority like a criminal under sentence of death for i verily believed the hour was now arrived when i should end all my miseries by an ignominious death but fortunately a circumstance took place at the office that changed my apprehensions into transports previous to our arrival a gentleman who had been robbed the week before on hounslow heath had attended the examination of two men who were taken up on suspicion of being guilty of the robbery but finding they were not the persons who had committed the fact he was coming down the steps of the door on his departure when he met the whole troop who were conducting me and my accuser before the sitting magistrate anxious to learn the cause of a piece of business so apparently dreadful he turned back and just as i and the villain who had charged me falsely were brought to the bar the gentleman pointing to my prosecutor exclaimed with a strong emphasis like nathan in holy writ thou art the man  what man replied the justice  the man who committed the robbery says the gentleman upon the strength of his authority the villain who was endeavoring to harrass me for exercising the feelings of a christian was in his turn secured and examined in the course of which he owned the commission of the fact and in the confusion of his mind acknowledged that i had neither robbed or in any manner illused him but ratified in every particular the account i had previously delivered before the constable of the night in consequence of the happy issue of this woefraught adventure i was immediately set at liberty and the poor devil whose bones i had so belabored in the morning was handcuffed and conveyed to prison to await in durance vile the awful sentence of the law  when i found myself once more unrestrained and in the middle of the street at liberty to follow which path i liked best i thought my heart would have leaped through my ribs for joy my extacies were indeed somewhat allayed by the recollection that i had not a sixpence in my purse but yet not sufficiently so to make me sad for all ideas relative to money became now but a secondary consideration in my scale of felicity and that circumstance which would have made me wretched the day before was now absorbed in the selfcongratulations of escape from so perilous a situation  so much does the happiness of our lives as well as the beauty of objects depend upon opposition  as the perturbation of my spirits began to subside a sense of the misfortunes that still hovered round me began to operate with accumulated force i knew not whither to turn my steps to procure a dinner much less all those comforts of which i had been deprived by the silly expenditure of my money in the pursuit of a shadow in the bitterness of my anguish i cursed the hour that had first made me acquainted with the count whom i now considered as the primary cause of all my woe and vowed revenge if ever time and opportunity brought him within my reach  as i was musing deeply on the hard rubs of fortune that i had experienced i luckily thought of the guinea which i had formerly sewed up in my waistband and instantly ripping it open with a penknife i seized the hidden treasure which i kissed with the rapture of a zealot and ere i put my resolutions in practice which were to buy a pair of cheap shoebuckles and a few other indispensible personal necessaries i could not help uttering the following rhapsody to my last guinea  and shall i never see thee more thou lovely minister of all my pleasures  without thy powerful assistance the goodly fruits that issue from the womb of nature are tasteless joyless and insipid  it is you alone can cheer the human heart and raise it from despondency  you visit us as the harbinger of delight and all the graces that adorn our state are crouding in thy train  thy influence more potent than the blandishments of beauty can turn aside the stream of justice shake the monarch on his imperial throne and by thy strength of argument confound and destroy the longprescribed distinctions which equity and wisdom have erected on the precincts of right and wrong  alas how ineffectual is merit if not supported by your smiles like the floweret in the arabian desert it blossoms unregarded and perishes unknown  the love of thee even supersedes that of fame for proud man would cease to be a hero and the artist to be immortalized by the labors of his pencil if cut off from the genial hope of thy embraces  if providence in her bounteous dispensations meant you as a blessing why were you distributed with so unequal a hand but on the contrary my reason assures me that you were sent us as a curse to poison the fountain of human excellence to vitiate the heart and shake the peace of society the force of reflection having dissipated my prejudices i will lament thy loss no more but cheerfully resign thee thou baneful minister of human evil to the insatiate hand of avarice and ambition and living obedient to the dictates of morality endeavor to be happy by the exercise of virtue
