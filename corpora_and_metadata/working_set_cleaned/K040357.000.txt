lxxvi  the art of rising on the stage canto i to grace the elbowchair of age roscius the monarch of the stage for roscius was in years well stricken besides that he began to thicken resolved to lay the scepter down and make his exit from the town to this intent he summoned strait the lords and commons of his state a motley tribe as you should see a theatres variety from madam yates to columbine he summoned them exact at nine exact at nine the parties came some known to famine some to fame in the same room for once they met the tragic ladies took their seat the little folks were on the scout and fairly wished themselves without the gentlemen strolld here and there till roscius came and took the chair then stood in attitude profound and thus addressed the circle round my subjects and my friends adieu i now am come to part with you full forty years in various places have i alas been making faces during which time  as you can tell much have i talked of heaven and hell myself have stabbed through every part and often given away my heart imaginary crimes committed been hated scorned admired and pitied my father strangled killed my brother and played the devil with my mother to day a fool to morrow wiser a monarch manager and miser ten thousand times this hand has pressed in mimic agony my breast i have died for love and rose again on purpose to repeat my pain at once i have stabbed both man and maid and now and then a tyrant played not sir john hill so much has wrote as i have spoken through my throat it is true indeed we all rehearse each year a wagon load of verse i when the poet lost his gift have kindly given the man a lift when poets weighty matters cobble and their galled jades begin to hobble the player doctors up their feet and makes them seem both sound and fleet this have i done  with your assistance though sometimes we scarce saved our distance bards now a days would lose the race if players did not mend their pace so apt their hackneys are to trip that did we not work spur and whip scarce is there one among them all but would ere course the second fall to tell you then my serious wish i am tired of this poetic dish so mean to bid farewell to verse and live upon my prose and purse i am on the edges of threescore it is really time to give it over i need not counterfeit a wrinkle behold  it strikes you in a twinkle the step of sixty as i stir you see it is downright angular i i am now unfit for rant and riot and so determine to be quiet no more will i the proteus play but choose henceforth the private way nay mr king you need not stare i am in earnest now i swear as player manager and poet i have done some service and you know it i have had my struggles like the moor a time there was when i was poor now farewell hairbreadth escapes and slavings hail  three times hail  my little savings i never coveted such stuff but will retire with just enough to line the evening couch with down and keep a cottage out of town my homely hampton hut i mean although a plain a pleasant scene a palace ill befitteth age mine is the season to be sage and that is another reason why i lay this bustling business by although of actors i am king the hour alas is on the wing when i and real monarchs must lay all our royalties in dust i now an awful part should act and fable must give way to fact you see my purpose and my plan no more the player but the man then friends farewell but ere i quit these well known scenes of sense and wit these everhonourd sacred boards where such a levee grand of lords where kings and queens so often have stood and died  with little loss of blood where conquerors of every clime have night by night harangued in rhyme where by the aid of good blank verse stout heroes have improved their curse where dukes of every sort and size have complimented ladies eyes where chiefs have fought their countrys cause and statesmen made and unmade laws where countesses have drained the bowl or stabbed the form to save the soul while virgins rather than submit their pretty panting hearts have hit where all of us have had our blows our sieges battles joys and woes ah friends  i cannot leave this place till i have given my last embrace my eyes will linger to this spot till you my last advice have got friends ours is often a dangerous trade take then a recipe i have made i have tried its efficacy long mind and apply it to the tongue the legs and arms must claim a part i have mixed it up with wondrous art twill move the soul and mend each feature i am told there is not the like in nature and as a mark twill bear the test me it has made  probatum est take first a wellsizd lookingglass and view your shadow as you pass mark every motion of the eye and learn at will to laugh and cry observe to step and start with grace and call up meaning in the face walk not too narrow nor too wide it is like sir punch to strut and stride as bad it is to jerk and run pray ladies copy abington observe the breeding in her air there is nothing of the actress there assume her fashion if you can and catch the graces of her fan learn in the mirror how to stare to smile in joy to droop in care with ease to hectorit or sinit and be the proteus of the minute from gloomy shift to the serene and learn to methodise your mien in drawing off a glove i will tell whether a woman is bred well in tieing on a solitaire or in the tender of a chair or managing the limbs below i know whatever a man can do i prithee never pause too long a trick i got when i was young a trick my enemies have told but habits seldom leave the old the glass may teach to bow and kneel but heaven alone can make you feel from that fair fount the truth must flow yet art can make a shift you know i have found it frequently supply the want of sensibility but then twill take up all your leisure ere you can make such toil a pleasure for where dame nature is unkind and scarcely half makes up the mind while fortune like a scurvy jade tosses that mind upon our trade it follows as a clear effect that notwithstanding such neglect if nature will not do her part the business must be done by art in stageaffairs as in a watch there is many a wheel and many a catch in both the mechanisms fine your lookerson can never divine what a mere juggle it is to play and yet this juggle does i say who only views the watchs face conceive not what is within the case enough for them if truth it tell and bids sue roast the mutton well the fine machinery they miss as it is in that so it is in this i would not have you then despair though nature should her blessings spare though some of you should feel no more than dunstans giants over church door sheer art may move a man about and who is to find the secret out take heed twill seem all skill and knowledge might pose the fellow of a college have you not seen in lear and fool where players often rave by rule the calling out  a mouse a mouse has fairly taken in the house if well the changeling throws his hat make sure of your applause for that one minute marks a start at most but if on entrance of a ghost you stamp but loud enough and six instead of one you may take six twere well indeed if when it is come with dextrous dash of hand or thumb you caused the hair to stand an end as that would much the horror mend when hamlets phantom you pursue gaze as if every lamp burnt blue but when its errand you would know take care to stagger as you go then as it waves you not to vex it let the sword tremble in your exit to make king richard there is a knack be perfect in the leg and back the eyebrow should be broad and dark and give to murder every mark his fell complottings and designs should startle in the faces lines give him the dark assassins airs and catch the audience unawares much much dear folks depends on dress the seemly ruff of royal bess the flourish when she gives the blow the royal train and furbelow the thundering boast of blustering pierre the strawmade crown of crazy lear othellos face ophelias willow and desdrmonas strangling pillow your hose ye fair when boys you play white chins when age is in decay fat falstaffs shield and mountain belly are half the battle let me tell ye if once the galleries give the hand a fig for those that understand the men of taste you know are rare the boxes seldom heed the player mind not the critics hiss at flaws it is buried in the fools applause is genius wanting  trust to trick twill prove the actors walkingstick there are who use it every year though none of my good people here but where true taste is given escape that which will make you play the ape where there is genius  in such cases the passions know their proper places just where they ought behold them rise or flow in tears or heave in sighs they animate the brightest jest and mighty nature stands confessed what therefore i remarked at first was putting matters at the worst as providence bestowed the power i never could bear finesse an hour my archer is your comic sample and lear affords a grave example of other points there are a few that i will now reveal to you and first it would not be amiss but here and there prevent a hiss if some of you would condescend a certain careless air to mend it is villainous to search the pit to find where your admirers sit nor is it right to stare on high intrigueing with the gallery or to the boxes give your eyes while on the stage a lady sighs believe me there is much to play even when you have no more to say some at the close of every speech will saucy turn upon their breech dear ladies pray forgive the word but faith the customs more absurd never conclude your business past till act the fifth and line the last often have i been the friend in danger when him i loved stood like a stranger and though next scene i was to die by draught or dart or sympathy for broken hearts with us are common i have often cracked a cord for woman the fellow was so lost to feeling i might as well have hugged the ceiling one of his hands indeed was near to take my tributary tear while other members making love were set to trap the nymphs above sure gentlemen you will grant me this a time to act a time to kiss resrain but till the curtains down then rangerit through all the town but really there is no excuse where kissing is so much in use the modern stage is no way slack in granting you an honest smack i cannot recollect the play where poets do not show the way there is scarce a scene of tragic bliss but they have introduced a kiss or if a comedys their forte there is always something of that sort the drama now however chaste in tender matters near the waist though they run round and round the riddle girding a zone about the middle yet all who deal in deaths and faintings our dapsters at dramatic paintings however artfully each draws over sacred parts the virtuous gauze there is none so churlish to dispute the players right to a salute in times of wycherly indeed a man might modestly proceed might leave the lips and  in a pet said y  g  pray sir dont you forget i wish pure precepts you would convey and treat us  in a decent way when ladies in the room are sitting say is it sitting roscius  fitting as heaven shall judge me by its laws i only fight the female cause my argument will plainly prove you have a right to claim our love whatever characters you play or great or little grave or gay while your dear forms are on the stage you every motion should engage and he who turns away his head  the prompter  ought to strike him dead there is not a man in the creation has for the sex such veneration it now remains ere i go hence to thank you for your diligence sickness it is true will often disable pretended sickness is a fable the papers have been full of this but i blame nature for each miss at dutys call you all would come but  that you could not get from home nay you would have ventured in a chair had you not feared  the evening air i know a ladys resolution but who can help her constitution and had you left your hoods and screens you might have died behind the scenes i credit not the idle tale she is not sick she does not ail i have seldom pried for your complaint convinced you were above a feint but sure of your indisposition have often sent you a physician some may have had it much at heart because they did not like a part some fair ones have been apt to quarrel and could not fancy their apparel it seems i have too much trimmed a train when twould have prettier looked if plain i have not always pleased my beaux in the division of the clothes i have given gold for silver lace and sometimes sulted ill a face complexions differ and stage dresses should always match the skan and tresses but far from me the blame may pass the fault was in  the lookingglass ladies indeed it told not truth each habit much improved your youth and when you were displeased with me twas i adorned  a deity perhaps a word may be expected of bards who think themselves neglected it is no easy task to rule the scribbling tribe and every sool who pelts a man with manuscripts and crowds on him misshapen slips things half begot and born in pain the very faetus of the brain some of you know my windowseat the piles of paper there you meet are but the bastards of the day from trash that spawn a mushroom play abortions sprung from parents poor that lie  like foundlings  at my door in charity i take them up although not worth my caudlecup the sire without dramatic sap how can the son be reared by pap yet all i keep a decent time in ragged swatheingcloaths of rhyme then beg the fathers to attend and  take them to another friend i am charged with scorning babes of wit a charge for which i have answer fit extract a moral from a tale a grazier once had steers for sale horses just broke and heifers grown pigs calves and other kine his own to market as he went one day a neighbor stopped him on the way dobson said he as you know well both how to buy and how to sell as i must watch today the house for mother midwifes with my spouse twill be a kindness dob if you will bargain for my oxen too none better knows when beasts are fat you are a judge  i must say that the grazier from pure love to john jogd with the cattle gently on a mile beyond one thomas staver begged with a smile an equal favor talked of a lameness in his legs and pressed upon him all his eggs it was not dobs denying day so with his load he trudged away but just as if twas never to end hard by he saw a female friend she too had met a bad disaster for which repose would prove a plaster how much she said would he oblige if he would take her fridays cheese the grazier though almost weighed down agreed and toiling went to town twas sultry noon when he got there and now came on our graziers care off went his horses to his mind his heifers did not stay behind his lambkins bore a market price his hogs found buyers in a trice the market then was at a stand his neighbors goods remain in hand he scarcely sold an egg an hour and night at last began to lower longer to stay would be in vain and so he drove them back again the man with the rheumatic legs who was the owner of the eggs the swain who sent the oxen too now on our luckless grazier flew they tore his coat they bruised his eye  he was at last compelled to fly yet how was the poor man to blame he would have sold if buyers came he could not force the beef and cheese the town was full of purchases the moral is worth every other serve first yourself and then a brother to serve a brother first is right provided self gets double by it but mind that you get pleasure too that sanctifies whatever you do it is past dispute and stands revealed by men of note  see chesterfield authority we have no better it is the sense of every letter for that it was i saved my gold for that i bought for that i sold my friends i have no more to say i wish you long to live and play and when like me you have saved a pittance make your last bows and cry acquittance the greenroom echoed approbation and thus broke up the convocation end of the first canto canto ii when mighty resignations come they are sounded loud by beat of drum i speak by trope  conceive me right not drums made use of in the fight but those more general alarms that summon kingdoms up to arms again i strike on metaphor these things in rhiming will occur sure as guns pop by pulling trigger pen but a verse off goes a figure although our greatest merits lie far from such quaint embroidery true it is that young poetic sinners who at the trade are but beginners find it extremely hard to rein the ideas of the buxom brain when spirits boil and fancy rages then glare and gewgaw gild the pages imaginations in her prime who loves to sing in summertime and hence the stripling poet goes to compliment the blooming rose pours forth his genius in love bedecks the garden grot and grove scorns to see things like other men but with a sort of chymic pen hies to the shepherds fleecy sold and turns the greasy wool to gold has civil sayings for each flower first makes and then describes a bower meet such a bardling in your walk perchance you find him deep in talk or neath the branches with a book or listening to a lazy brook for what you readers call a bird writers have quite another word a plumy songster feathered friend if proper name an a at end not bullfinch goldfinch thrush or chaf a sweeter softer sound by half it is philamela tells the tale and not the vulgar nightingale it is not the linnet gives its note but lillinetta pours her throat what dull folks call the beetles flight is but the messenger of night and when the day is gone to bed on thetis lap he lays his head the poets eye can see him swim and tinge with gold the oceans brim then that which mortals call the dawn is opened by the ruddy morn and certain streaks of rising red mark where that ladys fingers spread lambs are the types of innocence lilies and snow dispute that sense nay every leaf on every tree affords the bard a simile and every tender bud that blows an epithet or thought bestows now some may think  jove help their heads it is mere dust a mortal treads i cannot pity such enough we authors know it is no such stuff the velvet carpet nature gives she offers it and man receives wish you to change the phrase again it is the green mantle of the plain it is heavens own livery silken sod and by no means a kneaded clod it is tissue wove by hands divine it is all that is fair and all that is fine but to proceed  henceforth the muse at most shall modest edging choose with her the fairy days are over content with sense she dares not soar leave we such freaks to youngsters green they are but the sportings of eighteen the muse alas who scribbles this is now no more a flaunty miss the fever of her fancy cool she rhimes and reasons all by rule the morning registers of fame soon set the city in a flame a favorite player to retire is worse than the alarm of fire the ignis fatuus of the stage runs ripe and rapid through the age and though two mighty nations wait upon the councils of the state yet like true patriots at the heart we look when roscius plays a part whateers theatrical devour and give to him the important hour the papers told that he resigned at this you guess the public mind hang all the folks across the main so roscius would but act again next day the matter was averred certain the patent was transferred song sonnet ditty sought the press and half the town was in distress the matter scarce abroad had flown ere it arrived at helicon swift to the muses laurelld court a poet went to make report for poets be it noted go on such affairs incognito and though to skeptics it seem odd in point of speed shall match a god they stride not ordinary horse but pegasus performs the course a beast that traverses the air more fleet than your arabian mare thus poets get to hypocrene ere sunday cits to turnham green phoebus allows the miracle and so they ride invisible hence it is the ponies of parnass all other quadrupedes surpass the reasons evident the mead is consecrated where they feed the best historians allege there is something holy in each hedge that sacred herbage blooms around and not a thistle in the ground a nettle here and there you find for steeds that are to wit inclined even then there is honey round the sting but for a weed  there is no such thing in vain you look for winter here it is june rich june throughout the year hence it is that all the coursers noses are perfumed with parnassian posies for as the creatures stoop to graze they bite  and fill the mouth with bays the fillies chiefly choose to eat the primrose pagle violet because this sort of food it seems inspires your pretty pastral themes on jemmy gentle seet they run and frisk and frolic in the fun in short the fields are here so fine they prove that every blades divine such too is their peculiar force a bard they make of ass or horse certain as wings grace hermes cap whatever eats and takes a nap right good sufficient poets wake the better if their thirst they slake at caballine the horses fountain which lies on the other side the mountain some fearful fools too tame to blunder have set these matters far asunder the river in beotia placing and phocis call the spot they graze in but poet real mule or man despises critics rigid plan and skip through kingdoms in a minute think of a place  whew  pass  they are in it your bards dramatical shall run and win the sweepstakes from the sun in waving of a gooses feather shall draw the distant poles together on wings scarce fledged with ease can fly from catharine street to castaly then dig the spur add loose the rein dine in the strand and sup in spain these points premised we will not fail to see who went to tell the tale trust me there was no less than seven now made a vigorous push for heaven dan roscius ranged them in a row and every one desired to go their coursers you will suppose were there pawing to gallop through the air reader you will note that heavens a phrase we authors use in different ways the skies above lay constant claim and helicon enjoys the name nay what will startle most i know we give it to the shades below in short sirs every place of rest is heaven because it suits in best so whatsoevers bad or bitter is hell to make the sense compleater this license chiefly marks our charter so wonder not at what comes a ter in verse like this the bards allowed a privilege denied the crowd a letter we never mind a pin but cast it out or keep it in odd syllables we cut and clip and half a word with ease oerskip so that at top we put our dashes the critic heeds not such small flashes this right prince butler did ordain and swift confirmed the act again dan prior signed it with his hand a law poetic through the land since these so often pared the line there is none will cavil sure at mine say i clip oftner i am the less but to return  i shall digress the bard who saddled first his steed was of a mixed and mongrel breed his pegasus scarce known to fame though young and mettlesome was lame one that never won a noble bet but threw the heel at all he met in going a dogtrot lie stumbled yet snorting restive and never humbled you would think its master was a bruiser i lack a rhyme  proceed  twill do sir  yet was it plump as pad of parson the beast might serve to bring a farce on indeed he has been known to pray and written almost half a play nay to do justice to the steed it is certain he the news could read there are who say  you need not laugh he actually could paragraph the column kend with critic eyes and wrote both question and replies however this be he did not fail to be a candidate for the mail to search too nicely for the reason would at this time be out of season but roscius thought not fit to send this courier though esteemed a friend rumor declared  but she is a hag that roscius had long fed his nag and some were bold enough to swear this couriers beast engaged his care while blooded horses left to play could scarce get either corn or hay that many a prancer stout and able was left to swell at leg in stable while this queer creature was rubbed down and made a fight of for the town but not to tire you with suggestion i haste to things beyond a question although by taking off a cup of that same water poets sup and dining well on heavenly sallads might mend our authors knack at ballads it is clear sir roscius did not choose to dub him postman to the muse the second was a bard obscure that wanted much a sinecure the master of a galloway exceeding apt to run away that lately threw a lady down then scamperd with her through the town quoth roscius it cannot be my friend i might as well an andrew send how am i sure ere you get there you will not settle in the air the tit you rides a lovely brown but who is to bring the message down the four next candidates were such as proved a little was too much your men of farce and interlude who teaze the town with trifles crude who give their tiny popguns play to pelt the folly of the day whom roscius artfully employs to keep the galleries  from noise when tragic heroines in disguise are now no more to cheat the eyes when she who lately seemed a brother in scene the next turns out a mother when passions are no more at strife and the poor man may own his wife till she puts on her woman weeds it is certain that a pause succeeds and as it takes both time and pain to make a boy a girl again it is decent that we use finesse that each fair lady may undress hence roscius being politic engages those same sons of trick a tribe of low dramatic hacks to fill the space between the acts their sense and taste were nearly even but all unfit alas for heaven on these accounts he called a crony who kept a very pretty poney a thing of fashion brisk and neat and swift of foot although petite well he maintained a poets cause a stickler stout for critic laws the steed was little but not lazy the rider dapper as a daisy with fairy step together they had trippd to paris for a play thither each year the pair would prance to catch the comedy of france him roscius deemed a proper hard to carry off the messagecard then mount dear george said he your steed and pray return to me with speed although our poet did not race he deftly went a decent pace and those who take long journeys know your even riders fastest go thus though he did not stretch and tear he canterd regularly there for though a dramatist and fleet his pegasus oheyd the bit some bards full cautious and exact are swayed by aristotles act which does provide in certain cases strict edicts upon times and places to break through which without just reason is called a literary treason would you with these same laws comply then  reverence probability awed therefore by the sages plan steadily went our little man arrived he hailed the sacred spring dismounted and addressed the ring for as it chanced the ladies nine were after dinner quaffing wine a basket of ambrosia by remained to tempt a strangers eye yet ere he laid a finger on he told them what he came upon ye everhonourd three times three i coley george now visit ye the messenger alas of news that needs must shock each gentle muse the facts connected with the matter will turn your nectar all to water and your divine poetic lake an ordinary puddle make roscius old drurys mighty king with pain ye maids i tell the tiling roscius resolved to leave the town prepares to quit the scenic crown even now he flies he is gone this hour unless you interpose your power   and who the diadem shall wear cried the sad muses with a stare all rose confused some swore twas fable some spilt the nectar on the table queen tragedy was in despair the comic lady tore her hair it chanced the graces were their guests and they began to thump their breasts and though perhaps twas only art each fair one acted well her part they topt it sir as they had been six summers training for the scene i am led to judge it a deceit at best a modish counterfeit because though some amongst them had sufficient reason to run mad the poor thalia well might cry and her sad sister sob and sigh yet really all the rest might spare their woeful looks and fullen air for those to whimper  twas a whim he scarce knew them they scarce knew him and wherefore could the charming graces distort and spoil their lovely faces the thing as it appears to me is that they wept for sympathy for if you criticize you shall observe that griefs electrical when belvidera draws the tear behold  the handkerchiefs appear at once a thousand noses blow till the house echoes with the woe but mark  i dont conclude from hence all feel the pathos of the sense or all regard the stage or player even though the lovely barrys there for those who truly are distressed perhaps the nose shall blow the least yet when the infection touches one from box to box you see it run but every heart is not alike and one woe cannot all folks strike where fathers feel themselves a lear no doubt the miserys sincere but she who bride shall be tomorrow has no soul then i ween for sorrow and many a tittering fair you find so little to distress inclined even shakespeares scenes could never melt yet still you would swear they really felt when tender people round you cry it is right to bear them company before the face the fan to pull and vow it is passing pitiful the eye to rub the head to lean and seem  quite softened by the scene this clears the conduct of each muse nor could the graces well refuse when mel and tha heaved sighs by dozens they claimed the sympathy of cousins their beauteous sisters too gave vent twas all a decent compliment the news some thought must be a fable roscius they said though old was able the courier must mistake the thing they would send an herald to the king and have it well confirmed for sure the tidings must be premature the courier said he told the truth moreover that a tuneful youth who by a certain spanish plot a wondrous rich duenna got who for six singsong months together had led the town through wind and weather his tweedledum  and dee to hear and took  the nation by the ear that be the palace now had bought the trappings trimmings and what not that other gentlefolks had part and shared the instruments of art the comic mask and tragic train the sunshine and the showers of rain the weeds the witches often danced in with colored coat of harlequin the sceptres swords and suits of mail the palace flats the park the jail the dragons bears and dromedaries and all the pantomime vagaries the truncheon targe and trumpet loud the pasteboard crown and canvass cloud the thunderspouts and thunder too with robes of tartar turk and jew the couches coronets and camps the stars the moon and all the lamps the heroes habits whole and torn and ermine walking dukes have worn the blazing petticoats and sacks which often graced princesses backs in short the whole machinery and all the trick of tragedy enough enough said pommy here i see the horrid matter clear it chiefly touches you and me it does my dear melpomene exclimd poor thaly  let us fly direct to feathered mercury this said the sisters instant went to maia in the firmament their golden pinions beat the wind the little herald stayed behind longed with the rest to hold converse but thought it right to talk in verse he told the fate of epicoene yet did not give the nymphs the spleen a connoisseur the bard they found so many a civil thing went round and after much dramatic chat they stuck a laurel in his hat then as the nectar gan to rise which they get coustant from the skies for from olympus to parnass it is with them an easy pass each lady freely spoke her mind and did  what by and by you will find reader twould sacriligious look at the mere fag end of a book these sacred matters to rehearse which figure in our future verse when great affairs approach we pause this is amongst your epic laws important points demand parade and to grace these we cantos made end of the second canto canto iii upon a card as white as snow fairer than message cards below fairer than those on which the belle sends by her hermes to pall mall the modish message of

and briskly took the london road but ere he came to drury lane thalia pressed the olympian plain for as no turnpikes tax the air the sisters presently were there when on the earth we go it is gravel but debonair to heaven you travel the path is cut through ether clear a mild and milky atmosphere and as you reach the realms of day there is not a pebble in the way when once you get beyond the sun so smooth and rapidly you run all is so gentle fair and even you glide on featherbeds to heaven hence venus with a thousand loves yokes but a single pair of doves which managed with a silken rein skim

madam mel was still in tears and might be so these twenty years unless their poetships could rule friend roscius still to play the fool he thought that roscius should agree for sake of all stage poesy to act one more theatric session   hermes youre right  i say possession cried shakespeare loud and while he spoke no other bard the accents broke is all to perish then of mine must shakespeare be no more divine though fame may here her clarion blow pray who must manage it below  he said  elysium heard the sound and all its tenants thronged around the story in a moment flew till every bard the matter knew one told the tidings to another till sol himself was in a pother elysium reader is a name not only for these sons of fame but a fine place by jove ordained for all who have figured fought or reigned it is for the wise the great the fair and every constant lovers there it is in short for all the good when they have done with flesh and blood and yet the beauty when a ghost there as on earth remains a toast the elysians to her charms pay court and amorous shadows round her sport the human shape we sure retain else could sons know their sires again now strange as this may seem to you aeneas found it vastly true who as dan virgils legends go once took a pious trip below walked round the charming garden twice and owned anchises in a trice made without toil the important tour and got to earth within the hour the characters that roscius played were now assembled  to a shade poor benedict began to stare and though it is odd how he got there macbeth protested he was glad roscius too often had made him mad his crimes so painted to the life as  pritchard used to paint his wife the pensive hamlet smote his breast and on poor yorricks shoulder pressed even drugger seemed to feel the blow then took a quid to ease his woe othello little seemed to care and jaffier was not in despair yet royal lear sustained the stroke though barry  at the bottom broke if all were well as it is above that form that face might well improve my scenes said lee  ah alexander that barry was a better stander then might thou still unrivaled run and claim alliance with the sun zanga an hero of the moorish race had a the late mr mossop new guest in his embrace near whom the stately wolsey stood to give him welcome from the flood even a name given to corrolianus whose character was finely represented by mr mossop caiius marcius hailed his friend and pierre was eager to attend cato to grieve saw little cause sheridan gives his senate laws but princely john declined the head and wished that sheridan was dead then dropped a tear and hid his face as conscious still of his disgrace ranger with nectar almost mellow swore roscius was a noble fellow then turning to unfriended amongst the parts of mr shuter stephen wished ned and davy both in heaven the multitude now talked so fast the matter was so like to last so little hope remained of hearing sir hermes spread his wings for steering when shakespeare thus preferred his prayer to him who darts his rays from far  i see i feel the tempest brewing dark over my stage impends the ruin let me to earth a ramble take and i will expedition make thou bearer of the brilliant bow this favor on thy bard bestow  dear shakespeare thy request is odd replied the silvershafted god and yet i know not to deny  then here good friend said mercury this winged cap i will lend to thee a flying foot will do for me so short the way is to the king one might go there with half a wing consent thus gained and full in feather the bard and hermes flew together as friendly toward earth they went to see what these strange tidings meant they freely chatted on the road and shakespeare thus bespoke the god  hermes no toil that man engages not making verses to make pages not all the logic of the laws nor knot that ties the gordian cause not all the navigators art nor even the warriors wily part not methodistical devotion nor secret of perpetual motion not the dull road to classic knowledge nor humdrum labors of a college not the fierce spirit of debate that works the whirligig of state nor jarring jargon of physician not science of geometrician not fluxions fractions or finance not both on heel and head to dance not coptic algebra or erse not dignity without a purse nor ought on earth such talents ask such powers as the theatric task at once to move and mend the heart a master of the thespian art for even i with all my boast was deemed unfit to make a ghost yet hermes i could scribble things as easy as you work your wings could very decent dukes create and make a minister of state dubb one a lord a second sir and half complete a character sooner than get that phantoms talk or even be perfect in my stalk it is not acting to rehearse some hundred lines of florid verse it is not comedy to frisk to trip to titter and look brisk the wood and wire can dance and caper a very mountebank can vapor it is not tragedy to roar and flounce the body on the floor then to spring upward with a bound and cast the goggling eyeballs round to writhe the joints or shake the head then quiver and burlesque the dead it is not tragedy to pout or in a fume to jump about to slap the forehead thump the chest and screw the face to seem distressed nor sweat an hour upon the stage or twich the mantle in a rage hence i infer my worthy friend nature peculiar gifts must lend and after all her favors care and industry must make the player quoth mercury  my noble poet youre a great man and often show it but now you miss the matter quite since you dear will began to write affairs have had a modern turn actors have little now to learn the deuce a difficulty in it the hocuspocus of a minute at least the folks who teach to speak dispatch a dozen in a week roscius indeed and three or four happily through britain half a score the subject study as a science the rest to study bid defiance he who is to the stage inclined tells to sir manager his mind to be or not to be rehearses and tries his compass in the curses his bosom beats with tragic rage and so he jumps upon the stage a time he takes to con his part since he must get the words by heart his leisure at the glass employs and scares the landlady with noise then all in rubric capitals he flames resplendent on the walls at every corner of the street the new young gentleman you meet and that he may the better bellow sometimes he chooses your othello changes his face to moorish black or else a bunch upon his back  he aims at grin and glare and posture and takes a tug of master gloucester at length upon a solemn night the hero is to fume and fight in romish triumph lo he comes and stalks to the tattoo of drums he never played the king before and happily never shall play it more observe him the succeeding eve with a vile livery on his sleeve sunk to the servants lowest place yet mean enough to bear disgrace but if his lungs the task sustain he plays the character again the strange attraction casts around and works his way by dint of sound the papers circulate the puff he is a diamond in the rough and by the force of mighty jaws he storms awhile and wins applause now with success quite feverish grown he will have a playhouse of his own the manager and actor join and then he fills the heros line afar he travels on the hoof his theater without a roof in a vile barn he butchers lear and stabbs the regimentald pierre but even if all his toils succeed prithee dear william mark the meed full often he bustles half the night yet scarcely gets a supper by it on thy fine thoughts he feeds by day the famished sovereign  of a play the vagrant hut rewards his pains and the world frowns upon his gains not pedlar gipsy jesuit not balladwenches in the street not base buffoon on scaffolding not bullock baited at the ring nor beggar dieting at door nor the chance children of the poor a lot so hard   i prithee stop returned the bard  the subject drop for if their private life be good blessed they may be whatever their food the ship boy on the giddy mast my worthy billy not so fast said maias son  philosophy is a fine thing when plentys nigh as to their goodness i confess they are the types of holiness though i sometimes pass to and fro i hear no trips wherever i go so much to deal in sentiment inspires pure love esteem content though grocers will their figs neglect actors will noble thoughts respect and hence it is the real player will live on virtue and the air to no one ill is he inclined unspotted both in form and mind to do the ladies right their dress even in a morn is cleanliness so spruce you at a glance would swear in every pin you saw the player with rumpled cap and towzled head they never breakfast on the bed but as at night they love parade at day each fair shall match a maid in short the heroines of the scene are full as chaste as they are clean here hermes paused and rubbed his eye and why friend mercury so sly rejoined the poet  in these days actors i hear get pence and praise fashion it seems has changed her plan townplayer is a gentleman and surely men of art and sense have justly to the name pretense but as i scent the city smoke prithee good hermes spare thy joke and if thou love me quickly say should roscius go who is left to play for since i have been a ghost my friend i little to such points attend it is long quoth hermes sir since i to either house have had a fly there is little call for you or me the news you will hear from pominb there is sheridan the old and young one famed for speech and one for song but ah dear will alack a day it is all to sing and naught to say his airs full seventy nights have run and yet the game is just begun why sir i am told this wicked elf has thrown your lordship on the shelf in vain you growl forth list oh list your favorite phantom is not mist and when the mob resign their ghost judge how much footing you have lost uncalled old barry limps about gets a long sabbath for his gout and it is with much ado i hear his wife can draw one tragic tear methinks the age is operatizd sweet willy  you seem much surpised hermes stopped short  the poet frowned and tore the bays his temples bound the chaplet thrice indignant shook tossed it air then angry spoke roscius resigned why had he stayed i would go forward to upbraid  oh had i known what shakespeare wrote would fly before the sidlers note by yonder  but i will not swear why did thou lead me on thus far hermes your hand  dear friend adieu he turned about and backward flew the god of errands left alone now bent his course toward helicon told every muse the appeal was vain and in a huff sought heaven again the end
