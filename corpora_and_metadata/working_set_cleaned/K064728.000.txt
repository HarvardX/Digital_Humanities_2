the apprentice a farce in two acts as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  by mr murphy  london printed for paul vaillant facing southamptonstreet in the strand       price one shilling  advertisement there was room to apprehend before the representation of the following farce that the subject might appear extravagant and merely ideal but the real existence of it is displayed in such a lively and picturesque manner by the author of the prologue and was at once so universally felt by the audience that all necessity of saying any thing farther on this head is now entirely superseded what at present remains to be feared is that the apprentice will not make so lively a figure in the closet as on the stage where the parts in general were allowed to be well performed where simon was represented with a perfection of folly where the skill of mr yates exhibited the impotence of a mind whose ideas extend very little beyond the multiplication table and whose passions are ever in a crazy conflict unless when they all subside into a sordid love of gain and where mr woodwards admirable comic genius gave such a spirit to the whole that there is reason to think whenever he relinquishes the part the apprentice may again elope from his friends without any ones desiring him to return to his business  the author has however endeavored to render all its defects as excusable as he could and he wishes no stronger criticism could be brought against him than the two following observations which he thinks very singular and somewhat entertaining i cannot says one give my opinion of the piece till i have time to consider the depth of it  po says another this is not all his own i remember some of it in other plays  in order to assist the former in his deep researches and to enable the latter to make good his charge of plagiarism references are made to the several plays from which the distempered hero of the piece makes up his motley but characteristick dialect the intelligent reader if he think it worth his while to turn over these leaves will be pleased to remember that a parody does not always carry with it a burlesque on the lines alluded to for as it is judiciously remarked in a note to mr popes dunciad it is a common but foolish mistake that a ludicrous parody of a grave and celebrated passage is a ridicule of that passage a ridicule indeed there is in every parody but where the image is transferred from one object to another there the ridicule falls not on the thing imitated but imitating thus for instance when a line of popes in a ludicrous account of the coronation in henry the viiith old edwards armor beams on cibbers breast it is without doubt an object ridiculous enough but then i think it falls neither on old king edward nor his armor but on his armorbearer only  but this is prefacing a farce as if it were a thing of moment i shall therefore dismiss it to the press without adding any thing farther except my grateful acknowledgements for the very favorable reception with which the public has honored the trifling scenes of  their most obliged and most obedient servant arthur murphy tavistock row  th jan      prologue written by mr garrick spoken by mr murphy dressed in black behold a wonder for theatric story the culprit of this night appears before ye before his judges dares these boards to tread with all his imperfections on his head prologues precede the piece  in mournful verse as undertakers  walk before the hearse whose doleful march may strike the hardened mind and wake it is feelings  for the dead  behind trickt out in black thus actors try their art to melt that rock of rocks  the critics heart no acted fears my vanity betray i am indeed  what others only play thus far myself  the farce come next in view though many are it is faults at least it is new no smuggled pilferd scenes from france we show it is english  english sirs  from top to toe though coarse my colors and my hand unskilled from real life my little cloth is filled my hero is a youth  by fate designed for culling simples  but whose stagestruck mind nor fate could rule nor his indentures bind a place there is

heroes and their laurels crop to bring em back to reason  and their shop to raise an harmless laugh was all my aim and if i shun contempt  i seek not fame indulge this firstling  let me but begin nor nip me  in the buddings of my sin some hopes i cherish  in your smiles i read em whatever my faults  your candor can exceed em  epilogue written by a friend spoken by mrs clive enters reading the playbill a very pretty bill  as i am alive the part of  nobody  by mrs clive a paltry scribbling fool  to have me out  he will say perhaps  he thought i could not spout malice and envy to the last degree and why  i wrote a farce as well as he and fairly ventured it  without the aid of prologue dressed in black and face in masquerade o pit  have pity  see how i am dismayed poor soul  this canting stuff will never do unless like bays he brings his hangman too but granting that from these same obsequies some pickings to our bard in black arise should your applause to joy convert his fear
