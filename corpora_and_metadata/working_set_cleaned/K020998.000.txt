the higher poets  epistle i perish that critic pride which often has hurled its empty thunders over the epic world which eager to extend its mimic reign would bind free fancy in a servile chain with papal rage the eye of genius blind and bar the gates of glory on the mind such dark decrees have lettered bigots penned ver   see note i  yet seized that honored name the poets friend but learning from her page their laws will blot scorned be their arrogance their name forgot the indignant bard abhorring base control seeks the just critic of congenial soul say mason judge and master of the lyre harmonious chief of britains living choir say will thou listen to his weaker strains who pants to range round fancys rich domains to vindicate her empire and disown proud system seated on her injured throne come while thy muse contented with applause gives to her graceful song a little pause enjoying triumphs past at leisure laid in thy sweet gardens variegated shade or fondly hanging on some favorite oak that harp whose notes the fate of mona spoke strung by the sacred druids social band and wisely trusted to thy kindred hand come for thy liberal and ingenuous heart can aid a brother in this magic art let us and freedom be our guide explore the highest province of poetic lore free the young bard from that oppressive awe which feels opinions rule as reasons law and from his spirit bid vain fears depart of weakened nature and exhausted art phantoms that literary spleen conceives dullness adopts and indolence believes while with adventurous step we wind along the expansive regions of heroic song from different sources let our search explain why few the chieftains of this wide domain happily inspiriting poetic youth our verse may prove this animating truth that poesys sublime neglected field may still new laurels to ambition yield her epic trumpet in a modern hand still make the spirit glow the heart expand be such our doctrine our enlivening aim the muses honor and our countrys fame thou first and fairest of the social arts sovereign of liberal souls and feeling hearts if in devotion to thy heavenly charms i clasped thy altar with my infant arms for thee neglected the wide field of wealth the toils of interest and the sports of health enchanting poesy that zeal repay with powers to sing thy universal sway to trace thy progress from thy distant birth heavens pure descendant dear delight of earth charm of all regions to no age confined the prime ennobler of the aspiring mind nor will thy dignity sweet power disdain what fiction utters in her idle strain thy sportive friend who mocking solemn truth tells her fond tales of thy untutored youth as wronged latona so her tale begins to delphos traveled with her youthful twins the envenomed python with terrific sway crossed the fair goddess in her destined way the heavenly parent in the wild alarm her little dian in her anxious arm high on a stone which she in terror trod cried to her filial guard the archer god bidding with force that spoke the mothers heart her young apollo launch his ready dart in measured sounds her rapid mandate flowed the first foundation of the future ode thus at their banquets fabling greeks rehearse ver    see note ii  the fancied origin of sacred verse and though cold reason may with scorn assail or turn contemptuous from their simple tale yet poesy thy sister art may stoop from this weak sketch to paint the impassioned group though taste refined to modern verse deny the hacknied pageants of the pagan sky their sinking radiance still the canvass warms painting still glories in their graceful forms nor can thou envy if the world agree to grant thy sister claims denied to thee for thee the happier art the elderborn superior rights and dearer charms adorn confined she catches with observance keen her single moment of the changeful scene but thou endud with energy sublime unquestioned arbiter of space and time can join the distant the unknown create and while existence yields thee all her state on the astonished mind profusely pour myriads of forms that fancy must adore yet of thy boundless power the dearest part is firm possession of the feeling heart no progeny of chance by labor taught no slowformd creature of scholastic thought the child of passion thou thy lyre she strung to her parental notes she tuned thy tongue gave thee her boldest swell her softest tone and made the compass of her voice thy own to admiration source of joy refined chaste lovely mover of the simple mind to her though skeptics in their pride declaim with many an insult on her injured name to her sweet poesy we owe thy birth thou first encomiast of the fruitful earth by her inspired the earliest mortal found the eardelighting charm of measured sound he hailed the maker of a world so fair and the first accent of his song was prayer o most attractive of those airy powers who most illuminate mans checkered hours is there an art in all the group divine whose dawn of being must not yield to thine religions self whose provident control takes from fierce man his anarchy of soul she over thy youth with fond affection hung and borrowed music from thy infant tongue law sterner law whose potent voice impressed severest terror on the human breast with thy fresh flowers her aweful figure crowned and spoke her mandate in thy foster found even cold philosophy whom later days saw thy mean rival envious of thy praise who closed against thee her ungrateful arms and urged her plato to defame thy charms she from thy childhood gained no fruitless aid from thee she learnt her talent to persuade gay nature viewed thee with a smiling glance the graces round thee framed the frolic dance and well might festive joy thy favor court thy song turned strife to peace and toil to sport exhausted vigor at thy voice revived and mirth from thee her dearest charm derived triumphant love in thy alliance blessed enlarged his empire over the gentle breast his torch assumed new luster from thy breath and his clear flame defied the clouds of death but of the splendid train who felt thy sway or drew existence from thy vital ray glory with fondest zeal proclaimed thy might and hailed thee victor of oblivious night her martial trumpet to thy hand she gave at once to quicken and reward the brave it sounds  his blood the kindling hero pays a cheap and ready price for thy eternal praise though selfish fear the immortal strain deride and mock the warriors wish as frantic pride ye gallant hapless dead of distant time whose fame has perished unembalmd in rhyme as through the desert air your ashes fly in fancys ear the nameless atoms cry to us unhappy cruel fates refuse the wellearnd record of the applauding muse blessed are those chiefs who blazoned on her roll still waken virtue in each kindred soul their bright existence still on earth prolong and shine for ever in the deathless song yet often oblivion in a treacherous shade has sunk the tuneful rites to valor paid her palsied lips refusing to rehearse the sacred old traditionary verse as well the curious eye with keen desire might hope to catch that spark of vital fire which first through chaos shot a sudden light and quickened nature in its transient flight as the fond ear to catch the fleeting note which on the ravished air was heard to float when first the muse her epic strain began and every listening chief grew more than man but as the ruler of the newborn day from chaos rose in glorys rich array so from deep shades impenetrably strong that shroud the darkened world of ancient song bright homer bursts magnificently clear the solar lord of that poetic sphere before whose blaze in wide luxuriance spread each grecian star hides his diminished head whose beams departed yet enchant the sight in latiums softer chaste reflected light say ye whose curious philosophic eye searches the depth where natures secrets lie ye who can tell how her capricious fit directs the flow and ebb of human wit and why obedient to her quick command springtides of genius now enrich her favorite land now sink by her to different climes assigned and only leave some worthless weeds behind say why in greece unrivaled and alone the sovereign poet graced his epic throne why did the realm that echoed his renown produce no kindred heir to claim his crown if as the liberal mind delights to think fancys rich flowers their vital essence drink from libertys pure streams that largely roll their quickening virtue through the poets soul why in the period when this friend of earth made greece the model of heroic worth and saw her votaries act beneath her sway scenes more sublime than fiction can display why did the epic muses silent lyre ver  0  see note iii  shrink from those feats that summoned all her fire or if as courtly theorists maintain the muses revel in a monarchs reign why when young ammons soul athirst for fame called every art to celebrate his name when ready painting at his sovereign nod with aweful thunder armed this mimic god why did coy poesy though fondly wooed refuse that dearer smile for which he sued and see him shed in martial honors bloom the tear of envy on achilles tomb in vain would reason those nice questions solve which the fine play of mental powers involve in bards of ancient time with genius fraught what mind can trace how thought engendered thought how little hints awaked the large design and subtle fancy spun her variegated line yet sober critics of no vulgar note but such as learnings sons are proud to quote the progress of homeric verse explain as if their souls had lodged in homers brain laughs not the spirit of poetic frame however slightly warmed by fancys flame when grave bossu by systems studied laws ver     see note iv  the grecian bards ideal picture draws and wisely tells us that his song arose as the good parsons quiet sermon grows who while his easy thoughts no pressure find from hosts of images that crowd the mind first calmly settles on some moral text then creeps  from one division  to the next nor if poetic minds more slowly drudge through the cold comments of this gallic judge will their indignant spirit less deride that subtle pedants more presumptive pride whose bloated page with arrogance replete imputes to virgil his own dark conceit ver     see note v  and from the tortured poet dares to draw that latent sense which horace never saw which if on solid proof more strongly built must brand the injured bard with impious guilt while such dictators their vain efforts waste in the dark visions of distempered taste let us that pleasing happier light pursue which beams benignant from the milder few who justly conscious of the doubts that start in all nice questions on each finer art with modest doubt assign each likely cause but dare to dictate no decisive laws it is said by one who with this candid claim ver     see note vi  has gained no fading wreath of critic fame who fondly listening to her various rhyme has marked the muses step through many a clime that where the settled rules of writing spread where learnings code of critic law is read though other treasures deck the enlightened shore the germs of fancy ripen there no more are critics then that bold imperious tribe the guards of genius who his path prescribe are they like visirs in an eastern court who sap the very power they should support whose specious wiles the royal mind unnerve and sink the monarch they pretend to serve no of their value higher far i deem and prize their useful toil with fond esteem when lowths firm spirit leads him to explore the hallowed confines of hebraic lore when his free pages luminous and bold the glorious end of poesy unfold assert her powers her dignity defend and speak her as she is fair freedoms friend when thus he shines his mitred peers above i view his warmth with reverential love proud if my verse may catch reflected light from the rich splendour of a mind so bright blessed be the names to no vain system tied who render learnings blaze an useful guide a friendly beacon raised on high to teach the wandering bark to shun the shallow beach but o ye noble and aspiring few whose ardent souls poetic fame pursue ye on whom smiling heaven perfections source seems to bestow unlimitable force the inborn vigor of your souls defend nor lean too fondly on the firmest friend genius may sink on criticisms breast by weak dependence on her truth oppressed sleep on her lap and stretch his lifeless length shorn by her soothing hand of all his strength thou will not mason thou whose generous heart must feel that freedom is the soul of art thou will not hold me arrogant or vain if i advise the young poetic train to deem infallible no critics word not even the dictates of thy attic hurd no not the stagyrites unquestioned page the sire of critics sanctified by age the noblest minds with solid reason blessed who feel that faculty above the rest who argue on those arts they never try exalt that reason they so often apply till in its pride with tyrannous control it crush the kindred talents of the soul and hence in every art will systems rise which fancy must survey with angry eyes and at the lightning of her scornful smile in frequent ruin sinks the labored pile how often my romney have i known thy vein swell with indignant heat and generous pain to hear in terms both arrogant and tame some reasoning pedant on thy art declaim its laws and limits when his sovereign taste with firm precision has minutely traced and in the close of a decisive speech pronounced some point beyond the pencils reach how has thy genius by one rapid stroke refuted all the sapient things he spoke thy canvass placing in the clearest light his own impossible before his sight o might the bard who loves thy mental fire who to thy fame attund his early lyre learn from thy genius when dull fops decide so to refute their systematic pride let him at least succeeding poets warn to view the pedants lore with doubt or scorn and even to question with a spirit free established critics of the first degree among the names that judgment loves to praise the pride of ancient or of modern days what laws of poesy can learning show above the critic song of sage despreaux his fancy elegant his judgment nice his method easy and his style concise the bard of reason with her vigor fraught her purest doctrine he divinely taught nor taught in vain his precept clear and chaste reformed the errors of corrupted taste and french imagination who was bit by that tarantula distorted wit ceasing her antic gambols to rehearse blessed the pure magic of his healing verse with his loud fame applauding europe rung and his just praise a rival poet sung yet had this friend of versedevoted youth this tuneful teacher of poetic truth had he but chanced his doctrine to diffuse ere milton commund with his sacred muse and could that english selfdependant soul born with such energy as mocks control could his high spirit with submissive awe have stooped to listen to a gallic law his hallowed subject by that law forbid ver     see note vii  might still have laid in silent darkness hid and this bright sun not rising in our sphere homer had wanted still his true compeer from hence let genius to himself be just hence learn ye bards a liberal distrust whenever it is said by systems haughty son that what he cannot do can never be done it is fancys right the exalted throne to press whose height proud system can but blindly guess springs whose existence she denies unlock and call rich torrents from the flinty rock let the true poet who would build a name in noble rivalship of ancient fame when he would plan to triumph over time the splendid fabric of his lofty rhyme let him the pride of constantine assume the imperial founder of the second rome who scorned all limits to his work assigned ver     see note viii  save by the inspiring god who ruled his mind or like the fabled jupiter ut perhibent spatium quum discere vellet naturae regni nescius ipse sui armigeros utrimque duos aequalibus alis misit ab eois occiduisque plagis parnassus geminos fertur junxisse volatus contulit alternas pythius axis aves claudian jove to ascertain the doubtful confines of his wide domain two eagles let him send of equal wing whose different flight may form a perfect ring and at the point where sense and fancy meet there safely bold and though sublime discreet his fames foundation let him firmly lay nor dread the danger of disputed sway yet if the bard to glory must aspire by free exertion of unborrowd fire nor like the classic bigot vainly deem no modern muse can challenge just esteem unless her robe in every fold be pressed to fall precisely like the grecian vest if the blind notion he must boldly shun that beautys countless forms are only one and not when fancy from her magic hoard would blindly bring him treasures unexplord snap her light wand and force her hand to bear the heavier compass and the formal square let him no less their dangerous pride decline who singly criticize their own design in that nice toil what various perils lurk not pride alone may mar the needful work but foes more common to the feeling nerve where taste and genius dwell with coy reserve the sickly doubt with modest weakness fraught the languid tedium of oerlabourd thought the pain to feel the growing work behind the finished model in the forming mind these foes that often the poets bosom pierce these that condemned to fire virgilian verse prove that the bard a bold yet trembling elf should find a critic firmer than himself but what fine spirit will assume the judge patient through all this irksome toil to drudge it is here o friendship here thy glories shine the hard the important task is only thine for thou alone can all the powers unite that justly make it thy peculiar right thine the fixed eye which at no foible winks thine the warm zeal which utters all it thinks in those sweet tones that hasty spleen disarm that give to painful truth a winning charm and the quick hand of listening genius teach to grasp that excellence he burns to reach thou sweet subduer of all mental strife thou source of vigor thou support of life nor art nor science could delight or live without that energy thy counsels give genius himself must sink in dumb despair unblest uncherishd by thy cheering care nor let the bard elate with youthful fire when fancy to his hand presents the lyre when her strong plumes his soaring spirit lift when friendship heavens more high and holy gift with zeal angelic prompts his daring flight and round him darts her doubtdispelling light let him not then by vanity betrayed look with unjust contempt on learnings aid but as the adventurous seaman to attain that bright renown which great discoverers gain consults the conduct of each gallant name who sailed before him in that chase of fame reviews with frequent glance their useful chart marks all their aims and fathoms all their art so let the poet trace their happy course so bravely emulate their mental force whose daring souls from many a different clime have nobly ventured on the sea of rhyme led by no fear his swelling sail to slack let him with eager eyes pursue the track not like a pirate with insidious views to plunder every vessel he pursues but with just hope to find yet farther shores and pass each rival he almost adores end of the first epistle epistle the second argument of the second epistle character of ancient poets  homer  apollonius rhodius  virgil  lucan  epistle ii hail mighty father of the epic line thou vast prolific intellectual mine where veins of ancient and of modern gold the wealth of each poetic world have rolled great bard of greece whose everduring verse all ages venerate all tongues rehearse could blind idolatry be justly paid to aught of mental power by man displayed to thee thou sire of soulexalting song that boundless worship might to thee belong for as thy jove on his olympian throne in his unrivaled sway exults alone commanding nature by his aweful nod in high seclusion from each humbler god so shines thy genius through the cloud of years exalted far above thy pagan peers by the rich splendour of creative fire and the deep thunder of thy martial lyre the conscious world confesses thy control and hails thee sovereign of the kindling soul yet could thy mortal shape revisit earth how would it move great bard thy scornful mirth to hear vain pedants to thy verse assign scholastic thoughts that never could be thine to hear the quaint conceits of modern pride blaspheme thy fancy and thy taste deride when thus in vanitys capricious fit we see thy fame traduced by gallic wit ver    see note i  we see a dwarf who dares his foot to rest on a recumbent giants ample chest and lifting his pert form to public sight boasts like a child his own superior height but neither envious wits malignant craft though armed with ridicules envenomed shaft nor fickle fashions more tyrannic sway whose varying voice the sons of earth obey can shake the solid base of thy renown or blast the verdure of thy laurel crown though time who from his manycolourd wings scatters ten thousand shades over human things has wrought unnumberd changes since thy birth and given new features to the face of earth though all thy gods who shook the starry pole unquestioned rulers of the pagan soul are fallen with their fanes in ruin hurled their worship vanished from the enlightened world still its immortal force thy song retains still rules obedient man and fires his glowing veins for natures self that great and constant power one and the same through every changing hour gave thee each secret of her reign to pierce and stamped her signet on thy sacred verse that aweful signet whose imperial sway no age disputes no regions disobey for at its sight the subject passions start and open all the passes of the heart twas nature taught thy genius to display that host of characters who grace thy lay so richly varied and so vast the store her plastic hand can hardly model more twas nature noblest of poetic guides gave thee thy flowing verse whose copious tides gushing luxuriant from high fancys source by no vain art diverted in their course with splendid ease with simple grandeur roll spread their free wealth and fertilize the soul there are whom blind and erring zeal betrays to wound thy genius with illjudging praise who rashly deem thee of all arts the sire who draw dull smoke from thy resplendent fire pretend thy fancied miracles to pierce and form quaint riddles of thy clearest verse blind to those brighter charms and purer worth which make thy lays the lasting joy of earth for why has every age with fond acclaim swelled the loud note of thy increasing fame not that cold study may from thee deduce vain codes of mystic lore and laws abstruse but that thy song presents like solar light a world in action to the enraptured sight that with a force beyond the enervate rules of tame philosophys pedantic schools thy living images instruct mankind mould the just heart and fire the heroic mind even socrates himself that purest sage ver    see note ii  imbibed his wisdom from thy moral page and happily greece the wonder of the earth for feats of martial fire and civic worth that glorious land of noblest minds the nurse owes her unrivaled race to thy inspiring verse for o what greek who in his youthful vein had felt thy soulinvigorating strain who that had caught amid the festive throng the public lesson of thy patriot song could ever cease to feel his bosom swell with zeal to dare and passion to excel in thee thy grateful country justly praised the noblest teacher of the tribes she raised thy voice which doubly gave her fame to last formed future heroes while it sung the past what deep regret thy fond admirers feel that mythologic clouds thy life conceal that like a distant god you are darkly shown felt in thy works but in thyself unknown perchance the shades that hide thy mortal days from keen affections disappointed gaze and that idolatry so fondly proud with which thy country to thy genius bowed might form the cause why kindling with thy fire no grecian rival struck thy epic lyre perchance not seeing how thy steps were trained how they the summit of parnassus gained on thy oppressive glorys flaming pride young emulation gazed and gazing died the muses of the attic stage impart to many a votary their kindred art and she who bids the theban eagle bear her lyric thunder through the stormy air how high soever she leads his daring flight ver     see note iii  guides his bold rivals to an equal height of all the grecian bards in glorys race it is thine alone by thy unequalled pace to reach the goal with loud applause and hear no step approaching thine no rival near yet may not judgment with severe disdain slight the young rhodians variegated strain ver     see note iv  though with less force he strike an humbler shell beneath his hand the notes of passion swell his tender genius with alluring art displays the tumult of the virgins heart when love like quivering rays that never rest darts through each vein and vibrates in her breast though nature feel his verse though she declare medeas magic is still potent there yet fancy sees the slighted poet rove in pensive anger through the elysian grove from critic shades whose supercilious pride his song neglected or his powers decried he turns indignant  unopprest by fears behold he seeks the sentence of his peers see their just band his honest claim allow see pleasure lighten on his laurelld brow he soars the critics cold contempt above for virgil greets him with fraternal love hail thou rich column on whose highwrought frame the roman muse supports her epic fame hail great magician whose illusive charms gave pleasing luster to a tyrants arms to joves pure scepter turned his iron rod and made the homicide a guardian god hail wondrous bard to glorys temple led through paths that genius rarely deigns to tread for imitation she whose siren song betrays the skillful and unnerves the strong preserving thee on her perfidious shore where many a poet had been wrecked before led thee to heights that charm the astonished eye and with inventions heaven in splendour vie as rome herself by long unwearied toil gleaned the fair produce of each foreign soil from all her wide dominions various parts borrowed their laws their usages their arts imported knowledge from each adverse zone and made the wisdom of the world her own thy patient spirit thus from every bard whose mental riches won thy just regard drew various treasure which thy skill refined and in the fabric of thy verse combined it was thy glory as thy fond desire to echo the sweet notes of homers lyre but with an art thy hand alone can reach an art that has endeared the strain of each so the young nymph whose tender arms embrace an elder sister of enchanting grace though formed herself with every power to please by genuine character and native ease yet fondly copies from her favorite fair her mien her motion her attractive air her robes nice shape her ribands pleasing hue and every ornament that strikes the view but she displays by imitative art so quick a spirit and so soft a heart the graceful mimic while our eyes adore we think the model cannot charm us more though seen together each more lovely shows and by comparison their beauty grows some critics to decide which bard prevails weigh them like jove but not in golden scales in their false balance the injured greek they raise virgil sinks loaded with their heavy praise ver   0 see note v  ingenuous bard whose mental rays divine shaded by modest doubts more sweetly shine thou whose last breath unconscious of the wrong doomed to destruction thy sublimest song how dull their incense in thy sight must burn how must thy spirit with abhorrence turn from their disgusting rites who at thy shrine blaspheme thy masters name to honor thine more equal tribute in their simpler flowers the poets offer to your separate powers for all poetic eyes delight to view your different forms and with devotion due in each the radiant delphic god they own by beauteous majesty distinctly shown but they behold the lofty homer stand the bright colossus of the rhodian land beneath whose feet the waves submissive roll whose towering head appears to prop the pole stupendous image grand in every part and seeming far above the reach of mortal art in thee thou lovely mantuan bard appear the softer features of the belvidere that finished grace which fascinates all eyes yet from the copying hand elusive flies charms so complete by such pure spirit warmed they make less perfect beauty seem deformed o had thy muse whose decorating skill could spread rich foliage over the leafless hill had she who knew with nicest hand to frame the sweet unperishable wreaths of fame had she exalted by a happier fate virtues free herald and no slave of state decked worthier shrines with her unfading flower and given to freedom what she gave to power then with more keen delight and warmer praise the world had listened to thy bolder lays perchance had owed to thee a mighty debt verse where perfection her bright seal had set where art could nothing blame and nature naught regret of coarser form with less pathetic charms hating with stoic pride a tyrants arms in the keen fervor of that florid time when youthful fancy pours her hasty rhyme when all the minds luxuriant shoots appear untrimmd by art by interest or fear see daring lucan for that wreath contend which freedom twines for her poetic friend it is thine thou bold but injured bard it is thine though critic spleen insult thy rougher line though wronged thy genius and thy name misplaced by vain distinctions of fastidious taste indignant freedom with just anger fired shall guard the poet whom herself inspired what though thy early uncorrected page betrays some marks of a degenerate age though many a tumid point thy verse contains like warts projecting from herculean veins though like thy cato thy stern muse appear her manners rigid and her frown austere like him still breathing freedoms genuine flame justice her idol public good her aim well she supplies her want of softer art by all the sterling treasures of the heart by energy from independance caught and the free vigor of unborrowd thought thou bard most injured by malicious fate could not thy blood appease a tyrants hate must he still galled by thy poetic claim with falsehood persecute thy moral fame shall historys pen to aid his vengeance won ver   0 see note vi  brand thee brave spirit as an impious son who meanly feared to yield his vital flood and sought his safety by a parents blood base calumny at which belief must halt and blind credulity herself revolt could that firm youth become so vile a slave whose voice new energy to virtue gave whose stoic soul all abject thoughts abhorred and owned no sordid passion as its lord who in the trying hour of mortal pain while life was ebbing from his open vein alike unconscious of remorse and fear his heart unshaken and his senses clear smiled on his doom and like the fabled bird whose music on meanders bank was heard formed into tuneful notes his parting breath and sung the approaches of undreaded death rise thou wronged bard above detractions reach whose arts in vain thy various worth impeach enjoy that fame thy spirit knew to prize and viewed so fondly with prophetic eyes though the nice critic of fastidious france survey thy song with many a scornful glance and as a goth the kinder judge accuse who with their great corneille commends thy muse let britain eager as the lesbian state to shield thy pompey from the wrongs of fate to thee with pride a fond attachment show thou bard of freedom though the worlds thy foe as keenly sensible of beautys sway let our just isle such generous honor pay to the fair partner of thy hapless life as lesbos paid to pompeys lovely wife ver     see note vii  ye feeling painters who with genius warm delineate virtue in her softest form let argentaria on your canvass shine ver     see note viii  a graceful mourner at her poets shrine for nobly fearless of the tyrants hate she mourns her murdered bard in solemn state with pious care she decks his splendid tomb where the dark cypress sheds its soothing gloom there frequent takes her solitary stand his dear pharsalia in her faithful

bestow unfading glory on thy generous woe age after age thy virtue should record and thou should live immortal as thy lord him liberty shall crown with endless praise true to her cause in romes

the provencal poetry  the most distinguished epic poets of italy spain portugal france and england  epistle iii blessed be the hand that with a generous care to the bright crown which learning loves to wear restores the gem whose luster faint and pale died in the fold of dark oblivions veil such praise o mason to the bard is due in whose fraternal guard thy genius grew over whose untimely grave thy lyre has paid its just devotion to a brothers shade and thus hereafter shall the british muse in memorys fane the fairest tablet choose to bid her sons your blended names admire the pride of friendships as of fancys choir thy modest gray solicitous to pierce the dark and distant source of modern verse by strings untried first taught his english lyre to reach the gothic harps terrific fire the norths wild specter own his potent hand and hells nine portals at his voice expand with new existence by his verse endued see gothic fable wakes her shadowy brood which in the runic rhymes of many a scald with pleasing dread our northern sires appalled ye brave progenitors ye vigorous source of modern freedom and of europes force while your rude minds athirst for martial strife mocked all the meaner arts of polished life the muse still led you by her magic clue and from your savage strength new vigor drew in wars dire field your dauntless bards appeared alost their animating harps they reared poured through the charging host their potent strain and swelled the fiery flood in valors vein souls thus inspired in every scene elate defied the utmost rage of adverse fate in torturing death the royal captive sang and smiles of triumph hid his mortal pang ver    see note i  thus to brave odins songs our northern sire rude early framer of the modern lyre fierce freedom gave an energy sublime parent and guardian of the gothic rhyme while nurtured in the norths protecting arms the modern muse displayed her infant charms like joves undaunted child her spirit glowed and force herculean in her cradle showed her native scene in roughness she surpast her breath tempestuous as the northern blast but when to softer climes the vagrant flew and baskd beneath a sky of azure hue when for her throne the flowery south she chose and formed her crown of the provencal rose warmed by a brighter suns relaxing beams she tuned her altered voice to tender themes here her gay form a gaudier dress assumes and shines in chivalrys imperial plumes her votaries wear proud honors mystic glove and every lyre resounds romantic love save when to burst oppressions mental chain keen satire mingles with this gallant train strikes priestly pride with wits vindictive flash and galls the ghostly tyrant with her lash ver  0 see note ii  afraid of poesys expansive flood these early bards along the shallows feud in some light skiff for on the depths untried no fulltrimmd vessel floats in epic pride as infants eager for regard abound in sportive efforts of uncertain sound before their little artless lips can reach the harder elements of perfect speech so the young language of each modern clime rose by prelusive lays to lofty rhyme through many an age while in the convent bred over the chilled mind scholastic darkness spread those keener spirits who from nature caught the warmth that kindles to poetic thought betrayed ambition by thy blind desire struck with illfated zeal the latian lyre ver    see note iii  though discords hand the jarring strings had crossed and all the sweetness of their tone was lost at length fair italy luxuriant land where arts rich flowers in earliest bloom expand thy daring dante his wild vision sung ver    see note iv  and raised to epic pomp his native tongue down arnos stream his newformd music floats the proud vale echoing with his tuscan notes see the bold bard now sink and now ascend wherever thought can pierce or life extend in his wide circuit from hells drear abyss through purifying scenes to realms of perfect bliss he seems begirt with all that airy throng who brighten or debase the poets song sublimest fancy now directs his march to opening worlds through that infernal arch over whose rough summit aweful words are read that freeze each entering soul with hopeless dread now at her bidding his strong numbers flow and rend the heart at ugolinos woe while natures glorygiving tear bedews a tale unrivaled by the grecian muse now to those notes that milder grief inspire pathetic tenderness attunes his lyre which soft as murmurs of the plaintive dove tells the sad issue of illicit love but all the worse companions of his way soon into different sounds his ductile voice betray satiric fury now appears his guide through thorny paths of enmity and pride now quaint conceit his wandering steps misleads through all the hideous forms that folly breeds now priestly dullness the lost bard enshrouds in cold confusion and scholastic clouds unequal spirit in thy various strain with all their influence light and darkness reign in thy strange verse and wayward theme alike new forms of beauty and disorder strike extremes of harmony and discord dwell the seraphs music and the demons yell the patient reader to thy merit just with transport glows and shudders with disgust thy failings sprung from thy disastrous time thy stronger beauties from a soul sublime whose vigor burst like the volcanos flame from central darkness to the sphere of fame of gentler mind and with a heart to feel the fondest warmth of emulative zeal thy festive scholar who adored thy lays and graced thy genius with no scanty praise the gay boccacio tempts the italian muse ver     see note v  more varied notes and different themes to choose themes which her voice had dared not yet to sound valors heroic feats by beauty crowned sweet was the glowing song but strange to tell on his bold lyre oblivions shadows fell his richer tales engrossed the worlds regard and the bright novelist eclipsed the bard in following ages

trembles at his fame which shades the luster of her homers name hence sacred virgil from thy soul adore above the rest and to thy utmost power pursue the glorious paths he struck before pitts translation a critic who lately rose to great eminence in our own country has endeavored by a more singular method to damp the ardour of inventive genius and to annihilate the hopes of all who would aspire to the praise of originality in this higher species of poetical composition he has attempted to establish a triumvirate in the epic world with a perpetuity of dominion every reader who is conversant with modern criticism will perceive that i allude to the following passage in the famous dissertation on the sixth book of virgil  just as virgil rivalled homer so milton emulated both of them he found homer possessed of the province of morality virgil of politics and nothing left for him but that of religion this he seized as aspiring to share with them in the government of the poetic world and by means of the superior dignity of his subject has gotten to the head of that triumvirate which took so many ages in forming these are the three species of the epic poem for its largest sphere is human action which can be considered but in a moral political or religious view and these the three makers for each of their poems was struck out at a heat and came to perfection from its first essay here then the grand scene was closed and all farther improvements of the epic at an end  i apprehend that few critical remarks contain more absurdity to use the favorite expression of the author i have quoted than the preceding lines surely milton is himself a proof that human action is not the largest sphere of the epic poem and as to virgil his most passionate admirers must allow that in subject and design he is much less of an original than camoens or lucan but such a critical statute of limitation if i may call it so is not less pernicious than absurd to disfigure the sphere of imagination with these capricious and arbitrary zones is an injury to science such criticism instead of giving spirit and energy to the laudable ambition of a youthful poet can only lead him to start like macbeth at unreal mockery and to exclaim when he is invited by genius to the banquet the tables full  note ii ver    thus at their banquets fabling greeks rehearse the fancied origin of sacred verse for this fable such as it is i am indebted to a passage in athenaeus which the curious reader may find in the close of that fanciful and entertaining compiler page  0  of casaubons edition  note iii ver  0  why did the epic muses silent lyre shrink from those feats that summoned all her fire i have ventured to suppose that greece produced no worthy successor of homer and that her exploits against the persians were not celebrated by any poet in a manner suitable to so sublime a subject  yet an author named chaerilus is said to have recorded those triumphs of his country in verse and to have pleased the athenians so highly as to obtain from them a public and pecuniary reward he is supposed to have been a cotemporary of the historian herodotus but from the general silence of the more early greek writers concerning the merit of this poet we may i think very fairly conjecture that his compositions were not many degrees superior to those of his unfortunate namesake who frequented the court of alexander the great and is said to have sung the exploits of his sovereign on the curious conditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good verse and a box on the ear for every bad one the old scholiast on horace who has preserved this idle story concludes it by saying that the miserable bard was beat to death in consequence of his contract some eminent modern critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early chaerilus who is supposed to be confounded both by horace himself and afterward by scaliger with the chaerilus rewarded by alexander vossius de historicis graecis  in particular appears a warm advocate in his behalf and appeals to various fragments of the ancient bard preserved by aristotle strabo and others and to the testimony of plutarch in his favor but on consulting the fragments he has referred to they rather fortify than remove my conjecture the scrap preserved by aristotle in his rhetoric is only half a verse and quoted without any commendation of its author the two citations in strabo amount to little more the curious reader may also find in athenaeus an epitaph on sardanapalus attributed to this poet who is mentioned by the same author as peculiarly addicted to the grosser excesses of the table  let us now return to that chaerilus whom horace has damned to everlasting fame the judicious and elegant roman satirist seems remarkably unjust in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his patron augustus at the expense of the macedonian hero alexander appears to have possessed much more poetical spirit and a higher relish for poetry than the coldblooded octavius it is peculiarly unfair to urge his liberality to a poor poet as a proof that he wanted critical discernment when he had himself so thoroughly vindicated the delicacy of his taste by the enthusiastic bonmot that he had rather be the thersites of homer than the achilles of chaerilus  note iv verse     when grave bossu by systems studied laws the grecian bards ideal picture draws though bossu is called the best explainer of aristotle and one of the most learned and judicious of modern critics by a writer for whose opinions i have much esteem i cannot help thinking that his celebrated essay on epic poetry is very ill calculated either to guide or to inspirit a young poet the absurdity of his advice concerning the mode of forming the fable by choosing a moral inventing the incidents and then searching history for names to suit them has been sufficiently exposed and as to his leading idea concerning the design of homer in the composition of the iliad and odyssey i apprehend most poetical readers must feel that he is probably mistaken for it is a conjectural point and placed beyond the possibility of decision perhaps few individuals differ more from each other in their modes of thinking by the force of education and of national manners than a modern french critic and an early poet of greece yet the former will often pretend with the most decisive air to lay open the sensorium of an ancient bard and to count every link in the chain of his ideas those who are most acquainted with the movements of imagination will acknowledge the steps of this airy power to be so light and evanescent in their nature that perhaps a poet himself in a few years after finishing his work might be utterly unable to recollect the exact train of thought or the various minute occurrences which led him to the general design or directed him in the particular parts of his poem but in spite of the interval of many hundred centuries the decisive magic of criticism can call up all the shadows of departed thought that ever existed in his brain and display with a most astonishing clearness the precise state of his mind in the moment of composition  homere says bossu  livre i chap   voyoit les grecs pour qui il ecrivoit divisez en autant detats quils avoient de villes considerables chacune faisoit un corpse a part and avoit sa form de gouvernement independamment de toutes les autres et toutefois ces etats differens etoient souvent obligez de se reunir comme en un seul corpse contre leurs ennemis communs voila sans doubt deux sorts de gouvernemens bien differens pour etre commodement reunis en un corpse de morale and en un seul poem  le poet en a donc fait deux fables separees lune est pour toute la greece reunie en un seul corpse mais composee de parties independantes les unes des autres comme else etoient en effect and lautre est pour chaque etat particulier tells quils etoient pendant la paix sans ce premier rapport and sans la necessete de se reunir  homere a donc pris pour le fond de sa fable cette grande verite que la mesintelligence des princes ruin leurs propres etats  on the odyssey bossu remarks que la verite qui sert de fond a cette fiction and qui avec elle compose la fable est que labsence dune person horse de chez soi ou qui na point loeil a ce qui sy fait y cause de grands desordres livre i chap  0   on the mature consideration of these two moral axioms the critic supposes the sublime bard to have begun his respective poems for homer continues he  livre i chap    navoit point dautre dessein que de former agreablement les moeurs de ses citoiens en leur proposant comme dit horace ce qui est utile ou pernicieux ce qui est honnete ou ce qui ne lest pas  il na entrepris de raconter aucune action particuliere dachille ou dulysse il a fait la fable et le dessein de ses poemes sans penser a ces princes and ensuite il leur a fait lhonneur de donner leurs noms aux heroes quil avoit feints  the preceding remarks of this celebrated critic have been frequently admired as an ingenious conjecture which most happily illustrates the real purpose of homer to me they appear so much the reverse that if i ventured to adopt any decided opinion on a point so much darkened by the clouds of antiquity i should rather incline to the idea which bossu affects to explode and suppose the poems of homer intended panegyrics on the very princes whom the critic affirms he never thought of while he was designing the works which have made them immortal  there is a striking passage on this subject in a dialogue of plato which i shall enlarge upon for two reasons  st as it proves that the latter persuasion concerning the purpose of homer was entertained at athens and  dly because it gives me a pleasing opportunity of supporting the learned madame dacier against an illgrounded censure of a late english critic in her preface to the odyssey she asserts that the judgment of antiquity decided in favor of the iliad and she appeals to part of the sentence in plato to which i have alluded as a proof of her assertion mr wood in a note to the introduction of his essay on homer endeavors to show the insufficiency of this proof and still farther to convince us that madame dacier was utterly mistaken in her sense of the passage to which she appealed if he ventures to contradict this learned lady he does not however insult her with that insolent pertness with which she is frequently treated in the notes to popes homer and which for the honor of our english poet i will not suppose to be his but though mr wood endeavors to support his opinion by argument i apprehend that he is himself mistaken and that madame dacier is perfectly right in understanding the words of socrates in their literal sense without the least mixture of irony it is true indeed that the aim of socrates in the course of the dialogue is to ridicule the presumption and ignorance of the sophist hippias in the most ironical manner but the particular speech on which madame dacier founds her opinion is a plain and simple address to eudicus before he enters on his debate with the sophist it turns on the most simple circumstance the truth of which eudicus could hardly be ignorant of namely the sentiments of his own father concerning the poems of homer as these sentiments are such as i believe most admirers of the ancient bard have entertained on the point in question i perfectly agree with madame dacier in thinking that socrates means to be literal and serious when he says to eudicus  plat hip min edit serrani tom i page      i have heard your father apemantus say that the iliad of homer was a finer poem than his odyssey and as far surpassed it in excellence as the virtue of achilles surpassed the virtue of ulysses for those two poems he said were purposely composed in honor of those two heroes the odyssey to show the virtues of ulysses the iliad those of achilles platos lesser hippias translated by sydenham page     let us now return to bossu whose opinion concerning the purpose of homer we may venture to oppose supported as it is by an ingenious interpretation of some ambiguous passages in the poetics of aristotle and this opposition may be grounded not so much on the sentence which i have quoted from plato as on the probable conduct of epic composition in the early ages of poetry in such periods as produced the talents of virgil and of dryden when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly understood we can easily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the mask of such heroic names as history could supply and their genius accommodate to their purpose we find accordingly that the roman bard is supposed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his emperor in the character of aeneas and that the english poet has with equal ingenuity enwrapt the dissolute charles the second in the jewish robes of king david but in so rude an age as we must admit that of homer to have been when the poet was certainly more the child of nature than of art when he had no history to consult perhaps no patron to flatter and no critics to elude or obey in such an age may we not more naturally conjecture that poetical composition was neither labored in its form nor deep in its design that instead of being the slow and systematic product of political reasoning it was the quick and artless offspring of a strong and vivifying fancy which brooding over the tales of tradition soon raised them into such life and beauty as must satisfy and enchant a warlike and popular audience ever ready to listen with delight to the heroic feats of their ancestors  if the learned bossu appears unfortunate in his system concerning the purpose of homer he may be thought still more so in his attempt to analyze the divinities of virgil for to throw new light on the convention of the gods in the opening of the tenth aeneid he very seriously informs us that  book v chap i venus is divine mercy or the love of god toward virtuous men and juno his justice  i cannot conclude these very free strictures on a celebrated author without bearing a pleasing testimony to the virtues of the man  bossu is allowed by the biographers of his country to have been remarkable for the mildest manners and most amiable disposition totally free from that imperious and bigoted attachment to speculative opinions which the science he cultivated is so apt to produce he endeared himself to boileau by a generous act of friendship that led to an intimacy between them which was dissolved only by the death of the former in    0  note v verse     imputes to virgil his own dark conceit as it requires much leisure to examine and more skill to unravel an intricate hypothesis twisted into a long and labored chain of quotation and argument the dissertation on the sixth book of virgil remained for some time unrefuted the public very quietly acquiesced in the strange position of its author that aeneass adventure to the infernal shades is no other than a figurative description of his initiation into the mysteries and particularly a very exact one of the spectacles of the eleusinian at length a superior but anonymous critic arose who in one of the most judicious and spirited essays that our nation has produced on a point of classical literature completely overturned this illfounded edifice and exposed the arrogance and futility of its assuming architect the essay i allude to is entitled critical observations on the sixth book of the aeneid printed for elmsly    0 and as this little publication is i believe no longer to be purchased the curious reader may thank me for transcribing a few of its most striking passages  having ridiculed with great spirit and propriety warburtons general idea of the aeneid as a political institute and his illsupported assertion that both the ancient and modern poets afforded virgil a pattern for introducing the mysteries into this famous episode the author proceeds to examine how far the critics hypothesis of initiation may be supported or overthrown by the text of the poet it is says he from extrinsical circumstances that we may expect the discovery of virgils allegory every one of these circumstances persuades me that virgil described a real not a mimic world and that the scene lay in the infernal shades and not in the temple of ceres  the singularity of the cumaean shores must be present to every traveller who has once seen them to a superstitious mind the thin crust vast cavities sulphurous steams poisonous exhalations and fiery torrents may seem to trace out the narrow confine of the two worlds the lake avernus was the chief object of religious horror the black woods which surrounded it when virgil first came to naples were perfectly suited to feed the superstition of the people strabo i v p      it was generally believed that this deadly flood was the entrance of

daring enterprise addresses himself to the priestess of those dark regions their conversation may perhaps inform us whether an initiation or a descent to the shades was the object of this enterprise

ad auras hoc opus hic labor est aeneid vi      these particulars are absolutely irreconcilable with the idea of initiation but perfectly agreeable to that of a real descent that every step and every instant may lead us to the grave is a melancholy truth the mysteries were only open at stated times a few days at most in the course of a year the mimic descent of the mysteries was laborious and dangerous the return to light easy and certain in real death this order is inverted  pauci quos aequus amavit jupiter aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus diis geniti potuere ibid vi      these heroes as we learn from the speech of aeneas were hercules orpheus castor and pollux theseus and pirithous of all these antiquity believed that before their death they had seen the habitations of the dead nor indeed will any of the circumstances tally with a supposed initiation the adventure of eurydice the alternate life of the brothers and the forcible intrusion of alcides theseus and pirithous would mock the endeavors of the most subtle critic who should try to melt them down into his favorite mysteries the exploits of hercules who triumphed over the king of terrors tartareum ille manu custodem

and embellish these popular traditions and it is the interest of every man of taste to acquiesce in their poetical fictions  virgil has borrowed as usual from homer his episode of the infernal shades and as usual has infinitely improved what the grecian had invented if among a profusion of beauties i durst venture to point out the most striking beauties of the sixth book i should perhaps observe   that after accompanying the hero through the silent realms of night and chaos we see with astonishment and pleasure a new creation bursting upon us   that we examine with a delight which springs from the love of virtue the just empire of minos in which the apparent irregularities of the present system are corrected where the patriot who died for his country is happy and the tyrant who oppressed it is miserable   as we interest ourselves in the heros fortunes we share his feelings  the melancholy palinurus the wretched deiphobus the indignant dido the grecian kings who tremble at his presence and the venerable anchises who embraces his pious son and displays to his sight the future glories of his race all these objects affect us with a variety of pleasing sensations  let us for a moment obey the mandate of our great critic and consider these aweful scenes as a mimic show exhibited in the temple of ceres by the contrivance of the priest or if he pleases of the legislator whatever was animated i appeal to every reader of taste whatever was terrible or whatever was pathetic evaporates into lifeless allegory  tenuem sine viribus umbram  dat inania verba dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis the end of philosophy is truth the end of poetry is pleasure i willingly adopt any interpretation which adds new beauties to the original i assist in persuading myself that it is just and could almost show the same indulgence to the critics as to the poets fiction but should a grave doctor lay out fourscore pages in explaining away the sense and spirit of virgil i should have every inducement to believe that virgils soul was very different from the doctors  having shown in this spirited manner how far the hypothesis of the critic is inconsistent with particular passages and with the general character of the poet the essayist proceeds to allege two simple reasons which persuade him that virgil has not revealed the secret of the eleusinian mysteries the first is his ignorance and the second his discretion the author then proves by very ingenious historical arguments  st that it is probable the poet was never initiated himself and  dly that if he were so it is more probable that he would not have violated the laws both of religion and of honor in betraying the secret of the mysteries particularly as that species of profanation is mentioned with abhorrence by a cotemporary poet  vetabo qui cereris sacrum vulgarit arcanae sub iisdem sit trabibus fragilemque mecum solvat phaselum hor liii od   when horace composed the ode which contains the preceding passage the aeneid continues my author and particularly the sixth book were already known to the public donat in virgil propert lii el xxv v     the detestation of the wretch who reveals the mysteries of ceres though expressed in general terms must be applied by all rome to the author of the sixth book of the aeneid can we seriously suppose that horace would have branded with such wanton infamy one of the men in the world whom he loved and honored the most hor li od   li sermon v ver    etc   nothing remains to say except that horace was himself ignorant of his friends allegorical meaning which the bishop of gloucester has since revealed to the world it may be so yet for my own part i should be very well satisfied with understanding virgil no better than horace did  such is the forcible reasoning of this ingenious and spirited writer i have been tempted to transcribe these considerable portions of his work by an idea perhaps an illfounded one that the circulation of his little pamphlet has not been equal to its merit but if it has been in any degree neglected by our country it has not escaped the researches or wanted the applause of a learned and judicious foreigner professor heyne the late accurate and accomplished editor of virgil has mentioned it in his comments to the sixth book of the aeneid with the honor it deserves he remarks indeed that the author has censured the learned prelate with some little acrimony paullo acrius quam velis but what lover of poetry unbiassed by personal connection can speak of warburton without some marks of indignation if i have also alluded to this famous commentator with a contemptuous asperity it arises from the persuasion that he has sullied the page of every poet whom he pretended to illustrate and that he frequently degraded the useful and generous profession of criticism into a mean instrument of personal malignity or to use the more forcible language of his greatest antagonist that he invested himself in the high office of inquisitor general and supreme judge of the opinions of the learned which he assumed and exercised with a ferocity and despotism without example in the republic of letters and hardly to be paralleled among the disciples of dominic letter to warburton by a late professor etc page    d edition  it is the just lot of tyrants to be detested and of all usurpers the literary despot is the least excusable as he has not the common tyrannical plea of necessity or interest to allege in his behalf for the prevalence of his edicts will be found to sink in proportion to the arbitrary tone with which they are pronounced the fate of warburton is a striking instance of this important truth what havoc has the course of very few years produced in that pile of imperious criticism which he had heaped together many of his notes on shakespeare have already resigned their place to the superior comments of more accomplished critics and perhaps the day is not far distant when the volumes of pope himself will cease to be a repository for the lumber of his friend the severest enemies of warburton must indeed allow that several of his remarks on his poetical patron are entitled to preservation by their use or beauty but the greater part i apprehend are equally destitute of both and how far the critic was capable of disgracing the poet must be evident to every reader who recollects that the nonsense in the essay on criticism where pegasus is made to snatch a grace which is justly censured by dr warton was first introduced into the poem by an arbitrary transposition of the editor  though arrogance is perhaps the most striking and characteristical defect in the composition of this assuming commentator he had certainly other critical failings of considerable importance and it may possibly be rendering some little service to the art which he professed to investigate the peculiarities in this singular writer which conspire to plunge him in the crowd of those evanescent critics if i may use such an expression whom his friend pope beheld in so clear a vision that he seems to have given us a prophetical portrait of his own commentator critics i saw that others names efface and fix their own with labor in the place their own like others soon their place resigned or disappeared and left the first behind i shall therefore hazard a few farther observations not only on this famous critic of our age and country but on the two greater names of antiquity to each of whom he has been declared superior by the partial voice of enthusiastic friendship i wish not to offend his most zealous adherents and though i cannot but consider him as a literary usurper i speak of him as a great historian said of more exalted tyrants sine ira et studio quorum causas procul habeo  there seem to be three natural endowments requisite in the formation of an accomplished critic  strong understanding lively imagination and refined sensibility the first was the characteristic of aristotle and by the consent of all ages he is allowed to have possessed it in a superlative degree may i be pardoned for the opinion that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the other two i would not absolutely say that he had neither fancy nor feeling but that his imagination was not brilliant and that his sensibility was not exquisite may i think be fairly presumed from the general tenor of his prose nor does the little relic of his poetry contradict the idea the two qualities in which aristotle may be supposed defective were the very two which peculiarly distinguish longinus who certainly wanted not understanding though he might not possess the philosophical sagacity of the stagyrite when considered in every point of view he appears the most consummate character among the critics of antiquity if warburton wore any resemblance to either of these mighty names i apprehend it must be to the former and perhaps in imagination he was superior to aristotle but of the three qualities which i have ventured to consider as requisite in the perfect critic i conceive him to have been miserably deficient in the last and certainly the most essential of the three for as the great commentator of horace has philosophically and truly remarked in a note to that poet feeling or sentiment is not only the surest but the sole ultimate arbiter of works of genius notes on the epistle to augustus ver   0  a man may possess an acute understanding and a lively imagination without being a sound critic and this truth perhaps cannot be more clearly shown than in the writings of warburton his understanding was undoubtedly acute his imagination was lively but imagination and sentiment are by no means synonymous and he certainly wanted those finer feelings which constitute accuracy of discernment and a perfect perception of literary excellence in consequence of this defect instead of seizing the real sense and intended beauties of an author he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy which led him in quest of secret meanings and mysterious allusions these he readily found and his powers of understanding enabled him to dress them up in a plausible and specious form and to persuade many readers that he was what he believed himself to be the restorer of genuine criticism as a farther proof that he was destitute of refined sensibility i might allege the peculiarity of his diction which as dr johnson has very justly remarked is coarse and impure perhaps it may be found that in proportion as authors have enjoyed the quality which i suppose him to have wanted they have been more or less distinguished by the ease the elegance and the beauty of their language were i required to fortify this conjecture by examples i should produce the names of virgil and racine of fenelon and addison  that addison who though insulted by the commentator of pope with the names of an indifferent poet and a worse critic was i think as much superior to his insulter in critical taste and in solidity of judgment as he confessedly was in the harmony of his style and in all the finer graces of beautiful composition  note vi verse     it is said by one who with this candid claim has gained no fading wreath of critic fame these and the six subsequent lines allude to the following passage in dr wartons essay on pope i conclude these reflections with a remarkable fact in no polished nation after criticism has been much studied and the rules of writing established has any very extraordinary work ever appeared this has visibly been the case in greece in rome and in france after aristotle horace and boileau had written their arts of poetry in our own country the rules of the drama for instance were never more completely understood than at present yet what uninteresting though faultless tragedies have we lately seen so much better is our judgment than our execution how to account for the fact here mentioned adequately and justly would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and caution which is occasioned by a rigid regard to the dictates of art or whether that philosophical that geometrical and systematical spirit so much in vogue which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite literature by consulting only reason has not diminished and destroyed sentiment and made our poets write from and to the head rather than the heart or whether lastly when just models from which the rules have necessarily been drawn have once appeared succeeding writers by vainly and ambitiously striving to surpass those just models and to shine and surprise do not become stiff and forced and affected in their thoughts and diction wartons essay page  0   d edition  i admire this ingenious and modest reasoning but for the honor of that severer art which this pleasing writer has the happy talent to enliven and embellish i will venture to start some doubts concerning the fact itself for which he endeavors to account perhaps our acquaintance with those writings of greece and rome which were subsequent to aristotle and horace is not sufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in respect to those countries but with regard to france may we not assert that her poetical productions which arose after the publication of boileaus didactic essay are at least equal if not superior to those which preceded that period if the henriade of voltaire is not a fine epic poem it is allowed to be the best which the french have to boast not to mention the dramatic works of that extraordinary and universal author if this remarkable fact may indeed be found true i should rather suppose it to arise from the irritable nature of the poetic spirit so peculiarly averse to restraint and control the bard who could gallop his pegasus over a free and open plain might be eager to engage in so pleasing an exercise but he who observed the directionposts so thickly and so perversely planted that instead of assisting his career they must probably occasion his fall would easily be tempted to descend from his steed and to decline the course let me illustrate this conjecture by a striking fact in the very words of the poet just mentioned who was by no means deficient in poetical confidence and who has left us the following anecdote of himself in that pleasing little anonymous work entitled commentaire historique sur les oeuvres de l auteur de la henriade il lut un jour plusieurs chants de ce poem chez le jeune president de maisons son intime ami on limpatienta par des objections il jetta son manuscrit dans le feu le president henaut len retira avec peine souvenez vous lui dit mr henaut dans une de ses lettres que cest moi qui ai sauve la henriade et quil men a coute une belle pair de manchettes  to return to the essay on pope  i rejoice that the amiable critic has at length obliged the public with the conclusion of his most engaging and ingenious work he has the singular talent to instruct and to please even those readers who are most ready to revolt from the opinion which he endeavors to establish and he has in some degree atoned for that excess of severity which his first volume discovered and which sunk the reputation of pope in the eyes of many who judge not for themselves even far below that mortifying level to which he meant to reduce it had pope been alive to add this spirited essay to the bundle of writings against himself which he is said to have collected he must have felt that like the dagger of brutus it gave the most painful blow from the character of the assailant all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them yet pope ascended not the throne of poetry by usurpation but was seated there by a legal title of which i shall speak farther in a subsequent note  note vii verse     his hallowed subject by that law forbid might still have laid in silent darkness hid boileaus art of poetry made its first appearance in      six years after the publication of paradise lost the verses of the french poet to which i have particularly alluded are these cest donc bien vainement que nos auteurs decus bannissant de leurs verse ces ornemens recus pensent fair agir dieu ses saints et ses prophets comme ces dieux eclos du cerveau des

toujours hurlant contre les cieux qui de votre heroes veut rabaisser la gloire et souvent avec dieu balance la victoire poetique de despreaux chant iii ver     etc  the preceding lines which are said to have been levelled at the clovis of desmaretz appear so pointed against the subject of milton that we might almost believe them intended as a satire on our divine bard there is nothing in boileaus admirable didactic essay so liable to objection as the whole passage concerning epic poetry his patronage of the old pagan divinities and his oblique recommendation of classical heroes are alike exceptionable even a higher name than boileau has failed in framing precepts for the epic muse the maxims delivered by tasso himself in his discourse on epic poetry are so far from perfect that an agreeable and judicious french critic has very justly said of him sil eut mis sa theorie en pratique son poem nauroit pas tant de charms marmontel poetique francoise  i am not so vain as to think of succeeding in the point where these immortal authors have failed and i must beg my reader to remember that the present work is by no means intended as a code of laws for the epic poet it is not my design to write receipts how poems may be made for i think the writer who would condescend to frame this higher species of composition according to the exact letter of any directions whatever may be most properly referred to that admirable receipt for an epic poem with which martinus scriblerus will happily supply him my serious desire is to examine and refute the prejudices which have produced as i apprehend the neglect of the heroic muse i wish to kindle in our poets a warmer sense of national honor with ambition to excel in the noblest province of poesy if my essay should excite that generous enthusiasm in the breast of any young poetic genius so far from wishing to confine him by any arbitrary dictates of my own imagination i should rather say to him in the words of dantes virgil

fame traduced by gallic wit homer like most transcendent characters has found detractors in every age we learn from a passage in the life of socrates by diogenes laertius that the great poet had in his lifetime an adversary named sagaris or syagrus and his calumniator zoilus is proverbially distinguished in the greek anthologia there is a sepulchral inscription on a slanderer of the sovereign bard which for its enthusiastic singularity i shall present to the reader           anthologia p  0 edit oxon      on parthenius the phocensian who calumniated homer here though deep buried he can

thorn for this dark furies in your snakes enroll and through cocytus drag the slandrous soul parthenius say the commentators was a disciple of dionysius of alexandria who flourished under nero and trajan erycius the author of the inscription is supposed to have lived in the same age among the modern adversaries of homer the french are most remarkable for their severity and injustice nor is it surprising that the nation which has displayed the faintest sparks of epic fire should be the most solicitous to reduce the oppressive splendour of this exalted luminary the most depreciating remarks on genius in every walk are generally made by those who are the least able to prove its rivals and often perhaps not so much from the prevalence of envious malignity as from the want of vivid and delicate perception the merits and the failings of homer were agitated in france with all the heat and acrimony of a theological dispute madame dacier distinguished herself in the contest by her uncommon talents and erudition she combated for the grecian bard with the spirit of minerva defending the father of the gods it must however be confessed that she sometimes overstepped the modesty of wisdom and caught unwarily the scolding tone of juno it is indeed amusing to observe a people who pique themselves on their extreme politeness and censure homer for the gross behavior of his gods engaging among themselves in a squabble concerning this very poet with all the unrefined animosity of his olympian synod in the whole controversy there is nothing more worthy of remembrance and of praise than the lively elegance and the pleasing good humor of mr de la motte who though not one of the most exalted was certainly one of the most amiable characters in the literary world and made a generous return to the severity of his female antagonist by writing an ode in her praise voltaire has pointed out with his usual spirit the failings of la motte in his abridgement of the iliad but he has frequently fallen himself into similar defects and is equally unjust to homer against whom he has levelled the most bitter sarcasms both in prose and verse voltaire attacking homer is like paris shooting his arrow at the heel of achilles the two poets are as unequal as the two ancient warriors yet homer like achilles may have his vulnerable spot but with this happy difference that although the shaft of ridicule which is pointed against him may be tinged with venom its wound cannot be mortal perhaps no better answer can be made to all those who amuse themselves with writing against homer than the following reply of madame dacier to the abbe terrasson who had attacked her favorite bard in two abusive volumes  que monsieur labbe terrasson trouve homere sot ridicule extravagant ennuyeux cest son affair le public jugera si cest un defaut a homere de deplaire a m labbe terrasson ou a m labbe terrasson de ne pas gouter homere  note ii verse    even socrates himself that purest sage

dion chrysostom p      note iii verse     how high soever she leads his daring flight etc i mean not to injure the dignity of pindar by this assertion though quinctilian in drawing the character of the grecian lyric poets has given him high preeminence in that choir we may i think very fairly conjecture that some odes of alcaeus and stesichorus were not inferior to those of the theban bard who is said to have been repeatedly vanquished in a poetical contest by his female antagonist corinna the absurd jealousy of our sex concerning literary talents has led some eminent writers to question the merits of corinna as olearius has observed in his dissertation on the female poets of greece but her glory seems to have been fully established by the public memorial of her picture exhibited in her native city and adorned with a symbol of her victory pausanias who saw it supposes her to have been one of the handsomest women of her time and the ingenuity of some critics imputes her success in the poetical contest to the influence of her beauty they have taken some liberties less pardonable with her literary reputation and by their curious comments on a single greek syllable made the sublime pindar call his fair rival a sow though the unfortunate word  which may be twisted into that meaning signifies in its more obvious construction that the poet challenged his successful antagonist to a new trial of skill  for a more minute account of this singular piece of criticism i must refer the reader to the notes on corinna in the fragmenta poetriarum by wolfius time has left us only a few diminutive scraps of corinnas poetry but plutarch in his treatise on the glory of the athenians has preserved one of her critical bonmots which may deserve to be repeated that author asserts that corinna instructed pindar in his youth and advised him to adorn his composition with the embellishments of fable the obedient poet soon brought her some verses in which he had followed her advice rather too freely when his tutress smiling at his profusion   note iv verse     yet may not judgment with severe disdain slight the young rhodians variegated strain apollonius surnamed the rhodian from the place of his residence is supposed to have been a native of alexandria where he is said to have recited some portion of his poem while he was yet a youth finding it ill received by his countrymen he retired to rhodes where he is conjectured to have polished and completed his work supporting himself by the profession of rhetoric and receiving from the rhodians the freedom of their city he at length returned with considerable honor to the place of his birth succeeding eratosthenes in the care of the alexandrian library in the reign of ptolemy euergetes who ascended the throne of egypt in the year before christ     that prince had been educated by the famous aristarchus and rivalled the preceding sovereigns of his liberal family in the munificent encouragement of learning apollonius was a disciple of the poet callimachus but their connection ended in the most violent enmity which was probably owing to some degree of contempt expressed by apollonius for the light compositions of his master the learned have vainly endeavored to discover the particulars of their quarrel  the only work of apollonius which has descended to modern times is his poem in four books on the argonautic expedition both longinus and quintilian have assigned to this work the mortifying character of mediocrity but there lies an appeal from the sentence of the most candid and enlightened critics to the voice of nature and the merit of apollonius has little to apprehend from the decision of this ultimate judge his poem abounds in animated description and in passages of the most tender and pathetic beauty how finely painted is the first setting forth of the argo and how beautifully is the wife of chiron introduced holding up the little achilles in her arms and showing him to his father peleus as he sailed along the shore but the chief excellence in our poet is the spirit and delicacy with which he has delineated the passion of love in his medea that virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular is sufficiently evident from the minute exactness with which he has copied many tender touches of the grecian poet those who compare the third book of apollonius with the fourth of virgil may i think perceive not only that dido has some features of medea but that the two bards however different in their reputation resembled each other in their genius and that they both excel in delicacy and pathos  note v verse   0 virgil sinks loaded with their heavy praise scaliger appears to be the most extravagant of all the critics who have lavished their undistinguishing encomiums on virgil by asserting that he alone is entitled to the name of poet poetices lib iii c    though the opinion of spence and other modern critics concerning the character of aeneas considered as an allegorical portrait of augustus seems to gain ground yet it might perhaps be easy to overturn the ingenious conjectures and the fanciful reasoning by which that idea has been supported this attempt would have the sanction of one of the most judicious commentators of virgil for the learned heyne expressly rejects all allegorical interpretation and thinks it improbable that a poet of so correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which must necessarily contract and cramp his powers he even ventures to assert that if the character of aeneas was delineated as an allegorical portrait of augustus the execution of it is unhappy the strongest argument which has been adduced to support this conjecture is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following passage in the opening of the third georgic primus ego in patriam mecum modo vita supersit aonio rediens deducam vertice musas primus idumaeas referam tibi mantua palmas et viridi in campo templum de marmore ponam propter aquam tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat mincius et tenera praetexit arundine ripas in medio mihi caesar erit templumque tenebit etc   these lines in which virgil expresses his intention of dedicating a temple to augustus have been considered as the noblest allegory of ancient poetry hurds horace volii page     and the great critic who first started the idea has expatiated in the triumph of his discovery on the mysterious beauties they contain but the whole of this hypothesis is unfortunately built upon the rejection of three verses which are pronounced unworthy of the poet and which though found in every ms the critic claims a right of removing a license so extraordinary cannot even be justified by the talents of this accomplished writer for if the less elegant passages of the ancient poets might be removed at pleasure their compositions would be exposed to the caprice of every fantastic commentator the obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unnecessary but is more agreeable to the judgment of the poet and the manners of his age the custom of erecting real temples was so familiar to antiquity that a roman would never have suspected the edifice was to be raised only with poetical materials we may even conjecture from a line of statius that the poet himself had a temple erected to his memory and without any breach of probability we may admit his intention of giving his living emperor such a testimony of his gratitude this adulation though shocking to us was too generally justified by example to oblige the poet to palliate it by a fiction he had before acquiesced in the divinity of his imperial patron and had expressed the idea in its full sense  namque erit ille mihi semper deus illius aram saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus eclog i ingredere et votis jam nunc assuesce vocari georg i having made such an invocation in the beginning of his work was his delicacy afterward to be shocked and oblige him to pay a compliment under the disguise of an obscure conceit for that allegory must be allowed to be obscure which had remained through so many ages unexplained the unfortunate rejected lines for whose elegance we do not contend may at least be rescued from impropriety by a literal interpretation of the preceding passage for dismiss the conjectured allegory and the chief objections against them remain no longer if the phraseology be peculiar it is at least supported by concurring mss the adjective ardens is sometimes undoubtedly joined to a word that does not denote a substance of heat or flame as the critic himself admits in the case of ardentes hosts to which we may add the verbum ardens of cicero as to the line which is said to contain the most glaring note of illegitimacy tithoni prima quot abest ab origin caesar many reasons might induce the poet to use the name of tithonus which at this distance of time it is not easy for us to conjecture perhaps he chose it to vary the expression of assaraci proles which he had adopted in the preceding lines the absurdity of the subject matter and the place in which it is introduced that are insisted on as the principal objections arise solely from the allegorical hypothesis without it the construction will be plain and natural the poet expresses his intention of erecting a temple to augustus and expatiates on the magnificence with which it was to be adorned he then returns to his present poetical subject interea dryadum sylvas saltusque sequamur and having dwelt a little on that to avoid too long a digression very naturally resumes the praises of the emperor by alluding to the sublimer song which he intended to devote to him hereafter mox tamen ardentes accingar dicere pugnas caesaris  perhaps the important position that gave rise to this conjecture and to others of a similar complexion that the propriety of allegorical composition made the distinguished pride of ancient poetry is as questionable as the conjecture itself and a diligent and judicious perusal of the ancient poets might convince us that simplicity was their genuine character and that many of their allegorical beauties have originated in the fertile imagination of their commentators aristarchus indeed the celebrated model of ancient criticism rejected with great spirit the allegorical interpretations of homer as we are informed by eusthathius but the good archbishop of thessalonica who like some modern prelates had a passion for allegory censures the great critic of alexandria for his more simple mode of construction and supposes it an injury to the refined beauties and profound wisdom of the poet  eusth vol iii page   00  note vi verse   0 shall historys pen to aid his vengeance won there is hardly any eminent personage of antiquity who has suffered more from detraction both in his literary and moral character than the poet lucan his fate indeed seems in all points to have been peculiarly severe his early death at an age when few poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work is itself sufficient to excite our compassion and regret but to perish by the envious tyranny of nero may be considered as a blessing when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with infamy in the immortal pages of tacitus as i am persuaded that the great historian has inadvertently adopted the grossest calumny against our poet i shall most readily assign my reasons for thinking so it may first be proper to give a short sketch of lucans life  he was the son of anneus mela the youngest brother of seneca and though born at corduba was conveyed to rome at the age of eight months a circumstance as his more indulgent critics observe which sufficiently refutes the censure of those who consider his language as provincial at rome he was educated under the stoic cornutus so warmly celebrated by his disciple persius the satirist who was the intimate friend of our poet in the close of his education lucan is said to have passed some time at athens on his return to rome he rose to the office of quaestor before he had attained the legal age he was afterward enrolled among the augurs and married a lady of noble birth of whose amiable character i shall speak more at large in a subsequent note lucan had for some time been admitted to familiarity with nero when the emperor chose to contend for poetical honors by the public recital of a poem he had composed on niobe and some verses of this imperial production are supposed to be preserved in the first satire of persius lucan had the hardiness to repeat a poem on orpheus in competition with that of nero and what is more remarkable the judges of the contest were just and bold enough to decide against the emperor from hence nero became the persecutor of his successful rival and forbade him to produce any poetry in public the wellknown conspiracy of piso against the tyrant soon followed and tacitus with his usual sarcastic severity concludes that lucan engaged in the enterprise from the poetical injuries he had received a remark which does little credit to the candor of the historian who might have found a much nobler and i will add a more probable motive for his conduct in the generous ardor of his character and his passionate adoration of freedom in the sequel of his narration tacitus alleges a charge against our poet which if it were true must lead us to detest him as the most abject of mankind the historian asserts that lucan when accused of the conspiracy for some time denied the charge but corrupted at last by a promise of impunity and desirous to atone for the tardiness of his confession accused his mother atilla as his accomplice this circumstance is so improbable in itself and so little consonant to the general character of lucan that some writers have treated it with contempt as a calumny invented by nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence but the name of tacitus has given such an air of authority to the story that it may seem to deserve a more serious discussion particularly as there are two subsequent events related by the same historian which have a tendency to invalidate the accusation so injurious to our poet the events i mean are the fate of annaeus and the escape of atilla the two parents of lucan the former died in consequence of art accusation brought against him after the death of his son by fabius romanus who had been intimate with lucan and forged some letters in his name with the design of proving his father concerned in the conspiracy these letters were produced to nero who sent them to annaeus from an eager desire says tacitus to get possession of his wealth from this fact two inferences may be drawn according to the different lights in which it may be considered  if the accusation against annaeus was just it is clear that lucan had not betrayed his father and he appears the less likely to have endangered by his confession the life of a parent to whom he owed a still tenderer regard  if annaeus was not involved in the conspiracy and merely put to death by nero for the sake of his treasure we may the more readily believe that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice might calumniate the son from envy but the escape of atilla affords us the strongest reason to conclude that lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery of which tacitus has supposed him guilty had the poet really named his mother as his accomplice would the vindictive and sanguinary nero have spared the life of a woman whose family he detested particularly when other females were put to death for their share in the conspiracy that atilla was not in that number the historian himself informs us in the following remarkable sentence atilla matter annaei lucani sine absolutione sine supplicio dissimulata thus translated by gordon the information against atilla the mother of lucan was dissembled and without being cleared she escaped unpunished  the preceding remarks will i hope vindicate to every candid mind the honor of our poet whose firmness and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly displayed in that picture of his death which tacitus himself has given us i shall present it to the english reader in the words of gordon  lucan while his blood issued in streams perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and stiffen and life to retire by little and little to the extremities while his heart was still beating with vital warmth and his faculties no wise impaired recollected some lines of his own which described a wounded soldier expiring in a manner that resembled this the lines themselves he rehearsed and they were the last words he ever uttered the annals of tacitus book xv  the critics differ concerning the verses of the pharsalia which the author quoted in so memorable a manner i shall transcribe the two passages he is supposed to have repeated and only add that lipsius contends for the latter  sanguis erant lacrymae quaecunque foramina novit humor ab his largus manat cruor ora redundant et patulae nares sudor rubet omnia plenis membra fluunt venis totum est pro vulnere corpus lib ix     now the warm blood at once from every part ran purple poison down and drained the fainting heart blood falls for tears and over his mournful face the ruddy drops their tainted passage trace wherever the liquid juices find a way there streams of blood there crimson rivers stray his mouth and gushing nostrils pour a flood and even the pores ouze out the trickling blood in the red deluge all the parts lie drowned and the whole body seems one bleeding wound row scinditur avulsus nec sicut vulnere sanguis emicuit lentus ruptis cadit undique venis discursusque animae diversa in membra meantis interceptus aquis lib iii v     no single wound the gaping rupture seems where trickling crimson wells in slender streams but from an opening horrible and wide a thousand vessels pour the bursting tide at once the winding channels course was broke where wandering life her mazy journey took at once the currents all forgot their way and lost their purple in the azure sea row such was the death of lucan before he had completed his twentyseventh year if his character as a man has been injured by the historian his poetical reputation has been treated not less injuriously by the critics quintilian by a frivolous distinction disputes his title to be classed among the poets and scaliger says with a brutality of language disgraceful only to himself that he seems rather to bark than to sing but these insults may appear amply compensated when we remember that in the most polished nations of modern europe the most elevated and poetic spirits have been his warmest admirers that in france he was idolized by corneille and in england translated by row  the severest censures on lucan have proceeded from those who have unfairly compared his language to that of virgil but how unjust and absurd is such a comparison it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry taken rough from the quarry to the most beautiful supersicies of polished marble how differently should we think of virgil as a poet if we possessed only the verses which he wrote at that period of life when lucan composed his pharsalia in the disposition of his subject in the propriety and elegance of diction he is undoubtedly far inferior to virgil but if we attend to the bold originality of his design and to the vigor of his sentiments if we consider the pharsalia as the rapid and uncorrected sketch of a young poet executed in an age when the spirit of his countrymen was broken and their taste in literature corrupted it may justly be esteemed as one of the most noble and most wonderful productions of the human mind  note vii verse     as lesbos paid to pompeys lovely wife pompey after his defeat at pharsalia proceeded to lesbos as he had left his wife cornelia to the protection of that island which received the unfortunate hero with a sublime generosity the lesbians entreated him to remain amongst them and promised to defend him pompey expressed his gratitude for their fidelity but declined the offer and embarked with cornelia the concern of this gallant people on the departure of their amiable guest is thus described by lucan  dixit moestamque carinae imposuit comitem cunctos mutare putares tellurem patriaeque solum sie litore toto plangitur infestae tenduntur in aethera dextrae pompeiumque minus cujus fortuna dolorem moverat ast illam quam toto

argentaria on your canvass shine polla argentaria was the daughter of a roman senator and the wife of lucan she is said to have transcribed and corrected the three first books of the pharsalia after the death of her husband it is much to be regretted that we possess not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accomplished woman but her name is immortalized by two surviving poets of that age the veneration which she paid to the memory of her husband is recorded by martial and more poetically described in that pleasing and elegant little production of statius genethliacon lucani a poem which i the more readily commend as i may be thought by some readers unjust toward its author in omitting to celebrate his thebaid i confess indeed the miscellaneous poems of statius appear to me his most valuable work in most of these there is much imagination and sentiment in harmonious and spirited verse the little poem which i have mentioned on the anniversary of lucans birth is said to have been written at the request of argentaria the author after invoking the poetical deities to attend the ceremony touches with great delicacy and spirit on the compositions of lucans childhood which are lost and the pharsalia the production of his early youth he then pays a short compliment to the beauty and talents of argentaria laments the cruel fate which deprived her so immaturely of domestic happiness and concludes with the following address to the shade of lucan at tu seu rapidum poli per axem famae curribus arduis levatus qua surgunt animae potentiores terras despicis et sepulchra rides seu pacis meritum nemus reclusae felix elysiis tenes in oris quo pharsalica turba congregatur et te nobile carmen insonantem pompeii comitantur et catones tu magna sacer et

not your high and hallowed soul distant you hear that wailing coast and see the guilty neros ghost grow pale with anguish and affright his mother flashing on his sight be present to your pollas vows

grief its anguish over what it lamented now adore   i cannot close this note without observing that the preceding verses have a strong tendency to prove that lucan was perfectly innocent in regard to the accusation which i have examined before had he been really guilty of basely endangering the life of his mother it is not probable that his wife would have honored his memory with such enthusiastic veneration or that statius in verses designed to do him honor would have alluded to the mother of nero the reader will pardon my recurring to this subject as it is pleasing to make use of every

learned polycarp leyser after having patiently traced the obscure progress of latin poetry through all the dark ages indeed the merit of some latin poets in a period that we commonly suppose involved in the grossest barbarism is singularly striking many of these are of the epic kind and as they describe the manners and customs of their respective times a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work i shall briefly mention such as appear most worthy of notice  abbo a parisian monk of the benedictine order wrote a poem on the siege of paris by the normans and the danes at which he was present in the year     it is printed in the second volume of duchesnes scriptfrancorum and though it has little or no poetical merit may be regarded as an historical curiosity the following lines addressed to the city of paris in the beginning of the work may serve as a specimen of its language dic igitur praepulchra polis quod danea munus libavit tibimet soboles plutonis amica tempore quo praesul domini et dulcissimus heroes gozlinus temet pastorque benignus alebat haec inquit miror narrare potest aliquisne nonne tuis idem vidisti oculis refer ergo vidi equidem jussisque tuis parebo libenter   leyser has confounded this poet with another of this name but fabricius has corrected the mistake in his bibliotheca latina mediae et infimae aetatis  guido bishop of amiens from the year  0   to  0   wrote an heroic poem on the exploits of william the conqueror in which according to ordericus vitalis he imitated both virgil and statius william of apulia composed at the request of pope urban the iid a poem in five books on the actions of the normans in sicily apulia and calabria to the death of robert guiscard their prince addressing his work to the son of that hero it was written between the years  0 0 and  0   first printed in       to and again in muratoris script ital du cange in his notes to the alexiad of the princess anna comnena has illustrated that history by frequent and long quotations from william of apulia but though the learned critic gives him the title of scriptor egregius his poetry appears to me but a few degrees superior to that of the monk abbo whom i have just mentioned the reader may judge from the following passage which i select not only as a specimen of the authors style but as it shows that the wives of these martial princes shared with them in all the perils of war  uxor in hoc bello roberti forte sagitta quadam laesa fuit quae vulnere territa nullam dum sperabat opem se pene subegerat hosti navigio cujus se commendare volebat instantis metuens vicina pericula lethi hanc deus eripuit fieri ludibria nolens matronae tantae tam nobilis et venerandae the princess comnena has also celebrated the fortitude which this heroine whose name was gaita displayed in the battle and it is remarkable that the royal female historian describes the noble amazon more poetically than the latin poet  gualfredo an italian who succeeded to the bishopric of siena in the year  0 0 and died in      wrote an heroic poem on the expedition of godfrey of boulogne which is said to be still preserved in ms at siena i believe gualfredo is the first poet in point of time who treated of the happy subject of the crusades which was afterward embellished by two very elegant writers of latin verse iscanus and gunther of whom i shall presently speak and at length received its highest honor from the genius of tasso there is also an early latin poem on this subject the joint production of two writers named fulco and aegidius whom the accurate fabricius places in the beginning of the   th century the title of the work is historia gestorum viae nostri temporis hierosolymitanae it is printed in the fourth volume of duchesnes script franc and with considerable additions in the third volume of anecdota edmundi martene i transcribe part of the opening of this poem as the curious reader may have a pleasure in comparing it with that of tasso ardor inest inquam sententia fixaque menti versibus et numeris transmittere posteritati qualiter instinctu deitatis et auspice cultu est aggressa via memorando nobilis

pugnans carnes resecaret et ossa sive eques atque pedes propelleret agmina densa hic inimicitiis cunctis sibi conciliatis cunctis possessis pro christi pace relictis arripuit callem christum sectando vocantem the poem closes with the capture of jerusalem  laurentius of verona who flourished about the year    0 wrote an heroic poem in seven books entitled rerum in majorica pisanorum edidit ughellus tom   italiae sacrae  but in merit and reputation these early latin poets of modern time are very far inferior to philip gualtier de chatillon who seems to have been the first that caught any portion of true poetic spirit in latin verse he was provost of the canons of tournay fabricius calls him episcopus magalonensis bib lat tom ii p     about the year   00 according to mr warton who has given some specimens of his style in the second dissertation prefixed to his admirable history of english poetry i shall therefore only add that the best edition of his alexandreid an heroic poem in ten books on alexander the great was printed at leyden  to       the superior merit of josephus iscanus or joseph of exeter has been also displayed by the same judicious encomiast in the dissertation i have mentioned nor has he failed to commemorate two latin epic poets of the same period and of considerable merit for the time in which they lived  gunther and william of bretagny the first was a german monk who wrote after the year   0  and has left various historical and poetical works particularly two of the epic kind  solymarium a poem on the taking of jerusalem by godfrey of bulloign and another entitled ligurinus on the exploits of the emperor frederick barbarossa which he completed during the life of that prince the first was never printed of the latter there have been several editions and one by the celebrated melancthon in      that his poetical merit was considerable in many respects will appear from the following verses in which he speaks of himself  hoc quoque me famae si desint caetera solum conciliare potest quod jam per multa latentes saecula nec clausis prodire penatibus ausas pierides vulgar paro priscumque nitorem reddere carminibus tardosque citare poetas william of bretagny was preceptor to pierre charlot natural son of philip augustus king of france and addressed a poem to his pupil entitled karlotis which is yet unpublished but his greater work called philippis an heroic poem in twelve books is printed in the collections of duchesne and pithaeus and in a separate  to volume with a copious commentary by barthius notwithstanding the praises bestowed on this author by his learned commentator who prefers him to all his contemporaries he appears to me inferior in poetic spirit to his three rivals gualtier de chatillon iscanus and gunther yet his work is by no means despicable in its style and may be considered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived for he was himself engaged in many of the scenes which he describes his professed design is to celebrate the exploits of philip augustus and he closes his poem with the death of that monarch which happened in      he addresses his work in two separate poetical dedications to lewis the successor of philip and to pierre charlot his natural son who was bishop of noyon in    0 and died      he seems to have been excited to this composition by the reputation of gualtiers alexandreid to which he thus alludes in the verses addressed to lewis gesta ducis macedum celebri describere versu si licuit gualtere tibi quae sola relatu multivago docuit te vociferatio famae cur ego quae novi proprio quae lumine vidi non ausim magni magnalia scribere regis qui nec alexandro minor est virtute nec illo urbi rumuleae totum qui subdidit orbem   he takes occasion also in two other parts of his poem to pay a liberal compliment to gualtier to whom in poetical ability he confesses himself inferior but this inferiority his admirer barthius will not allow of their respective talents the reader may judge who will compare the passage which mr warton has cited from the alexandreid with the following lines in which william of bretagny uses the very simile of his predecessor comparing his hero philip to a young lion  rex dolet ereptum comitem sibi frendit et irae occultare nequit tectos sub pectore motus nam rubor in vultu duplicatus prodit aperte quam gravis illustrem trahit

subsequitur presso relegens vestigia gressu i will add the following passage from the eleventh book as it contains an animated portrait and a simile more original than the preceding  at laevo in cornu

belvacenumque philippum bolonides  william of bretagny had an immediate successor in latin poetry who appears to have at least an equal portion of poetical spirit the name of this author is nicholas de brai who wrote an heroic poem on the actions of louis the viiith after the death of that monarch and addressed it to william of auvergne who was bishop of paris from the year      to      as a specimen of his descriptive power i select the following lines which form part of a long description of a goblet presented to the king on his accession  parant intrare palatia regis magnifici cives gratissima dona ferentes tegmina quos ornant variis insculpta figuris et patrem patriae jucunda voce salutant et genibus flexis praesentant ditia dona offertur crater quem si sit credere dignum

describe thebes and troy as they are figured on this superb goblet and concludes his account of the workmanship with the four following lines of peculiar beauty for the age in which they appeared martis adulterium resupino margin pinxit mulciber et venerem laqueis cum mart ligavit pluraque caelasset sub margin sed pudor illi obstat et ingentis renovatur causa doloris   this poem which the author seems to have left imperfect is printed in the fifth volume of duchesnes script francorum  england is said to have produced another heroic poet of considerable merit who celebrated in latin verse the exploits of richard the first and who was called gulielmus peregrinus from his having attended that prince to the holy land leland mentions him by the name of gulielmus de canno and pits calls him poetarum sui temporis apud nostrates facile princeps but i do not find that his work was ever printed nor do the several biographical writers who speak of him inform us where it exists in ms  in italy the latin language is supposed to have been cultivated with still greater success and the restoration of its purity is in great measure ascribed to albertino mussato whose merits were first displayed to our country by the learned author of the essay on pope  mussato was a paduan of high rank and great talents but unfortunate he died in exile      and left besides many smaller latin pieces an heroic poem de gestis italorum post henricum vii caesarem seu de obsidione domini canis grandis de verona circa maenia paduanae civitatis et conflictu ejus  quadrio from whom i transcribe this title says it is printed in the tenth volume of muratori vossius who speaks of him as an historian asserts that he commanded in the war which is the subject of his poem  in a few years after the death of mussato petrarch received the laurel at rome for his latin epic poem entitled africa a performance which has sunk so remarkably from the high reputation it once obtained that the great admirer and encomiast of petrarch who has published three entertaining quarto volumes on his life calls it un ouvrage sans chaleur sans invention sans interet qui na pas meme le merit de la versification and du style and dont il est impossible de soutenir la lecture  i must observe however that tasso in his essay on epic poetry bestows a very high encomium on that part of petrarchs latin poem in which he celebrates the loves of sophonisba and masinissa and indeed the censure of this amiable french writer who in other points has done ample justice to the merits of petrarch appears to me infinitely too severe there are many passages in this neglected poem conceived with great force and imagination and expressed with equal elegance of language i shall select some verses from that part of it which has been honored by the applause of tasso the following lines describe the anguish of the young numidian prince when he is constrained to abandon his lovely bride volvitur inde thoro quoniam sub pectore pernox saevit amor lacerantque truces praecordia curae uritur invigilant moeror metus ira furorque saepe and absentem lacrymans dum stringit amicam saepe thoro dedit amplexus et dulcia verba postquam nulla valent violento fraena dolori incipit et longis solatur damna querelis cura mihi nimium vita mihi dulcior omni sophonisba vale non te mea cura videbo leniter aethereos

aeterno connexi foedere nec nos ferreus aut aequos scipio interrumpet amores   the wellknown catastrophe of the unfortunate sophonisba is related with much poetical spirit the close of her life and her first appearance in the regions of the dead are peculiarly striking  illa manu pateramque tenens and lumina coelo attollens sol alme inquit superique valete masinissa vale nostri memor inde

verendus et vetus egregia majestas front manebat indignata tamen superis irataque morti ibat et exiguo defigens lumina flexu with petrarch i may close this cursory review of the neglected authors who wrote heroic poems in latin during the course of the dark ages  a peculiar circumstance induces me to add another name to the preceding list john abbot of peterborough in the reign of edward the third wrote an heroic poem entitled bellum navarrense      de petro rege aragoniae and edwardo principe this performance containing five hundred and sixty verses is said to be preserved in ms in the bodleian library and i have thought it worthy of notice because it treats of the very subject on which dryden informs us he had once projected an epic poem  of the many latin compositions of the epic kind which later times have produced the christiad of vida the sarcotis of massenius and the constantine of mambrun appear to me the most worthy of regard but even these are seldom perused and indeed the poet who in a polished age prefers the use of a dead language to that of a living one can only expect and perhaps only deserves the attention of a few curious sequestered students  note iv verse    thy daring dante his wild vision sung dante allighieri was born at florence in may      of an ancient and honorable family boccacio who lived in the same period has left a very curious and entertaining treatise on the life the studies and manners of this extraordinary poet whom he regarded as his master and for whose memory he professed the highest veneration this interesting biographer relates that dante before he was nine years old conceived a passion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his singular poem her age was near his own and her name was beatrice the daughter of folco portinari a noble citizen of florence of this fair one the best accounts are obscure some refining commentators have even denied her corporeal existence affirming her to be nothing more or less than theology but we may question if theology was ever the mistress of so young a lover the passion of dante however like that of his successor petrarch seems to have been of the chaste and platonic kind according to the account he has himself given of it in one of his early productions entitled vita nuova a mixture of mysterious poetry and prose in which he mentions both the origin of his affection and the death of his mistress who according to boccacio died at the age of twentyfour the same author asserts that dante fell into a deep melancholy in consequence of this event from which his friends endeavored to raise him by persuading him to marriage after some time he followed their advice and repented it for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore some resemblance to the celebrated xantippe the poet not possessing the patience of socrates separated himself from her with such vehement expressions of dislike that he never afterward admitted her to his presence though she had borne him several children  in the early part of his life he gained some credit in a military character distinguishing himself by his bravery in an action where the florentines obtained a signal victory over the citizens of arezzo he became still more eminent by the acquisition of civil honors and at the age of thirtyfive he rose to be one of the chief magistrates of florence when that dignity was conferred by the suffrages of the people from this exaltation the poet himself dated his principal misfortunes as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by lionardo bruni one of his early biographers where dante speaks of his political failure with that liberal frankness which integrity inspires  italy was at that time distracted by the contending factions of the ghibellins and the guelphs the latter among whom dante took an active part were again divided into the blacks and the whites dante says gravina exerted all his influence to unite these inferior parties but his efforts were ineffectual and he had the misfortune to be unjustly persecuted by those of his own faction a powerful citizen of florence named corso donati had taken measures to terminate these intestine broils by introducing charles of valois brother to philip the fair king of france dante with great vehemence opposed this disgraceful project and obtained the banishment of donati and his partisans the exiles applied to the pope boniface the viiith and by his assistance succeeded in their design charles of valois entered florence in triumph and those who had opposed his admission were banished in their turn dante had been dispatched to rome as the ambassador of his party and was returning when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city his enemies availing themselves of his absence had procured an iniquitous sentence against him by which he was condemned to banishment and his possessions were confiscated his two enthusiastic biographers boccacio acid manetti express the warmest indignation against this injustice of his country dante on receiving the intelligence took refuge in siena and afterward in arezzo where many of his party were assembled an attempt was made to surprise the city of florence by a small army which dante is supposed to have attended the design miscarried and our poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of italy till he found a patron in the great can della scala prince of verona whom he has celebrated in his poem the high spirit of dante was ill suited to courtly dependence and he is said to have lost the favor of his veroneze patron by the rough frankness of his behavior from verona he retired to france according to manetti and boccacio affirms that he disputed in the theological schools of paris with great reputation bail questions his visiting paris at this period of his life and thinks it improbable that a man who had been one of the chief magistrates of florence should condescend to engage in the public squabbles of the parisian theologists but the spirit both of dante and the times in which he lived sufficiently account for this exercise of his talents and his residence in france at this season is confirmed by boccacio in his life of our poet which bail seems to have had no opportunity of consulting  the election of henry count of luxemburgh to the empire in november   0  afforded dante a prospect of being restored to his native city as he attached himself to the interest of the new emperor in whose service he is supposed to have written his latin treatise de monarchia in which he asserted the rights of the empire against the encroachments of the papacy in the year      he instigated henry to lay siege to florence in which enterprise says one of his biographers he did not appear in person from motives of respect toward his native city the emperor was repulsed by the florentines and his death which happened in the succeeding year deprived dante of all hopes concerning his reestablishment in florence  after this disappointment he is supposed to have passed some years in roving about italy in a state of poverty and distress till he found an honorable establishment at ravenna under the protection of guido novello da polenta the lord of that city who received this illustrious exile with the most endearing liberality continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life and extended his munificence to the ashes of the poet  eloquence was one of the many talents which dante possessed in an eminent degree on this account he is said to have been employed on fourteen different embassies in the course of his life and to have succeeded in most of them his patron guido had occasion to try his abilities in a service of this nature and dispatched him as his ambassador to negociate a peace with the venetians who were preparing for hostilities against ravenna manetti asserts that he was unable to procure a public audience at venice and returned to ravenna by land from his apprehensions of the venetian fleet when the fatigue of his journey and the mortification of failing in his attempt to preserve his generous patron from the impending danger threw him into a fever which terminated in death on the   th of september      he died however in the palace of his friend and the affectionate guido paid the most tender regard to his memory this magnificent patron says boccacio commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments and after being carried on a bier through the streets of ravenna by the most illustrious citizens to be deposited in a marble coffin he pronounced himself the funeral oration and expressed his design of erecting a splendid monument in honor of the deceased a design which his subsequent misfortunes rendered him unable to accomplish at his request many epitaphs were written on the poet the best of them says boccacio by giovanni del virgilio of bologna a famous author of that time and the intimate friend of dante boccacio then cites a few latin verses not worth transcribing six of which are quoted by bail as the composition of dante himself on the authority of paul jovius in      bernardo bembo the father of the celebrated cardinal raised a handsome monument over the neglected ashes of the poet with the following inscription  exigua tumuli danthes hic sort jacebas squallenti nulli cognita paene situ at nunc marmoreo subnixus conderis arcu omnibus et cultu splendidiore nites nimirum bembus musis incensus etruscis hoc tibi quem in primis hae coluere dedit before this period the florentines had vainly endeavored to obtain the bones of their great poet from the city of ravenna in the age of leo the xth they made a second attempt by a solemn application to the pope for that purpose and the great michael angelo an enthusiastic admirer of dante very liberally offered to execute a magnificent monument to the poet the hopes of the florentines were again unsuccessful the particulars of their singular petition may be found in the notes to condivis life of michael angelo  the person and manners of dante are thus represented by the descriptive pen of boccacia  fu adunque questo nostro pceta di mezzana statura e poiche alla matura eta fu pervenuto ando alquanto gravetto ed era il suo andar grave e mansueto di onestissimi panni sempre vestito in quello abito che era alla sua matura eta convenevole il suo volto  lungo il naso aquilino gli occhi anzi grossi che piccioli le mascelle grandi e dal labbro di sotto era quel di sopra avanzato il color era bruno i capelli e la barba spessi neri e crespi e sempre nella faccia malinconico e pensoso  ne costumi publici e domestici mirabilmente fu composto e ordinato piu che niuno altro cortese e civil nel cibo e nel poto fu modestissimo  though dante is described as much inclined to melancholy and his genius particularly delighted in the gloomy and sublime yet in his early period of life he seems to have possessed all the lighter graces of sprightly composition as appears from the following airy and sportive sonnet  imitation henry i wish that you and charles and i by some sweet spell within a bark were placed a gallant bark with magic virtue graced swift at our will with every wind to fly so that no changes of the shifting sky no stormy terrors of the watery waste might bar our course but heighten still our taste of sprightly joy and of our social tie then that my lucy lucy fair and free with those soft nymphs on whom your souls are bent the kind magician might to us convey to talk of love throughout the livelong day and that each fair might be as well content as i in truth believe our hearts would be a guido cavalcanti guido vorrei che tu e lappo ed io fossimo presi per incantamento e messi ad un vassel chad ogni vento per mare andasse a voler vostro e mio sicche fortuna od altro tempo rio non ci potesse dare impedimento anzi vivendo sempre in noi talento di stare insieme crescesse l disio e monna vanna e monna bice poi con quella su il numer delle trenta con noi ponesse il buono incantatore e quivi ragionar sempre d amore e ciascuna di lor fosse contenta siccome io credo che sariamo noi these lively verses were evidently written before the poet lost the object of his earliest attachment as she is mentioned by the name of bice at what time and in what place he executed the great and singular work which has rendered him immortal his numerous commentators seem unable to determine boccacio asserts that he began it in his thirtyfifth year and had finished seven cantos of his inferno before his exile that in the plunder of his house on that event the beginning of his poem was fortunately preserved but remained for some time neglected till its merit being accidentally discovered by an intelligent poet named dino it was sent to the marquis maroello malespina an italian nobleman by whom dante was then protected the marquis restored these lost papers to the poet and entreated him to proceed in a work which opened in so promising a manner to this incident we are probably indebted for the poem of dante which he must have continued under all the disadvantages of an unfortunate and agitated life it does not appear at what time he completed it perhaps before he quitted verona as he dedicated the paradise to his veronese patron  the critics have variously accounted for his having called his poem comedia he gave it that title said one of his sons because it opens with distress and closes with felicity the very high estimation in which this production was held by his country appears from a singular institution the republic of florence in the year      assigned a public stipend to a person appointed to read lectures on the poem of dante boccacio was the first person engaged in this office but his death happening in two years after his appointment his comment extended only to the seventeen first cantos of the inferno the critical dissertations that have been written on dante are almost as numerous as those to which homer has given birth the italian like the grecian bard has been the subject of the highest panegyric and of the grossest invective voltaire has spoken of him with that precipitate vivacity which so frequently led that lively frenchman to insult the reputation of the noblest writers in one of his entertaining letters he says to an italian abbe je fais grand cas du courage avec lequel vous avez ose dire que dante etoit un fou et son ouvrage un monstre  le dante pourra entrer dans les bibliotheques des curieux mais il ne sera jamais lu but more temperate and candid critics have not been wanting to display the merits of this original poet mr warton has introduced into his last volume on english poetry a judicious and spirited summary of dantes performance we have several versions of the celebrated story of ugolino but i believe no entire canto of dante has hitherto appeared in our language though his whole work has been translated into french spanish and latin verse the three cantos which follow were translated a few years ago to oblige a particular friend the author has since been solicited to execute an entire translation of dante but the extreme inequality of this poet would render such a work a very laborious undertaking and it appears very doubtful how far such a version would interest our country perhaps the reception of these cantos may discover to the translator the sentiments of the public at all events he flatters himself that the ensuing portion of a celebrated poem may afford some pleasure from its novelty as he has endeavored to give the english reader an idea of dantes peculiar manner by adopting his triple rhyme and he does not recollect that this mode of versification has ever appeared before in our language it has obliged him of course to make the number of translated lines correspond exactly with those of the original the difficulties attending this meter will sufficiently show themselves and obtain some degree of indulgence from the intelligent and candid reader  dell inferno canto i nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura che la diritta via era smarrita e quanto a dir qual era e cosa dura questa selva selvaggia ed aspra e forte che nel pensier rinnuova la paura tanto e amara che poco e piu morte ma per trattar del ben chi vi trovai diro dell altre cose chi vho scorte i non so ben ridir comi ventrai tantera pien di sonno in su quel punto che la verace via abbandonai ma po chi fui al pie dun colle giunto la ove terminava

sentimento e caddi come l uom cui sonno piglia the inferno of dante canto i in the mid season of this mortal strife i found myself within a gloomy grove far wandering from the ways of perfect life the place i know not where i chanced to rove it was a wood so wild it wounds me sore but to remember with what ills i strove such still my dread that death is little more but i will tell the good which there i found high things twas there my fortune to explore yet how i entered on that secret ground i know not to explain so much in sleep my mortal senses at that hour were drowned but when i reached the bottom of a steep that rose to terminate the dreary vale which made cold terrors through my bosom creep i looked on high where breathed a purer gale and saw the summit glisten with that ray which leads the wanderer safe over hill and dale this soon began to chase those fears away which held my struggling spirit bound so fast during that night of darkness and dismay and as the exhausted wretch by fortune cast safe from the stormy deep upon the shore turns to survey the perils he has past so turned my soul ere yet its dread was over back to contemplate that mysterious strait where living mortal never past before arising soon from this repose elate up the rough steep my journey i begin my lower foot sustaining all my weight here while my toilsome way i slowly win behold a nimble panther springs to sight and beauteous spots adorn his motley skin he at my presence showed no signs of fright but rather strove to bar my doubtful way i often turned and often resolved on flight twas now the cheerful hour of rising day the sun advanced in that propitious sign which first beheld his radiant beams display creations charms the work of love divine so that i now was raised to hope sublime by these bright omens of a fate benign the beauteous beast and the sweet hour of prime but soon i lost that hope and shook yet more to see a lion in this lonely clime with open jaws athirst for human gore he rushed toward me in his hungry ire air seemed to tremble at his savage roar with him enflamed with every fierce desire a famished shewolf like a spectre came beneath whose gripe shall many a wretch expire such sad oppression seized my sinking frame such horror at these strange tremendous sights my hopes to climb the hill no longer aim but as the wretch whom lucres lust incites in the cursed hour which scatters all his wealth sinks in deep sorrow dead to all delights so was i robbed of all my spirits health and to the quarter where the sun grows mute driven by this beast who crept on me by stealth while i retreated from her dread pursuit a manly figure my glad eyes surveyed whose voice was like the whisper of a lute soon as i saw him in this dreary glade take pity on me to this form i cried be thou substantial man or fleeting shade  a man i was the gracious form replied and both my parents were of lombard race they in their native mantua lived and died i lived at rome rich in a monarchs grace beneath the good augustus lettered reign while fabled gods were served with worship base a bard i was the subject of my strain that just and pious chief who sailed from troy sinking in ashes on the sanguine plain but thou whom these portentous sights annoy why do thou turn why not ascend the mount source of all good and summit of all joy  art thou that virgil thou that copious fount of richest eloquence so clear so bright i answered blushing at his kind account o thou of poets the pure guide and light now let me profit by that fond esteem which kept thy song for ever in my sight thou art my master thou my bard supreme from whom alone my fond ambition drew that purer style which i my glory deem o from this beast so hideous to the view save me o save me thou muchhonourd sage for growing terrors all my power subdue  a different road must lead thee from her rage he said observant of my starting tears and from this wild thy spirit disengage for that terrific beast which caused thy fears worries each wretch that in her road she spies till death at length his sole relief appears so keen her nature sleep never seals her eyes her ravenous hunger no repast can sat food only serves to make its fury rise she calls from different animals her mate and long shall she produce an offspring base then from a mighty victor meet her fate nor pomp nor riches shall that victor grace but truth and love and all excelling worth he from his rescued land all ill shall chase the savior of the realm that gives him birth of italy for whom camilla fell and turnus fighting for his native earth and ninus with the friend he loved so well the beast this victor to that den shall drive whence envy let her loose her native hell now for thy good wellpleased i will contrive that by my aid while i thy steps control thou shall in safety at those realms arrive where thou shall see the tortured spirits roll and hear each mourn his miserable fate calling for death on his immortal soul then shall thou visit those who in a state of purifying fire are still content and for their promised heaven submissive wait if to that heaven thy happy course is bent a worthier guard will soon my place supply a purer spirit for thy guidance sent for that immortal power who rules on high because i never his perfect laws have known his sacred presence will to me deny there in the realms of light he fixed his throne there over the world almighty lord he reigns o blessed the servant whom he deigns to own  poet i answered by thy living strains and by that god though not revealed to thee that i may scape from these and heavier pains be thou my leader where thy way is free so that my eyes st peters gate may find and all the wonders of the deep may see he led and i attentive marched behind canto ii the day was sinking and the dusky air on all the animals of earth bestowed rest from their labors i alone prepare to meet new toil both from my dreary road and pious wish to paint in worthy phrase the unerring mind and his divine abode o sacred muses now my genius raise o memory who writest what i saw from hence shall spring thy everduring praise kind poet i began with trembling awe mark if my soul be equal to this aim nor into scenes too hard my weakness draw thy song declares the chief of pious fame appeared among the blessed retaining still his mortal senses and material frame yet if the great opposer of all ill showed grace to him as knowing what and who should from him rise and mighty things fulfill most worthy he appeared in reasons view that heaven should choose him as the roman sire source of that empire which so widely grew marked in its growth by the angelic choir to be the seat where sanctity should rest and peters heirs yet raise dominion higher from his dark journey in thy song expressed he learned mysterious things from whence arose romes early grandeur and the papal vest to paul while living heavens high powers disclose their secret bliss that he may thence receive strength in that faith from which salvation flows but how may i this high exploit atchieve i am not aeneas nor the holy paul of this unworthy i myself believe if then i follow at thy friendly call midway perchance my trembling soul may sink wise as thou art thou may foresee my fall now as a man who shuddring on the brink of some great venture sudden shifts his mind and feels his spirit from the peril shrink so in this scene of doubt and darkness joined wavering i wasted thought in wild affright and the first ardour of my soul resigned if thy faint words i understand aright replied the mighty and magnanimous shade those mists of fear have dimmed thy mental sight which often the seat of human sense invade and make blind mortals from high deeds recoil by terrors airy fantasies betrayed but that such fears thy soul no more may soil i will tell thee whence i came at whose request when first i pitied thy uncertain toil from the suspended host in which i rest a lovely spirit called me fair as light eager i waited on her high behest while eyes beyond the solar radiance bright and with the sweetness of an angels tongue thus her soft words my willing aid invite o ever gentle shade from mantua sprung whose fame unfading on the earth shall last as long as earth in ambient air is hung my friend whose love all base desire surpast in yon drear desert finds his passage barred and compassed round with terrors stands aghast and much i fear beset with dangers hard he may be lost beyond all friendly reach and i from heaven descend too late a guard but go and with thy soft soulsoothing speech and all the aid thy wisdom may inspire the ways of safety to this wanderer teach my name is beatrice the heavenly quire for this i left though ever left with pain but love suggested what i now desire when i the presence of my lord regain on thee my praises with delight shall dwell so spoke this angel in her heavenly strain bright fair i cried who did on earth excel all that ever shone beneath the lunar sphere and every mind to virtuous love impel had i even now performed the task i hear that swift performance i should think too slow nor needs there more your gracious will is clear yet how you venture i would gladly know from those pure realms to which again you fly so near the center of eternal woe what you require she said in kind reply i briefly will explain how thus i dare unconscious of alarm these depths to try from these things only springs our fearful care by which our hapless friends may suffer ill but not from other for no fear is there such am i formed by heavens most gracious will that torture cannot touch my purer frame even where fierce fires his flaming region fill a gentle spirit lucia is her name in heaven laments the hardships of my friend for whom i ask your aid to me she came and kindly bade me to his woes attend behold she said thy servant in distress and i his safety to thy care commend lucia the friend of all whom ills oppress me where i sat with pensive rachel sought in heavenly contemplations deep recess in mercys name she cried thus lost in thought see thou not him who held thy charms so dear whom love to rise above the vulgar taught and do thou not his lamentation hear nor see the horror which his strength impairs on yon wide torrent with no haven near never was mind intent on worldly cares so eager wealth to gain or loss to shun as when acquainted with these deadly snares i flew from the blessed confines of the sun trusting that eloquence which to thy name and to thy followers such praise has won she having thus explained her gracious aim turned her bright eyes which tears of pity fill and hence more swift to thy relief i came and pleased to execute her heavenly will i saved thee from the fury of that beast which barred thy journey up the brighter hill why then o why has all thy ardour ceased and whence this faintness in thy feeble mind why has its noble energy decreased when these pure spirits for thy good combined watch over thy safety in their heavenly seat and i reveal the favor thou shall find  as tender flowers revived by solar heat that through the chilling night have sunk deprest rise and unfold the welcome ray to meet so rose my spirit of new life possessed and my warm heart on high achievements bent i thus my animating guide addressed gracious that spirit who thy succor sent and friendly thou who freely have displayed thy zeal to execute her kind intent thy soothing words have to my soul conveyed such keen desire to those bright realms to soar i scorn the terror that my step delayed now lead  thy pleasure i dispute no more my lord my master thou and thou my guard  i ended here and while he marched before the gloomy road i entered deep and hard canto iii through me you pass to mournings dark domain through me to scenes where grief must ever pine through me to miserys devoted train justice and power in my great founder join and love and wisdom all his fabrics rear wisdom above control and love divine before me nature saw no works appear save works eternal such was i ordained quit every hope all ye who enter here these characters where misty darkness reigned high over a lofty gate i saw engraved ah sire said i hard things are here contained he sapient guide my farther question saved with spirit answering here all doubt resign all weak distrust and every thought depraved at length we have reached that gloomy drear confine where as i said thou wilt see the mournful race for ever robbed of reasons light benign then stretching forth his hand with gentle grace from whence new comfort through my bosom flows he led me in to that mysterious place there sighs and wailings and severest woes deeply resounded through the starless air and as i first advanced my fears arose each different cry the murmuring notes of care accents of misery and words of ire with all the sounds of discord and despair to form such tumult in this scene conspire as flies for ever round the gloomy waste like sand when quickened by the whirlwinds fire i then my mind with error still disgraced exclaimed  o sire what may this trouble mean what forms are these by sorrow so debased  he soon replied  behold these bounds between all who without or infamy or fame closed the blank business of their mortal scene they join those angels of ignoble name who not rebelled yet were not faithful found without attachment self alone their aim heaven shuts them out from its unsullied bound and hell refuses to admit this train lest even the damned over these their triumph sound  o sire said i whence then this grievous pain that on our ears their lamentations grate  this he replied i will in brief explain these have no hope that death may mend their fate and their blind days form so confused a mass they pine with envy of each others state from earth their name has perished like the grass even mercy views them with a scornful eye well speak of them no more behold and pass  i looked and saw a banner raised on high that whirled unconscious of a moments stand with rapid circles in the troubled sky behind it driven by fates supreme command came such a host i never could have believed death had collected so complete a band when now i had the forms of all perceived i saw the shade of that ignoble priest of sovereign power by indolence bereaved instant i knew from every doubt released these were the base the miscreated crew to whom the hate of god had never ceased vile forms never honored with existence true naked they marched and sorely were they stung by wasps and hornets that around them flew these the black blood from their galled faces wrung blood mixed with tears that trickling to their feet fed the fastidious worms which round them clung when now i farther pierced the dark retreat numbers i saw beside a mighty stream sudden i cried  now sire let me entreat to know what forms in distant prospect seem to pass so swiftly over a flood so wide as i discern by this imperfect gleam  that shall thou know returned my gracious guide when the near respite from our toil we reach on sullen acherons infernal tide  with downcast eyes that pardon now beseech and hoping silence may that pardon win even to the river i abstained from speech and lo toward us with a shrivelled skin a hoary boatman steers his crazy bark exclaiming woe to all ye sons of sin hope not for heaven nor lights celestial spark i come to wast you to a different lot to tortures realm with endless horror dark and thou who living viewst this sacred spot haste to depart from these for these are dead but when he saw that i departed not in wrath he cried through other passes led not here shall thou attempt the farther shore but in a bark to bear thy firmer tread  o charon said my guide thy strife give over for thus it is willed in that superior scene where will is power seek thou to know no more  now grew the bearded visage more serene of the stern boatman on the livid lake whose eyes so lately glard with anger keen but all the naked shades began to quake their shuddering figures grew more pale than earth soon as they heard the cruel words he spoke god they blasphemed their parents injured worth and all mankind the place the hour that saw their first formation and their future birth then were they driven by fates resistless law weeping to that sad scene prepared for all who fear not god with pure devotions awe charon with eyes of fire and words of gall collects his crew and high his oar he wields to strike the tardy wretch who slights his call as leaves in autumn through the woody fields fly in succession when each trembling tree its lingering honors to the whirlwind yields so this bad race condemned by heavens decree successive hasten from that rivers side as birds which at a call to bondage flee so are they wafted over the gloomy tide and ere from thence their journey is begun a second crew awaits their hoary guide  my gracious master kindly said  my son all those who in the wrath of god expire from every clime haste hither one by one nor would their terrors from this stream retire since heavenly justice so impels their mind that fear is quickened into keen desire here may no spirit pass to good inclined and hence if charon seemed to thwart thy will hence will thou deem his purpose not unkind  he paused and horrors of approaching ill now made the mournful troop so stand aghast their fears yet strike me with a deadly chill the groaning earth sent forth a hollow blast and flashed a fiery glare of gloomy red the horrid scene my fainting power surpast i fell and as in sleep my senses fled note v verse     the gay boccacio tempts the italian muse boccacio was almost utterly unknown to our country as a poet when two of our most accomplished critics restored his poetical reputation  mr tyrwhitt to whom chaucer is as deeply indebted as a poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator has given a sketch of boccacios theseida in his introductory discourse to the canterbury tales and mr warton has enriched the first volume of his history of english poetry with a considerable specimen of this very rare italian epic poem of which our country is said to possess but a single copy  the father of boccacio was an italian merchant a native of certaldo near florence who in his travels attached himself to a young woman of paris and our poet is supposed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection he was born in      and educated as a student of the canon law but a sight of virgils tomb according to filippo villani his most ancient biographer made him resolve to relinquish his more irksome pursuits and devote himself entirely to the muses his life seems to have been divided between literature and love as he was equally remarkable for an amorous disposition and a passionate attachment to study his most celebrated mistress was mary of arragon the natural daughter of robert king of naples the generous and enthusiastic patron of petrarch to this lady distinguished by the name of the fiammetta boccacio addressed his capital poem the theseida telling her in an introductory letter that it contained many allusions to the particular circumstances of their own secret attachment in his latter days he retired to certaldo and died there in the year      of a disorder supposed to have arisen from excessive application few authors have rendered more essential service to the republic of letters than boccacio as he not only contributed very much to the improvement of his native language but was particularly instrumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning a merit which he shared with petrarch the tender and generous friendship which subsisted between these two engaging authors reflects the highest honor on both and their letters to each other may be ranked among the most interesting productions of that period boccacio composed according to quadrio no less than thirtyfour volumes his novels are universally known his poetical works are as follow   la theseida in ottava rima   lamorosa visione in terza rima   il filostrato in ottava rima   il ninfale fiesolano in ottava rima  he piqued himself on being the first poet who sung of martial subjects in italian verse and he has been generally supposed the inventor of the ottava rima the common heroic measure of the italian muse but quadrio has shown that it was used by preceding writers and pasquier in his recherches has quoted two stanzas of thibaud king of navarre written in the same measure on blanch queen of france who died in      the neglect into which the poems of boccacio had fallen appears the more striking as he peculiarly prided himself on his poetical character informing the world by an inscription on his tomb that poetry was his favorite pursuit  studium fuit alma poesis are the last words of the epitaph which he composed for himself  note vi verse     she spoke exulting and trissino sung giovanni giorgio trissino was born of a noble family in vicenza      he was particularly distinguished by a passion for poetry and architecture and one of the very few poets who have been rich enough to build a palace this he is said to have done from a design of his own under the direction of the celebrated palladio he had the merit of writing the first regular tragedy in the italian language entitled sophonisba but in his epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed though some learned critics and gravina amongst them have endeavored to support the credit of that performance his subject was the expulsion of the goths from italy by belisarius and his poem consists of twentyseven books in blank verse he addressed it to the emperor charles the vth and professes in his dedication to have taken aristotle for his preceptor and homer for his guide  the reader will excuse a trifling anachronism in my naming trissino before ariosto for poetical reasons the italia liberata of the former was first published in      the orlando furioso in      trissino died at rome    0 ariosto at ferrara       note vii verse     of a poetic sire the more poetic son the reputation of torquato tasso has almost eclipsed that of his father bernardo who was himself a considerable poet and left two productions of the epic kind lamadigi and il floridante the latter remained unfinished at his death but was afterward published in its imperfect state by his son who has spoken of his fathers poetry with filial regard in his different critical works the amadigi was written at the request of several spanish grandees in the court of charles the vth and first printed in venice by giolito    0 the curious reader may find an entertaining account of the authors ideas in composing this work among his letters volume the first page     i cannot help remarking that the letter referred to contains a simile which torquato has introduced in the opening of his jerusalem delivered  the italians have formed a very pleasing and valuable work by collecting the letters of their eminent painters which contain much information on points relating to their art the letters of their poets if properly selected might also form a few interesting volumes as a proof of this i shall insert a short letter of the younger tasso because it seems to have escaped the notice of his biographers and relates the remarkable circumstance of his having deliberated on five different subjects before he decided in favor of goffredo al m illustre sig conte ferrante estense tassone  io ho scritto questa mattina a v s che io desidero di far due poemi a mio gusto e sebben per elezione non cambierei il soggetto che una volta presi nondimeno per soddisfar il

jamais choisi le tasse latraite dignement adds the lively critic with unusual candor yet in his subsequent remarks he is peculiarly severe on the magic of the italian poet the merits of tasso are very ably defended against the injustice of french criticism and particularly that of boileau and voltaire in the wellknown letters on chivalry and romance indeed the genius of this injured poet seems at length to triumph in the country where he was most insulted as the french have lately attempted a poetical version of his jerusalem  i enter not into the history of tasso or that of his rival ariosto because the public has lately received from mr hoole a judicious account of their lives prefixed to his elegant versions of their respective poems  note viii verse     shall gay tassoni want his festive crown alessandro tassoni the supposed inventor of the modern heroicomic poetry was born at modena      his family was noble but his parents dying during his infancy left him exposed to vexatious lawsuits which absorbed a great part of his patrimony and rendered him dependant in      he was engaged as secretary to cardinal ascanio colonna whom he attended on an embassy into spain he was occasionally dispatched into italy on the service of that prelate and in the course of one of these expeditions wrote his observations on petrarch in   0  he is supposed to have quitted the service of the cardinal and to have lived in a state of freedom at rome where in   0  he became the chief of a literary society entitled academia degli umoristi he was afterward employed in the service of charles emanuel duke of savoy which after suffering many vexations in it he quitted with a design of devoting himself to study and retirement but this design he was induced to relinquish and to serve the cardinal lodovisio nephew of pope gregory xv from whom he received a considerable stipend on the death of this patron in      he was recalled to his native city by francis the first duke of modena and obtained an honorable establishment in the court of that prince age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune his health declined in the year of his return and he expired in april      his genius was particularly disposed to lively satire and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increase that disposition after having passed many vexatious and unprofitable years in the service of the great he had his portrait painted with a fig in his hand and muratori supposes him to have written these two lines on the occasion  dextera cur ficum quaeris mea gestet inanem longi operis merces haec fuit aula dedit his celebrated poem la secchia rapita was written as he has himself declared in      begun in april and finished in october it was circulated in ms received with the utmost avidity and first printed at paris      in a catalogue of the numerous editions of the secchia which muratori has prefixed to his life of tassoni he includes an english translation of it printed       note ix verse  0  and rashly judges that her vegas lyre the famous lope de vega frequently called the shakespeare of spain is perhaps the most fertile poet in the annals of parnassus and it would be difficult to name any author ancient or modern so universally idolized while living by all ranks of people and so magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the great he was the son of felix de vega and francisca fernandez who were both descended from honorable families and lived in the neighborhood of madrid our poet was born in that city on the   th of november      he was according to his own expression a poet from his cradle and beginning to make verses before he had learned to write he used to bribe his elder schollfellows with a part of his breakfast to commit to paper the lines he had composed having lost his father while he was still a child he engaged in a frolic very natural to a lively boy and wandered with another lad to various parts of spain till having spent their money and being conducted before a magistrate at segovia for offering to sell a few trinkets they were sent home again to madrid soon after this adventure our young poet was taken under the protection of geronimo manrique bishop of avila and began to distinguish himself by his dramatic compositions which were received with great applause by the public though their author had not yet completed his education for after this period he became a member of the university of alcala where he devoted himself for four years to the study of philosophy he was then engaged as secretary to the duke of alva and wrote his arcadia in compliment to that patron who is frequently mentioned in his occasional poems he quitted that employment on his marriage with isabel de urbina a lady says his friend and biographer perez de montalvan beautiful without artifice and virtuous without affectation his domestic happiness was soon interrupted by a painful incident  having written some lively verses in ridicule of a person who had taken some injurious freedom with his character he received a challenge in consequence of his wit and happening in the duel which ensued to give his adversary a dangerous wound he was obliged to fly from his family and shelter himself in valencia he resided there a considerable time but connubial affection recalled him to madrid his wife died in the year of his return his affliction on this event led him to relinquish his favorite studies and embark on board the armada which was then preparing for the invasion of england he had a brother who served in that fleet as a lieutenant and being shot in an engagement with some dutch vessels his virtues were celebrated by our afflicted poet whose heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection after the ill success of the armada the disconsolate lope de vega returned to madrid and became secretary to the marquis of malpica to whom he has addressed a grateful sonnet from the service of this patron he passed into the household of the count of lemos whom he celebrates as an inimitable poet he was once more induced to quit his attendance on the great for the more inviting comforts of a married life his second choice was juana de guardio of noble birth and singular beauty by this lady he had two children a son who died in his infancy and a daughter named feliciana who survived her father the death of his little boy is said to have hastened that of his wife whom he had the misfortune to lose in about seven years after his marriage having now experienced the precariousness of all human enjoyments he devoted himself to a religious life and fulfilled all the duties of it with the most exemplary piety still continuing to produce an astonishing variety of poetical compositions his talents and his virtues procured him many unsolicited honors pope urban the viiith sent him the cross of malta with the title of doctor in divinity and appointed him to a place of profit in the apostolic chamber favors for which he expressed his gratitude by dedicating his corona tragica a long poem on the fate of mary queen of scots to that liberal pontiff in his seventythird year he felt the approaches of death and prepared himself for it with the utmost composure and devotion his last hours were attended by many of his intimate friends and particularly his chief patron the duke of sessa whom he made his executor leaving him the care of his daughter feliciana and of his various manuscripts the manner in which he took leave of those he loved was most tender and affecting he said to his disciple and biographer montalvan that true fame consisted in being good and that he would willingly exchange all the applauses he had received to add a single deed of virtue to the actions of his life having given his dying benediction to his daughter and performed the last ceremonies of his religion he expired on the   th of august       the splendour of his funeral was equal to the respect paid to him while living  his magnificent patron the duke of sessa invited the chief nobility of the kingdom to attend it the ceremony was prolonged through the course of several days and three sermons in honor of the deceased were delivered by three of the most celebrated preachers these are printed with the works of the poet and may be considered as curious specimens of the false eloquence which prevailed at that time a volume of encomiastic verses chiefly spanish and written by more than a hundred and fifty of the most distinguished characters in spain was published soon after the death of this lamented bard to this collection his friend and disciple perez de montalvan prefixed a circumstantial account of his life and death which i have chiefly followed in the preceding narrative an ingenious traveller who has lately published a pleasing volume of letters on the poetry of spain has imputed the duel in which lope de vega was engaged to the gallantries of his first wife but montalvans relation of that adventure clears the honor of the lady whose innocence is still farther supported by a poem written in her praise by pedro de medina medinilla it is printed in the works of our poet who is introduced in it under the name of belardo celebrating the excellencies and lamenting the loss of his departed isabel  of the person and manners of lope de vega his friend montalvan has only given this general account  that his frame of body was particularly strong and preserved by temperance in continued health  that in conversation he was mild and unassuming courteous to all and to women peculiarly gallant  very eager when engaged in the business of his friends and somewhat careless in the management of his own of his wealth and charity i shall have occasion to speak in a subsequent note the chief expenses in which he indulged himself were books and pictures of the latter he distributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends to the duke of sessa a fine portrait of himself and to me says montalvan another painted when he was young surrounded by dogs monkies and other monsters and writing in the midst of them without attending to their noise  of the honors paid to this extraordinary poet his biographer asserts that no person of eminence visited spain without seeking his personal acquaintance that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the streets and women saluted him with benedictions when he passed under their windows if such homage can be deserved by the most unwearied application to poetry lope de vega was certainly entitled to it he declared that he constantly wrote five sheets a day and his biographers who have formed a calculation from this account conclude the number of his verses to be no less than      000 his country has very lately published an elegant edition of his poems in    quarto volumes his dramatic works are to be added to this collection and will probably be still more voluminous i shall speak only of the former  among his poems there are several of the epic kind the three following appear to me the most remarkable   la dragontea   la hermosura de angelica   la jerusalem conquistada the dragontea consists of ten cantos on the last expedition and death of our great naval hero sir francis drake whom the poet from his excessive partiality to his country considers as an avaricious pirate or rather as he chooses to call him a marine dragon and it may be sufficient to observe that he has treated him accordingly the poem on angelica seems to have been written in emulation of ariosto and it is founded on a hint in that poet it was composed in the early part of our authors life and contains many compliments to his sovereign philip the iid it consists of  0 cantos and closes with angelicas being restored to her beloved medoro in his jerusalem conquistada he enters the lists with tasso whom he mentions in his preface as having sung the first part of the history which he had chosen for his subject from the great name of lope de vega i had some thoughts of presenting to the reader a sketch of this his most remarkable poem but as an epic poet he appears to me so much inferior to tasso and to his countryman and cotemporary ercilla that i am unwilling to swell these extensive notes by an enlarged description of so unsuccessful a work the author has prophesied in the close of it that although neglected by his own age it would be esteemed by futurity  a singular proof that even the most favored writers are frequently disposed to declaim against the period in which they live if lope de vega could think himself neglected what poet may ever expect to be satisfied with popular applause  but to return to his jerusalem conquistada richard the second of england and alphonso the eighth of castile are the chief heroes of the poem which contains twenty cantos and closes with the unfortunate return of these confederate kings and the death of saladin it was first printed   0  more than twenty years after the first appearance of tassos jerusalem  one of the most amiable peculiarities in the character of lope de vega is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals in his laurel de apollo he celebrates all the eminent spanish and portugueze poets he speaks both of camoens and ercilla with the warmest applause among the most pleasing passages in this poem is a compliment which he pays to his father who was like the father of tasso a poet of considerable talents  among the smaller pieces of lope de vega there are two particularly curious a descriptive poem on the garden of his patron the duke of alva and a sonnet in honor of the invincible armada the latter may be considered as a complete model of spanish bombast go forth and burn the world says the poet addressing himself to that mighty fleet my sighs will furnish your fails with a neverfailing wind and my breast will supply your cannon with inexhaustible fire  perhaps this may be equalled by a spanish character of our poet with which i shall close my imperfect account of him it is his friend and biographer montalvan who in the opening of his life bestows on him the following titles el doctor frey lope felix de vega carpio portento del orb gloria de la nation luster de la patria oracula de la lengua centro de la fama assumpio de la invidia cuydado de la fortuna fenix de los siglos principe de los versos orfeo de las ciencias apolo de las musas horacio de los poetas virgilio de los epicos homero de los heroycos pindaro de los lyricos sofocles de los tragicos y terencio de los comicos unico enter los mayores mayor enter los grandes y grande a todas luzes y en todas materias  note x verse     the brave ercilla sounds with potent breath his epic trumpet in the fields of death don alonzo de ercilla y zuniga was equally distinguished as a hero and a poet but this exalted character notwithstanding his double claim to our regard is almost totally unknown in our country and i shall therefore endeavor to give the english reader the best idea that i can both of his gallant life and of his singular poem  he was born in madrid on the  th of august      the third son of fortun garcia de ercilla who though descended from a noble family pursued the profession of the law and was so remarkable for his talents that he acquired the appellation of the subtle spaniard the mother of our poet was also noble and from her he inherited his second title zuniga ercilla was the name of an ancient castle in biscay which had been long in the possession of his paternal ancestors he lost his father while he was yet an infant a circumstance which had great influence on his future life for his mother was received after the decease of her husband into the household of the empress isabella the wife of charles the vth and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young alonzo into the palace he soon obtained an appointment there in the character of page to the infant don philip to whose service he devoted himself with the most heroic enthusiasm though philip was a master who little deserved so generous an attachment at the age of fourteen he attended that prince in the splendid progress which he made at the desire of his imperial father through the principal cities of the netherlands and through parts of italy and germany this singular expedition is very circumstantially recorded in a folio volume by a spanish historian named juan christoval calvete de estrella whose work affords a very curious and striking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and romantic age all the cities which were visited by the prince contended with each other in magnificent festivity the brilliant series of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited though they answered not their design of conciliating the affection of the sullen philip might probably awaken the genius of our youthful poet and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame in      he returned with the prince into spain and continued there for three years at the end of which he attended his royal master to england on his marriage with queen mary which was celebrated at winchester in the summer of      at this period ercilla first assumed the military character for his sovereign received advice during his residence at london that the martial natives of aranco a district on the coast of chile had revolted from the spanish government and dispatched an experienced officer named alderete who attended him in england to subdue the insurrection investing him with the command of the rebellious province ercilla embarked with alderete but that officer dying in his passage our poet proceeded to lima don hurtado de mendoza who commanded there as viceroy of peru appointed his son don garcia to supply the place of alderete and sent him with a considerable force to oppose the arancanians ercilla was engaged in this enterprise and greatly distinguished himself in the obstinate contest which ensued the noble character of the barbarians who maintained this unequal struggle and the many splendid feats of valor which this scene afforded led our author to the singular design of making the war in which he was himself engaged the subject of an heroic poem which he entitled la araucana from the name of the country as many of his own particular adventures may be found in the following summary of his work i shall not here enlarge on his military exploits but proceed to one of the most mortifying events of his life which he briefly mentions in the conclusion of his poem after passing with great honor through many and various perils he was on the point of suffering a disgraceful death from the rash orders of his young and inconsiderate commander on his return from an expedition of adventure and discovery to the spanish city of imperial he was present at a scene of public festivity displayed there to celebrate the accession of philip the iid to the crown of spain at a kind of tournament there arose an idle dispute between ercilla and don juan de pineda in the heat of which the two disputants drew their swords many of the spectators joined in the broil and a report arising that the quarrel was a mere pretense to conceal some mutinous design the hasty don garcia their general committed the two antagonists to prison and sentenced them both to be publicly beheaded ercilla himself declares he was conducted to the scaffold before his precipitate judge discovered the iniquity of the sentence but his innocence appeared just time enough to save him and he seems to have been fully reinstated in the good opinion of don garcia as among the complimentary sonnets addressed to ercilla there is one which bears the name of his general in which he styles him the divine alonzo and celebrates both his military and poetical genius but ercilla seems to have been deeply wounded by this affront for quitting chile he went to callao the port of lima and there embarked on an expedition against a spanish rebel named lope de aguirre who having murdered his captain and usurped the chief power was perpetrating the most cruel enormities in the settlement of venezuela but ercilla learned on his arrival at panama that this barbarous usurper was destroyed he therefore resolved as his health was much impaired by the hardships he had passed to return to spain he arrived there in the twentyninth ninth year of his age but soon left it and traveled as he himself informs us through france italy germany silesia moravia and pannonia but the particulars of this expedition are unknown in the year    0 he appeared again at madrid and was married to maria bazan a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the course of his military poem he is said to have been afterward gentleman of the bedchamber to the emperor rodolph the iid a prince who had been educated at madrid but the connection of our poet with this monarch is very indistinctly recorded and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known in the year    0 he resided at madrid in a state of retirement and poverty the time and circumstances of his death are uncertain it is proved that he was living in the year      by the evidence of a spanish writer named mosquera who in a treatise of military discipline speaks of ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of don alvaro bazan marquis de santa cruz in a poem which has never appeared and is supposed to have been left imperfect at his death some anecdotes related of our poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits ware not entirely unrewarded it is said that in speaking to his sovereign philip he was so overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him don alonzo replied the king speak to me in writing  he did so and obtained his request the spanish historian ovalle who has written an account of chile in which he frequently supports his narration by the authority of ercilla affirms that our poet presented his work to philip with his own hand and received a recompense from the king but in this circumstance i fear the historian was mistaken as he supposes it to have happened on the return of ercilla from chile and our poet in a distinct portion of his work which was not published till many years after that period expressly declares in addressing himself to philip that all his attempts to serve him had been utterly unrequited ercilla left no legitimate family but had some natural children the most eminent of which was a daughter who was advantageously married to a nobleman of portugal  in that elegant collection of spanish poets  parnaso espanol there is a pleasing little amorous poem written by ercilla in his youth which is peculiarly commended by lope de vega who has bestowed a very generous encomium on our poet in his  laurel de apolo but the great and singular work which has justly rendered ercilla immortal is his poem entitled araucana which was published in three separate parts the first appeared in      he added the second in the succeeding year and in    0 he printed a complete edition of the whole it was applauded by the most eminent writers of spain and cervantes in speaking of don quixotes library has ranked it among the choicest treasures of the castilian muse voltaire who speaks of ercilla with his usual spirit and inaccuracy has the merit of having made our poet more generally known though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely slight for he affirms that ercilla was in the battle of saint quintin a mistake into which he never could have fallen had he read the araucana indeed the undistinguishing censure which he passes on the poem in general after commending one particular passage sufficiently proves him a perfect stranger to many subsequent parts of the work yet his remark on the inequality of the poet is just ercilla is certainly unequal but with all his defects he appears to me one of the most extraordinary and engaging characters in the poetical world perhaps i am a little partial to him from the accidental circumstance of having first read his poem with a departed friend whose opinions are very dear to me and who was particularly fond of this military bard however this may be my idea of ercillas merit has led me to hazard the following extensive sketch of his work  it has swelled to a much larger size than i at first intended for i was continually tempted to extend it by the desire of not injuring the peculiar excellencies of this wonderful poet if i have not utterly failed in that desire the english reader will be enabled to judge and to enjoy an author who considering his subject and its execution may be said to stand single and unparalleled in the host of poets his beauties and his defects are of so obvious a nature that i shall not enlarge upon them but let it be remembered that his poem was composed amidst the toils and perils of the most fatiguing and hazardous service and that his verses were sometimes written on scraps of leather from the want of better materials his style is remarkably pure and perspicuous and notwithstanding the restraint of rhyme it has frequently all the ease the spirit and the volubility of homer i wish not however to conceal his defects and i have therefore given a very fair account of the strange episode he introduces concerning the history of dido which has justly fallen under the ridicule of voltaire i must however observe as an apology for ercilla that many bards of his country have considered it as a point of honor to defend the reputation of this injured lady and to attack virgil with a kind of poetical quixotism for having slandered the chastity of so spotless a heroine if my memory does not deceive me both lope de vega and quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of dido we may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively frenchman against our poet on this occasion but let us recollect that ercilla has infinitely more homeric spirit and that his poem contains more genuine epic beauties than can be found in voltaire  ercilla has been honored with many poetical encomiums by the writers of his own country and as i believe the most elegant compliment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a spanish lady i shall close this account of him with a translation of the sonnet in which she celebrates both the hero and the poet  soneto de la senora dona leonor de iciz senora de la baronia de rafales a don alonso de ercilla mil bronces para estatuas ya forxados mil lauros de tus obras premio honroso te ofrece espana ercilla generoso por tu pluma y tu lanza tan ganados hourese tu valor enter soldados invidie tu nobleza el valeroso y busque en ti el poeta mas famoso lima para sus versos malimados derrame por el mundo tus loores la fama y eternice tu memoria porque jamas el tiempo la consuma gocen ya sin temor de que hay mayores tus hechos y tus libros de igual gloria pues la han ganado igual la espada y pluma sonnet from the lady

thy merit spread in memorys volume may thy praises stand in characters that time shall never destroy thy songs and thy exploits without the dread to be surpassed by a superior hand with equal right their equal fame enjoy a sketch of the araucana the poem of ercilla opens with the following exposition of his subject i sing not love of ladies nor of sights devised for gentle dames by courteous knights nor feasts nor tourneys nor that tender care which prompts the gallant to regale the fair but the bold deeds of valors favorite train those undegenerate sons of warlike spain who made arauco their stern laws embrace and bent beneath their yoke her untamed race of tribes distinguished in the field i sing of nations who disdain the name of king courage that danger only taught to grow and challenge honor from a generous foe and persevering toils of purest fame and feats that aggrandize the spanish name for the brave actions of the vanquished spread the brightest glory round the victors head   he then addresses his work to his sovereign philip the second and devotes his first canto to the description of that part of the new world which forms the scene of his action and is called arauco a district in the province of chile he paints the singular character and various customs of its warlike inhabitants with great clearness and spirit in many points they bear a striking resemblance to the ancient germans as they are drawn with a kind of poetical energy by the strong pencil of tacitus the first canto closes with a brief account how this martial province was subdued by a spanish officer named valdivia with an intimation that his negligence in his new dominion gave birth to those important exploits which the poet proposes to celebrate  canto ii ercilla begins his cantos much in the manner of ariosto with a moral reflection sometimes rather too much dilated but generally expressed in easy elegant and spirited verse  the following lines faintly imitate the two first stanzas of his second canto many there are who in this mortal strife have reached the slippery heights of splendid life for fortunes ready hand its succor lent smiling she raised them up the steep ascent to hurl them headlong from that lofty seat to which she led their unsuspecting feet even at the moment when all fears disperse and their proud fancy sees no sad reverse little they think beguiled by fair success that joy is but the herald of distress the hasty wing of time escapes their sight and those dark evils that attend his flight vainly they dream with gay presumption warm fortune for them will take a steadier form she unconcerned at what her victims feel turns with her wonted haste her fatal wheel   after blaming his countrymen for abusing their good fortune the poet celebrates in the following spirited manner the eagerness and indignation with which the indians prepared to wreak their vengeance on their spanish oppressors the indians first by novelty dismayed as gods revered us and as gods obeyed but when they found we were of woman born their homage turned to enmity and scorn their childish error when our weakness showed they blushed at what their ignorance bestowed fiercely they burnt with anger and with shame to see their masters but of mortal frame disdaining cold and cowardly delay they seek atonement on no distant day prompt and resolved in quick debate they join to form of deep revenge their dire design impatient that their bold decree should spread and shake the world around with sudden dread the assembling chieftains led so large a train their ready host overspread the extensive plain no summons now the soldiers heart requires the thirst of battle every breast inspires no pay no promise of reward they ask keen to accomplish their spontaneous task and by the force of one avenging blow crush and annihilate their foreign foe of some brave chiefs who to this council came well may thou memory preserve the name though rude and savage yet of noble soul justly they claim their place on glorys roll who robbing spain of many a gallant son in so confined a space such victories won whose fame some living spaniards yet may spread too well attested by our warlike dead   the poet proceeds to mention in the manner of homer but in a much shorter catalogue the principal chieftains and the number of their respective vassals  uncouthly as their names must sound to an english ear it seems necessary to run through the list as these free and nobleminded savages act so distinguished a part in the course of the poem  tucapel

forces for the projected war an honor which almost every chieftain was arrogant enough to challenge for himself in the midst of this turbulent debate the ancient colocolo delivers the following harangue which voltaire prefers and i think with great justice to the speech of nestor on a similar occasion in the first iliad  assembled chiefs ye guardians of the land think not i mourn from thirst of lost command to find your rival spirits thus pursue a post of honor which i deem my due these marks of age you see such thoughts disown in me departing for the world unknown but my warm love which ye have long possessed now prompts that counsel which you will find the best why should we now for marks of glory jar why wish to spread our martial name afar crushed as we are by fortunes cruel stroke and bent beneath an ignominious yoke ill can our minds such noble pride maintain while the fierce spaniard holds our galling chain your generous fury here ye vainly show ah rather pour it on the embattled foe what frenzy has your souls of sense bereaved ye rush to selfperdition unperceived against your own vitals would ye lift those hands whose vigor ought to burst oppressions bands if a desire of death this rage create o die not yet in this disgraceful state turn your keen arms and this indignant flame against the breast of those who sink your fame who made the world a witness of your shame haste ye to cast these hated bonds away in this the vigor of your souls display nor blindly lavish from your countrys veins blood that may yet redeem her from her chains even while i thus lament i still admire the fervor of your souls they give me fire but justly trembling at their fatal bent i dread some dire calamitous event lest in your rage dissentions frantic hand should cut the sinews of our native land if such its doom my thread of being burst and let your old compeer expire the first shall this shrunk frame thus bowed by ages weight live the weak witness of a nations fate no let some friendly sword with kind relief forbid its sinking in that scene of grief happy whose eyes in timely darkness close saved from that worst of sights his countrys woes yet while i can i make your weal my care and for the public good my thoughts declare equal ye are in courage and in worth heaven has assigned to all an equal birth in wealth in power and majesty of soul each chief seems worthy of the worlds control these gracious gifts not gratefully beheld to this dire strife your daring minds impelled but on your generous valor i depend that all our countrys woes will swiftly end a leader still our present state demands to guide to vengeance our impatient bands fit for this hardy task that chief i deem who longest may sustain a massive beam your rank is equal let your force be tried and for the strongest let his strength decide the chieftains acquiesce in this proposal which as voltaire justly observes is very natural in a nation of savages the beam is produced and of a size so enormous that the poet declares himself afraid to specify its weight the first chieftains who engage in the trial support it on their shoulders five and six hours each tucapel fourteen and lincoza more than double that number when the assembly considering his strength as almost supernatural is eager to bestow on him the title of general but in the moment he is exulting in this new honor caupolican arrives without attendants his person and character are thus described by the poet though from his birth one darkened eye he drew the viewless orb was of the granates hue nature who partly robbed him of his sight repaid this failure by redoubled might this noble youth was of the highest state his actions honored and his words of weight prompt and resolved in every generous cause a friend to justice and her sternest laws fashioned for sudden feats or toils of length his limbs possessed both suppleness and strength dauntless his mind determined and adroit in every quick and hazardous exploit   this accomplished chieftain is received with great joy by the assembly and having surpassed lincoza by many degrees in the trial is invested with the supreme command he dispatches a small party to attack a neighboring spanish fort they execute his orders and make a vigorous assault after a sharp conflict they are repulsed but in the moment of their retreat caupolican arrives with his army to their support the spaniards in despair evacuate the fort and make their escape in the night the news is brought to valdivia the spanish commander in the city of conception  and with his resolution to punish the barbarians the canto concludes  canto iii o cureless malady oh fatal pest embraced with ardor and with pride carest thou common vice thou most contagious ill bane of the mind and frenzy of the will thou foe to private and to public health thou dropsy of the soul that thirsts for wealth insatiate avarice  it is from thee we trace the various misery of our mortal race with this spirited and generous invective against that prevailing vice of his countrymen which sullied the luster of their most brilliant exploits ercilla opens his  d canto he does not scruple to assert that the enmity of the indians arose from the avaricious severity of their spanish oppressors and he accuses valdivia on this head though he gives him the praise of a brave and gallant officer  this spaniard on the first intelligence of the indian insurrection dispatched his scouts from the city where he commanded they do not return pressed by the impatient gallantry of his troops valdivia marches out  they soon discover the mangled heads of his messengers fixed up as a spectacle of terror on the road valdivia deliberates what measures to pursue his army entreat him to continue his march he consents being piqued by their insinuations of his disgracing the spanish arms an indian ally brings him an account that twenty thousand of the confederated indians are waiting to destroy him in the valley of tucapel he still presses forward arrives in sight of the fort which the indians had destroyed and engages them in a most obstinate battle in the description of which the poet introduces an original and striking simile in the following manner the steady pikemen of the savage band waiting our hasty charge in order stand but when the advancing spaniard aimed his stroke their ranks to form a hollow square they broke an easy passage to our troop they leave and deep within their lines their foes receive their files resuming then the ground they gave bury the christians in that closing grave as the keen crocodile who loves to lay his silent ambush for his finny prey hearing the scaly tribe with sportive sound advance and call a muddy darkness round opens his mighty mouth with caution wide and when the unwary fish within it glide closing with eager haste his hollow jaw thus satiates with their lives his ravenous maw so in their toils without one warning thought the murderous foe our little squadron caught with quick destruction in a fatal strife from whence no christian soldier scapd with life   such was the fate of the advanced guard of the spaniards the poet then describes the conflict of the main army with great spirit  ten spaniards distinguish themselves by signal acts of courage but are all cut in pieces the battle proceeds thus the hostile sword now deeply died in blood drenched the wide field with many a sanguine flood courage still grows to form the fierce attack but wasted vigor makes the combat slack no pause they seek to gain exhausted breath no rest except the final rest of death the wariest combatants now only try to snatch the sweets of vengeance ere they die the fierce disdain of death and scorn of flight give to our scanty troop such wondrous might the araucanian host begin to yield they quit with loss and shame the longfought field they fly and their pursuers shake the plain with joyous shouts of victory and spain but dire mischance and fates resistless sway gave a strange issue to the dreadful day an indian youth a noble chieftains son who as our friend his martial feats begun our leaders page by him to battle trained who now beside him the hard fight sustained as he beheld his kindred chiefs retire felt an indignant flash of patriot fire and thus incited to a glorious stand the flying champions of his native land misguided country by vain fear possessed ah whither do thou turn thy timid breast ye brave compatriots shall your ancient fame be vilely buried in this field of shame those laws those rights ye gloried to defend all perish all by this ignoble end from chiefs of dreaded power and honored worth ye sink to abject slaves the scorn of earth to the pure founders of your boasted race ye give the cureless wound of deep disgrace behold the wasted vigor of your foe see bathed in sweat and blood their coursers blow lose not your mental force your martial fires our best inheritance from generous sires sink not the noble araucanian name from glorys summit to the depths of shame fly fly the servitude your souls detest to the keen sword oppose the dauntless breast why show ye frames endued with manly power yet shrink from danger in the trying hour fix in your minds the friendly truth i speak vain are your fears your terror blind and weak now make your names immortal now restore freedoms lost blessings to your native shore now turn while fame and victory invite while prosperous fortune calls you to the fight or yet a moment cease o cease to fly and for our country learn of me to die as thus he speaks his eager steps advance and against the spanish chief he points his lance to lead his kindred fugitives from flight singly he dares to tempt the unequal fight against our circling arms that round him shine eager he darts amidst the thickest line keen as when chafed by summers fiery beam the young stag plunges in the cooling stream   the poet proceeds to relate the great agility and valor displayed by lantaro for such is the name of this gallant and patriotic youth and as ercilla has a soul sufficiently heroic to do full justice to the virtues of an enemy he gives him the highest praise having mentioned on the occasion many heroes of ancient history he exclaims say of these famous chiefs can one exceed or match this young barbarians noble deed victory for them her purpose unexplord tempted by equal chance their happy sword what risk what peril did they boldly meet save where ambition urged the splendid feat or mightier interest fired the daring mind which makes a hero of the fearful hind many there are who with a brave disdain face all the perils of the deathful plain who fired by hopes of glory nobly dare yet fail the stroke of adverse chance to bear with animated fire their spirit shines till the short splendour of their day declines but all their valor all their strength expires when fickle fortune from their side retires this youthful hero when the die was cast wars dire decree against his country past made the stern power the finished cause resume and finally reverse the cruel doom he by his efforts in the dread debate forced the determined will of adverse fate from shouting triumph rushed the palm to tear and fixed it on the brow of faint despair   caupolican leading his army back to the charge in consequence of lantaros efforts in their favor obtains a complete victory the spaniards are all slain in the field except their commander valdivia who flies attended only by a priest but he is soon taken prisoner and conducted before the indian chief who is inclined to spare his life when an elder savage called leocato in a sudden burst of indignation kills him with his club  all the people of arauco assemble in a great plain to celebrate their victory old and young women and children unite in the festival and the trees that surround the scene of their assembly are decorated with the heads and spoils of their slaughtered enemies  they meditate the total extermination of the spaniards from their country and even a descent on spain the general makes a prudent speech to restrain their impetuosity and afterward bestowing just applause on the brave exploit of the young lantaro appoints him his lieutenant in the midst of the festivity caupolican receives advice that a party of fourteen spanish horsemen had attacked some of his forces with great havoc he dispatches lantaro to oppose them  canto iv a party of fourteen gallant spaniards who had set forth from the city of imperial to join valdivia not being apprized of his unhappy fate are surprised by the enemy where they expected to meet their commander  they defend themselves with great valor they are informed by a friendly indian of the fate of valdivia they attempt to retreat but are surrounded by numbers of the araucanians  when the poet introduces the following instance of spanish heroism which i insert as a curious stroke of their military character here cried a spaniard far unlike his race nor shall his abject name my verse debase marking his few associates march along o that our band were but a hundred strong the brave gonsalo with disdain replied rather let two be severed from our side kind heaven that memory may our feats proclaim and call our little troop the twelve of fame   they continue to fight with great bravery against superior numbers when lantaro arrives with a fresh army against them still undaunted they only resolve to sell their lives as dear as possible seven of them are cut to pieces  in the midst of the slaughter a furious thunder and hail storm arises by which incident the surviving seven escape the tempest is described with the following original simile now in the turbid air a stormy cloud spreads its terrific shadow over the crowd the gathering darkness hides the solar ray and to the affrighted earth denies the day the rushing winds to which the forests yield rive the tall tree and desolate the field in drops distinct and rare now falls the rain and now with thickening fury beats the plain as the bold master of the martial drum ere to the shock the advancing armies come in awful notes that shake the heavens high arch intrepid strikes the slow and solemn march but when the charging heroes yield their breath doubles the horrid harmony of death so the dark tempest with increasing sound pours the loud deluge on the echoing ground   the few spaniards that escape take refuge in a neighboring fort which they abandon the following day on hearing the fate of valdivia lantaro returns and receives new honors and new forces from his general to march against a spanish army which departs from the city of penco under the command of villagran an experienced officer to revenge the death of valdivia the departure of the troops from penco is described and the distress of the women  villagran marches with expedition toward the frontiers of arauco he arrives at a dangerous pass and finds lantaro with his army of  0 00 indians advantageously posted on the heights and waiting with great steadiness and discipline to give him battle  canto v lantaro with great difficulty restrains the eager indians in their post on the rock he suffers a few to descend and skirmish on the lower ground where several distinguish themselves in single combat the spaniards attempt in vain to dislodge the army of lantaro by an attack of their cavalry  they afterward fire on them from six pieces of cannon  the vexed air feels the thunder of the fight and smoke and flame involve the mountains height earth seems to open as the flames aspire and new volcanos spout destructive fire lantaro saw no hopes of life allowed save by dispersing this terrific cloud that pours its lightning with so dire a shock smiting his lessened host who strew the rock and to the troop of leucoton the brave his quick command the skilful leader gave he bids them fiercely to the charge descend and thus exhorts aloud each ardent friend my faithful partners in bright victorys meed whom fortune summons to this noble deed behold the hour when your prevailing might shall prove that justice guards us in the fight now firmly fix your lances in the rest and rush to honor over each hostile breast through every bar your bloody passage force nor let a brothers fall impede your course be yon dread instruments of death your aim possessed of these you gain eternal fame the camp shall follow your triumphant trace and own you leaders in the glorious chase while these bold words their ardent zeal exalt they rush impetuous to the rash assault the indians undismayed by a dreadful slaughter gain possession of the cannon  villagran makes a short but spirited harangue to his flying soldiers he is unable to rally them and choosing rather to die than to survive so ignominious a defeat rushes into the thickest of the enemy  when the poet leaving his fate uncertain concludes the canto  canto vi the valiant mind is privileged to feel superior to each turn of fortunes wheel chance has no power its value to debase or brand it with the mark of deep disgrace so thought the noble villagran our chief who chose that death should end his present grief and smooth the horrid path with thorns overspread which destiny condemned his feet to tread with the preceding encomium on the spirit of this unfortunate officer the poet opens his  th canto thirteen of the most faithful soldiers of villagran perceiving their leader fallen motionless under the fury of his enemies make a desperate effort to preserve him  being placed again on his horse by these generous deliverers he recovers from the blow which had stunned him and by singular exertion with the assistance of his spirited little troop effects his escape and rejoins his main army whom he endeavors in vain to lead back against the triumphant araucanians the pursuit becomes general and the poet describes the horrid massacre committed by the indians on all the unhappy fugitives that fell into their hands  the spaniards in their flight are stopped by a narrow pass fortified and guarded by a party of indians villagran forces the rude entrenchment in person and conducts part of his army safe through the pass but many attempting other roads over the mountainous country are either lost among the precipices of the rocks or pursued and killed by the indians  canto vii the remains of the spanish army after infinite loss and fatigue at last reach the city of concepcion  their entrance in these walls let fancy paint overwhelmed with anguish and with labor faint these gashd with ghastly wounds those writhed with pain and some their human semblance scarce retain they seem unhappy spirits scapd from hell yet wanting voice their misery to tell their pangs to all their rolling eyes express and silence most declares their deep distress when weariness and shame at length allowed their tongues to satisfy the enquiring crowd from the pale citizens amazed to hear a tale surpassing even their wildest fear one general sound of lamentation rose that deeply solemnized a nations woes the neighboring mansions to their grief reply and every wall returned the mournful cry the inhabitants of concepcion expecting every instant the triumphant lantaro at their gates resolve to abandon their city a gallant veteran upbraids their cowardly design they disregard his reproaches and evacuate the place  when the poet introduces the following instance of female heroism it is just that fame a noble deed display which claims remembrance even to the day when memorys hand no more the pen shall use but sink in darkness and her being lose the lovely mencia an accomplished dame a valiant spirit in a tender frame here firmly showed as this dread scene began courage now found not in the heart of man the bed of sickness twas her chance to press but when she heard the citys loud distress snatching such weapons as the time allowed she rushed indignant midst the flying crowd now up the neighboring hill they slowly wind and bending often their mournful eyes behind cast a sad look of every hope berest on those rich plains the precious home they left more poignant grief see generous mencia feel more noble proof she gives of patriot zeal waving a sword in her heroic hand in their tame march she stopped the timid band crossed the ascending road before their van and turning to the city thus began thou valiant nation whose unequalled toils have dearly purchased fame and golden spoils where is the courage ye so often displayed against this foe from whom ye shrink dismayed where those high hopes and that aspiring flame which made immortal praise your constant aim where your firm souls that every chance defied and native strength that formed your noble pride ah whither would you fly in selfish fear in frantic haste with no pursuer near how often has censure to your hearts assigned ardor too keenly brave and rashly blind eager to dart amid the doubtful fray scorning the useful aid of wise delay have we not seen you with contempt oppose and bend beneath your yoke unnumberd foes attempt and execute designs so bold ye grew immortal as ye heard them told turn to your people turn a pitying eye to whom your fears these happy seats deny turn and survey this fair this fertile land whose ready tribute waits your lordly hand survey its pregnant mines its sands of gold survey the flock now wandering from its fold mark how it vainly seeks in wild despair the faithless shepherd who forsakes his care even the dumb creatures of domestic kind though not endowed with mans discerning mind now show the semblance of a reasoning soul and in their masters misery condole the stronger animals of sterner heart take it this public woe a feeling part their plaintive roar that speaks their sense aright justly upbraids your ignominious flight ye fly from quiet opulence and fame purchased by valor your acknowledged claim from these ye fly to seek a foreign seat where dastard fugitives no welcome meet how deep the shame an abject life to spend in poor dependence on a pitying friend turn let the brave their only choice await or honorable life or instant fate return return o quit this path of shame stain not by fear your yet unsullied name myself i offer if our foes advance to rush the foremost on the hostile lance my actions then shall with my words agree and what a woman dares your eyes shall see return return she cried but cried in vain her fire seemed frenzy to the coward train   the dastardly inhabitants of the city unmoved by this remonstrance of the noble donna mencia de nidos continue their precipitate flight and after twelve days of confusion and fatigue reach the city of santiago in the valley of mapocho lantaro arrives in the mean time before the walls they had deserted  and the poet concludes his canto with a spirited description of the barbaric fury with which the indians entered the abandoned city and destroyed by fire the rich and magnificent mansions of their spanish oppressors  canto viii lantaro is recalled from his victorious exploits to assist at a general assembly of the indians in the valley of arauco the different chieftains deliver their various sentiments concerning the war after their leader caupolican has declared his design to pursue the spaniards with unceasing vengeance the veteran colocolo proposes a plan for their military operations an ancient augur named puchecalco denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen in the name of the indian demon eponamon he recites the omens of their destruction the fierce tucapel provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet strikes him dead in the midst of his harangue by a sudden blow of his mace caupolican orders the murderous chieftain to be led to instant death he defends himself with success against numbers who attempt to seize him lantaro pleased by this exertion of his wonderful force and valor entreats the general to forgive what had passed and at his intercession tucapel is received into favor lantaro then closes the business of the assembly by recommending the plan proposed by colocolo and entreating that he may himself be entrusted with a detached party of five hundred indians with which he engages to reduce the city of santiago his proposal is accepted the chieftains having finished their debate declare their resolutions to their people and after their usual festivity caupolican with the main army proceeds to attack the city of imperial  canto ix the poet opens this canto with an apology for a miracle which he thinks it necessary to relate as it was attested by the whole indian army and though it does not afford him any very uncommon or sublime imagery he embellishes the wonder he describes by his easy and spirited versification of which the following lines are an imperfect copy when to the citys weak defenseless wall its foes were rushing at their trumpets call the air grew troubled with portentous sound and mournful omens multiplied around with furious shock the elements engage and all the winds contend in all their rage from clashing clouds their mingled torrents gush and rain and hail with rival fury rush bolts of loud thunder floods of lightning rend the opening skies and into earth descend over the vast army equal terrors spread no mind escapes the universal dread no breast though armed with adamantine power holds its firm vigor in this horrid hour for now the fierce eponamon appears and in a dragons form augments their fears involving flames around the demon swell who speaks his mandate in a hideous yell he bids his votaries with haste invest the trembling city by despair deprest wherever the invading squadrons force their way he promises their arms an easy prey spare not he cried in the relentless strife one spanish battlement one christian life he spoke and while the host his will adore melts into vapor and is seen no more quick as he vanished natures struggles cease the troubled elements are soothed to peace the winds no longer rage with boundless ire but hushed insilence to their caves retire the clouds disperse restoring as they fly the unobstructed sun and azure sky fear only held its place and still possessed usurped dominion over the boldest breast the tempest ceased and heaven serenely bright arrayed the moistened earth in joyous light when poised upon a cloud that swiftly flew a female form descended to their view clad in the radiance of so rich a veil as made the suns meridian luster pale for it outshone his golden orb as far as his full blaze outshines the twinkling star her sacred features banish all their dread and over the host reviving comfort shed an hoary elder by her side appeared for age and sanctity of life revered and thus she spoke with soft persuasive grace ah whither rush ye blind devoted race turn while you can toward your native plain nor against yon city point your arms in vain for god will guard his faithful christian band and give them empire over your bleeding land since thankless false and obstinate in ill you scorn submission to his sacred will yet shun those walls the almighty there adored there arms his people with destructions sword so spoke the vision with an angels tongue and through the spacious air to heaven she sprung   the indians confounded by this miraculous interposition disperse in disorder to their several homes and the poet proceeds very gravely to affirm that having obtained the best information from many individuals concerning this miracle that he might be very exact in his account of it he finds it happened on the twentythird of april four years before he wrote the verses that describe it and in the year of our lord      the vision was followed by pestilence and famine among the indians they remain inactive during the winter but assemble again the ensuing spring in the plains of arauco to renew the war they receive intelligence that the spaniards are attempting to rebuild the city of concepcion and are requested by the neighboring tribes to march to their assistance and prevent that design lantaro leads a chosen band on that expedition hoping to surprise the fort the spaniards had erected on the ruins of their city but the spanish commander alvarado being apprized of their motion sallies forth to meet the indian party a skirmish ensues the spaniards retire to their fort lantaro attempts to storm it a most bloody encounter ensues tucapel signalizes himself in the attack the indians persevere with the most obstinate valor and after a long conflict described with a considerable portion of homeric spirit gain possession of the fort alvarado and a few of his followers escape they are pursued and much galled in their flight a single indian named rengo harrasses alvarado and two of his attendants the spanish officer provoked by the insult turns with his two companions to punish their pursuer but the wily indian secures himself on some rocky heights and annoys them with his sling till despairing of revenge they continue their flight  canto x the indians celebrate their victory with public games and prizes are appointed for such as excel in their various martial exercises leucoton is declared victor in the contest of throwing the lance and receives a scimitar as his reward rengo subdues his two rivals cayeguan and talco in the exercise of wrestling and proceeds to contend with leucoton after a long and severe struggle rengo has the misfortune to fall by an accidental failure of the ground but springing lightly up engages his adversary with increasing fury and the canto ends without deciding the contest  canto xi lantaro separates the two enraged antagonists to prevent the ill effects of their wrath the youth orompello whom leucoton had before surpassed in the contest of the lance challenges his successful rival to wrestle they engage and fall together the victory is disputed tucapel demands the prize for his young friend orompello and insults the general caupolican the latter is restrained from avenging the insult by the sage advice of the veteran colocolo at whose request he distributes prizes of equal value to each of the claimants to prevent farther animosities they relinquish the rest of the appointed games and enter into debate on the war lantaro is again appointed to the command of a chosen troop and marches toward the city of st jago the spaniards alarmed at the report of his approach send out some forces to reconnoitre his party a skirmish ensues they are driven back to the city and relate that lantaro is fortifying a strong post at some distance intending soon to attack the city villagran the spaniard who commanded there being confined by illness appoints an officer of his own name to sally forth with all the forces he can raise in quest of the enemy the spaniards fix their camp on the approach of night near the fort of lantaro they are suddenly alarmed and summoned to arms but the alarm is occasioned only by a single horse without a rider which lantaro aware of their approach had turned loose toward their camp as an insulting mode of proclaiming his late victory in which he had taken ten of the spanish horses  the spaniards pass the night under arms resolving to attack the indians at break of day lantaro had issued orders that no indian should sally from the fort under pain of death to prevent the advantage which the spanish cavalry must have over his small forces in the open plain he also commanded his soldiers to retreat with an appearance of dismay at the first attack on the fort and suffer a considerable number of the enemy to enter the place this stratagem succeeds the spaniards rush forward with great fury the indians give ground but soon turning with redoubled violence on those who had passed their lines destroy many and oblige the rest to save themselves by a precipitate flight the indians forgetting the orders of their leader in the ardour of vengeance sally forth in pursuit of their flying enemy lantaro recalls them by the sound of a military horn which he blows with the utmost violence they return but dare not appear in the presence of their offended commander he issues new restrictions and then summoning his soldiers together addresses them in a spirited yet calm and affectionate harangue on the necessity of martial obedience while he is yet speaking the spaniards return to the attack but are again repulsed with great loss they retreat and encamp at the foot of a mountain unmolested by any pursuers  canto xii the spaniards remain in their camp while two of their adventurous soldiers engage to return once more to the fort and examine the state of it on their approach one of them called marcos vaez is saluted by his name and promised security by a voice from within the walls lantaro had formerly lived with him on terms of friendship and now invites him into the fort the indian chief harangues on the resolution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the spaniards unless they submit he proposes however terms of accommodation to his old friend marcos and specifies the tribute he should expect the spaniard answers with disdain that the only tribute the indians would receive from his countrymen would be torture and death lantaro replies with great temper that arms and the valor of the respective nations must determine this point and proceeds to entertain his guest with a display of six indians whom he had mounted and trained to exercise on spanish horses the spaniard challenges the whole party lantaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict but dismisses him in peace he recalls him before he had proceeded far from the fort and telling him that his soldiers were much distressed by the want of provision entreats him to send a supply affirming it to be true heroism to relieve an enemy from the necessities of famine the spaniard subscribes to the sentiment and engages if possible to comply with the request returning to his camp he acquaints his commander villagran with all that had passed who suspecting some dangerous design from lantaro decamps hastily in the night to regain the city the indian chief is severely mortified by their departure as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat by letting large currents of water into the marshy ground on which the spaniards were encamped despairing of being able to succeed against their city now prepared to resist him he returns toward arauco most sorely galled by his disappointment and thus venting his anguish what can redeem lantaros wounded name what plea preserve his failing arms from shame did not my ardent soul this task demand which now upbraids my unperforming hand on me on me alone can censure fall myself the adviser and the guide of all am i the chief who in fames bright career asked to subdue the globe a single year while at the head of this my glittering train i weakly threaten spanish walls in vain thrice has pale cynthia with replenished ray seen my illorderd troop in loose array and the rich chariot of the blazing sun has from the scorpion to aquarius run at last as fugitives these paths we tread and mourn twice fifty brave companions dead could fates kind hand this hateful stain efface could death redeem me from this worse disgrace my useless spear should pierce this abject heart which has so ill sustained a soldiers part unworthy thought the mean ignoble blow would only tempt my proud and vaunting foe to boast that i preferred in fears alarm my own weak weapon to his stronger arm by hell i swear who rules the sanguine strife if chance allow me yet a year of life i will chase these foreign lords from chiles strand and spanish blood shall saturate our land no changing season neither cold nor heat shall make the firmer step of war retreat nor shall the earth nor hells expanding cave from this avenging arm one spaniard save now the brave chief with solemn ardor swore to his dear native home to turn no more from no fierce sun no stormy winds to fly but patiently abide the varying sky and spurn all thoughts of pleasure and of ease till rescued fame his tortured soul appease till earth confess the brave lantaros hand has closed the glorious work his spirit planned in these resolves the hero found relief and thus relaxed the oerstraind cord of grief whose pressure galled him with such mental pain that frenzy almost seized his burning brain   lantaro continues his march into an indian district from which he collects a small increase of force and after addressing his soldiers concerning the expediency of strict military discipline and the cause of their late ill success he turns again toward the city of st jago but receiving intelligence on his road of its preparations for defense he again suspends his design and fortifies a post which he chooses with the hope of collecting still greater numbers to assist him in his projected enterprise the spaniards at st jago are eager to sally in quest of lantaro but their commander villagran was absent on an expedition to the city of imperial in returning from thence he passes near the post of lantaro an indian ally acquaints him with its situation and at the earnest request of the spanish officer agrees to conduct him by a short though difficult road over a mountain to attack the fort by surprise the poet suspends his narration of this interesting event to relate the arrival of new forces from spain in america and he now begins to appear himself on the field of action hitherto says he i have described the scenes in which i was not present yet i have collected my information from no partial witnesses and i have recorded only those events in which both parties agree since it is known that i have shed so much blood in support of what i affirm my future narration will be more authentic for i now speak as an ocular witness of every action unblinded by partiality which i disdain and resolved to rob no one of the praise which he deserves  after pleading his youth as an apology for the defects of his style and after declaring that his only motive for writing was the ardent desire to preserve so many valiant actions from perishing in oblivion the poet proceeds to relate the arrival of the marquis de canete as viceroy in peru and the spirited manner in which he corrected the abuses of that country the canto concludes with reflections on the advantages of loyalty and the miseries of rebellion  canto xiii spanish deputies from the province of chile implore assistance from the new viceroy of peru he sends them a considerable succor under the conduct of don garcia his son the poet is himself of this band and relates the splendid preparations for the enterprise and the embarkation of the troops in ten vessels which sail from lima toward the coast of chile having described part of this voyage he returns to the bold exploit of villagran and the adventures of lantaro the most interesting of all the araucanian heroes whom he left securing himself in his sequestered fort  a path where watchful sentinels were spread a single path to this lone station led no other signs of human step were traced for the vexed land was desolate and waste it chanced that night the noble chieftain pressed his anxious mistress to his gallant breast the fair guacolda for whose charms he burned and whose warm heart his faithful love returned that night beheld the warlike savage rest free from the encumbrance of his martial vest that night alone allowed his eyes to close in the deceitful calm of short repose sleep pressed upon him like the weight of death but soon he starts alarmed and gasps for breath the fair guacolda with a trembling tongue anxious enquires from whence his anguish sprung my lovely fair the brave lantaro cries an hideous vision struck my scornful eyes methought that instant a fierce chief of spain mocked my vain spear with insolent disdain his forceful arm my failing powers oercame and strength and motion seemed to quit my frame but still the vigor of my soul i keep and its keen anger burst the bonds of sleep with quick despair the troubled fair one said alas thy dreams confirm the ills i dread it is come  the object of my boding fears thy end the source of my unceasing tears yet not so wretched is this mournful hour nor over me fortune can thou boast such power but that kind death may shorten all my woes and give the agonizing scene to close let my stern fate its cruel rage employ and hurl me from the throne of love and joy whatever pangs its malice may devise it cannot rend affections stronger ties though horrible the blow my fears foresee a second blow will set my spirit free for cold on earth thy frame shall never be found while mine with useless being loads the ground the chief transported with her tender charms closely around her neck entwined his arms and while fond tears her snowy breast bedewed thus with redoubled love his speech pursued my generous fair thy gloomy thoughts dismiss nor let dark omens interrupt our bliss and cloud these moments that with transport shine while my exulting heart thus feels thee mine thy troubled fancy prompts my mutual sigh not that i think the hour of danger nigh but love so melts me with his soft control impossibilities alarm my soul if thy kind wishes bid lantaro live who to this frame the wound of death can give though against me all the powers of earth combine my life is subject to no hand but thine who has restored the araucanian name and raised it sinking in the depths of shame when alien lords our nations spirit broke and bent its neck beneath a servile yoke i am the chief who burst our galling chain and freed my country from oppressive spain my name alone without my swords display humbles our foes and fills them with dismay these happy arms while thy dear beauties fill i feel no terror i foresee no ill be not by false and empty dreams deprest since truth has nothing to afflict thy breast often have i scapd inured to every state from many a darker precipice of fate often in far mightier perils riskd my life and issued glorious from the doubtful strife with lessening confidence and deeper grief trembling she hung upon the soothing chief his lip with supplicating softness pressed and urged with many a tear this fond request if the pure love which prodigal and free when freedom most was mine i gave to thee if truth which heaven will witness and defend weigh with my sovereign lord and gentle friend by these let me adjure thee by the pain which at our parting pierced my every vein and all the vows if undispersd in air which then with many a tear i heard thee swear to this my only wish at least agree if all thy wishes have been laws to me haste i entreat thee arm thyself with care and bid thy soldiers for defense prepare the brave barbarian quick replied  it is clear how low my powers are rated by thy fear can thou so poorly of lantaro deem and is this arm so sunk in thy esteem this arm which rescuing thy native earth so prodigally proved its valiant worth in my tried courage how complete thy trust whose terror weeps thy living lord as dust in thee she cries with confidence most pure my soul is satisfied yet not secure what will thy arm avail in dangers course if my malignant fate has mightier force but let the misery i forebode arise on this firm thought my constant love relies the sword whose stroke our union may disjoin will teach my faithful soul to follow thine since my hard destiny with rage severe thus threatens me with all that love can fear since i am doomed the worst of ills to see and lose all earthly good in losing thee o suffer me to pass ere death appears the little remnant of my life in tears the heart that sinks not in distress like this could never feel could never merit bliss here from her eyes such floods of sorrow flow compassion weeps in gazing on her woe the fond lantaro though of firmest power sheds as she speaks a sympathetic shower but to the tender scenes of love unused my artless pen embarrassd and confused from its sad talk with diffidence withdraws and in its labor asks a little pause canto xiv what erring wretch to truth and beauty blind shall dare to satirize the female kind since pure affection prompts their anxious care their lovely weakness and their fond despair this fair barbarian free from christian ties a noble proof of perfect love supplies by kindest words and floods of tears that roll from the clear source of her impassioned soul the chearing ardor of the dauntless chief fails to afford her troubled mind relief nor can the ample trench and guarded wall preserve her doubtful heart from fears enthrall her terrors rushing with loves mighty force level whatever would impede their course she finds no shelter from her cruel doom save the dear refuge of lantaros tomb thus their two hearts where equal passion reigned a fond debate with tender strife maintained their differing words alike their love display feed the sweet poison and augment its sway the sleepy soldiers now their stories close and stretched around their sinking fires repose the path in front with sentinels was lined and the high mountain was their guard behind but over that mountain with adventurous tread bold villagran his silent forces led his hasty march with painful toil he made toil is the price that must for fame be paid now near the fort and halting in its sight he waits the coming aid of clearer light the stars yet shining but their fires decay and now the reddening east proclaims the day the advancing troop no indian eye alarms for friendly darkness hovered over their arms and on the quarter where the mountain rose the careless guard despised the thought of foes no panting horse their still approach betrayed propitious fortune lent the spaniards aid fortune who often bids drowsy sloth beware and lulls to sleep the watchful eye of care when nights obscure dominion first declines and glimmering light the dusky air refines the weary guards who round the wall were placed hail the new day and from their station haste secure of ill no longer watch they keep quick to forget their nightly toils in sleep through all the fort there reigned a calm profound in wine and slumber all its force was drowned the spanish chief who saw the favoring hour led on by slow degrees his silent power no indian eyes perceived his near advance fate seemed to bind them in a cruel trance each in sound slumber draws his easy breath nor feels his slumber will be closed by death so blind are mortals to that tyrants sway they deem him distant while they sink his prey our eager soldiers now no longer halt while kind occasion prompts the keen assault a shout they raise terrific loud and long swelled by the voice of all the ardent throng whose ranks obedient to their leaders call rush with light ardoro er the unguarded wall and gain the fort where sleeps oppressive weight exposed his wretched victims blind to fate as villains conscious of their life impure find in their guilty course no spot secure for vice is ever doomed new fears to feel and tremble at each turn of fortunes wheel at every noise at each alarm that stirs deaths penal horror to their mind occurs quick to their arms they fly with wild dismay and rush where hasty terror points the way so quick the indians to the tumult came with sleep and valor struggling in their frame unawed by dangers unexpected sight they rouse their fellows and they rush to fight though their brave bosoms are of armor bare their manly hearts their martial rage declare no furious odds their gallant souls appall but resolute they fly to guard the wall it was the season when with tender care lantaro reasoned with his anxious fair carest consold and in his anger kind mildly reproved her weak mistrusting mind spite of his chearing voice she trembles still severer terrors now her bosom fill for sterner sounds their soft debate overcome drowned in the rattle of the alarming drum but not so quick on apprehensions wings the wretched miser from his pillow springs whose hoarded gold forbids his mind to rest if doubtful noise the nightly thief suggest nor yet so hasty though with terror wild flies the fond mother to her wounded child whose painful cry her shuddering soul alarms as flew lantaro at the sound of arms his mantle rapidly around him rolled and grasping a light sword with hasty hold too eager for his heavier arms to wait the fierce barbarian hurried to the gate o faithless fortune thou deceitful friend of thy false favors how severe the end how quick thou cancellst when thy frown appears the accumulated gifts of long triumphant years to aid the spaniards in their bold emprize four hundred indians marched their firm allies who on the left their line of battle close and haste to combat with their painted bows launching adroitly in their rapid course unnumberd arrows with unerring force as brave lantaro issued from his tent a shaft to meet the sallying chief was sent through his left side ye valiant mourn his lot flew the keen arrow with such fury shot it pierced his heart the bravest and the best that ever was lodged within a human breast proud of the stroke that laid such valor low death seemed to glory in the important blow and that no mortal might his triumph claim in darkness hid the doubtful archers name such force the keen resistless weapon found it stretched the mighty chieftain on the ground and gave large outlet to his ardent blood that gushed apace in a tumultuous flood from his sunk cheek its native color fled his sightless eyes rolled in his ghastly head his soul that felt its glorious hopes overthrown retired indignant to the world unknown the noble savages not dismayed by the death of their leader continue to defend the fort with great fury  canto xv the poet opens this canto with a lively panegyric on love he affirms that the greatest poets have derived their glory from their vivid descriptions of this enchanting passion and he laments that he is precluded by his subject from indulging his imagination in such scenes as are more likely to captivate a reader  he seems to intend this as an apology but i must own it is an unsatisfactory one for deserting the fair guacolda whom he mentions no more he proceeds to describe the sharp contest which the undaunted indians still maintained in their fort  they refuse quarter which is offered them by the spanish leader and all resolutely perish with the brave and beloved lantaro the poet then resumes his account of the naval expedition from peru to chile and concludes the canto with a spirited description of a storm which attacked the vessels as they arrived in sight of the province to which they were steering  canto xvi the storm abates the spaniards land and fortify themselves on an island near the country of the araucanians the latter hold a council of war in the valley of ongolmo caupolican their general proposes to attack the spaniards in their new post the elder chieftains dissuade him from the design a quarrel ensues between tucapel and the aged peteguelen  they are appeased by a speech of the venerable colocolo by whose advice a spirited and adroit young indian named millalanco is dispatched as a peaceful ambassador to learn the situation and designs of the spaniards he embarks in a large galley with oars and soon arrives at the island he surveys the spanish implements of war with astonishment and is conducted to the tent of the general don garcia  canto xvii the indian addresses the spanish officers with a proposal of peace and amity he is dismissed with presents the chieftains on his return pretend to relinquish hostilities but prepare secretly for war the spaniards remain unmolested on the island during the stormy season they send a select party of a hundred and thirty including our poet to raise a fort on the continent these execute their commission with infinite dispatch and all the spanish troops remove to this new post the araucanians are alarmed an intrepid youth named gracolano proposes to the indian general caupolican to storm the fort the indians advance near it under shelter of the night the poet describes himself at this juncture as oppressed by the excessive labors of the day and unable to pursue his poetical studies according to his nightly custom the pen falls from his hand he is seized with violent pains and tremblings his strength and senses forsake him but soon recovering from this infirmity he enjoys a refreshing sleep bellona appears to him in a vision and encourages him both as a soldier and a poet she conducts him through a delicious country to the summit of a most lofty mountain when pointing to a spot below she informs him it is st quintin and that his countrymen under the command of their sovereign philip are just marching to attack it she adds that her presence is necessary in the midst of that important scene and leaves the poet on the eminence to survey and record the battle  canto xviii after the poet has described the success of his royal master at st quintin a female figure of a most venerable appearance but without a name relates to him prophetically many future events of great importance to his country she touches on the disturbances in the netherlands the enterprises of the turks and the exploits of don john of austria at that time unknown to fame these she hints very imperfectly telling the poet that if he wishes for farther information he must follow the steps of a tame deer which he will find in a particular spot this animal will lead him to the cell of an ancient hermit formerly a soldier who will conduct him to the secret cave of the unsocial fiton a mighty magician who will display to him the most miraculous visions his female instructor then advises him to mix softer subjects with the horrors of war and to turn his eyes and his thoughts to the charms of the many beauties who then flourished in spain he beholds all these lovely fair ones assembled in a delicious paradise and he is particularly attracted by a young lady whose name he discovers to be donna maria bazan his future wife in the moment that he begins to question his guide concerning this engaging beauty he is roused from his vision by the sound of an alarm he snatches up his arms and hurries to his post  while the morning dawns and the indians begin to attack the fort  canto xix the indians advance in three squadrons the youth gracolano oerleaps the trench supported on a lofty pike by which he also passes the wall he defends himself in the midst of the spaniards with great spirit but finding himself unsupported he wrenches a lance from a spanish soldier and tries to leap once more over the trench but he is struck by a stone while vaulting through the air and falls covered as the poet expressly declares with twoandthirty wounds some of his friends are shot near him but the indians get possession of the spanish lance with which he had sprung over the wall and brandish it in triumph the spaniard named elvira who had lost his weapon piqued by the adventure sallies from the fort and returns amid the shouts of his countrymen with an indian spear which he won in single combat from a barbarian whom he had perceived detached from his party the indians attempt to storm the fort on every side many are destroyed by the spanish firearms the head of the ancient peteguelen is shot off but tucapel passes the wall and rushes with great slaughter into the midst of the enemy the spaniards who were in the ships that anchored near the coast hasten on shore and march to assist their countrymen in the fort but are attacked by a party of indians in their march the conflict continues furious on the walls but the indians at length retreat leaving tucapel still fighting within the fort  canto xx tucapel though severely wounded escapes with life and rejoins the indian army which continues to retreat the spaniards sally from the fort but soon return to it from the apprehension of an ambuscade they clear their trench and strengthen the weaker parts of their fortification night comes on the poet describes himself stationed on a little eminence in the plain below the fort which was seated on high and rocky ground  fatigued with the toils of the day and oppressed by the weight of his armor which he continues to wear he is troubled with a lethargic heaviness which he counteracts by exercise declaring that his disposition to slumber in his post arose not from any intemperance either in diet or in wine as moldy biscuit and rainwater had been for some time his chief sustenance and that he was accustomed to make the moist earth his bed and to divide his time between his poetical and his military labors he then relates the following nocturnal adventure which may perhaps be considered as the most striking and pathetic incident in this singular poem while thus i strove my nightly watch to keep and struggled with the oppressive weight of sleep as my quick feet with many a silent stride traversed the allotted ground from side to side my eye perceived one quarter of the plain white with the mingled bodies of the slain for our incessant fire that bloody day had slaughtered numbers in the stubborn fray as often i paused each distant noise to hear gazing around me with attentive ear i heard from time to time a feeble sound toward the breathless indians on the ground still closing with a sigh of mournful length at every interval it gathered strength and now it ceased and now again begun and still from corse to corse it seemed to run as nights increasing shade my hope destroys to view the source of this uncertain noise eager my minds unquiet doubts to still and more the duties of my post fulfill with crouching steps i haste and earnest eyes to the low spot from whence the murmurs rise and see a dusky form that seems to tread slow on four feet among the gory dead with terror that my heart will not deny when this strange vision struck my doubtful eye toward it with a prayer to heaven i pressed arms in my hand my corselet on my breast but now the dusky form on which i sprung upright arose and spoke with plaintive tongue mercy to mercy hear my just pretense i am a woman guiltless of offense if my distress and unexampled plight no generous pity in thy breast excite if thy bloodthirsty rage by tears uncheckd would pass those limits which the brave respect will such a deed increase thy martial fame when heavens just voice shall to the world proclaim that by thy ruthless sword a woman died a widow sunk in sorrows deepest tide yet i implore thee if twas happily thine or for thy curse as now i feel it mine if ever thy lot in any state to prove how firm the faithful ties of tender love o let me bury one brave warrior slain whose corse lies blended with this breathless train remember he who thwarts the duteous will becomes the approver and the cause of ill thou will not hinder these my pious vows war fiercest war this just demand allows the basest tyranny alone is driven to use the utmost power that chance has given let but my soul its dear companion find then sat thy fury if to blood inclined for in such grief i draw my lingering breath life is my dread beyond the pangs of death there is no ill that now can wound my breast no good but what i in my love possessed fly then ye hours that keep me from the dead for he the spirit of my life is fled if adverse heaven my latest wish deny on his dear corse to fix my closing eye my tortured soul in cruel fates despite will soar the faithful partner of his flight and now her agony of heart implored an end of all her sorrows from my sword doubt and distrust my troubled mind assail that fears deceit in her affecting tale nor was i fully of her faith secure till often her words the mournful truth insure suspicion whispered that an artful spy by this illusion might our state descry however inclined to doubt yet soon i knew though night concealed her features from my view that truth was stamped on every word she said so full of grief so free from guilty dread and that bold love to every danger blind had sent her forth her slaughtered lord to find who in the onset of our bloody strife for brave distinction sacrificed his life filled with compassion when i saw her bent to execute her chaste and fond intent i led her weeping to the higher spot to guard whose precincts was that night my lot securely there i begged her to relate the perfect story of her various fate from first to last her touching woes impart and by the tale relieve her loaded heart ah she replied relief i never can know till deaths kind aid shall terminate my woe earth for my ills no remedy supplies beyond all suffrance my afflictions rise yet though the talk will agonize my soul of my sad story i will tell the whole grief thus enforced my lifes weak thread may rend and in the killing tale my pangs may end   the fair indian then relates to ercilla the particulars of her life in speech of considerable length  she informs him that her name is tegualda  that she is the daughter of the chieftain brancol  that her father had often pressed her to marry which she had for some time declined though solicited by many of the noblest youths in her country till being appointed in compliment to her beauty to distribute the prizes in a scene of public festivity to those who excelled in the manly exercises she was struck by the accomplishments of a gallant youth named crepino as she bestowed on him the reward of his victories  that she declared her choice to her father after perceiving the youth inspired with a mutual affection for her  that the old chieftain was delighted by her choosing so noble a character and their marriage had been publicly solemnized but a month from that day on this conclusion of her story she bursts into new agonies of grief and entreats ercilla to let her pay her last duties to her husband or rather to unite them again in a common grave ercilla endeavors to console her by repeated promises of all the assistance in his power in the most passionate excess of sorrow she still entreats him to end her miserable life  in this distressing scene our author is relieved by the arrival of a brother officer who had been also stationed on the plain and now informs ercilla that the time of their appointed watch is expired they join in comforting the unhappy mourner and conduct her into the fort where they consign her for the remainder of the night to the decent care of married women to use the chaste expression of the generous and compassionate ercilla  canto xxi in pure affection who has soared above the tender pious proof of faithful love which thus awaked our sympathetic care for this unhappy fond barbarian fair o that just fame my humble voice would raise to swell in loudest notes her lasting praise to spread her merits in immortal rhyme through every language and through every clime with pitying females she the night remained where no rude step their privacy profaned though wretched thankful for their soothing aid with hopes her duty would at length be paid soon as the welcome light of morning came though soundest sleep had seized my jaded frame though my tired limbs were still to rest inclined solicitude awaked my anxious mind quick to my indian mourner i repair and still in tears i find the restless fair the varying hours afford her no relief no transient momentary pause of grief with truest pity i her pangs assuage to find her slaughtered lord my word engage restore his corse and with a martial band escort her safely to her native land with blended doubt and sorrow weeping still my promised word she prayed me to fulfill assembling now a menial indian train i led her to explore the bloody plain where heaps of mingled dead deformed the ground near to the fort the breathless chief we found claycold and stiff the gory earth he pressed a fatal ball had passed his manly breast wretched tegualda who before her viewed the pale disfigured form in blood imbrued sprung forward and with instantaneous force frantic she darted on the precious corse and pressed his lips where livid death appears and bathed his wounded bosom in her tears and kissed the wound and the wild hope pursues that her fond breath may yet new life infuse wretch that i am at length she madly cried why does my soul these agonies abide why do i linger in this mortal strife nor pay to love his just demand my life why poor of spirit at a single blow do i not close this bitter scene of woe whence this delay will heaven to me deny the wretchs choice and privilege to die while bent on death in this despair she gaspd her furious hands her snowy neck inclaspd failing her frantic wish they do not spare her mournful visage nor her flowing hair much as i strove to stop her mad intent her fatal purpose i could scarce prevent so loathed she life and with such fierce control the raging thirst of death inflamed her soul when by my prayers and soft persuasions balm her pangs of sorrow grew a little calm and her mild speech confirmed my hope at last that her delirious agony was past my ready indian train with duteous haste on a firm bier the claycold body placed and bore the warrior in whose fate we grieved to where her vassals the dear charge received but lest from ruthless wars outrageous sway the mourning fair might suffer on her way over the near mountains to a safer land i marched to guard her with my warlike band and there secure for the remaining road was clear and open to her own abode she gratefully declined my farther care and thanked and blessed me in a parting prayer as i have been tempted to dwell much longer than i intended on some of the most pathetic incidents of this extraordinary poem i shall give a more concise summary of the remaining cantos  on ercillas return the spaniards continue to strengthen their fort they receive intelligence from an indian ally that the barbarian army intend a fresh assault in the night they are relieved from this alarm by the arrival of a large reinforcement from the spanish cities in chile  on which event colocolo prevails on the indians to suspend the attack caupolican the indian general reviews all his forces and the various chieftains are well described the spanish commander don garcia being now determined to march into the hostile district of amuco addresses soldiers in a spirited harangue requesting them to remember the pious cause for which they fight and to spare the life of every indian who is disposed to submission they remove from their post and pass in boats over the broad river biobio  canto xxii the spaniards are attacked in their new quarters  a surious battle enfues the spaniards are forced to give ground but at last prevail the indian chief rengo signalizes himself in the action defends himself in a marsh and retreats in good order with his forces the spaniards after the conflict seize an unhappy straggling youth named galvarino whom they punish as a rebel in the most barbarous manner by cutting off both his hands the valiant youth defies their cruelty in the midst of this horrid scene and brandishing his bloody stumps departs from his oppressors with the most insulting menaces of revenge  canto xxiii galvarino appears in the assembly of the indian chieftains and excites them in a very animated speech to revenge the barbarity with which he has been treated he faints from loss of blood in the close of his harangue but is recovered by the care of his friends and restored to health the indians exasperated by the sight of his wounds unanimously determine to prosecute the war the spaniards advancing in arauco send forth scouts to discover the disposition of the neighboring tribes ercilla engaging in this service perceives an old indian in a sequestered spot apparently sinking under the infirmities of age but on his approach the ancient figure flies from him with astonishing rapidity he endeavors in vain though on horseback to overtake this aged fugitive who soon escapes from his sight he now discovers the tame deer foretold in his vision and pursuing it is conducted through intricate paths to a retired cottage where a courteous old man receives him in a friendly manner ercilla enquires after the magician fiton the old man undertakes to guide him to the secret mansion of that wonderful necromancer to whom he declares himself related he adds that he himself was once a distinguished warrior but having the misfortune to sully his past glory without losing his life in a conflict with another chieftain he had withdrawn himself from society and lived twenty years as a hermit he now leads ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the magician whose residence and magical apparatus are described with great force of imagination fiton appears from a secret portal and proves to be the aged figure who had escaped so swiftly from the sight of ercilla at the request of his relation the old warrior he condescends to show ercilla the wonders of his art he leads him to a large lucid globe selfsuspended in the middle of an immense apartment he tells him it is the work of forty years study and contains an exact representation of the world with this singular power that it exhibits at his command any scene of futurity which he wishes to behold  that knowing the heroic composition of ercilla he will give him an opportunity to vary and embellish his poem by the description of a most important sea fight which he will display to him most distinctly on that sphere he then invokes all the powers of the infernal world ercilla fixes his eye on the globe and perceives the naval forces of spain with those of the pope and the venetians prepared to engage the great armament of the turks  canto xxiv describes circumstantially the naval battle of lepanto and celebrates the spanish admiral don john of austria ercilla gazes with great delight on this glorious action and beholds the complete triumph of his countrymen when the magician strikes the globe with his wand and turns the scene into darkness ercilla after being entertained with other mavelous sights which he omits from his dread of prolixity takes leave of his two aged friends and regains his quarters the spaniards continue to advance on their pitching their camp in a new spot toward evening an araucanian fantastically dressed in armor enquires for the tent of don garcia and is conducted to his presence  canto xxv the araucanian delivers a defiance to don garcia in the name of caupolican who challenges the spanish general to end the war by a single combat the messenger adds that the whole indian army will descend into the plain on the next morning to be spectators of the duel don garcia dismisses him with an acceptance of the challenge at the dawn of day the indian forces appear in three divisions a party of spanish horse precipitately attack their left wing before which caupolican was advancing they are repulsed a general and obstinate engagement ensues the mangled galvarino appears at the head of one indian squadron and excites his countrymen to revenge his wrongs many spaniards are named who distinguish themselves in the battle among the indian chiefs tucapel and rengo display the most splendid acts of valor and though personal enemies they mutually defend each other caupolican also at the head of the left squadron obliges the spaniards to retreat and the araucanians are on the point of gaining a decisive victory when the fortune of the day begins to turn  canto xxvi the reserved guard of the spaniards in which ercilla was stationed advancing to the charge recover the field and oblige the main body of the indians to fly caupolican though victorious in his quarter sounds a retreat when he perceives this event the indians fly in great disorder rengo for some time sustains an unequal conflict and at last retreats sullenly into a wood where he collects several of the scattered fugitives as ercilla happened to advance toward this spot a spaniard called remon exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this indian party from the wood his honor being thus piqued he rushes forward with a few followers and after an obstinate engagement in which many of the indians are cut to pieces the spaniards obtain the victory and return to their camp with several prisoners after this great defeat of the indian army the spaniards to deter their enemies from all future resistance barbarously resolve to execute twelve chieftains of distinction whom they find among their captives and to leave their bodies exposed on the trees that surrounded the field of battle the generous ercilla lamenting this inhuman sentence intercedes particularly for the life of one alleging that he had seen him united with the spaniards this person proves to be galvarino who on hearing the intercession for his life produces his mangled arms which he had concealed in his bosom and giving vent to his detestation of the spaniards insists on dying with his countrymen ercilla persists in vain in his endeavor to save him as no executioner could be found among the spanish soldiers a new mode of destruction says our poet was invented and every indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him these brave men hastened to accomplish their fate with as much alacrity continues ercilla as the most spirited warrior marches to an attack one alone of the twelve begins to hesitate and pray for mercy declaring himself the lineal descendant of the most ancient race and sovereign of the country he is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous galvarino and repenting his timidity atones for it by instant death  the spaniards advance still farther in the country and raise a fort where valdivia had perished ercilla finds his old friend the magician once more who tells him that heaven thought proper to punish the pride of the araucanians by their late defeat but that the spaniards would soon pay dearly for their present triumph the wizard retires after this prophecy and with much entreaty allows ercilla to follow him coming to a gloomy rock he strikes it with his wand a secret door opens and they enter into a delicious garden which the poet commends for its symmetry expressly declaring that every hedge has its brother the magician leads him into a vault of alabaster and perceiving his wish though he does not express it of seeing the miraculous globe again the courteous fiton conducts him to it  canto xxvii the magician displays to our poet the various countries of the globe particularly pointing out to him the ancient castle of ercilla the seat of his ancestors in biscay and the spot where his sovereign philip the second was soon to build his magnificent palace the escurial having shown him the various nations of the earth on his mavelous sphere fiton conducts his guest to the road leading to the spanish camp where the soldiers of ercilla were seeking their officer the spaniards in vain attempt to sooth and to terrify the araucanians into peace and finding the importance of their present post they determine to strengthen it ercilla proceeds with a party to the city of imperial to provide necessaries for this purpose on his return as he is marching through the country of some pacific indians he discovers at the close of day a distressed female who attempts to fly but is overtaken by ercilla  canto xxviii the fair fugitive whom our poet describes as singularly beautiful relates her story she tells him her name is glaura the daughter of an opulent chieftain with whom she lived most happily till a brother of her fathers who frequently resided with him persecuted her with an unwarrantable passion  that she in vain represented to him the impious nature of his love  he persisted in his frantic attachment and on the appearance of a hostile party of spaniards rushed forth to die in her defense entreating her to receive his departing spirit he fell in the action her father shared the same fate she herself escaped at a postern gate into the woods two negroes laden with spoil discovered and seized her her cries brought a young indian named cariolano to her rescue he shot an arrow into the heart of the first russian and stabbed the second glaura expressed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her husband before they could regain a place of safety they were alarmed by the approach of spaniards the generous youth entreated glaura to conceal herself in a tree while he ventured to meet the enemy in her terror she submitted to this expedient which on recovery from her panic she bitterly repented for when she issued from her retreat she sought in vain for cariolano and supposed from the clamor she had heard that he must have perished she continued to wander in this wretched state of mind still unable to hear any tidings of her protector while the fair indian thus closes her narrative ercilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of barbarians one of his faithful indian attendants whom he had lately attached to him entreats him to escape with the utmost haste adding that he can save him from pursuit by his knowledge of the country and that he will risque his own life most willingly to preserve that of ercilla glaura bursts into an agony of joy in discovering her lost cariolano in this faithful attendant ercilla exclaims adieu my friends i give you both your liberty which is all i have at present to bestow and rejoins his little troop before he enters on the account of what followed he relates the circumstance by which he attached cariolano to his service whom he had found alone as he himself was marching with a small party and a few prisoners that he had taken the youth at first defended himself and shot two spaniards with his arrows and continued to resist the numbers that pressed upon him with his mantle and his dagger evading their blows by his extreme agility and wounding several ercilla generously rushed in to his rescue and declared he deserved a reward for his uncommon bravery instead of being destroyed so unfairly the youth in consequence of this treatment flung down his dagger and became the affectionate attendant of ercilla our poet after relating this incident returns to the scene where his party was surprised in a hollow road and severely galled by the enemy who attacked them with showers of stones from the higher ground ercilla forces his way up the precipice and after dispersing part of the indian force effects his escape with a few followers but all are wounded and obliged to leave their baggage in the possession of their numerous enemies  canto xxix opens with an encomium on the love of our country and the signal proofs of this virtue which the araucanians displayed who notwithstanding their loss of four great battles in the space of three months still continue firm in their resolution of defending their liberty caupolican proposes in a public assembly to set fire to their own habitations and leave themselves no alternative but that of killing or being killed the chieftains all agree in this desperate determination tucapel before they proceed to action against the spaniards insists on terminating his difference with rengo a rival chieftain by a single combat a plain is appointed for this purpose all the people of arauco assemble as spectators the chiefs appear in complete armor and engage in a most obstinate and bloody conflict  canto xxx after many dreadful wounds on each side the two chiestains closing with each other fall together and after a fruitless struggle for victory remain speechless on the ground caupolican who presided as judge of the combat descends from his seat and finding some signs of life in each orders them to be carried to their respective tents they recover and are reconciled the spaniards leaving a garrison in their new fort under a captain named reynoso had proceeded to the city of imperial caupolican endeavors to take advantage of this event he employs an artful indian named pran to examine the state of the fort pran insinuates himself among the indian servants belonging to the spaniards he views the fort and endeavors to persuade a servile indian named andresillo to admit caupolican and his forces while the spaniards are sleeping andresillo promises to meet caupolican in secret and converse with him on this project  canto xxxi opens with a spirited invective against treachery in war and particularly those traitors who betray their country andresillo reveals all that had passed to his spanish captain who promises him a great reward if he will assist in making the stratagem of the indians an instrument of destruction to those who contrived it they concert a plan for this purpose andresillo meets caupolican in secret and promises to introduce the indian forces into the fort when the spaniards are sleeping in the heat of the day pran is sent forward to learn from andresillo if all things are quiet just before the hour appointed for the assault he examines the state of the fort and finding the spaniards apparently unprepared for defense hastens back to the indian general who advances by a quick and silent march the spaniards in the interim point all their guns and prepare for the most bloody resistance  canto xxxii after a panegyric on clemency and a noble censure of those enormous cruelties by which his countrymen sullied their military fame the p  the dreadful earnage which ensued as the indians approached the fort the spaniards after destroying numbers by their artillery snd frth a party of horse who cut the fugitives to pieces they inhumanly murder thirteen of their most distinguished prisoners by blowing them from the mouths of cannon but none of the considerate chieftains whom the poet has particularly celebrated were included in this number for those highspirited barbarians had refused to attend caupolican in this assault as they considered it as disgraceful to attack their enemies by surprise the unfortunate indian leader eeing his forces thus unexpectedly massacred escapes with ten faithful followers and wanders through the country in the most calamitous condition the spaniards endeavor by all the means they can devise to discover his retreat the faithful inhabitants of arauco refuse to betray him  ercilla in sarching the country with a small party finds a young wounded   that marching with her husband she had the misfortune of seeing him perish in the late slaughter  that a friendly soldier in pity to her extreme distress had tried to end her miserable life in the midst of the confusion but had failed in his generous design by giving her an ineffectual wound  that she had been removed from the field of battle to that sequestered spot where she languished in the hourly hope of death which she now implores from the hand of ercilla our poet consoles her dresses her wound and leaves one of his attendants to protect her on his return to the fort he discourses to his soldiers in praise of the fidelity and spirit displayed by the indian females comparing them to the chaste and constant dido a young soldier of his train expresses his surprise on hearing ercilla commend the carthaginian queen for a virtue to which he conceived she had no pretense from hence our poet takes occasion to vindicate the injured eliza from the slanderous misrepresentation of virgil and flatters himself that the love of justice so natural to man will induce every reader to listen with pleasure to his defense of the calumniated queen he then enters on her real history and relates circumstantially her lamentation over the murdered sichaeus and the artifice by which she escaped with her treasures from her inhuman brother pygmalion  she engages many of his attendants to share the chances of her voyage and having collected a supply of females from the island of cyprus she directs her course to the coast of africa  canto xxxiii dido as our poet continues her more authentic story purchases her dominion and raises her flourishing city the ambassadors of iarbas arrive at carthage to offer this celebrated queen the alternative of marriage or war the senate who are first informed of the proposal being fearful that the chaste resolutions of their fair sovereign may ruin their country attempt to engage her by a singular device to accept the hand of iarbas they tell her that this haughty monarch has sent to demand twenty of her privy counselors to regulate his kingdom and that in consideration of their age and infirmities they must decline so unpleasant a service the queen represents to them the danger of their refusal and the duty which they owe to their country declaring that she would most readily sacrifice her own life for the safety or advantage of her subjects the senators then reveal to her the real demand of iarbas and urge the necessity of her marriage for the preservation of the state the faithful dido knows not what to resolve and demands three months to consider of this delicate and important point  at the close of that period she assembles her subjects and taking leave of them in a very affectionate harangue declares her resolution to die as the only means by which she can at once satisfy both heaven and earth by discharging her duty to her people and at the same time preserving her faith inviolate to her departed sichaeus invoking his name she plunges a poniard in her breast and throws herself on a flaming pile which had been kindled for a different sacrifice her grateful subjects lament her death and pay divine honors to her memory this este es el cierto y verdadero cuento de la famosa dido disfamada que virgilio maron sin miramiento falseo su historia y castidad preciada por dar a sus ficciones ornamento pues vemos que esta reyna importunada pudiendose casar y no quemarse antes quemarse quiso que casarse  says our poet is the true and genuine story of the famous defamed dido whose most honored chastity has been belied by the inconsiderate virgil to embellish his poetical fictions  our poet returns from this digression on dido to the fate of the indian leader caupolican  one of the prisoners whom the spaniards had taken in their search after this unfortunate chief is at last tempted by bribes to betray his general he conducts the spaniards to a spot near the sequestered retreat of caupolican and directs them how to discover it but refuses to advance with them overcome by his dread of the hero whom he is tempted to betray the spaniards surround the house in which the chieftain had taken refuge with his ten faithful associates alarmed by a sentinel he prepares for defense but being soon wounded in the arm surrenders endeavoring to conceal his high character and to make the spaniards believe him an ordinary soldier  with their accustomed shouts and greedy toil our furious troops now riot in their spoil through the lone village their quick rapine spread nor leave unpillagd even a single shed when from a tent that placed on safer ground the neighboring hills unculturd summit crowned a woman rushed who in her hasty flight ran through the roughest paths along the rocky height a negro of our train who marked her way soon made the hapless fugitive his prey for thwarting crags her doubtful steps impede and the fair form was ill prepared for speed for at her breast she bore her huddled son to fifteen months the infants life had run from our brave captive sprung the blooming boy of both his parents the chief pride and joy the negro carelessly his victim brought nor knew the important prize his haste had caught our soldiers now to catch the cooling tide had sallied to the murmuring rivers side when the unhappy wife beheld her lord his strong arms bound with a disgraceful cord stripped of each ensign of his past command and led the prisoner of our shouting band her anguish burst not into vain complaint no female terrors her firm soul attaint but breathing fierce disdain and anger wild thus she exclaimed advancing with her child the stronger arm that in this shameful band has tied thy weak effeminated hand had nobler pity to thy state expressed if it had bravely pierced that coward breath were thou the warrior whose heroic worth so swiftly flew around the spacious earth whose name alone unaided by thy arm shook the remotest clime with fears alarm were thou the victor whose triumphant strain promised with rapid sword to vanquish spain to make new realms araucos power revere and spread her empire over the arctic sphere wretch that i am how was my heart deceived in all the noble pride with which it heaved when through the world my boasted title ran tresia the wife of great caupolican now plunged in misery from the heights of fame my glories end in this detested shame to see thee captive in a lonely spot when death and honor might have been thy lot what now avail thy scenes of happier strife so dearly bought by many a nobler life the wondrous feats that valor scarce believed by thee with hazard and with toil achieved where are the vaunted fruits of thy command the laurels gathered by this fettered hand all sunk all turned to this abhorred disgrace to live the slave of this ignoble race say had thy soul no strength thy hand no lance to triumph over the fickle power of chance do thou not know that to the warriors name a gallant exit gives immortal fame behold the burden which my breast contains since of thy love no other pledge remains had thou in glorys arms resigned thy breath we both had followed thee in joyous death take take thy son he was a tie most dear which spotless love once made my heart revere take him  by generous pain and wounded pride the currents of this fruitful breast are dried rear him thyself for thy gigantic frame to woman turned a womans charge may claim a mothers title i no more desire or shameful children from a shameful fire as thus she spoke with growing madness stung the tender nursling from her arms she flung with savage fury hastening from our sight while anguish seemed to aid her rapid flight vain were our efforts our indignant cries nor gentle prayers nor angry threats suffice to make her breast where cruel frenzy burned receive the little innocent the spurned the spaniards after providing a nurse for this unfortunate child return with their prisoner caupolican to their fort which they enter in triumph  the indian general perceiving that all attempts to conceal his quality are ineffectual desires a conference with the spanish captain reynoso  canto xxxiv caupolican entreats reynoso to grant his life but without any signs of terror he affirms it will be the only method of appeasing the sanguinary hatred by which the contending nations are inflamed and he offers from his great influence over his country to introduce the christian worship and to bring the araucanians to consider themselves as the subjects of the spanish monarch his proposals are rejected and he is sentenced to be impaled and shot to death with arrows he is unappalld by this decree but first desires to be publicly baptized after which ceremony he is inhumanly led in chains to a scaffold he displays a calm contempt of death but on seeing a wretched negro appointed his executioner his indignation bursts forth and he hurls the negro from the scaffold entreating to die by a more honorable hand his horrid sentence is however executed he supports the agonies of the stake with patient intrepidity till a chosen band of archers put a period to his life  our brave ercilla expresses his abhorrence of this atrocious scene and adds that if he had been present this cruel execution should not have taken place  the consequence of it was such as caupolican foretold  the araucanians determine to revenge his death and assemble to elect a new general the poet makes an abrupt transition from their debate to relate the adventures of don garcia with whom he was himself marching to explore new regions the inhabitants of the districts they invade alarmed at the approach of the spaniards consult on the occasion an indian named tunconabala who had served under the araucanians addresses the assembly and recommends to them a mode of eluding the supposed avaricious designs of the spaniards by sending messengers to them who should assume an appearance of extreme poverty and represent their country as barren and thus induce the invaders to turn their arms toward a different quarter he offers to engage in this service himself the indians adopt the project he recommends and remove their valuable effects to the interior parts of their country  canto xxxv don garcia being arrived at the boundaries of chile which no spaniard had passed encourages his soldiers in a spirited harangue to the acquisition of the new provinces which lay before them they enter a rude and rocky country in which they are exposed to many hazards by their deceitful guides tunconabala meets them as he had projected with the appearance of extreme poverty and after many assurances of the sterility of that region advises them to return or to advance by a different path which he represents to them as dangerous but the only practicable road on finding them resolved to press forward he supplies them with a guide they advance with great toil and danger their guide escapes from them they continue their march through various hardships in a desolate region they at length discover a fertile plain and a large lake with many little inhabited islands as they approach the lake a large gondola with twelve oars advances to meet them the party it contained leap ashore and salute the spaniards with expressions of amity  canto xxxvi the young chieftain of the gondola supplies the spaniards with provisions refusing to accept any reward and our poet celebrates all the inhabitants of this region for their amiable simplicity of manners he visits one of the principal islands where he is kindly entertained he discovers that the lake had a communication with the sea by a very rough and dangerous channel this circumstance obliges the spaniards though reluctant to return they lament the necessity of passing again through the hardships of their former road a young indian undertakes to conduct them by an easier way but our adventurous ercilla before the little army set forth on their return engages ten chosen associates to embark with him in a small vessel and pass the dangerous channel he lands on a wild and sandy spot and advancing half a mile up the country engraves a stanza to record this adventure on the bark of a tree he repasses the channel and rejoins the spanish troops who after much difficulty reach the city of imperial our poet then touches on some particulars of his personal history which i mention in the slight sketch of his life he afterward promises his reader to relate the issue of the debate among the araucanian chieftains on the election of their new general but recollecting in the instant that spain herself is in arms he entreats the favor of his sovereign to inspire him with new spirit that he may devote himself to that higher and more interesting subject  canto xxxvii our poet in this his last canto seems to begin a new work he enters into a discussion of philips right to the dominion of portugal and his acquisition of that kingdom when sinking under the weight of this new subject he declares his resolution of leaving it to some happier poet he recapitulates the various perils and hardships of his own life and remarking that he has ever been unfortunate and that all his labors are unrewarded he consoles himself with the reflection that honor consists not in the possession of rewards but in the consciousness of having deserved them he concludes with a pious resolution to withdraw himself from the vain pursuits of the world and to devote himself to god  note xi verse   0 at once the bard of glory and of love the epic powers of camoens have received their due honor in our language by the elegant and spirited translation of mr mickle but our country is still a stranger to the lighter graces and pathetic sweetness of his shorter compositions these as they are illustrated by the spanish notes of his indefatigable commentator manuel de faria amount to two volumes in folio i shall present the reader with a specimen of his sonnets for which he is celebrated as the rival of petrarch of the three translations which follow i am indebted for the two first to an ingenious friend from whom the public may wish me to have received more extensive obligations of a similar nature it may be proper to add that the first sonnet of camoens like that of petrarch is a kind of preface to the amorous poetry of its author  soneto i em quanto quis fortuna que tivesse esperanca de algum contentamento o gosto de hum suave pensamento me fez que seus effeytos escrevesse porem temendo amor que aviso desse minha escritura a algum juizo isento escureccome o engenho co o tormento para que seus enganos nao dissesse o vos que amor obriga a ser sogeytos a diversas vontades quando lerdes number breve livro casos

puro viste ese vires que pode merecerte algua cousa a dor queme sicou da magoa sem remedio de perderte roga a deos que teus annos encurtou que tao cedo de ca me leve a verte quao cedo de meur olhos te

heard me praise the golden shower resolved my fond presumption to control and painful darkness over my spirit stole lest i should dare to tell his treacherous power o ye whom his hard yoke compels to bend to others will if in my various lay sad plaints ye find and fears and cruel wrong to suffering nature and to truth attend for in the measure ye have felt his sway your sympathizing hearts will

from thy immortal seat of heavenly rest behold us lingering in a world of woe and if beyond the grave to saints above fond memory still the transient past pourtrays blame not the ardor of my constant love which in these longing eyes was wont to blaze but if from virtues source my sorrows rise for the sad loss i never can repair be thine to justify my endless sighs and to the throne of grace prefer thy prayer that heaven who made thy span of life so brief may shorten mine and give my soul relief soneto lxxii quando de minhas magoas a comprida maginacao os olhos me adormece em sonhos aquella alma

sombra benina ella os olhos em mi chum brado pejo como quem diz que ja nao pode ser torna a fugirme torno a bradar dina e antes q acabe em mean acordo and vejo que nem hum breve engano posso ter sonnet lxxii while pressed with woes from which it cannot flee my fancy sinks and number seals my eyes her spirit hastens in my dreams to rise who was in life but as a dream to me over a drear waste so wide no eye can see how far its senseevading limit lies i follow her quick step but ah she flies our distance widening by stern fates decree fly not from me kind shadow i exclaim she with fixed eyes that her soft thoughts reveal and seem to say forbear thy fond design still flies  i call her but her halfformd name dies on my faltring tongue  i wake and feel not even one short delusion may be mine the spanish commentator of camoens considers this vision as the most exquisite sonnet of his author and affirms that it is superior to the much longer poem of petrarchs on a similar idea it may amuse a curious reader to compare both camoens and petrarch on this occasion with milton who has also written a sonnet on the same subject the commentator faria has a very pleasant remark on this species of composition he vindicates the dignity of the amorous sonnet by producing an alphabetical list of two hundred great poets who have thus complimented the object of their affection and he very gravely introduces achilles as the leader of this choir for having celebrated briseis if the sonnets of the portugueze poet are worthy of attention his elegies are perhaps still more so as they illustrate many particulars of his interesting life which ended in      under the most cruel circumstances of neglect and poverty  portugal has produced no less than fourteen epic poems twelve in her own language and two in that of spain at the head of these stands the lusiad of camoens the malaca conquistada of francisco de sa de menesis  and the ulyssea or lisboa edificada of gabriel pereira de castro are two of the most eminent among its successors  for a list of the portugueze epic poets and for an elegant copy of the malaca conquistada i am indebted to the very liberal politeness of the chevalier de pinto the ambassador of portugal  note xii verse     where eulogy with one eternal smile though a vain insipidity may be considered as the general characteristic of the french eloges it is but just to remark that several of these performances are an honor to the country which produced them and particularly the little volume of eloges lately published by mr dalembert this agreeable encomiast has varied and enlivened the tone of panegyric by the most happy mixture of amusing anecdote judicious criticism and philosophical precept we may justly say of him what he himself has said of his predecessor fontenelle il a solidement assure sa gloire par ces eloges si interessans pleins dune raison si fine et si profonde qui font aimer et respecter les lettres qui inspirent aux genies

devenant leur panegyriste  dalembert eloge de la motte p     note xiii verse  0  no great examples rise but many a rule before the appearance of bossus celebrated treatise on epic poetry the french had a similar work written in latin the learned jesuit mambrun published in      a quarto volume entitled dissertatio peripatetica de epico carmine his dissertation is founded on the principles of aristotle whom he considers as infallible authority and he introduces the greek philosopher to decide the following very curious question which he argues with becoming gravity whether the action of a woman can be sufficiently splendid to prove a proper subject for an epic poem  having reasoned on this delicate point with more learning than gallantry he thus concludes the debate congruenter magis finem huic quaestioni ponere non licet quam verbis aristotelis capite    poeticae ubi de moribus disputat   id est secunda proprietas morum est ut sint congruentes ut esse fortem mos est aliquis at non congruit mulieri fortem esse aut terribilem ut vertit riccobonus vel prudentem ut pacius the latter interpretation of the word  would render the decision of these philosophers very severe indeed on the female character by supposing it incapable of displaying both fortitude and prudence  the fair sex have found an advocate on this occasion in a french epic poet the famous chapelain in the preface to his unfortunate pucelle has very warmly attacked these ungallant maxims of mambrun and aristotle in speaking of certain critics who had censured the choice of his subject before the publication of his poem he says ceuxcy jurant sur le text daristote maintiennent que la femme est une erreur de la nature qui ayant toujours intention de fair un homme sarreste souvent en chemin et se voit contrainte par la resistance de la matiere de laisser son dessein imparfait ils tiennet la force corporelle tellement necessaire dans la composition dun heroes que quand il ny auroit autre defaut a reprocher a la femme ils luy en refuseroient le nom pour cela seulement quelle na pas la vigueur dun athlete et que la mollesse de sa complexion lempesche de pouvoir durer au travail ils nestiment ce sex capable daucune pensee heroique dans la creance que lesprit suit le temperament du corpse et que dans le corpse de la femme lesprit ne peut rien concevoir qui ne se sent de sa foiblesse  ces messieurs me pardonneront toutefois si je leur dis quils ne considerent pas trop bien quelle est la nature de la virtue heroique quils en definissent lessence par un de ses moindres accidens et quils en font plutost une virtue brutale quune virtue divine  ils se devroient souvenir que cette virtue na presque rien a fair avec le corpse et quelle consiste non dans les efforts dun milon de crotone ou lesprit na aucune part mais en ceux des ames nees pour les grandes chooses quand par une ardeur plusqu human else selevent audessus dellesmesmes quelles forment quelque dessein dont lutilite est aussi grande que la difficulte et quelles choisissent les moyens de lexecuter avec constance et hauteur de courage pour prevenus quils soient en faveurs des hommes je ne pense pas quils voulussent attribuer a leur ame un seul avantage auquel lame de la femme ne pust aspirer ni fair deux especes des deux sexes desquels la raison de tous les sages na fait quune jusquicy  je ne croy pas non plus quils imaginent que les vertus morales ayent leur siege ailleurs que dans la volonte ou dans lentendement mais si else y ont leur siege et si lon ne peut dire que ces deux facultes soient autres dans lame de la femme que dans lame de lhomme ils ne peuvent sans absurdite accorder une de ces vertus a l homme et ne l accorder pas a la femme en effet cette belle pensee daristote qui a done occasion a leur erreur est si peu physique quelle fait plus de tort a la philosophy du lycee quelle nappuye lopinion de ceux que nous combattons chapelain then enters into an historical defense of female dignity and opposes the authority of plato to that of aristotle concerning the propriety of womans ever appearing on the great theater of active life happy had he supported the female cause as forcibly in the execution of his poem as in the arguments of his preface but chapelain was unfortunately one of the many examples which every country affords that the most perfect union of virtue and erudition is utterly insufficient to form a poet and as he had the ill fate to be persecuted by the pitiless rigor of boileau his inharmonious poem can never sink into a desirable oblivion the treatise of mambrun seems to have excited among the french an eagerness to distinguish themselves in the field of epic poetry for several epic poems were published in france in a few years after that work appeared but most of them and particularly those on scriptural subjects were hardly ever known to exist  le jonas inconnu seche dans la poussiere le david imprime na point vu la lumiere le moise commence a moisir par les bords boileau sat ix the alaric of scudery and the clovis of desmarests can scarce be reckoned more fortunate but in this band of unsuccessful epic writers there was one poet of whom even the severe boileau could not allow himself to speak ill this was le moine the author of st louis the satirist being asked why he had never mentioned the poetry of le moine replied with the two following verses parodied from corneille il sest trop eleve pour en dire du mal il sest trop egare pour en dire du bien   the judicious and candid heyne has bestowed considerable applause on le moine in one of his notes to the  th book of virgil where he examines the different methods by which the epic poets have introduced their various pictures of futurity from his account le moine excels in this article i can speak only from the opinion of this learned critic for the neglected french poet is become so rare that i have sought in vain for a copy of his work  the number of obscure epic writers in france is very trifling compared to those which italy has produced the italians have been indefatigable in this species of composition and as if they had resolved to leave no hero unsung their celebrated novelist giraldi cinthio has written an epic poem in twentysix cantos on the exploits of hercules  note xiv verse  0  keen boileau shall not want his proper praise nicolas boileau despreaux was born in or near paris for it is a contested point on the first of november      and died in march      of a dropsy the very disease which terminated the life of his english rival the lutrin of boileau still considered by some french critics of the present time as the best poem to which france has given birth was first published in      it is with great reason and justice that voltaire confesses the lutrin inferior to the rape of the lock few poets can be so properly compared as pope and boileau and wherever their writings will admit of comparison we may without any national partiality adjudge the superiority to the english bard these two great authors resembled each other as much in the integrity of their lives as in the subjects and execution of their several compositions there are two actions recorded of boileau which sufficiently prove that the inexorable satirist had a most generous and friendly heart when patru the celebrated advocate who was ruined by his passion for literature found himself under the painful necessity of selling his expensive library and had almost agreed to part with it for a moderate sum boileau gave him a much superior price and after paying the money added this condition to the purchase that patru should retain during his life the possession of the books the succeeding instance of the poets generosity is yet nobler  when it was rumoured at court that the king intended to retrench the pension of corneille boileau hastened to madame de montespan and said that his sovereign equitable as he was could not without injustice grant a pension to an author like himself just ascending parnassus and take it from corneille who had so long been seated on the summit that he entreated her for the honor of the king to prevail on his majesty rather to strike off his pension than to withdraw that reward from a man whose title to it was incomparably greater and that he should more easily console himself under the loss of that distinction than under the affliction of seeing it taken away from such a poet as corneille this magnanimous application had the success which it deserved and it appears the more noble when we recollect that the rival of corneille was the intimate friend of boileau  the long and unreserved intercourse which subsisted between our poet and racine was highly beneficial and honorable to both the dying farewell of the latter is the most expressive eulogy on the private character of boileau je regard comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avaunt vous said the tender racine in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend  note xv verse     nor gentle gresset shall thy sprightly rhyme this elegant and amiable writer was born at amiens and educated in the society of the jesuits to whom he has paid a grateful compliment in bidding them adieu at the age of twentysix he published his ververt a poem in four cantos which commemorates  la cause infortunee dun perroquet non moins brillant qu enee non moins devot plus malheureux que lui voltaire has spoken invidiously of this delightful performance but a spirited french critic has very justly vindicated the merits of gresset in the following remark

england holland and italy in a series of entertaining letters addressed to madame du perron her sister  note xvii verse     to swell the glory of her great voltaire though the henriade has been frequently reprinted and the partisans of voltaire have endeavored to make it a national point of honor to support its reputation it seems at length to be sinking under that neglect and oblivion which never fail to overtake every feeble offspring of the epic muse several of our most eminent critics have attacked this performance with peculiar severity and some have condemned it on the most opposite principles merely because it does not coincide with their respective systems their sentence has been passed only in short and incidental remarks but a french writer inflamed by personal animosity against voltaire has raised three octavo volumes on the defects of this single poem mr clement in his entretiens sur le poem epique relativement a la henriade has endeavored to prove it utterly deficient in all the essential points of epic poetry  in the structure of its general plan in the conduct of its various parts in sentiment in character in style his work indeed displays an acrimonious detestation of the poet whom he examines and perhaps there is hardly any human composition which could support the scrutiny of so rigid an inquisitor the henriade is utterly unequal to it for in many articles we are obliged to confess that the justice of the critic is not inferior to his severity he discovers in his dissection of the poem the skill of an anatomist with the malignity of an assassin if any thing can deserve such rigorous treatment it is certainly the artifice of voltaire who in his essay on epic poetry has attempted with much ingenuity to sink the reputation of all the great epic writers that he might raise himself to their level an attempt in which no author can ultimately succeed for as dalembert has admirably remarked on a different occasion le public laissera lamour propre de chaque ecrivain fair son plaidoyer rira de leurs efforts non de genie mais de raisonnement pour hausser leur place et finira par mettre chacun a la sienne  note xviii verse     and shrouded in a mist of moral spleen it seems to be the peculiar infelicity of pope that his moral virtues have had a tendency to diminish his poetical reputation possessing a benevolent spirit and wishing to make the art to which he devoted his life as serviceable as he could to the great interests of mankind he soon quitted the higher regions of poetry for the more level and more frequented field of ethics and of satire he declares with a noble pride arising from the probity of his intention that not in fancys maze he wandered long but stooped to truth and moralizd his song the severity of criticism has from hence inferred that his imagination was inferior to the other faculties of his mind and that he possessed not that vigor of genius which might enable him to rank with our more sublime and pathetic bards this inference appears to me extremely defective both in candor and in reason it would surely be more generous and i will venture to add more just to assign very different causes for his having latterly applied himself to moral and satyric composition if his preceding poems displayed only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderness we might indeed very fairly conjecture that he quitted the kind of poetry where these qualities are particularly required because nature directed him to shine only as the poet of reason  but his earlier productions will authorize an opposite conclusion at an age when few authors have produced any capital work pope gave the world two poems one the offspring of imagination and the other of sensibility which will ever stand at the head of the two poetical classes to which they belong his rape of the lock and his eloise have nothing to fear from any rivals either of past or of future time when a writer has displayed such early proofs of exquisite fancy and of tender enthusiasm those great constituents of the real poet ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater scope and freer exercise to these qualities rather than to assert that he did not possess them in a superlative degree why then it may be asked did he confine himself to compositions in which these have little share the life and character of pope will perfectly explain the reasons why he did not always follow the higher suggestions of his own natural genius he had entertained an opinion that by stooping to truth and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the passing time he should be most able to benefit mankind the idea was perhaps illfounded but his conduct in consequence of it was certainly noble its effects however were most unhappy for it took from him all his enjoyment of life and may injure in some degree his immortal reputation by suffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools he fell into the splenetic delusion that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly and from hence he has been reproached for supposing that all human merit was confined to himself and to a few of his most intimate correspondents  there was an amiable peculiarity in the character of pope which had great influence both on his conduct and composition  he embraced the sentiments of those he loved with a kind of superstitious regard his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affectionate heart it was this which led him at the request of his idol bolingbroke to write a sublime poem on metaphysical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend it was this which urged him almost to quarrel with mr allen in compliance with the caprices of a female friend it was this which induced him in the warmth of gratitude to follow the absurd hints of warburton with all the blindness of infatuated affection whoever examines the life and writings of pope with a minute and unprejudiced attention will find that his excellencies both as a poet and a man were peculiarly his own and that his failings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment or the artifice of his real and pretended friends the lavish applause and the advice of his favorite atterbury was perhaps the cause of his preserving the famous character of addison which finely written as it is all the lovers of pope must wish him to have suppressed few of his friends had integrity or frankness sufficient to persuade him that his satires would destroy the tranquillity of his life and cloud the luster of his fame yet to the honor of lyttelton be it remembered that he suggested such ideas to the poet in the verses which he wrote to him from rome with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friendship no more let meaner satire dim the rays that flow majestic from thy nobler bays in all the flowery paths of pindus stray but shun that thorny that unpleasing way nor when each soft engaging muse is thine address the least attractive of the nine   this generous admonition did not indeed produce its intended effect for other counselors had given a different bias to the mind of the poet and the malignity of his enemies had exasperated his temper yet he afterward turned his thoughts toward the composition of a national epic poem and possibly in consequence of the hint which this epistle of lyttelton contains the intention was formed too late for it arose in his decline of life had he possessed health and leisure to execute such a work i am persuaded it would have proved a glorious acquisition to the literature of our country the subject indeed which he had chosen must be allowed to have an unpromising appearance but the opinion of addison concerning his sylphs which was surely honest and not invidious may teach us hardly ever to decide against the intended works of a superior genius yet in all the arts we are perpetually tempted to pronounce such decisions i have frequently condemned subjects which my friend romney had selected for the pencil but in the sequel my opinion only proved that i was nearsighted in those regions of imagination where his keener eyes commanded all the

shall produce them a much higher poetical authority in the age of petrarch an italian lady named giustina perrot was desirous of distinguishing herself by this pleasing accomplishment but the remarks of the world which represented it as improper for her sex discouraged her so far that she was almost tempted to relinquish her favorite pursuit in her doubts on this point she consulted the celebrated poet of her country in an elegant sonnet and received his answer on the interesting subject in the same poetical form i shall add the two sonnets with an imitation of each  io vorrei pur drizzar

three subsequent periods to be regulated by the sale of the poem  for the ceiling at whitehall rubens received three thousand pounds  note iii verse     receive the laurel from imperial charles ariosto is said to have been publicly crowned with laurel at mantua by the emperor charles the vth toward the end of the year      this fact has been disputed by various writers but it seems to be sufficiently established by the researches of mazzuchelli  the custom of crowning poets with laurel is almost as ancient as poetry itself says the abbe du resnel in his recherches sur les poets couronnez a work which contains but scanty information on this curious topic petrarch is generally supposed to have revived this ancient solemnity which had been abolished as a pagan institution in the reign of the emperor theodosius it appears however from two passages in the writings of boccacio that dante had entertained serious thoughts of this honorable distinction which his exile precluded him from receiving as he chose says his biographer to be crowned only in his native city  an amusing volume might be written on the honors which have been paid to poets in different ages and in various parts of the world it is remarkable that the most unpolished nations have been the most lavish in rewarding their bards there are two instances on record in which poetical talents have raised their possessors even to sovereign dominion the scythians chose the poet thamyris for their king though he was not a native of their country  hist poet script edit gale p   0 saxo grammaticus begins the sixth book of his history by relating that the danes bestowed their vacant diadem on the poet hiarnus as a reward for his having composed the best epitaph on their deceased sovereign frotho from the four latin verses which the historian has given us as a translation of this extraordinary epitaph we may venture to affirm that the poetical monarch obtained his crown on very easy conditions  note iv verse     for him her fountains gush with golden streams of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary poet his friend and biographer montalvan has given a particular account this author concludes that lope de vega gained by his dramatic works alone a sum nearly equal to  0000 pounds sterling the revenue arising from the posts he held and from his pension was very considerable his opulence was much increased by the most splendid instances of private liberality he received many costly presents from various characters to whom he was personally unknown and he was himself heard to say in speaking of his generous patron that the duke of sessa alone had given him at different periods of his life sums almost amounting to six thousand pounds  it must be confessed that the noble patrons of english poetry have not equalled this example of spanish munificence even if we admit the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the generosity of lord southampton to shakespeare and of sir philip sidney to spenser considering the liberality for which our nation is so justly celebrated it is remarkable that not a single english poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs yet spenser had every claim to the bounty of elizabeth he sung her praises in a strain which might gratify her pride and of all who have flattered the great he may justly be considered as the most worthy of reward his song was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy and the sex of his idol may be said to purify his incense from all the offensive particles of servile adulation the neglect which he experienced from the vain imperious and ungrateful elizabeth appears the more striking when we recollect that her lovely rival the beautiful and unfortunate queen of scots signalized her superior generosity by a magnificent present of plate to the french poet ronsard this neglected bard was once the darling of france and perhaps equalled lope de vega in the honors which he received his sovereign charles the ninth composed some elegant verses in his praise and the city of toulouse presented him with a minerva of massive silver  if our princes and nobles have not equalled those of other kingdoms in liberality to the great poets of their country england may yet boast the name of a private gentleman who discovered in this respect a most princely spirit no nation either ancient or modern can produce an example of munificence more truly noble than the annual gratuity which akenside received from mr dyson a tribute of generous and affectionate admiration endeared to its worthy possessor by every consideration which could make it honorable both to himself and to his patron  it has been lately lamented by an elegant and accomplished writer who had too much reason for the complaint that the profession of literature by far the most laborious of any leads to no real benefit experience undoubtedly proves that it has a general tendency to impoverish its votaries and the legislators of every country would act perhaps a wise at all events an honorable part if they corrected this tendency by establishing public emoluments for such as eminently distinguish themselves in the various branches of science it is surely possible to form such an establishment which without proving a national burden might aggrandize the literary glory of the nation by preserving her men of letters from the evils so frequently connected with their pursuits by securing to those who deserve it the possession of ease and honor without damping their emulation or destroying their independence  notes to the fifth epistle note i verse    the loose petronius gave the maxim birth aristotle has said but little in his poetics concerning that weighty point which has so much employed and embarrassed the modern critics  the machinery of the epic poem and the little which he has said might rather furnish an argument for its exclusion than justify its use but rome in her most degenerate days produced a writer to whose authority contemptible as it is most frequent appeals have been made in this curious literary question in almost every modern author who has touched however slightly on epic poetry we may find at least some part of the following sentence from petronius arbiter  ecce belli civilis ingens opus quisquis attigerit nisi plenus litteris sub onere labetur non enim res gestae versibus comprehendendae sunt quod long melius historici faciunt sed per ambages deorumque ministeria and fabulosum sententiarum tormentum praecipitandus est liber spiritus ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides  these remarks on the necessity of celestial agents were evidently made to depreciate the pharsalia of lucan and petronius may be called a fair critic as pope said of milbourne on his opposition to dryden because he produces his own poetry in contrast to that which he condemns his specimen of the manner in which he thought an epic poem should be conducted sufficiently proves the absurdity of his criticism for how insipid is the fable in those verses which he has opposed to the pharsalia when compared to the first book of lucan yet the epic composition of petronius has not wanted admirers a dutch commentator is bold enough to say that he prefers this single rhapsody to three hundred volumes of such poetry as lucans an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with boileau un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui ladmire  if men of letters in the age of lucan differed in their sentiments concerning machinery the great changes that have since happened in the world and the disquisitions which have appeared on the subject are very far from having reconciled the judgment of modern writers on this important article two eminent critics of the present time have delivered opinions on this topic so singularly opposite to each other that i shall transcribe them both  in a theatrical entertainment which employs both the eye and the ear it would be a gross absurdity to introduce upon the stage superior beings in a visible shape there is not place for such objection in an epic poem and boileau with many other critics declares strongly for that fort of machinery in an epic poem but waving authority which is apt to impose upon the judgment let us draw what light we can from reason i begin with a preliminary remark that this matter is but indistinctly handled by critics the poetical privilege of animating insensible objects for enlivening a description is very different from what is termed machinery where deities angels devils or other supernatural powers are introduced as real personages mixing in the action and contributing to the catastrophe and yet these two things are constantly jumbled together in the reasoning the former is founded on a natural principle but can the latter claim the same authority so far from it that nothing is more unnatural its effects at the same time are deplorable first it gives an air of fiction to the whole and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections and to move our passions which of itself is sufficient to explode machinery whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination and next were it possible by disguising the fiction to delude us into a notion of reality which i think can hardly be an insuperable objection would still remain which is that the aim or end of an epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is introduced for an evident reason that virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endued with passions and affections like our own that is by human actions and as for moral instruction it is clear that none can be drawn from beings who act not upon the same principles with us homer it is true introduces the gods into his fable but the religion of his country authorized that liberty it being an article in the grecian creed that the gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs i must however observe that homers deities do no honor to his poems fictions that transgress the bounds of nature seldom have a good effect they may inflame the imagination for a moment but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste they may be of some use to the lower rank of writers but an author of genius has much finer materials of natures production for elevating his subject and making it interesting  voltaire in his essay upon epic poetry talking of the pharsalia observes judiciously that the proximity of time the notoriety of events the character of the age enlightened and political joined with the solidity of lucans subject deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction is it not amazing that a critic who reasons so justly with respect to others can be so blind with respect to himself voltaire not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior beings introduces them into the action in the sixth canto of the henriade st louis appears in person and terrifies the soldiers in the seventh canto st louis sends the god of sleep to henry and in the tenth the demons of discord fanaticism war etc assist aumale in a single combat with turenne and are driven away by a good angel brandishing the sword of god to blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals makes a bad figure at any rate and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of henry iv this singly is sufficient to make the henriade a shortlived poem were it otherwise possessed of every beauty elements of criticism vol ii p      th edition the pagan gods and gothic fairies were equally out of credit when milton wrote he did well therefore to supply their room with angels and devils if these too should wear out of the popular creed and they seem in a hopeful way from the liberty some late critics have taken with them i know not what other expedients the epic poet might have recourse to but this i know  the pomp of verse the energy of description and even the finest moral paintings would stand him in no stead without admiration which cannot be effected but by the mavelous of celestial intervention i mean the agency of superior natures really existing or by the illusion of the fancy taken to be so no epic poem can be longlived i am not afraid to instance in the henriade itself which notwithstanding the elegance of the composition will in a short time be no more read than the gondibert of sir w davenant and for the same reason letters on chivalry and romance letter x i have thus ventured to confront these eminent critical antagonists that while they engage and overthrow each other we may observe the injustice produced by the spirit of systematical criticism even in authors most respectable for their talents and erudition  here is the unfortunate voltaire placed between two critical fires which equally destroy him the first critic asserts that the henriade must be shortlived because the poet has introduced invisible and superior agents  the second denounces the same fate against it because it wants the agency of superior natures yet surely every reader of poetry who is not influenced by any particular system will readily allow that if voltaire had treated his subject with true epic spirit in all other points neither the introduction nor the absence of st louis could be singly sufficient to plunge the henriade in oblivion indeed the learned author who has spoken in so peremptory a manner concerning the necessity of supernatural agents to preserve the existence of an epic poem appears rather unfortunate in the two examples by which he endeavors to support his doctrine for the epic poems both of davenant and voltaire have sufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot without considering the article of machinery  if i have warmly opposed any decisions of this exalted critic it is from a persuasion in which i may perhaps be mistaken that some of his maxims have a strong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both an art on which his genius and learning have cast many rays of pleasing and of useful light  note ii verse     but howling dogs the fancied orpheus tore this anecdote of neanthus the son of king pittacus is related by lucian the curious reader may find it in the second volume of dr francklins spirited translation of that lively author page     of the quarto edition  note iii verse     and spotless laurels in that field be won the indian mythology as it has lately been illustrated in the writings of mr holwell is finely calculated to answer the purpose of any poetical genius who may wish to introduce new machinery into the serious epic poem besides the powerful charm of novelty it would have the advantage of not clashing with our national religion for the endeavors of mr holwell to reconcile the ancient and pure doctrine of bramah with the dispensation of christ have so far succeeded that if his system does not satisfy a theologist it certainly affords a sufficient basis for the structure of a poet in perusing his account of the indian scripture every reader of imagination may i think perceive that the shastah might supply a poetical spirit with as rich a mass of ideal treasure as fancy could with to work upon  an epic poet desirous of laying the scene of his action in india would be more embarrassed to find interesting heroes than proper divinities  had justice and generosity inspired and guided that english valor which has signalized itself on the plains of indostan had the arms of our country been employed to deliver the native indians from the oppressive usurpation of the mohammedan powers such exploits would present to the epic muse a subject truly noble and the mythology of the east might enrich it with the most splendid decorations whether it be possible or not to find such a subject in the records of our indian history i leave the reader to determine  our great historian of the roman empire has intimated in a note to the first volume of his immortal work that the wonderful expedition of odin which deduces the enmity of the goths and romans from so memorable a cause might supply the noble groundwork of an epic poem the idea is certainly both just and splendid had gray been ever tempted to engage in such a work he would probably have convinced us that the northern mythology has still sufficient power to seize and enchant the imagination as much in epic as in lyric composition  it may amuse our speculative critics to consider how far the religious gothic fables should be introduced or rejected to render such a performance most interesting to a modern reader few judges would agree in their sentiments on the question and perhaps the great dispute concerning machinery cannot be fairly adjusted till some happy genius shall possess ambition and perseverance enough to execute two epic poems in the one adopting and in the other rejecting supernatural agents for reason alone is by no means an infallible conductor in the province of fancy and in the poetical as well as the philosophical world experiment is the surest guide to truth  finis errata epistle ii ver   for where read whence      for critic read critics epistle iv ver     for keep
