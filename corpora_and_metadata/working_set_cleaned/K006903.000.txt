the ladys physician  a practical treatise on the various disorders incident to the fair sex  with proper directions for the cure thereof  the whole laid down in so plain a manner as to enable every reader not only to be a competent judge for herself but also to direct others with propriety and success  written originally in french by m tissot m d  first physician to the queen of france and fellow of the royal society of london member of the medicophysical society of basil and of the oeconomical society of berne and author of advice to the people concerning their health  translated by an eminent physician  london printed for j pridden at the feathers in fleet street mdcclxvi one shilling  the ladys physician introduction the author of this work besides the emolument that every practitioner has a right to expect from his profession had another motive to encourage him to the completion thereof to wit a humane and christian concern with which he had been long actuated for the welfare of the fair whose delicate frames are too often a prey to diseases which through the decrees of providence peculiar to their sex yet through a mistaken modesty they are loath to declare and apply for succor from those duly qualified to relieve them  they are here provided with the most rational yet easy instructions as well as with the most select and approved of recipes either to prevent in time or cure themselves of when through carelessness or any other cause they are surprised with any of those distempers particular to their own sex but unknown to the other  most males young or old make little or rather no scruple of unfolding any complaint they may labor under to a physician surgeon or apothecary while young females except abandoned prostitutes and many even of those more advanced in years through innate modesty an almost invincible bashfulness and a being reserved in the extreme to the great detriment of their health by the ridiculous concealment of a beginning distemper suffer a kind of petty martyrdom to misunderstood notions of virtue which are consequently the cause of their health and constitution being ruined and of their manifestly pining away though all around them can assign no reason and no disorder of the fair sex is made such a destructive mystery of as that which shall take the lead here to wit  the menstrual flux until the age of puberty that is of being capable to propagate the species which varies in different nations being earlier in the southern climes and later in the northern young males and females are indiscriminately liable to the same distempers nor before that critical period of life is there any sexual difference the cause of this difference the first of that class which on account of its being the forerunner and fruitful source whence all others are derived that in an especial manner afflict the more amiable part of society must afford us ample matter of admiration as will obviously appear to all who in a philosophical or christian light shall consider this essential evacuation  the womb of a female being designed by nature for the first receptacle and nursery of the yet unborn being is after a certain revolutionary period of life irrigated with an extraordinary quantity of blood at stated times by which means the vessels are used to open and distend themselves for the more easy admission of the monthly tide which when by a kindly discharge is decreased of its superabounding quantity the stretched vessels recover their due spring and return the rest to the general course of circulation  natures intent by this process is that after impregnation such increasing quantities of the blood derived to the womb are to supply nutriment to the foetus who when brought forth is supported by milk from the breasts of which the redundant blood then diverted from the womb to those parts becomes the nourishing fountain  while things are thus carried on in their due course all goes right but as from every deviation some new malady arises and indeed directly or indirectly all those with which the sex is peculiarly affected and that we may progressively follow them we have fixed our choice to begin with the menstrual discharge that is perverted either by its obstruction or an extraordinary efflux in a more or less violent degree  sect i an obstruction suppression or stoppage of the menstrual discharge is caused in young females either by too great a consistence viscidity or siziness of the blood which cannot force its way into the smaller vessels to be through them emptied to a certain degree or else is owing to too great a compactness in the fibers of the womb whose secretory orifices or little mouths are too closely compressed to yield admission to any ingress of the blood and consequently preventative of salutary evacuations in either case the bloods escape being debarred its return into the general circulation on account of its augmented quantity makes offensive lodgments on many parts through their weakness rendered more liable to yield and prove dangerous in proportion to the parts affected being more or less essential to life  this distemper is ever attended with an unwillingness to action an heaviness of mind a paleness of complexion pains are felt both in the groin and loins with a difficulty of breathing cold sweats hysteric and fainting fits etc there ensues a total depravation of all the functions of the body nay such has often been the dreadful effect of the discharge not being able to make its way through the proper outlets as to force for itself an unnatural violent and perilous egress through the anus or fundament the bladder breasts eyes ears etc  the bowels are wont to suffer prodigiously in such patients and in general more outrageously as their constitution is more delicate  hence what a train of maladies arise particularly every species of a depraved appetite as is made manifest by unnatural and often offensive longings too well known to need being mentioned here  besides the above assigned inherent causes of this disease whether in the too compact structure of the womb or the too great siziness obstructive to its escaping by the emissary pores the following which we may call external or adventitious ones are not to be neglected but rather seriously attended to such are the improper use of astringent remedies of acids and whatever may cause a spissitude in the humors too incrassating a diet that is nourishment which thickens the blood too much a suppression of the menstrual discharge is sometimes caused by too great an evacuation of the blood from a wound or otherwise it being thence rendered too weak to force its way by the womb it is also caused by any sudden terror obstinate grieving a violent cold etc  the cure in general where too great an evacuation of blood or weakness of the patients constitution is not supposed to be the leading cause it is proper the patient should undergo a gentle bleeding in order to make way for the remedies operating more effectually and during the course of taking them to receive frequently the steam of camomile flowers that had been boiled in water by the means of a conveying tube or funnel through a certain part to play upon the insertion of the womb in order to soften its texture in ease the suppression should be owing to the toughness of its structure  but should there appear to be a stagnating vice that is an unwillingness to flow in the blood a spur must be given to its laziness by fomentations such as the above accompanied with frequent exercise diluting drinks such as tea whey or a pleasant and wholesome liquor that may be made by infusing the rinds of oranges citrons and lemons in spring water till it shall have acquired an agreeable taste from them  then take the following pills for some time to wit venetian soap  borax  aloes  one dram each to be made into pills each pill to confist of three grains four pills to be taken every day one a little after the patient rises in the morning and some time before her breakfast another about an hour or at least half an hour before dinner a third at about the same distance before teatime in the evening the fourth is to be taken on going to bed  let the patient seek all occasions of exercise of merriment and whatever may excite a flow of spirits some time after the bleeding in the arm if matters succeed not as may be wished then let a gentle bleeding in the foot take place and this practice carefully followed for some time cannot fail of effectuating a cure where consummate weakness an exhausted constitution or other insuperable difficulties do not intervene  sect ii the immoderate flux of the menstrual discharge as a due discharge of blood by the uterus every month is an insurer of health so an extraordinary efflux is the harbinger of sickness and highly detrimental to the constitution because it occasions a loss of strength which is attended by other symptoms to wit crudities from indigestion a loss of appetite a sense of oppression in the stomach a sickly complexion oftentimes a small increase of heat a feeble pulse a swelling in the feet and a restlessness during the time of sleep  the immoderate flux of the menstrual discharge is effectuated in three different manners   by too plentiful and impetuous an eruption at the usual period   sometimes by happening twice or oftener within the space of a month   sometimes by continuing several days longer than they were wont to flow the cure to be obtained is a restraining of the present flux and keeping a future one within due bounds for this purpose let the patient rest as long as convenient to her situation of life in bed upon her back and as much as possible let her avoid speaking according as she is strong or weak and concurring circumstances will allow let her blood in the arm care should be taken that no strict ligatures be suffered on any part of her body as by means of garters sleevebuttons etc which are very prejudicial let the patients diet be slender and consist chiefly of veal chickenbroths fishsoups let her constant drink be ptisan of plantane yarrow and nettletops into which by way of giving it a zest put some orangepeel or of the greater comfrey but put in linseed if she be of a hot and bilious temperament  in cases where these remedies do not succeed then recourse must be had to the following prescribed by dr mead as a more efficacious one take one ounce of burnt alum one quarter of an ounce of dragons blood which reduce to a powder to those of weakly constitutions let there be given from fifteen grains to twenty to those of middling from twenty to twentyfive to those of a strong habit thirty grains in a glass of red wine diluted with an equal quantity of warm water and to be taken three times a day  in the more alarming cases of this malady the womb on account of its orifice being in a quite relaxed state may be syringed with a decoction of yarrow red roses plantane or with warm water impregnated with the powder of rochalum or with vinegar made warm  sect iii of the whites or fluor albus this malady is the running of a liquid matter from the private parts of the female sex but stinks not like ulcers and is free from any infectious taint its color is sometimes white sometimes green sometimes yellow etc it is sometimes of an acid nature and excoriates the parts sometimes not this species of running is in general continued but not copious it is interrupted in some patients and returns either at irregular or stated periods it is in many a constant forerunner of the menstrual discharge and after that is over reappears for some time  the common signs to distinguish the whites from the venereal flux or clap is that in the latter case the discharge is more copious and continues during the times of the menstrual discharge whereas the former suffers an interruption the patients knowledge of her own conduct must help to judge in this case  the patients who labor under an uninterrupted fluor albus or one that frequently returns have a pale and swollen countenance a distaste for their wonted aliments a loss of strength frequent pain about the region of the heart besides troublesome twitchings and a sinking weakness of the stomach  inasmuch as this remote and fixed cause of the fluor albus is in the stomach the setting that to rights is the surest way of performing a cure let the patient set off in the beginning of the disorder when not much enfeebled by letting a little blood from the arm and in a day or two after be puked with one grain of tartar emetic if young and rather weak with half an ounce of tincture of hipecacuanha but if at her full growth and of a strong habit of body let two grains of tartar emetic be employed and when it begins to operate it is to be encouraged by drinking after each effort some camomiletea in a few days after let her be purged with what ever purgative medicine and dose she may have been used to but if not habituated to any in case the patient be young and weakly let fifteen grains of jalap in powders be taken in a dish of tea or whey or any other inoffensive and weak liquor warmed to be also drunk from time to time while the medicines are operating in order to encourage it  after these preludes to a cure the patient must betake herself to a proper regimen that is she must shun all ragousts fruits salads confectionaryarticles roots and live chiefly on rice beef mutton fowl and all sorts of food that tend to strengthen the constitution if denied either by the place of her abode or of her circumstances the means of procuring ferrugineous waters she may make an artificial one for herself by boiling old pieces of rusty iron in water of which she is to drink half a pint each day if young and of a weakly constitution but if of a strong habit and come to be full grown then she may drink a pint and every eight days for the first month repeat the above purgative in the second every fifteen days in the third month let the interval be of three weeks and once a month afterward for the space of six if the malady should persevere  immediately subsequent to the first purge let her begin to take the following remedies for a recent or inveterate state   in the commencement the fluor albus and in as yet a notemaciated constitution an infusion of rosemary drunk every day in the manner and in the room of tea has been often known to prevent its farther progress but when of a long standing and that it has resisted the commonly advised remedies by female friends gossips and matron advisers etc recourse must be had to the following remedy take extract of the peruvian bark nutmeg alum of each one scruple and of syrup of clove a sufficient quantity to make a bolus of thse ingredients let the patient begin by taking a very small quantity from the tip or edge of a teaspoon and so continue for one week increasing it the next and following but there she is to stop where the quantity may be found disagreeable in cases where a weakness of the back is perceived let a strengthening plaster to be had at any apothecarys shop be thereto applied  doctor russel advises for the cure of an inveterate fluor albus to bathe in the seawater and drink it those who are situated near the sea may try but since it has been known to fail in so many cases it is not strenuously insisted upon here and frequent exercise is preferable to it  sect iv of the green sickness or chlorosis to this malady are subject maids and widows it is attended with a slow irregular and almost imperceptible fever the complexion of the patient is discolored being sometimes a ghastly pale at other times livid and not rarely greenish with a circle of a violet color under the eyes they feel a constant irksomeness and a despondency without any apparent cause the pulse is small unequal and variable the ancles and eyelids are apt to swell the face is bloated a benumbing dullness is diffused through the whole body in the legs and feet are felt a tensive lassitude such patients are also subject to a palpitation of the heart racking pains in the head and an inordinate desire of things totally unfit for nourishing the body to wit chalk coals etc  the treatment in order to obtain a cure is to be commenced by a purgative proportioned to the patients strength as may be gathered from our directions in the maladies already treated of then get of castile soap three drachms of rhubarb in powder half a dram filings of steel half a dram species of hiera picra half a dram with a sufficient quantity of orange peels made into an electuary of which the patient if young and weakly is to take the quantity of half a small tea spoon full twice a day if grown up and strong she is to take each time the teaspoon full  she is to eat nothing but wholesome food and of easy digestion such as the young of all kinds of animals fowls etc and to delight in much exercise without continuing it to a wearisome fatigue doctor mead has advised to take of the tincture of black hellebore thirty drops two or three times a day it sometimes produces good effects and there is no harm in trying it alternately day about with the above electuary after the latter has been taken for the term of a week  mineral waters especially of the ferrngineous or ironclass prove often very effectual in those disorders and may be drunk several times in a day in moderate quantities followed by some moderate exercise immediately after if the distemper be caused by a suppression of the menstrual discharges it is effectually removed by the remedies that restore them when a deep rooted passion for a male object is the cause then marriage with the object beloved is the most powerful of all specifics  sect v of the furor uterinus this frenzy or rather libidinous rage all the female sex are liable to not only maids and widows but sometimes even married women and especially those who are disappointed in their conjugal expectations it is a continual and insatiable desire of copulation all regard to decency is thrown aside it begins by a morose silence and an occasional sparkling of the eyes the patient is kindled at hearing any obscene or wanton expressions and her pulse beats tumultuously she alternately bursts into fits of weeping and laughing she soon bids adieu to shame and speaks openly and boldly of every part and action from which modesty turns aside unhappy females a prey to this curse become even so abandoned as to attempt to force men to satisfy their lustful desires  this dreadful and calamitous disease is the most disgusting and offensive of all that invade the female sex because the like suffering state in the males is not held so disgraceful owes its origin to some remote and to some immediate causes the remote are the reading obscene books hearing immodest discourses or the frequent presence of a loved object without proceeding to the last favor a natural disposition of the body time of life manner of living for it is always observed to seize on those who lead an indolent life more than on others the immediate causes are an irritation of the womb caused by the acrimony of the humors that are brought thither or the applying either through the patients own wantonness or false lovers cruel deceit external remedies that are called provocatives whether internally taken or externally applied  in order that a cure may be attempted the patient must in the first place renounce all excitements to lustful sensation such as reading conversation selftouching etc she must be copiously and repeatedly let blood her food must be of the mildest kind she must avoid salted food high sauces all seasoning whatever that may tend to inflame her drink must be cooling such as whey or other weak liquor with twenty grains of nitre to be dissolved in every quart  she must frequently sit in half baths of warm water when out of them let her as often as conveniently she can convey by means of a funnel put into the vagina and up toward the orifice of her womb the vapors of warm water she is to take frequent clysters of warm water with two ounces of manna dissolved therein which she is to retain as long as conveniently she can it will not be amiss from time to time that blood may be drawn more immediately from the suffering part to apply leeches to the anus  by this process the desired ends are to be obtained which are   to diminish the quantity of irritating humors   to correct the acrimony of the remainder by a cooling diet   to dilute and weaken the local stimulatory cause by the application of warm water in halfbaths and injections   to act as an immediate auxiliary to the enflamed womb in the gentlest manner by mannas mildly operating in the simple form of clysters and at the same time concurring with the other curative views to release the fibers from their violent state of tension and bring about the wishedfor calm which cannot be missed of with the concomitance of regularity sobriety and chaste company  sect vi of the vapors or hysteric passion this malady of the female sex arises mostly from an accumulating of the blood in the bowels and is caused chiefly by an hindrance of the menstrual discharge which obstruction is productive of much mischief to the fair sex on account of their tender structure it is frequently accompanied with a vomiting a sense of suffocation a violent compression of the breast convulsive efforts etc maiden ladies in the true chaste sense and widows are the most liable to this complaint it is sometimes occasioned by too immoderate evacuations through whatever means whether of bleeding puking purging etc sometimes by being debarred from a commerce with the other sex in those especially whose frame consists of too delicate and irritable fibers  this very unaccountable disorder arises from many different sources and each requires different views of cure thus it is wont to make its dreadful invasion in what is vulgarly called a fit a compressive pain is felt in the forehead a numbness of the limbs a dimness of the sight an universal irksomness is diffused through all the parts something as if in a globular form seems to force its way upward through the throat and menace immediate suffocation the speech is interrupted the heart is in a violent palpitation the pulse is irregular and hard very acid matter like to a greenish bile is thrown out by the mouth a tormenting headache fixes in one part and is called the clavus hystericus racking pains are felt in the bladder and kidney as if the patient was afflicted with the stone the back aches prodigiously an excruciating toothache often comes in for a share the legs and arms are cold fits of weeping and laughing succeed to each other without any apparent cause for either and are accompanied with convulsions  the intention of curing is twofold one when the patients are in the fit the other when they are out of it let the body and limbs be rubbed with warm flannels let the legs be plunged deep into a warm bath in which are camomile flowers or bran and there be detained for some time let the soles of their feet be tickled let the patients be pulled by the hair in the most sensible parts to awaken the faculty of feeling let the fume of assafoetida leather horn or of any strongly smelling substance when burnt even of tobacco be conveyed through a pipe up their nostrils some practitioners recommend a few grains of musk or civet tied in a rag to be introduced into the vagina and assert this method to have often proved very efficacious  treatment out of the fit  in order to prevent its return or at least to make it abate of its violence when it shall reappear a bleeding in the foot to be followed in a day or two by a vomit of hypecacoana fifteen grains for girls about fourteen twenty grains for those between nineteen and twenty for those turned of four and twenty twentyfive grains  the patients are to drink camomiletea by preference to quicken its energy and is productive of very good effects on this occasion the following remedy has been recommended by very eminent practitioners to wit mead hoffman and others of no less fame dosed in these proportions take twentyfour ounces of simple peppermintwater of valerian in powder two ounces and of lavenderdrops one ounce let them be perfectly well mixed together and two or three times in the day let the patient take three large teaspoonfulls it is looked upon as a good method to apply a large galbanumplaister to the navel  twelve or fourteen drops of the spirit of hartshorn taken in any proper vehicle as weak tea whey etc prove a serviceable medicine to make use of as a constant drink waters impregnated with iron are a powerful assistant and women who are not situated in the neighborhood of such salutary springs may in part substitute thereto by heating in the fire pieces of old rusty iron and plunging them repeatedly into water small beer tea etc which they drink  let those who are liable to this afflicting disorder seize on every opportunity of taking exercise and although that on horseback has been accounted the best yet the others such as walking being carried in a coach chair etc are beneficial to a certain point let them seek all occasions of mirth avoid dull company too serious conversation melancholy stories and if they be single let them finally make trial of that powerful remedy which the matrimonial state alone provides in a lawful and blameless manner  sect vii of pregnancy having in the close of our last section advised all single females whether maids or widows to have recourse to matrimony as yet the most universally acknowledged specific against so manifold a disease and the greatest tyrant over the tender sex to wit the hysteric passion it is now consistent with the strictest order that our next process be on supposition that the suffering fair ones have followed our advice and taken refuge in the conjugal state for the cure of so grievous a calamity to delineate the changes the salutary ailments they are to undergo in consequence of their change of life the first whereof is to be in the state of pregnancy which is discoverable and may beyond all doubt be ascertained by the following signs  we think it proper to premise that the signs of conception especially at the beginning are very obscure because common to several other diseases and that more over they are different in different women which depend in a great measure upon a more or less robust constitution and different manner of living however the following signs in general are declaratory of a conception the menses or monthly discharge from the womb being at the end of the first second or third month after having undergone the embraces of a man either entirely suppressed or at least very much diminished with a frequent tendency to puking in the fourth month and in some not until the fifth a motion of something alive is felt in the womb and soon after that inwardly felt intimation is perceived by others on applying their hands on the belly there then remains no longer a doubt of the persons having conceived being advanced in pregnancy and big with child the breasts swell to a greater size than they were wont to be of by the flowing thither of a serous fluid the forerunner of milk which oozes out occasionally from and admonishes them of the motherly care they are soon to be charged with in suckling their children around the nipple are darkish circles the swelling or expansion of the abdomen or belly is upwards  all the pretended foretelling before its birth of what sex the child in the womb is ought to be treated with the highest contempt as a barefaced imposition on the belief of weak people who have no repugnance to let themselves be made dupes provided if wishing for a son they are flattered with the promise of their soon being delivered of one  a dropsy is easily distinguished from advanced pregnancy because in the former the swelling is in the lower part of the belly whereas in the latter it is in the upper besides another proof which puts the matter out of all doubt is if the patients swelling be hydropical that will appear by putting one hand at either side of the persons belly and then to pat or push it gently with the other the hand on the opposite side will feel a fluctuation of water  the chief inconveniences which pregnant women are liable to are either a loss or depravation of their appetite a nauseating or tendency to puke a listlessness a heaviness an headache a diziness difficulty of breathing a swelling of the feet and breast a violent toothache in all which cases proper rest as far as their condition will allow is required and that they expose themselves to no great fatigue a gentle bleeding is often not amiss but if pregnancy be the consequence of a private love affair let the patients communicate their situation to some experienced female friend that may perhaps be able to advise or at least able to apply for them to the skilled in physic we purposely avoid giving any directions through fear of dangerous consequences either by misapprehension or unskilful application  sect viii abortion or miscarriage the female disease next in order to pregnancy is abortion which is the premature exclusion of the foetus many months before the natural term this disaster most commonly happens in the third month or thereabout the most dangerous to the mothers are those that happen on the fifth month to avoid being the cause of any mischief we for the same reasons as in the preceding chapter decline directing any complicated remedy yet when these forerunners of an abortion are felt to wit a pain in the bottom of the matrix or womb or in the inward parts of the thighs as well as slight shiverings between the skin and the flesh and at the same time the belly becomes depressed and flattish about the navel from pointed which it had been in that part at the beginning of such symptoms linseed has been often proved a very good remedy to prevent a miscarriage or abortion it may not also be amiss to bleed about the third month of pregnancy more or less according to the strength of the person and during the first months particularly let it be remembered that the body is to be kept open with rhubarb or senna or other purgative of the mild class we cannot finish this section more profitably to the commonwealth than with a truly physical moral and religious inculcating to young maids who may have unfortunately been seduced to beware of and shun as they would poison all remedies which the wicked recommend to cause abortions and for the following reasons obvious to the meanest capacity  the remedies that have been cried up by ignorance and vice as capable of causing an abortion or miscarriage are in fact nay absolutely not endowed with any such especial faculty for the way that they act toward and contribute to that purpose is by the violence with which they exert themselves when introduced into the human body where by the outrageous tumult which they cause they are sometimes productive of the too early expulsion of the foetus from the womb all shaken and convulsed by the general commotion caused throughout the mothers frame which storm likewise frequently causes her death so by one unhappy deed she is guilty of selfmurder and that of her child  but in those constitutions where such accursed remedies cannot operate the wished and diabolical effect of murdering and prematurely driving the foetus out of the womb whether through too great an adhesion or strong contexture of the parts and then they exercise all their malignant power on the constitution of the unhappy mother which they ruin for ever after and thus she shortens her date of life as but too many fatal instances have been known in practice  if they have no feeling for their yet unborn babes let them have some regard for their own health and well being in this world which should they overlook let them tremble at the certainty of their being to appear before a tremendous judge on the last day and there to receive the sentence of eternal torture for the most detestable the most barbarous and inhuman of all crimes a mother guilty of the murder of her own child nay of tearing it bleeding ftom her own womb before its allotted time of delivery to mangle its tender thread of life nature shudders at the thought  the most wild most savage and most ferocious beasts that howl terror through dreary forests or deserts never commit so monstrous a deed   sect ix of a mole by the term mole is to be understood nothing more than a fleshy substance generated in the womb it is most commonly of a spherical form and until ocular conviction after its delivery or a continuance long beyond the time of childbearing has been mistaken for the true consequence of a conception a foetus or child in the womb  its dimensions vary from the common size of an infant down to that of a large nutshell some are of a membranous texture others of a softish or spongy consistence and have in their middle a cavity they sometimes abound with little bladders called hydatides and at others they are replete with a serous matter  moles are apt to alarm those who are troubled with them by a display of symptoms at first not unlike to those of women really with child they differ much afterward for a dull heavy weight like a ball of lead is felt when a mole is the case but it never does like a living foetus exhibit a vibratory motion to any hand applied on the outside of the abdomen which in the state of undoubted pregnancy is spherical and roundish  a mole in itself menaces no peril to the patient and all the danger or difficulty that it is liable to be accompanied with consists chiefly in the manner of freeing the womb from so useless an encumbrance for otherwise women have been known to have carried them for many years nay even to a very advanced age in life without suffering any other inconvenience than the being troubled from time to time with the disagreeable sensation of a listless weight and a teazing uneasiness  the most ignorant of the sex may be persuaded beyond any possibility of a doubt that they have a mole in the womb when they perceive that an increase of bulk and weight has exceeded by far the usual time of gestation or childbearing which in general exceeds not nine months and the utmost indulgence of physicians to cover the reputation of great ladies has never let it stretch beyond eleven the truth of which complaisance is much doubted of and not without reason  the certainty of a mole in the womb being established the next attention is to eject an idle occupant of the first cradle of human existence for the twofold reason of being useless in itself and preventive of introducing there what may prove the reverse  the method to be followed by those who do not choose to run the risk of violent internal remedies which ought not to be ventured on without proper advice is to take the fresh slender root of a walnut tree not exceeding in length the palm of the hand then to shave and polish it to the thickness of a middlesized finger which is to be introduced from time to time into the vagina where it will excite a tingling sensation of heat and that being communicated to the womb will provoke it to action and cause it in time to eject its inanimate contents whether it be a real or dead foetus a mole or any concretion formed in the womb in consequence of a former delivery not happily conducted it will not be amiss to accompany the above application with the repetition of a pretty strong puke and purgative alternately that is within a few days distance of each in order to accelerate the desired effect the dose of the puke or purgative is to be settled by the patients which in this case is to be increased beyond that which is wont to work them  sect x dropsy of the uterus or womb that distemper of the female sex and which by practitioners in all treatises upon their maladies is called a dropsy of the uterus is obviously distinguishable from the common dropsy of the abdomen or belly and for this very striking reason because in the former the dropsy of the womb by the appearance both to the eye and touch is confined to the region or neighborhood of the uterus or womb and is round circumscribed and prominent but it is quite the contrary in the other dropsy because then the whole belly is equally swelled  the curing a dropsy of the womb is not attended with so much difficulty as curing that of the belly sometimes nothing more is necessary than hard riding or any other violent exercise accompanied as in the cure of mole dead foetus etc with strong pukes and purges from time to time  the following simple injection has been found of great use  get an ounce of ipecacoana boiled in a pint of water till the quantity be diminished about a quarter then let it be put by to cool  when to be used which may be every morning as the action of the day will forward its effect let it be warmed to that degree a clyster commonly is and then be injected up through the vagina toward the orifice of the womb the patient lying on her back in which situation she is to continue as long as she can and if for a quarter of an hour so much the better because by that means the remedy will have the more time to make its desired impression  it will not be amiss to take internally of the tincture of jalap and florentine orris mixed together one teaspoon full just before teatime in the morning and evening and constantly to put a small quantity of saffron into their tea will not be unserviceable  sect xi the falling down of the womb what is in the writings of eminent physicians called procidentia uteri and which for the being readily understood by the most vulgar capacity we have translated the falling down of the womb is alas too common a disorder in that part and easily known by presenting itself between the lips of the vagina and preventing an entrance into it  this distemper is rather more incommodious and disagreeable than dangerous  the first view of cure is to reduce the uterus and the next to retain it in its proper situation  to answer the first view of reducing it a common clyster must be taken in order to discharge the gut that is next to it called the rectum of any excremental lodgment  the patient must be let blood three or four times and there must also be applied emollient or softening plasters as of white bread and milk  a few warm baths will be of use because by their means the parts will be properly relaxed then must the patient lie on her back with her hips raised much higher than her head and her legs must be separated to a proper distance then in a most gentle and gradual manner is the womb to be put back and in that direction where it meets with the least obstacle when this operation is performed the patient still taking care to keep her hips raised and legs across is to remain in bed about a fortnight  but to put a finishing hand to the cure an astringent medicine dexterously applied will be necessary such as for instance  a quarter of a pound of the bark of oak with two oun of misletoe boiled in two quarts of water until reduced to one quart then lay it aside for use it is to be twice a day injected with a proper degree of warmth up through the vagina toward the womb  and in the vagina on going to rest at night ought to be introduced as high as convenient an adapted piece of sponge or else soft linen rags twisted into a circular form and well soaked in the above decoction of the bark of oak and misletoe the longer it is retained in the part so much the better  sect xii on delivery or childbirth and afterpains one of the inconveniences that most commonly attend women approaching to the time of delivery or of being brought to bed is a difficulty of making water which in general may be removed without taking any inward remedy or applying any outward and that by raising the belly for the pressure of the womb big with a grown foetus on the sphincter or outlet of the bladder is frequently the cause of such stoppage  when things are so far gone as to be near childbirth since from the extraordinary bulk of the patient it can be no longer kept a secret were there even a necessity for so doing then it is prudent to lay aside illtimed modesty and application is to be made to those who practice in that branch whether they be of the male or female sex especially when nature seems in danger of meeting difficulties she cannot overcome although in most cases she is sufficient of herself and great mischief is often caused by conceited practitioners thwarting her operation doctor mead advises for the quickening of a delivery that a grain of purified opium be divided into two pills one to be taken six hours after the other  about an hour after the delivery the mother ought to take a teaspoon full of the oil of sweet almonds and that repeatedly if it appear requisite in order to soothe the subsequent pains then let a cataplasm made up of oil of sweet almonds two ounces with two or three new laid eggs boiled together be applied to the parts and for the space of two days be renewed every six hours  if the pains after delivery prove violent and menacing then the following prescription has been experienced of the greatest use take two scruples of sperma ceti ten grains of volatile salts of hartshorn ten drops of balsam of peru and one dram of venice treacle let them be carefully mixed with as much syrup of white poppies as will suffice to be made into four doses one to be taken every six hours till the pains disappear the patient is to drink caudle very plentifully and to be kept very warm  in about fifteen days after delivery and a vanishing of the pains attendant thereon the late suffering parts are to be bathed with an astringent decoction that they may be braced up which decoction is to consist of half a pint of red wine wherein are to be boiled red roses and balaustins as chief ingredients  inasmuch as after all births that are any ways laborious the mother is in general weak and very apt to faint it will be necessary and far from imprudent by the means of a glass of hot wine or other generous liquor to comfort and keep up her spirits the same is to be repeated as often as she shall appear to stand in need thereof comfortable broths greatly contribute to forward a recovery of strength all other occurrences of a more intricate tendency are to be remedied by professed practitioners  sect xiii the lochia the advice with which we have closed the last section must take place relative to the disorders of this discharge immediately after childbearing whether in excess or diminished because then the patient on account of so enfeebled a state can be of no service to herself and the relying on friends in general is dangerous  sect xiv disorders of the breasts after childbearing that which commonly takes the lead and is therefore reckoned the first because it appears the third or fourth day after delivery is caused by a congestion or gathering of milk in both the breasts or in either of them it is thence called the milk fever  it is usually accompanied with a tensive or excruciating pain and also with a tumor or swelling of both the breasts or either that frequently extend to both armpits or at least to that of the breasts affected  this pain of the armpits is sometimes violent to a most insupportable degree it is wont to persevere for the space of one to two days and then puts an end to itself by copious sweats always proportioned to the preceding cold sweats by which it is diverted out of the body as a benefit of nature  in some cases however there may be a necessity of using gentle diaphoretic remedies that increase perspiration or some of the hot diluting ones to assist and encourage the disembarrassing of the vessels in the breasts to which the child ought often to be put and the mother confine herself to a strict diet  but if it should not be the intention of the patient to suckle the child then a more strict regimen is to be observed and a proper person is to be procured to draw the breasts from time to time which will contribute to hinder a gathering there  moreover a thickening of the milk is to be hindered by embrocating the breast with oil of sweet almonds or even with linseed oil nay a warm application of the leaves of red cabbage has proved beneficial on such occasions as have also double cloths dipped in brandy and then put under the armpits but if the milk fever should prove very hot acute and threaten immediate inflammation then recourse must be had to bleeding  sect xv an inflammation of the breasts if in a short time after childbirth there happens a stagnating of the milk accompanied with a swelling and a pain it is called an inflammation of the breasts then inwardly let gentle cordials be taken and externally apply hot linen cloths steeped in rum care must be taken to have the milk drawn off some how or other whether by the mouth of an animal such as a puppy or the hand of the nurse etc  but should the swelling caused by a stagnation of milk be observed to be without heat then with all possibe speed let the part be bathed with red wine made warm or spirit of wine camphorated nay the cataplasm or plaster of white bread and red wine boiled together with the addition of some camphorated spirit of wine has been recommended as a successful remedy by some very good practitioners  when the swelling appears inclinable to break then make use of a softening plaster particularly the common one with the gums which will ripen it to an opening as soon as it shall be opened take care to cleanse it with a digestive ointment to heal it with balsamic remedies particularly the balsam of peru to be had at any apothecarys shop  women in this disorder are liable to a disagreeable attendant upon it and that is a chapping in the nipples which in that case are to be anointed with a mixture of oil and bees wax  sect xvi an inflammation of the uterus or womb this malady happens frequently to childbed women at the same time of the milk fever appearing however if proper care be taken to oppose its progress in the beginning all will go well therefore let the patient take inwardly oil of sweet almonds alone to the quantity of half an ounce but for exterior remedy let the whole abdomen or belly be duly anointed with oil of dill an ounce with the same quantity of white lillies and camomile to which add a dram either of camphire or caraways over which a double napkin must be laid  sect xvii the cancer this malady is incidental either to the womb or breasts in women it begins at first with a small swelling no exceeding a nut in bigness nor does the color of the skin on the breasts undergo any sudden change because the cancer without causing any terrifying alarms in its first stages continues as it were a silent progress for many years  but when the fostering humors of that evil is endowed with a greater degree of activity the swelling is suddenly enlarged into a great unequal round and livid tumor accompanied with a racking pain  finally it terminates in a rupture and thence discharges a bloodurged stinking and acrimonious humor which by preying upon the parts that are sound render the lips of the wound ghastly and horrible to sight nay often death  the cancer of the womb seldom admits of any cure because the patient generally speaking is in a desperate state before it can be ascertained the cancer of the breasts as well as of the other parts if timely taken in hand is often cured for which end the following remedy is recommended for its powerful virtue by a very eminent physician get two ounces of the shavings of guaiacum which boil in two quarts of water and let it continue to boil until it be reduced to three pints half a pint of this decoction is to be drank twice a day  for external application  make use of a fomentation of milk and water in which camomile flowers had been boiled and let that be succeeded by a pultice of white bread and milk  the patient must be ever mindful that the cancer must be preserved with all imaginable care from every impression of the cold air on which for that purpose ought constantly to be spread a little of the sperma ceti ointment which salutary practice ought to be renewed every day two or three times  we cannot conclude the present section with a more essential advice to all laboring under this distemper than to bid them avoid dealing with ignorant quacks or nostrum retailers for a cure because the taking such a step must lead to certain danger  sect xviii ulcer of the womb the principal and determining sign by which this malady may be known is by a discharge of stinking and purulent matter that is streaked all over with blood and the greater the quantity oozing from it is the deeper you may pronounce the ulcer to be but when the flowing matter is not distained with blood then no more than the serous and lymphatic vessels are affected but when it is of a reddish color then to a certainty the blood vessels are attacked  the following injection is recommended let an ounce of honey of roses in half a pint of water be heated to a proper degree to wit such as can be borne without exciting a sense of pain which by means of a sponge is to be applied through the vagina on the ailing part several times in the day half a tea spoonfull of the tincture of myrrh may be added to each injection  but in order to correct the acrimony of the blood a milk diet is the most effectual which may be relieved from time to time by the use of herb soups light broths as of veal chicken etc  i have now treated sufficiently of all those distempers incidental to the fair sex and which every individual either through their own sagacity or with the assistance of some intelligent female friend may safely undertake the cure of  there are no cases omitted but those quite out of their reach to bring any help to and that require both the inspection as well as operation of a skilful surgeon  there are indeed a few slight diseases or rather deficiences of nature in the married state that obstruct the propagation of the species but decency forbids me to mention any thing about them lest libertinism should make a vicious use thereof  finis
