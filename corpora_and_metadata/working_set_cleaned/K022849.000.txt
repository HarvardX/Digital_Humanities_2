 little turnstile high holborn patriotic bookseller and publisher of pios meat    price one penny  pigs meat the honey or essence of politics is now finished in seventytwo penny numbers making three volumes price in boards  s each  this is the only book that in a direct manner teaches the real honest and pure rights of man and that shows an easy and practicable way to enjoy them  the end of oppression young man i hear there is another rights of man by spence that goes farther than paines   old m yet it goes no farther than it ought   y m i understand it suffers no private property in land but gives it all to the parishes   o m in so doing it does right the earth was not made for individuals   y m but people of all conditions have been so accustomed to think that the completion of all earthly felicity consists in the possession of landed propriety that it is not likely they will generally be brought to give up the daling hopes of one time or other possessing a snug estate   o m it is true if there were no injustice attending the state of a landlord it is the most desirable and enviable state in the world even infinitely more so than that of a king or any placeman or pensioner whatsoever   y m it is indeed every body knows that well for the landlord is entirely supreme independent and arbitrary in his own domains hence the title lord and nothing binds him but his own leases which he for his own interest grants he is in no danger of losing his revenues for he pays himself in a most haughty and lordly manner without process and without hardly condescending to ask and when his rents are brought to him on the very hour they are due his dignity will not permit him to be thankful   o m why i find you are at least half a spensonian you understand something of the nature of the enemy and i dare say we shall not differ much in opinion   y m i have heard read and seen enough of their oppressions to make me wish them at an end if possible   o m whether it be possible we shall see by and by but for the reasons beforementioned unless it be necessary that there should be in a state freemen and slaves lordly men and mean men landlords cannot be suffered   y m but most people believe it would be unjust to deprive landed men of their property as many of them have purchased their estates   o m landed property always was originally acquired either by conquest or encroachment on the common property of mankind and as those public robbers did never show any degree of conscience or moderation in their usurpations it cannot be expected that the multitudes thus disinherited and enslaved for ages should in the day of reclamation through an effeminate and foolish tenderness neglect the precious opportunity of recovering at once the whole of their rights   y m but i am speaking of the seeming hardships of depriving modern purchasers of their property   o m those modern purchasers are not ignorant of the manner in which landed property was originally obtained neither are they sorry for it nor for any other imposition by which they can get revenue and every one knows that buying stolen goods is as bad as stealing   y m you are entirely right the conduct of our rich men is not such as to create much respect for their property the whole of their study is to create monopolies and to raise rents and revenues and like the grave their endless cry is give give   o m and what was originally obtained by the sword they determine to detain by the sword are not they and their minions now in arms under the name of yeomanry volunteers etc and what means the inveterate war commenced by the aristocracy of the world against france they know that mankind once enlightened will not brook their lordliness nor be content with their rights by piecemeal therefore they exert every nerve to prevent light from spreading and the union of the people   y m indeed there cannot be any thing said for them they exhibit to us too plainly all the properties and practices of robbers plunder spoil and contributions they will at all events have though their illgotten lands should swim with blood fully declaring themselves the true heirs and successors of the ancient nimrods from whom they hold   o m then let all men say spence has done right in rooting up such a combination of spoilers and setting the world free from all exactions imposts and abuses at once and for ever   y m it is amazing that pain and the other democrats should level all their artillery at kings without striking like spence at this root of every abuse and of every grievance   o m the reason is evident they have no chance of being kings but many of them are already and the rest foolishly and wickedly hope to be sometime or other landlords lesser or greater   y m but do you think mankind will ever enjoy any tolerable degree of liberty and felicity by having a reform in parliament if landlords be still suffered to remain   o m you should first ask if the landed interest will let you have a reform which they will take care to prevent for a convention or parliament of the people would be at eternal war with the aristocracy but granting they should so far forget their interest they would soon recollect their mistake and set about their true interest again which is to counteract every species of public good and full well are they furnished with every requisite for the diabolical work the perpetual influx of wealth by their rents without toil or study leaves them at full liberty and leisure to plot and supplies them also with the means of fighting successfully against the interests of the working part of the community and turn their labors to their own advantage   y m yes it is natural to expect that whether in the legislature or out of it their whole study will be under every kind of government to increase the prices of what their estates produce that their rents may rise what shall we then account such a body of people whose interests are only their own and so opposite to all others but a public enemy a banditti that must always be watched and sometimes resisted   o m there you are wrong with your watching and resisting who is to watch and resist must not all the rest of the world do something for their bread and are they not disarmed by the game laws awed by the military and by monopolies state tricks rents and taxes reduced to continual drudgery and starvation how many days do you think such a brood of beggars could maintain themselves in a state of insurrection against their oppressors they must away to their work again the cries of their famished families break up their campaigns before they are well begun and they must again return to the yoke like other starved animals for mere subsistence   y m o hopeless state of mankind   o m no it is not yet hopeless though the enemy like a numerous army be garrisoned and quartered every where among us and have all the strong holds all the arms and every advantage that triumphant and cruel invaders could wish for yet will a true and universal knowledge of spences plain and simple system overturn them and sweep all their greatness and lordliness away in one day and leave the world in perpetual and perfect peace   y m some seem to apprehend the mismanagement of the parish revenues and so discourage people from thinking of that system   o m that is the natural work of the enemy and must be expected but it does not become democrats to doubt concerning it for if men cannot manage the revenues and affairs of a parish what must they do with a state it is almost as absurd to answer such quibbles as to make them how strange that men will turn the world upside down to get the management of a nation and yet pretend to despair concerning a parish it is too bad the villainy is too barefaced i am weary with combatting the vile sophistry of scoundrels that are oppressors and of scoundrels that would be oppressors but in spences pigs meat you will find the parish system represented in such a variety of ways and so plainly evidencing to every reader the easy and practicable transition from this scene of oppression and woe to perfect freedom and felicity that i must refer you to that incomparable work for complete satisfaction on the subject   y m i thank you i will take the first opportunity of perusing that excellent book but in the mean time for the sake of conversation let us suppose that a whole nation no matter whether america france holland or any other but as to england it is entirely out of the question were fully convinced of the excellence of this system and universally wishing its establishment i should be glad to know the most easy method of doing so and with least bloodshed   o m in a country so prepared let us suppose a few thousands of hearty determined fellows well armed and appointed with officers and having a committee of honest from and intelligent men to act as a provisionary government and to direct their actions to the proper object if this committee published a manifesto or proclamation directing the people in every parish to take on receipt thereof immediate possession of the whole landed property within their district appointing a committee to take charge of the same in the name and for the use of the inhabitants and that every landholder should immediately on pain of confiscation and imprisonment deliver to the said parochial committee all writings and documents relating to their estates that they might immediately be burnt and that they should likewise disgorge at the same time into the hands of the said committee the last payments received from their tenants in order to create a parochial fund for immediate use without calling upon the exhausted people if this proclamation was generally attended to the business was settled at once but if the aristocracy arose to contend the matter let the people be firm and desperate destroying them root and branch and strengthening their hands by the rich confiscations thus the war would be carried on at the expense of the wealthy enemy and the soldiers of liberty beside the hope of sharing in he future felicity of the country being well paid would be steady and bold and wherever the lands were taken possession of by the people which by all means should be as early accomplished as possible the grand resource of the aristocracy the rents would be cut off which would soon reduce them to reason and they would become as harmless as other men   y m if people could but thus become honest and wise enough to cut off at once the resources of the enemy they might soon get rid of oppression but it is a pity they do not perceive the immediate and inexpressible blessings that would infallably result from such a revolution   o m the good effects of such a change would be more exhilirating and reviving to the hungerbitten and despairing children of oppression than a benign and sudden spring to the frostbitten earth after a long and severe winter only think of the many millions of rents that are now paid to those selfcreated nephews of god almighty the landed interest which is literally paid for nothing but to create masters  i say only think of all this money circulating among the people and there promoting industry and happiness and all the arts and callings useful in society would not the change be unspeakable this would neither be a barren revolution of mere unproductive rights such as many contend for nor yet a glut of sudden and temporary wealth as if acquired by conquest but a continual flow of permanent wealth established by a system of truth and justice and guaranteed by the interest of every man woman and child in the nation the government also of such a people could no longer be oppressive the democratic parishes would take care how they suffered their money to be lavished away upon state speculations and their senators who could not be men of landed property would be found to be much more honest and true to the services of their constituents than our nowadays so much boasted gentlemen of independent fortunes  when a people create landlords they create a numerous host of hereditary tyrants and oppressors who not content with their lordly revenues of rents seize also upon the government and parcel it out among themselves and take as enormous salaries for the places they occupy therein as if they were poor men so that the rents which the foolish people foolishly pay they pay for nothing and the poor dull ass the public become thus loaded as it were with two pair of panyers so then whoever will be so silly goodnatured and overgenerous as to pay rents to a set of individuals must not be surprised if their masters by all ways and means and pretenses should keep them to it and give scope sufficient to their liberal propensities   finis a song to be sung at the end of oppression or the commencement of the political milennium when there shall be neither lords nor landlords but god and man will be all in all first printed in the year      tune god save the king   hark how the trumpets sound see leviticus chap     proclaims the land around the jubilee tells all the poor oppressed no more they shall be cessd nor landlords more molest their property   rents to ourselves now we pay dreading no quarter day fraught with distress welcome that day draws near for then our rents we share though the inhabitants in every district or parish in the world except in england have an undoubted right to divide the whole of the rents equally among them and suffer the state and all public affairs to be supported by taxes as usual yet from the numerous evils and restraints attending revenue laws and the number of collectors informers etc appendant on the same it is supposed they would rather prefer that after the whole amount of the rents are collected in a parish from every person according to the full value of the premises which they occupy so much per pound according to act of parliament should be set apart for support of the state instead of all taxes that another sum should next be deducted for support of the parish establishment instead of tolls tithes rates cesses etc and that after these important matters were provided for the remainder of the money should be equally divided among all the settled inhabitants whether poor or rich  earths rightful lords we are ordained for this   how has the oppressor ceased isaiah chap     and all the world released from misery the firtrees all rejoice and cedars lift their voice ceased now the eers noise long raised by thee   the scepter now is broke which with continual stroke the nations smote hell from beneath does rise to meet thy lofty eyes from the most pompous size how brought to naught   since then this jubilee sets all at liberty let us be glad behold each man return to his right and his own no more like doves to mourn by landlords sad
