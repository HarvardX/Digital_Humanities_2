curlls stomach the strong drench oercame infused in vengeance of insulted fame the avenger sees with a delighted eye his long jaws open and his color fly and while his guts the keen emeticks urge smiles on the vomit and enjoys the purge sold by j roberts j morphew r burleigh j baker and s popping price three pence  a full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge by poison on the body of mr edm curll etc history furnishes us with examples of many satirical authors who have fallen sacrifices to revenge but not of any booksellers that i know of except the unfortunate subject of the following papers i mean mr edmund curll at the bible and dial in fleetstreet who was yesterday poisoned by mr pope after having lived many years an instance of the mild temper of the british nation  every body knows that the said mr edmund curll on monday the   th instant published a satirical piece entitled court poems in the preface whereof they were attributed to a lady of quality mr pope or mr gay by which indiscreet method though he had escaped one revenge there were still two behind in reserve  now on the wednesday ensuing between the hours of  0 and    mr lintott a neighboring bookseller desired a conference with mr curll about settling the title page of wiqueforts ambassador inviting him at the same time to take a whet together mr pope who is not the only instance how persons of bright parts may be carried away by the instigations of the devil found means to convey himself into the same room under pretense of business with mr lintott who it seems is the printer of his homer this gentleman with a seeming coolness reprimanded mr curll for wrongfully ascribing to him the aforesaid poems he excused himself by declaring that one of his authors mr oldmixon by name gave the copies to the press and wrote the preface upon this mr pope being to all appearance reconciled very civilly drank a glass of sack to mr curll which he as civilly pledged and though the liquor in color and taste differed not from common sack yet was it plain by the pangs this unhappy stationer felt soon after that some poisonous drug had been secretly infused therein  about eleven a clock he went home where his wife observing his color changed said are you not sick my dear he replied bloody sick and incontinently fell a vomiting and straining in an uncommon and unnatural manner the contents of his vomiting being as green as grass his wife had been just reading a book of her husbands printing concerning jane wenham the famous witch of hartford and her mind misgave her that he was bewitched but he soon let her know that he suspected poison and recounted to her between the intervals of his yawnings and reachings every circumstance of his interview with mr pope  mr lintott in the mean time coming in was extremely afrighted at the sudden alteration he observed in him brother curll says he i fear you have got the vomiting distemper which i have heard kills in half an hour this comes from your not following my advice to drink old hock as i do and abstain from sack mr curll replied in a moving tone your authors sack i fear has done my business zds says mr lintott my author  why did not you drink old hock notwithstanding which rough remonstrance he did in the most friendly manner press him to take warm water but mr curll did with great obstinacy refuse it which made mr lintott infer that he chose to die as thinking to recover greater damages  all this time the symptoms increased violently with acute pains in the lower belly brother lintott says he i perceive my last hour approaching do me the friendly office to call my partner mr pemberton that we may settle our worldly affairs mr lintott like a kind neighbor was hastening out of the room while mr curll raved aloud in this manner if i survive this i will be revenged on tonson it was he first detected me as the printer of these poems and i will reprint these very poems in his name his wife admonished him not to think of revenge but to take care of his stock and his soul and in the same instant mr lintott whose goodness can never be enough applauded returned with mr pemberton after some tears jointly shed by these humane booksellers mr curll being as he said in his perfect senses though in great bodily pain immediately proceeded to make a verbal will mrs curll having first put on his night cap in the following manner  gentlemen in the first place i do sincerely pray forgiveness for those indirect methods i have pursued in inventing new titles to old books putting authors names to things they never saw publishing private quarrels for public entertainment all which i hope will be pardoned as being done to get an honest livelihood  i do also heartily beg pardon of all persons of honor lords spiritual and temporal gentry burgesses and commonalty to whose abuse i have any or every way contributed by my publications particularly i hope it will be considered that if i have vilifyd his grace the duke of mgh i have likewise aspersed the late duke of od if i have abused the honorable mr wle i have also libelled the late lord bke so that i have preserved that equality and impartiality which becomes an honest man in times of faction and division  i call my conscience to witness that many of these things which may seem malicious were done out of charity i having made it wholly my business to print for poor disconsolate authors whom all other booksellers refuse only god bless sir richard blre you know he takes no copy money  the book of the conduct of the earl of nm is yet unpublished as you are to have the profit of it mr pemberton you are to run the risque of the resentments of all that noble family indeed i caused the author to assert several things in it as facts which are only idle stories of the town because i thought it would make the book sell do you pay the author for copy money and the printer and publisher i heartily beg gods and my ld nms pardon but all trades must live  the second collection of poems which i groundlesly called mr priors will sell for nothing and has not yet paid the charge of the advertisements which i was obliged to publish against him therefore you may as well suppress the edition and beg that gentlemans pardon in the name of a dying christian  the french cato with the criticism showing how superior it is to mr addisons which i wickedly inscribed to madam dacier may be suppressed at a reasonable rate being damnably translated  i protest i have no animosity to mr row having printed part of his callipaedia and an incorrect edition of his poems without his leave in quarto mr gildons rehearsal or bays the younger did more harm to me than to mr row though upon the faith of an honest man i paid him double for abusing both him and mr pope  heaven pardon me for publishing the trials of sodomy in an elzevir letter but i humbly hope my printing sir richard blres essays will atone for them i beg that you will take what remains of these last which is near the whole impression presents excepted and let my poor widow have in exchange the sole propriety of the copy of madam mascranny  here mr pemberton interrupted and would by no means consent to this article about which some dispute might have arisen unbecoming a dying person if mr lintott had not interposed and mr curll vomited  what this poor unfortunate man spoke afterward was so indistinct and in such broken accents being perpetually interrupted by vomitings that the reader is entreated to excuse the confusion and imperfection of this account  dear mr pemberton i beg you to beware of the indictment at hicksshall for publishing rochesters bawdy poems that copy will otherwise be my best legacy to my dear wife and helpless child  the case of impotence was my best support all the last long vacation  in this last paragraph mr curlls voice grew more free for his vomitings abated upon his dejections and he spoke what follows from his closestole  for the copies of noblemens and bishops last wills and testaments i solemnly declare i printed them not with any purpose of defamation but merely as i thought those copies lawfully purchased from doctors commons at one shilling a piece our trade in wills turning to small account we may divide them blindfold  for mr manwarings life i ask mrs oldds pardon neither his nor my lord halifaxs lives though they were of great service to their country were of any to me but i was resolved since i could not print their works while they lived to print their lives after they were dead  while he was speaking these words mr oldmixon entered ah mr oldmixon said poor mr curll to what a condition have your works reduced me i die a martyr to that unlucky preface however in these my last moments i will be just to all men you shall have your third share of the court poems as was stipulated when i am dead where will you find another bookseller your protestant packet might have supported you had you writ a little less scurrilously there is a mean in all things  then turning to mr pemberton he told him he had several taking title pages that only wanted treatises to be wrote to them and earnestly entreated that when they were writ his heirs might have some share of the profit of them  after he had said this he fell into horrible gripings upon which mr lintott advised him to repeat the lords prayer he desired his wife to step into the shop for a common prayer book and read it by the help of a candle without hesitation he closed the book fetched a groan and recommended to mrs curll to give forty shillings to the poor of the parish of st dunstans and a weeks wages advance to each of his gentlemen authors with some small gratuity in particular to mrs centlivre  the poor man continued for some hours with all his disconsolate family about him in tears expecting his final dissolution when of a sudden he was surprizingly relieved by a plentiful foetid stool which obliged them all to retire out of the room notwithstanding it is judged by sir richard ble that the poison is still latent in his body and will infallibly destroy him by slow degrees in less than a month it is to be hoped the other enemies of this wretched stationer will not further pursue their revenge or shorten this small period of his miserable life  finis
