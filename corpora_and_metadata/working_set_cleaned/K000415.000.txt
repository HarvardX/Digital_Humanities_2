an elegy to the memory of the right honorable william late earl of bath  london printed for w nicoll at the papermill in st paulschurchyard  m dcc lxv  price one shilling and sixpence  this piece is inscribed to such members of the minority as are actuated by a real solicitude for the welfare of the public  by their most obedient humble servant the author  elegy to the memory of the right honorable william late earl of bath i say when the wise the dignified and high submit to fates inexorable doom shall no kind anguish swell the friendly eye nor drop one pious offering on the tomb ii ere this some votry of poetic fame twas thought o bath had kindled into fire and wreathed a deathless chaplet for thy name around the muses consecrated lyre iii yet this dead silence which the muse displays from friendships self may possibly arise since all though bound to wonder and to praise are bound alike to pity and despise iv o that deaths dread and everlasting pause in black oblivion might enwrap thy name so that the loss of honor and applause could wash away thy baseness and thy shame v but truth alas will rush beyond the grave and drag the mightiest to the face of morn dwell on each act that indicates the slave and hang it up to neverending scorn vi it is then no bawd of overbearing times however entrenched in ermine or in power can strain her honest dictates into crimes nor legal ruffian haul her to the tower vii it is then no dastard verdict she can hear on some tame jury villainously stole nor dread a sentence fastened on their fear repugnant wholly to their sense and soul viii had the white angel of the strictly just at one nice period pultney interposed and kindly snatched thee headlong into dust how bright a race of glory had thou closed ix then at thy mention the big drop would start and teach each nobler sentiment to burn all britain then had screwed thee to her heart and poured immortal sorrows on thy urn x the nameless magic on thy voice which hung had then swelled up our most exalted rhymes and the rich thunders of thy wondrous tongue rolled on impetuous to the latest times xi turn back o memory if thou can nor gaze where poor ambitions paltryminded breath could blast the harvest of so bright a praise and chill each ripening dignity to death xii throw some olympus fancy on the thought nor let the bursting sentiment disclose that patriot pultney ever could be bought to screen the deadliest of his countrys foes xiii that he the godlike guardian of the state who still pursued wherever the villain fled could basely stoop and snatch him from his fate when hung with honest horrors over his head xiv and stoop  for what  perdition catch the sound and blast it instant with the worst despair a word which truth in every age has found composed as much of infamy as air xv search the long list of nobles on record since empire first or dignity began and mark how few were honored with my lord who graced the humbler epithet of man xvi in natures earlier and exalted state on sure foundations all distinction stood whoever had worth of consequence was great and he was selfennobld that was  good xvii no star then glittered on the breast of shame no sordid knave was purpled over with strings twas worth that marked a subject with a name and not the wild capriciousness of kings xviii but when some spoiler rushing into light the bolts of power tyrannically hurled and claimed from heaven hereditary right to scourge the groaning nations of the world xix when future kings in one oppressive line on every human institute had trod nay talked of rights prescriptively divine to burst the dreadest mandates of their god xx then the mad license of unbounded rule a brand of title to it is minions gave stamped the disgrace of honor on the fool the public robber and the perjured slave xxi the blushless villain bore it from the hour he vilely sold his country and his trust the hackneyd strumpet had it for her dower and reekd a duchess from the bed of lust xxii yet for this breath of dignified disgrace did pultney meanly pandar to a throne nay though it stunk upon a walpoles race before it rankly festerd on his own xxiii here see ye meteors of a wondering state nor throw the moral sentiment aside how low ambition can reduce the great and how the wisest are debased by pride xxiv o did a puff of titlegiving wind point out to man a more exalted goal enlarge the smallest faculty of mind or raise the simplest excellence of soul xxv did the loud heralds widelyswelling strain the pompous coat or coronetted crest talk down the madning anguish of a pain or hush a rising sorrow in the breast xxvi could this ennobling quality of kings eternal rounds of happiness bestow pluck out from guilt it is neverdying stings and purge the midnight murderer to snow xxvii then even the basest possibly might rise the boast and wonder of applauding times and heaven which saw the greatness of the prize look down perhaps in mercy on his crimes xxviii but when we see in pondring on the great the bloating glories of a monarchs breath can sooth no adverse circumstance of fate nor kindly steal a manacle on death xxix when the long scene of tinsel has been closed which through unnumberd ancestries has ran and left the mightiest of the high exposed to all the various miseries of man xxx when we behold him languidly oppressed on deaths pale couch all ghastly and declined or dragged before the godhead of his breast and damned to all the hells within his mind xxxi it is then thintrinsic emptiness of fame in all it is pomp of nothingness shall rise teach wisdoms cheek to redden at a name and virtues brow to furrow and despise xxxii titles  what are ye on your noblest strings however the weak or worthless may revere alas the proudest epithet of kings never struck like barnard on a british ear xxxiii where inbred honor happily is given in vain the stream of dignity is shed and sure it is treason at the bar of heaven to pour a glory on a rascals head xxxiv see low in earth where pultneys title lies that glittering gewgaw of a princes nod while barnard holds a patent from the skies and soars a deathless nobleman with god xxxv here thrones enwrapd in silence and amaze shall shrink to look so wonderfully high and fame herself be furnished with a gaze to crack the straining fibers of her eye xxxvi hear ye mad factions of the present race who wildly rage with discords dangerous brand and call a shameless enmity for place a generous struggle for your native land xxxvii but chiefly hear ye celebrated few who nobly sicken at a countrys groan and acting always from the whitest view have fought from honest principle alone xxxviii is there who glowing with a godlike pride for barnards crown would emulously start and spurn the farce of dignity aside to raise an empire on a nations heart xxxix let stareyd justice ever be his rule which all of self indignantly disowns and scorns as much to be a partys tool as crouch the servile sycophant of thrones xl it is not a blind ungovernable rage at every act which ministers avow that justly marks the savior of an age or binds a laurel round the patriot brow xli the keenest scourge that ever smote these climes at some nice crisis for their welfare stood and often the mere necessity of times has scared the ruthless tyrant into good  xlii though hapless afric at her fires exclaims while midday suns their blazing circuit hold yet the same orb that lights her into flames matures the latent mineral to gold xliii the parching natives of the baleful shore at eves glad summons dart themselves away and grasp transported at the dazzling ore though ripened solely by the burning day xliv just so the patriot of an honest zeal swift as the lightning vehemently wings and grasps each measure for the public weal without once thinking from what source it springs xlv but why of patriots idly do i rave  my inmost soul the modern herd disdains where every boaster has his turn of slave and vilely bawds to shackle us in chains xlvi loud as the leaders of our patriot band the public shout of liberty may claim yet base proscription blackens every hand and stabs a kingdom to preserve the game xlvii what boots the casual vehemence of soul that swells the freeborn whirlwind to the skies rings against general warrants at the pole and chills the stars with curses at excise xlviii if while the cause of liberty they plead our very patriots infamously fall and stoop themselves to consecrate a deed which drags the widest ruin on us all xlix what are the newborn sufferings of the hour if justice takes the balance in her hand to what the mean barbarity of power in brutal gameacts scatters round the land l stripped of his rights the farmer seeks the shade where silence kindly waits upon despair and mourns his sacred liberties betrayed that pampered wealth may trifle with a hare li to grief and rage alternately he yields nor sheds one grateful smile upon the morn a general ravage wastes his little fields and speaks some purseproud ruffian of the horn lii perhaps a bleeding monument he stands to strike his neighboring villagers with awe and smarts all scourged by legislative hands who greatly club to rob him of the law  liii but at our minors let him not exclaim nor turn to heaven his melancholy eyes a patriot sure may murder for the game who damns a general warrant and excise live weep not ye russian vassals at your state nor think your lot is singularly hard though marked through some severity of fate a kind of packhorse to your casual lord lv what though beneath the everlasting breeze with scarce a pittance of the meanest bread through lifes long round you miserably freeze and none ever find a shelter but the dead lvi yet fate in all it is bitterness was kind and showed some marks of tenderness and care bestowed a blessed unthinkingness of mind and gave a happy promptitude to bear lvii you can sit naked in the beating rain even while the north wind violently roars and seem regardless while the bellowing main in horror dashes round your dreary shores lviii you at a nod can prostitute a wife nor doubt the killing mandate to be just can calmly kneel and sacrifice a life to lick the foot that tramples you in dust  lix but britons formed of very different mould at every touch intuitively smart and greatly just as generously bold the smallest dagger pierces to the heart lx how then must britons murmur at their fate if candid sense decides upon the cause when even the mere amusements of the great can stab the vital essence of our laws lxi when even the hand of legislative rule which once stood guardian at distresss door extends the power of every wealthy fool and nobly makes it guilty to be poor lxii o for some curse executive as dread hot hissing instant from the starry throne to strike the villains execrable head that first destroyed our title to our own lxiii will no kind thunder pity the distressed and big with judgment mercifully roll to crush his more than prostituted breast to blast  his actual sodomy of soul lxiv ye patriot names  but why should i persist  it is vain with pride or avarice to contend  besides few barnards beam upon the list and all too like may pultney in the end lxv o pultney  but comparison is pain where barnards name we mention as divine and fancy only aggravates the stain which bath has thrown eternally on thine lxvi the praise of worlds in echo to the spheres the patriots brightest and his best reward and all that once could ravish on our ears is now absorbed in infamy and lord lxvii yet let us teach the ages still unborn with some indulgence kindly to decide and think that fate has cast thee out to scorn to lash each swelling arrogance of pride lxviii let us suppose thee graciously designed to give one moral lesson to the ball and teach the proudest of the human kind how soon the wisest and the mightiest fall lxix then on the wing of widely spreading fame some tender mark of pity may be thrown and those who blush the deepest at thy name turn back dismayed and tremble for their own finis
