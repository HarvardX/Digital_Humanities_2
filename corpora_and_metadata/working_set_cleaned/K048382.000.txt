a treatise of the plague being an instruction how one ought to act in relation i to apparel and lodging ii to diet iii to antidotes or preservatives iv to such medicines as are necessary to be made use of when any one shall be so unhappy as to be visited with the distemper   wherein is inserted a rare collection of a great many recipes of very valuable medicines made use of in the plague by the greatest physicians in the world and published for the general good of mankind especially the meaner sort  by eugenius philalethes jun  london printed for james holland at the bible and ball in st

to your grace the following pages he has very good reasons to believe they cannot shelter themselves under the protection of a patron more proper than the duke of montague   my lord i do not address my self now to a priest or a levite inured to shedding blood who insensible to the groans of a wounded traveller pass regardless by but i have the honor now to speak as to a good samaritan whose profession is to heal and yet as much as possible to conceal from the eye of the world his charities and benefactions  alas what signify those pompous mad buildings erected at vas expenses and richly founded i their poor inhabitants pass a tedous life in a splendid poverty or rather have the honor to d daily in places fit for monarch while those who ought to have the care of them luxuriously riot and grow fat on the very blood and vital marrow of the poor invalids  not so my noble lord is our profession a true believer will not reveal to any one his good works but to such only to whom it may belong does acts of charity in silence covers all with the profoundest secrecy and receives from within that sublime satisfaction which none but good men know this is what makes us truly great and truly noble this elevates us to the highest degrees of true glory and makes us equal with kings it is the most precious and most valuable jewel in the world a jewel of great price redder and more sparkling than the finest rubies more transparent than the purest crystal of the rock brighter than the sun shining in darkness and is the light of the world and the salt and fire of the universe  your grace who is master of so many illustrious qualities which make a man truly great knows the importance of this eternal truth and as you have hitherto practiced as well as speculated pursue your glorious enterprise do good to your poor brethren for we are children of the great one eternal god the lord and master of us all and especially if we should as we richly deserve it be visited with a contagious distemper exert your self remember the poor and take care to provide them with proper medicines the motto of the good samaritan is i cure and say nothing  i speak with the liberty of a lover of truth not as a mercenary dedicator who racks his brains to flatter his patron this philalethes never did nor will and i know your grace hates it as much as i do but while i presume to talk after this manner i have not the vanity to imagine i have said any thing that may inform your grace or tell you what you did not know before learned men hear sermons not to be instructed in what they knew as well as and sometimes perhaps better than the preachers but they consider them as so many seasonable remembrancers or like a faithful clock that warns his master of the hour of the day  in this light i hope your grace will consider philalethes you are the master and i the clock an automaton a movement moved by the first great spring and strikes accordingly  i am my lord with entire submission your graces true most obedient and most humble servant eugenius philalethes jun aug         a treatise of the plague eccles chapter vii v xiv in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider   if ever france had reason to be joyful she has as much reason now to consider the greatest adversity that ever could befall an unhappy people now involving some of her richest cities in the most inexpressive misery and woe when i talk after this manner every body knows i mean the plague which now rages with such invincible fury in its extreme parts and in all probability without a particular turn of providence must rage too in its very bowels and thus france once the terror of its neighbors is now become the object of their pity and commiseration alas how are the mighty fallen how unsearchable o thou one eternal being are thy counsels and thy ways past finding out  indeed human life is nothing but one continued series of miseries and we are born to trouble whic his as natural to befall us as for the sparks to fly upwards or to use the words of a modern in the  d vol of the penitential tables a work printed for j sackfield near lincolns inn see dedication to lady harpur author our life is checkered with misfortunes or rather it is a piece of mournful mosaic where the black far exceeds the white well then may we be allowed a little mirth in our short prosperities by the preacher when our long adversities furnish us with matter of so much consideration  the time of consideration is arrived adversities enough surround us through the unnatural ruin of our own once flourishing and glorious country and how far the dreadful calamity raging so furiously among our neighbors may reach us heaven only knows proximus ardet when the next house is on fire it requires all our serious consideration attention and application to prevent catching hold of our own  to do this we ought to make use of all the helps of nature and art and the rich who have means to procure both will not want all possible aid and care the poor and the middle sort are here as in all other cases to be the greatest sufferers it is for the sake of those i publish this small but i hope useful treatise  the physicians and apothecaries surely will not take this amiss it would be cruel to think so i know there are but two sorts of these the good and the bad the good will not and as for the bad those very few are not worth our notice  i am very well satisfied that there have come into the world a great many ingenious treatises relating to the plague but as they have been for the most part very speculative they have served rather to display the fine genius of their several authors than to be of any real use to mankind alas what avails it to know the nice definitions of a distemper its remote and proximate causes and a long jargon of particles effluvias insects and that infinite gallimatias of pestilential and pestiferous vehicles if i know not how to preserve my self from their contagion or rid my self of it when i am so unhappy as to labor under it what i shall do then in the following pages is in the plainest and most easy terms familiar to the meanest capacity to write what i have learnt in relation to that which may be serviceable to my reader concerning the plague which i am afraid i have too just fears will in all probability without a particular providence of the most high visit our already too wretched and undone country  but that i may not burden my readers memory and attention i shall as short as the nature of the thing will admit of present them with what are my sentiments hereupon and for order sake divide this little treatise into four heads or chapters  i the first relates to apparel or lodging ii the second to diet iii the third to antidotes or preservatives and iv the fourth to such medicines as are necessary to be made use of when any one shall be so unhappy as to be visited with the distemper chap i of apparel and diet though at all times we ought to abstain from all manner of excess yet chiefly ought we so to do in the time of pestilence especially from excess of outward and inward heat as that of the sun fire clothes and hot air all very pernicious this i call outward heat inward heat is such as proceeds from too much eating of salt and salted meats spices and all food of a strong and intense heat and all strong malt liquors and strong wines and spirits  violent exercises are also to be avoided such as provoke sweatings and particularly coition and all the passions of the mind one must likewise abstain from all repletion of meat and drink that is to rise from table without loading your stomach the other excess too is equally dangerous i mean too great a hunger and thirst a great deal of sleep especially at daytime is also to be carefully avoided as well as letting the body be too much bound up or costive thus much in general  as to apparel what is made of linen is certainly best thick woollens are apt to gather infections but silk and furs and stuffs made of hair are principally to be shunned because they very easily admit the contagious air and retain it a long while but above all let every body be particularly careful in being clean in their dress as well as lodging hangings are by no means to be allowed bare walls or plain unpainted wainscot are the best furniture these cannot be kept too fresh and clean  the frequent washings among the jews though they had something mystical in them and were a part of their religion were yet very conducive to health and in reality there can be no religion in being a sloven paupertatem and non sorditiem habitus diligit deus god loves the poverty not the slovenliness of a habit said st bernard of some dirty religious of his time the good old man thought there was no religion at all in being dirty or lousy  the first thing that is to be done in the morning by those that wear their hair is to comb it with an ivory comb forty times at least from the forehead toward the pole after that let them wash all the organs of the senses that is the eyes ears mouth tongue and teeth in short the whole face with pure water and they who wear wigs are to wash their head in like manner the eyes are not only to be washed but dipped or plunged into cold water and all the foulness removed from the eyelids with this cold water it is very necessary sometimes to mix rose water or fennelwater and good strong whitewine vinegar and after the neck is washed which must never be omitted let it be rubbed with a towel somewhat coarser than ordinary all this comforts the body makes the mind more lively and cheerful and preserves the sight  the gums and mouth ought to be particularly taken care to be washed and cleansed and especially the teeth to do which nothing is more proper than the following dentifrices or teethpowders viz  a cheap powder to cleanse the teeth take three dried eggshells of red coral three drams a small quantity of the threads of white silk burnt to ashes in a new earthen pot or pipkin cinnamon one dram cloves two drams pelitoryroot two drams  reduce all to a very fine powder and rub your teeth every night and morning washing them with cold water mixed with vinegar or rose water or both you may buy the red coral of the apothecary ready powdered  another take of red and white coral of each one ounce pelitoryroot mace and mastick of each an ounce of pumicestone and bole armoniack of each an ounce  reduce all to a very fine powder searsing the same through a tiffany searse as you should the former  purify your chamber and your clothes with clear fires made of juniper cypress pine or ashwood as also with frequent sprinklings of rose water and vinegar it is also very good to strew about your rooms sweet herbs and flowers as roses violets vineleaves pennyroyal thyme lavender and the like and frequently to make use of several kinds of odoriferous fumes to purge and purify the air and perfume your self and clothes and very often to wash your hands and face every day with water mixed with vinegar and rosewater and never go abroad without a piece of the root of dittany or zedoary or some candid spice in your mouth and a nosegay or some refreshing persume in your hand among which i recommend a little box of warhams apoplectick balsam made only at the golden ball in fisherstreet near redlyonsquare which is of wonderful efficacy and with which it is good to anoint or smear a little the temples eyebrows and nostrils and always just before you go out take a piece of bayleaf or orangepeel or juniper berries which being bruised and soaked in a little vinegar pour upon a red hot iron hold your head over the fumes receiving them into your mouth nostrils and every part of your body and clothes some will not go out without a little bunch of hyssop or rue which is very good  those who can take tobacco would do well to smoke a pipe in the morning the first thing they do dr evans of st johns college in oxford told me not long since that he designed tobacco should be his chief medicine whenever it should please god to visit us and that he would fume his chambers and clothes with nothing else which may be very good for those who are used to tobacco and i have been told that during the last sickness in london the tobacconists escaped the contagion  having mentioned several fumes and sweet waters i shall here give a receipt how to make those most useful which because they are cheap and easily made may probably be not much esteemed by some who love nothing but what is costly but i write for the general good  a receipt for an useful odoriferous sweetwater take of rose water and strong white wind that is good mountain or lisbon madera if you can conveniently have it of each an equal quantity of vinegar of roses a fourth part loaf sugar a third part which dissolve therein some add a little saffron which is certainly better  with this wash your hands face and joints as also your eyes and rince your teeth and sprinkle with it your linen and if you swallow down a little it would not be amiss but that you may not mistake the quantities of each i shall here give a particular receipt or recipe  take of the best vinegar of roses four ounces of rose water and the strongest and best flavourd white wind of each one pound that is of each a winchester pint of the best saffron one scruple of loafsugar to be dissolved in the liquor   or   ounces  another take a pint and a half of rose water in which half an ounce of cinnamon has steeped two days of mace one dram violet roots two drams of cloves half a dram nutmeg one dram all which having distilled add five grains of saffron  another more costly take of rose water three pints fresh lavender flowers well picked three handfulls fresh cloves and cinnamon of each half an ounce white violet roots two drams mace two drams dried rose leaves one handful gum benzoin vulgarly called benjamin two drams storax calamita two drams musk and amber two grains add to these an ounce of strong mountain wine set all being well mixed in a glass vessel well stopped in the sun for one month  sweet candles good against the plague and all pestilential distempers take of labdanum three ounces storax ten drams benzoin six drams frankincense half an ounce staechas two ounces damask roses three ounces cloves three ounces lemon peel and sandalum citrinum of each two drams juniper berries half an ounce musk and amber a sixth part of a dram charcoal half a pound finely powdered  let all these be mixed up with rose water and gum tragacanth and put over a fire till they are reduced into a paste of which make small candles and let them dry gently  how to make little sweet balls good also against infection take of storax and benzoin of each an ounce labdanum and mastick of each half an ounce cloves xyloaloes and sandalum citrinum of each one dram guinea pepper two drams with a little turpentine of which make little balls  these may be perfumed with six grains of musk and amber dissolved in oil of cloves  how to make sweet pastills take of gum benzoin two ounces cinnamon and xyloaloes or lignum aloes of each half an ounce storax one ounce fine sugar eight ounces musk sixteen grains dissolved in rose water all which mix up with an infusion of gum tragacanth in rose water  a rare curious receipt how to make other odoriferous pastills more rich and costly particularly made use of by the countess of arnsburg which i here insert as a very valuable rarity  take four ounces of white roses pull off the leaves to which after they have been well pounded in a mortar add two ounces of gum benzoin that has lain twenty four hours disselvd in rose water to these add of amber two grains musk one grain and the fourth part of a grain of civet mix these last well on a marble stone and then incorporate them with the roses  add to all half an ounce of the finest sugar let the whole being well ground together stay eight and forty hours stopped close up in a mortar out of which make your pastills but you must not forget to mix with it some gum tragacanth dissolved in rosewater and roll up every pastill in a little dragons blood that they may dry the sooner then wrap up every pastill in two rose leaves  but because burning of these candles balls and pastills must necessarily occasion smoke in the rooms where they are so burnt which may in some measure affect the head and lungs i would advise you to cast them into a silver dish or those who cannot have silver may make use of what they can get an earthen pipkin well glazed will do or a tin or pewter dish but by no means use brass or copper which set over a lamp or candle and the fumes will be more agreeable  this manner of fuming is frequent among the italians especially among persons of distinction who have generally one of these sweet pots fuming in a corner of their rooms  you may use any of the sweet waters abovementioned after this manner  i have been the longer on this head and have described the greater variety of receipts according to the variety of the season and my readers purses but for the poorer sort of all i shall give them a receipt which they may almost always make use of which is as follows  take a little white wine vinegar if you add rose water twill be the better which set over a lamp or candle when it begins to fume put in two or three bay leaves a few cloves a little cinnamon and mace all bruised and let all fume together a little seville orange peel or lemon peel makes it yet more agreeable  these fumes are excellent against all manner of pestilential infection and purify the air  and besides all these you must often wash your mouth with vinegar boiled up with rue and hyssop and especially when you cannot get any of these fumes though i think it will be almost an impossibility not to compass what i have last described but never be without a piece of zedoary which now and then you must chew especially when you go abroad  chap ii of diet it is very easy to describe what kind of diet should be used in such times of sickness but it is not so easy for all people to observe it i shall only say in general that such food as the appetite most delights in is the best and of consequence that which it does not care for ought to be avoided i do not speak here of a depraved appetite which has been ruined and debauched by luxury for there can be no rules prescribed for such at least what it will observe  the simpler and the more plain the diet is the better and here i could wish man had kept up to nature and followed what the great creator of all things had prescribed to the infant world and had still fed on that innocent food the fruits and herbs of the earth and milk and the golden productions of the industrious be then would his blood have flowed free from those noxious juices engendered from such a heterogeneous commixture of the spirits of so many thousand animals which an unbounded cruel luxury continually sacrifices and delights  before the flood men did not eat the flesh of animals and yet they lived much longer  the jewish law indeed in some measure indulged its followers in this respect but it must be remembered the bill of divorce was in like manner tolerated for the hardness of their hearts the flesh pots of egypt the french ragous of that time ran in their minds but a toleration is a quite different thing from an approbation and how many restrictions this toleration was attended with every one knows that looks into the bible the most delicious food was absolutely forbidden as swines flesh and all shell fish and the manner of dressing was such as required the utmost scrutiny in relation to the health of the animal and the blood as the life or soul was particularly prohibited  but the christian who has a better religion who professes to follow a suffering lord and selfdenying savior tyrannizes over the whole creation flies at all and without the least remorse or scruple devours things strangled and swallows blood though expressly forbidden in the same place with fornication in that which he owns to be written by inspiration and a law decreed by the holy ghost  the poor cow to instance no more after having fed families with her own dugs must by cruel ungrateful man be knocked on the head for all her good offices and at last devoured and the tender lamb just dropped from its mother true emblem of sweetest innocence be snatched kneeling at the teat and sacrificed to satisfy the appetite perhaps of a lewd harlot  it is true man is the lord of the creation so is a master of his family but what lord devours his own subjects or what father feasts upon his own children and servants  i could answer all the vain idle frivolous objections that have been raised against this unlawful practice of destroying the creation but my business is not to write of controversy but health and however novel this may seem to some i am sure its opposite is only an ancient inveterate error  and i am satisfied that men if they would or could abstain from eating the flesh of animals would find themselves much better in health for it is that dreadful mixture of the souls if i may say so of so many thousand animals destroyed to pamper one that raises that terrible war in the blood which has made it a prey to such distempers as have baffled the skill of the most learned physicians  let us cast our eyes toward india and we shall see the brachmans or bramins who never eat the flesh of animals and yet they live frequently to an hundred years of age  in italy there is a religious order called the camaldolese or monks of st romuald who look healthy and live long and by their profession they neither eat flesh nor fish  the monks of la trappe in france do the same this regimen of life renders the passions calm and quiet while your fleshdevourers are soon irritated immediately take fire and even in some sense participate of the nature of the brutes they feed on  and then how many delicacies may be made without the death of animals how many ways of dressing herbs and fruits with milk and cream sugar and honey and aromatic spices all the innocent luxury of pastry and confectionary may here be introduced  but because this evil came in by degrees so by degrees it must be extirpated and since it is impossible quite to forsake it at once we having derived from our parents a blood made up of these spirits i shall only advise my readers to make use of flesh diet as sparingly as possible especially in time of pestilence let them choose that sort that they know they can best digest and dress it thoroughly and that too after the plainest and most simple manner avoiding all rich soupes ragous fricasies a la royalles a la daubes or a la diables and all those heterogeneous gallican or rather egyptian slipslops which are poisonous and create such malignant juices in the blood which easily unite with the pestilential effluvia and become a proper fuel for the plague  broyling is undoubtedly the best way of dressing over a clear fire the meat being thoroughly first cleansed from all blood and moderately seasoned with salt for salt savours all things and the fire purifies all things  the next is roasting for the same reasons  boiling comes next which must be done with a large quantity of water that the meat may have room enough and as soon as the pot boils take off the cover that the steam may go up  frying and stewing are the worst of all unless the stew pan be uncovered and frying is not very wholesome because of the fat the meat must necessarily swim in which hinders the fire from passing through the meat and stewing unless there be a great deal of liquor is only a genteel name for frying  as to sauces or seasoning i recommend especially with fresh fish though indeed i do not approve of any fish in the time of contagion i say for sauces or seasonings i recommend tormentil dittany fennel dill gentian zedoary sanders never forgetting roses and also vinegar and vinegar of roses especially citron seville orange and lemon juices as also juice of sorrel verjuice juice of pomegranates and barberries for all acids or sours resist the pestilential poison for they are refreshing drying comfort and preserve however if they offend the breast qualify them with sugar if the stomach with a small quantity of pepper for pepper resists the putrefaction of the humors strengthens digestion and provided it be not ground too small but powdered a little that is just broken it helps the liver  besides these kinds of seasonings you should also use onions garlic saffron radishes succory capers pickled cucumbers samphire mangoes and all sorts of four pickles especially where there is garlic in the pickle  as for drink choose the best of its kind not too strong wine and malt liquor clear and well brewed now and then a cordial of epidemick water vulgarly called plaguewater and for varietysake treaclewater but all things in moderation  chap iii of antidotes or preservatives the next thing in order to be considered are antidotes or preservatives against pestilential infections in the first place i shall give a description of two amulets which being hung about the neck have an extraordinary virtue after that i shall give receipts how to make such medicines as inwardly taken have had also very good effects  take of white chrystalline arsenick two ounces of red one ounce  make of these two a little cake about an inch broad mixed up with the white of an egg or a mucilage of gum tragacanth that is with gum tragacanth dissolved in rose water till it be of the thickness of a jelly  let this cake be sewed up in a piece of clean linen cloth enclosed with silk and hung about the neck toward the heart  you need not put your shirt between for though arsenick taken inwardly be mortal not on account of any occult quality but its corrosive nature and so properly speaking is no poison yet being outwardly applied it resists every thing that is so  another take of sapphires emeralds hyacinths rubies red and white coral of each one dram of saffron a scruple of pearls half a dram white arsenick two drams ambergrease six grains dried iris roots half an ounce burnt hartshorn a dram orpiment half an ounce  grind all together and make a little bag to be sewed up in purple silk and hung about the neck as the former  an antidote to be taken inwardly take of dried wallnuts six ounces dried figs four ounces half an ounce of dried rueleaves of salt two drams  let all these be bruised and steeped in rosewater with an equal quantity of whitewine vinegar or juice of sorrel to which you may add half an ounce of juniper berries take the quantity of a chestnut of this preparation fasting it is an excellent preservative  another take of the best cinnamon half a dram zedoary one dram bole armoniack prepared three drams camphire seven grains seeds of lemons huskt that is the husks taken off of sorrel and lemon juice of each an ounce and a half roots of dittany tormentill and pimpernell half a dram ivory shavings and the bone of a deers heart of each a dram of elks hoof harts horn and amber of each half a dram  take of this mixed up with half an ounce of sorrel juice or any other eager juice the quantity of two beans fasting  this preservative electuary was used with good success by don priscian of corduba physician to pope leo x and recommended by the famous rantzovius  and these antidotes which follow have also been known to have great success  take of rose water vinegar of roses sorrelwater and mountain wine of each an equal quantity in which infuse of the powder of zedoary root lemon peel and bole armoniack of each an equal quantity to which add a little saffron and if you will some old conserve of roses put all into a glass bottle well stopped and keep it for your use of which take every morning and oftentimes a day a little quantity  this antidote is admirable for it hinders the putrefaction of the blood and humors and powerfully resists the pestilential poison  another take of the paste of pill ruffi which having dissolved in seven times its quantity of celadinewater or honey water which is better distill in the bath after having been steeped three days this is of wonderful efficacy being drank in a moderate quantity like the former  another excellent antidote take of the best venice treacle two ounces of the best myrrh three drams of the purest camphire two drams  mix all in a pint of rose water of which after having steeped it three days in glass vessels well sealed drink a little every morning  the electuary of nuts take of fat cartacs half a pound of rue half an ounce of green walnuts a quarter of a pound of sea salt a dram and a half  let all these be incorporated in a mortar with clarified honey or syrup of lemons of which take every morning fasting the quantity of a hazle nut with a small quantity of vinegar and rose water  i shall now give you another receipt of great virtue which is  the electuary of eggs take a new laid egg which after having taken out the white and cocks tread fill with the best powdered saffron then close the whole and burn it over a slow fire till it turn black then grind it in a mortar to which add its weight of seed of eruca or white mustard incorporate the whole very well  of this electuary take the quantity of a pea every morning with a little wine and rose water you may add to this if you will for it makes the composition much better white dittany and tormentill of each two drams nux vomica one dram separately powdered before you add them to the rest add also of the roots of pimpernell zedoary angelica and camphire and as much treacle as the weight of the whole  this electuary is not only an excellent antidote or preservative but is good when one is actually infected in order to cure the distemper to be given one dram with whitewine if the sickness begins with cold or with rose water or scabious water if with heat but it ought to be taken in twelve hours time after the beginning of the distemper  these are the best antidotes or preservatives against the plague which may be used with good success but by no means omit taking pill ruffi once or twice a week about the weight of a scruple in the morning without any other medicine  but if the season be very hot then let the aloes and myrrh which are in the composition of that pill be well washed in rose water and you may add of the best camphire a third part of the quantity of myrrh but in cold weather and in cold complexions the pill must be taken without these prepations of washing and camphire  besides as these pills are somewhat too opening it would be good in such cases to add to them a small quantity of bole armoniack or to roll them up in its powder and as sometimes they hurt the stomach this evil is to be corrected with a little mixture of the best mastick and a little venicetreacle or mithridate that is two or three scruples this is to be taken every ten days with a draught of rose water or sorrelwater  chap iv medicines to be made use of when any one is so unhappy as to be visited with the distemper when any one finds himself infected if age or strength permit let him be let blood as soon as possible then let the following medicine be immediately applied and the sooner the better because this distemper admits no delays after that let the following draught be immediately administered and repeated according to the strength of the patient  take of white onions six in number which open at the top and take out the heart or inside fill them with venice treacle mixed with a little powder of dittany root and tormentill put them into wet paper and roast them in the embers till they are soft then p part of them to the part affected for this being applied like a pultise to the boil is a sovereign medicine for drawing out the poison  take the remaining part of these onions so prepared and let them be bruised and mixed with syrup of lemons about an ounce and a little vinegar which squeeze through a straining cloth and give of this liquor lukewarm three ounces and let the patient be laid in a warm bed abstaining from meat and drink six hours and by all means take care of sleeping which is ever dangerous in this distemper  this medicine is very efficacious expelling by sweat the poisonous infection but if you add to this a small quantity of the abovementioned electuary of eggs it will be admirable  but if the patient be full of ill humors and not let blood or that it is not convenient to diminish the blood add a little opening medicine to this potion that is for the weaker sort half an ounce of trifera persica with one dram of the electuary of hamech for those of stronger constitutions instead of trifera add to the confection of hamech an equal quantity of the of conserve roses and the like of electuary of india and two drams of diafericon but in both cases give the potion hot or warm with scabious water rose water or vinegar  there are a great many other medicines which i purposely omit these being the soonest prepared the cheapest and most efficacious but the last and most excellent remedy for this evil is adams earth that is the first matter of our creation for this is the one and only medicine and greater than which cannot be nor will it be a little when purged by the artifice of fire and reduced to its simplicity by a congruous lotion but of this enough  he that has understanding to understand let him understand  finis postscript here follow some receipts that have been omitted in their proper places a rare preservative against the plague take wood sorrel and pick it from the stalk and pound it well in a stone mortar to every pound of beaten sorrel add a pound of fine beaten sugar and two ounces of mithridate or venice treacle which being well beaten up together keep it in pots for your use the dose is the quantity of a small wallnut  this is the famous dr butlers receipt made use of afterward by sir kenelm digby and his family who all of them escaped the plague  an excellent perfume against the plague take angelica roots and dry them a little in an oven or by the fire then bruise them very soft and lay them in wine vinegar to steep three or four days then heat a brick hot and lay some of it on every morning  this is excellent to air the house and clothes or to hold ones head over every morning fasting  a most admirable receipt against the plague take three pints of the best canary and boil in it sage and rue of each one handful till it come to about a quart then strain it and putting it over the fire again add to it a dram of long pepper and half an ounce of nutmegs all beaten together which having boiled about a quarter of an hour take it off and dissolve in it venice treacle and mithridate of each three quarters of an ounce and put to it a quarter of a pint of the best angelica water  take of this always warm both morning and evening a spoonful or two if infected if not one spoonful in the morning
