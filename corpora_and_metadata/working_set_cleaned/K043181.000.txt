their dramatic tour through switzerland have derived so considerable a share of their celebrity from your judicious guidance  and their author owes so much to your zealous friendship on all occasions that it were impossible to inscribe this opera to any other person than yourself without violating those feelings which have so invariably represented you as the object of his regard and esteem  i am dear sir very faithfully yours h b dudley bradwell lodge march  0      advertisement the story on which the following drama is founded however defective is not borrowed  various curtailments and transpositions of scenes have unavoidably deranged the unities of the piece for the convenience of stage representation several of the airs and all the choruses having been written to compiled music the critical reader will make a suitable indulgence for some irregular and uncouth numbers which he will necessarily meet with  the author has too high a sense of the zealous exertions of his whole dramatis personae to make any distinction in that general tribute of thanks which he gratefully pays to their united merit to mr shield he is indebted on this occasion for every thing that friendship

name the upstart in my presence  a creature without a coat of arms to his family   mr sidney but having honor and private worth i should have given him up with reluctance though he had been without a coat to his back   lady phil i think mr sidney you might pay a little more respect to the memory of my ancestors   mr sidney come come my lady philippa et us drop this subject or you will worry yourself about the antiquity of your ancestors till you grow as old as the best of em   lady phil very well sir  vastly well   mr sidney have i ever uttered a single emonstrance on our carriage being overloaded with your quarterings and scutcheons like a country hearse   lady phil i see through your cruel design sir  you intend to break my heart in a foreign country   mr sidney and did not i take the advertisement for your swiss valet to the newspaper with my own hands and procure you one to attend upon my person with whiskers as long as a pole cat   lady phil go on sir go on dishonor me through life and when i am no more persevere in your barbarity and let no family trophies follow me to my tomb   mr sidney oh my dear lady philippa  air ii  mr sidney when convinced by the deep sounding boum that in earnest you seek your long home for trifles i then will not cavil but resigned to my fate i will direct that in state on this journey you proudly may travel with a bim boum bell

fangled notions of false grandeur aside   lady phil looking minutely at the seal field sable three panthers passant gorged with ducal collars chained armed crested tufted and hoofed   mr sidney and horned too i suppose to complete the impression of modern heraldry   lady phil from some illustrious personage my life on it   daniel yes my lady i am sure by what his servant says he is a foreign lord at the least   lady phil and yet its rather singular that he should not know my name reads a mesdames  mesdames angloises opens it yes he must be a man of fashion for he writes i perceive in all the languages reads indistinctly comte friponi  les belles angloises  his devoirs in person  and chaperon them through geneva and its environs delightful friponi that is surely a very old name   mr sidney yes my lady one of the ancient families no doubt which the deluge had not time to sweep away this must be the fellow that i saw in close conference with our swiss aside   lady phil

dorimond as swiss valet cazelle yes my lady   lady phil give me the port feiulle that i may write an answer immediately  exit with swiss mr sidney travel so far from correcting seems but to increase her romantic malady this artificial weakness bears down all the amiable qualities of her nature and the infatuation if not checked will descend i fear even to the unaffected julia serious remonstrance has been of no avail the force of ridicule is my last resource and the object is too valuable to leave the most painful experiment untried for its recovery  enter sir leinster mloghlin sir lein what the devil mr sidney have you done to my lady philippa this morning yesterday she graciously told me she could find no blot in my scutcheon  now this minute she whisked as spitefully by me as a bullet

seriously when we can avoid it  julia has declared never to favor the addresses of any one without my approbation in no case therefore but that of extreme necessity shall a fathers authority control her inclination  the future happiness of her life will probably depend on her own choice  let the man of her heart then win her and wear her say i   sir lein my dear fellow give me your hand and is that what you say win her and wear her oh say no more only leave me alone for that  air iii  sir leinster mloghlin to win and to wear a sweet creature is always sir leinsters delight the first thing

part with you now as soon as you please for count friponi in his note has recommended to me an english guide who lives just at the foot of the mountain  though he knows but little of the man himself he is reckoned the cleverest creature in the world who can tell us every body and every thing   mr sidney an english guide recommended to you by a foreign count  there must be some mischief on foot aside   lady phil yes and dont you think this an act of great courtesy and condescension in a man of high family   mr sidney without doubt my everlasting love ruminating if such a device were practicable aside   lady phil what are you prosing about   mr sidney i am thinking my lady philippa that in my absence is it not possible that you may thus subject yourself to some imposition   lady phil imposition i know you deem me a weak creature show me the man mr sidney that can impose upon me   mr sidney its worth the experiment at all events aside but dont you perceive that this will be an unnecessary increase of your expenses   lady phil poh what signifies expense when the honor of a family is concerned the larger the suite you know the more dignified besides he will be a better interpreter than cazelle the swiss who is far too reserved   mr sidney i should be sorry to withhold my consent even in    lady phil your consent now mr sidney you have made it an object of too much importance for me to dispense with  so have him i will and there is an end of it   mr sidney then all i have to do is i suppose as usual to acquiesce   lady phil to be sure  exit mr sidney well said my lady philippa musing there can be no great difficulty in defeating the probable rascalities of the count who from what i can learn of our landlord is little better than a desperado after all  this same guide intended no doubt for some secret service of that fashionable impostor may with a little dexterity be managed so as to answer a better purpose of mine   i shall satisfy myself at least whether the regard she pays to other opinions in preference to mine be a turn toward natural depravity or merely the coquettish folly of family pride if only the affection of vice she may yet be shamed out of it  should it prove worse the painful alternative my own honor must suggest  who knows but i may be received as her guide by stratagem though refused it through life on the score of long tried affection   i remember to have enacted davus before the grave dons of westminster with tolerable success   how shall i manage my voice but there can be no great difficulty in that for lady philippa has paid too little regard to its natural key to be struck with it under any disguise it may now assume  exit scene iii  castle gardens enter miss somerville air iv ever let me shun the

unperceived by miss somerville miss some this completes the first year of my selfbanishment from an object which i find is still dearer to me even than my country how devoted is that affection which neither time can alter nor distance remove in vain have i endeavored to reproach my own heart for permitting me to fly from all it values oh dalton if i still beheld thee at the feet of another my pride would take the same alarm and again inform thee that i must dispense with those addresses which i owed more to my fortune than my person had i wronged him by a groundless suspicion he could not have withdrawn himself with that cold respect without attempting the smallest explanation of his conduct though my mind approves the sacrifice it has made it cannot recollect it with indifference  perusing a letter she had written that enquiry after dalton will betray a womanly weakness to others and a want of resolution to myself  it must not be draws her pen through a passage folds up and

only the daughter of mr sidney   julia a distinction my lady sufficiently honorable in my mind i can assure you   lady phil in a word no more love fits  you must know i expect an immediate visit from a count friponi who is said to be rather a polished creature   julia probably he may   lady phil with a something so easy in his address and familiar at first sight that i thought it necessary to put you on your guard  besides should you think to find a wealthy admirer on the continent which was probably your fathers object in coming abroad you will both be much disappointed believe me   air viii
