essays for young ladies  essays on various subjects principally designed for young ladies  as for you i shall advise you in a few words aspire only to those virtues that are peculiar to your sex follow your natural modesty and think it your greatest commendation not to be talked of one way or the other oration of pericles to the athenian women london printed for j wilkie in st pauls churchyard and t cadell in the strand  mdcclxxvii  to mrs montagu madam if you were only one of the finest writers of your time you would probably have escaped the trouble of this address which is drawn on you less by the luster of your understanding than by the amiable qualities of your heart  as the following pages are written with an humble but earnest wish to promote the interests of virtue as far as the very limited abilities of the author allow there is i flatter myself a peculiar propriety in inscribing them to you madam who while your works convey instruction and delight to the bestinformed of the other sex furnish by your conduct an admirable pattern of life and manners to your own and i can with truth remark that those graces of conversation which would be the first praise of almost any other character constitute but an inferior part of yours  i am madam with the highest esteem your most obedient humble servant hannah more bristol may  0      contents introduction page

on wit page     introduction it is with the utmost diffidence that the following pages are submitted to the inspection of the public yet however the limited abilities of the author may have prevented her from succeeding to her wish in the execution of her present attempt she humbly trusts that the uprightness of her intention will procure it a candid and favorable reception the following little essays are chiefly calculated for the younger part of her own sex who she flatters herself will not esteem them the less because they were written immediately for their service she by no means pretends to have composed a regular system of morals or a finished plan of conduct she has only endeavored to make a few remarks on such circumstances as seemed to her susceptible of some improvement and on such subjects as she imagined were particularly interesting to young ladies on their first introduction into the world she hopes they will not be offended if she has occasionally pointed out certain qualities and suggested certain tempers and dispositions as peculiarly feminine and hazarded some observations which naturally arose from the subject on the different characters which mark the sexes and here again she takes the liberty to repeat that these distinctions cannot be too nicely maintained for besides those important qualities common to both each sex has its respective appropriated qualifications which would cease to be meritorious the instant they ceased to be appropriated nature propriety and custom have prescribed certain bounds to each bounds which the prudent and the candid will never attempt to break down and indeed it would be highly impolitic to annihilate distinctions from which each acquires excellence and to attempt innovations by which both would be losers  women therefore never understand their own interests so little as when they affect those qualities and accomplishments from the want of which they derive their highest merit the porcelain clay of human kind says an admired writer speaking of the sex greater delicacy evidently implies greater fragility and this weakness natural and moral clearly points out the necessity of a superior degree of caution retirement and reserve  if the author may be allowed to keep up the allusion of the poet just quoted she would ask if we do not put the finest vases and the costliest images in places of the greatest security and most remote from any probability of accident or destruction by being so situated they find their protection in their weakness and their safety in their delicacy this metaphor is far from being used with a design of placing young ladies in a trivial unimportant light it is only introduced to insinuate that where there is more beauty and more weakness there should be greater circumspection and superior prudence  men on the contrary are formed for the more public exhibitions on the great theater of human life like the stronger and more substantial wares they derive no injury and lose no polish by being always exposed and engaged in the constant commerce of the world it is their proper element where they respire their natural air and exert their noblest powers in situations which call them into action they were intended by providence for the bustling scenes of life to appear terrible in arms useful in commerce shining in counsels  the author fears it will be hazarding a very bold remark in the opinion of many ladies when she adds that the female mind in general does not appear capable of attaining so high a degree of perfection in science as the male yet she hopes to be forgiven when she observes also that as it does not seem to derive the chief portion of its excellence from extraordinary abilities of this kind it is not at all lessened by the imputation of not possessing them it is readily allowed that the sex have lively imaginations and those exquisite perceptions of the beautiful and defective which come under the denomination of taste but pretensions to that strength of intellect which is requisite to penetrate into the abstruser walks of literature it is presumed they will readily relinquish there are green pastures and pleasant valleys where they may wander with safety to themselves and delight to others they may cultivate the roses of imagination and the valuable fruits of morals and criticism but the steeps of parnassus sew comparatively have attempted to scale with success and when it is considered that many languages and many sciences must contribute to the perfection of poetical composition it will appear less strange the lofty epic the pointed satire and the more daring and successful slights of the tragic muse seem reserved for the bold adventurers of the other sex  nor does this assertion it is apprehended at all injure the interests of the women they have other pretensions on which to value themselves and other qualties much better calculated to answer their particular purposes we are enamoured of the soft strains of the sicilian and the mantuan muse while to the sweet notes of the pastoral reed they sing the contentions of the shepherds the blessings of love or the innocent delights of rural life has it ever been ascribed to them as a defect that their eclogues do not treat of active scenes of busy cities and of wasting war no their simplicity is their perfection and they are only blamed when they have too little of it  on the other hand the lofty bards who strung their bolder harps to higher measures and sung the wrath of peleus son and mans first disobedience have never been censured for want of sweetness and refinement the sublime the nervous and the masculine characterise their compositions as the beautiful the soft and the delicate mark those of the others grandeur dignity and force distinguish the one species ease simplicity and purity the other both shine from their native distinct unborrowed merits not from those which are foreign adventitious and unnatural yet those excellencies which make up the essential and constituent parts of poetry they have in common  women have generally quicker perceptions men have juster sentiments  women consider how things may be prettily said men how they may be properly said  in women young ones at least speaking accompanies and sometimes precedes reflection in men reflection is the antecedent  women speak to shine or to please men to convince or confute  women admire what is brilliant men what is solid  women prefer an extemporaneous sally of wit or a sparkling effusion of fancy before the most accurate reasoning or the most laborious investigation of facts in literary composition women are pleased with point turn and antithesis men with observation and a just deduction of effects from their causes  women are fond of incident men of argument  women admire passionately men approve cautiously  one sex will think it betrays a want of feeling to be moderate in their applause the other will be afraid of exposing a want of judgment by being in raptures with any thing  men refuse to give way to the emotions they actually feel while women sometimes affect to be transported beyond what the occasion will justify  as a farther confirmation of what has been advanced on the different bent of the understanding in the sexes it may be observed that we have heard of many female wits but never of one female logician  of many admirable writers of memoirs but never of one chronologer  in the boundless and aerial regions of romance and in that fashionable species of composition which succeeded it and which carries a nearer approximation to the manners of the world the women cannot be excelled this imaginary soil they have a peculiar talent for cultivating because here invention labors more and judgment less  the merit of this kind of writing consists in the vraisemblance to real life as to the events themselves with a certain elevation in the narrative which places them if not above what is natural yet above what is common it farther consists in the art of interesting the tender feelings by a pathetic representation of those minute endearing domestic circumstances which take captive the soul before it has time to shield itself with the armor of reflection to amuse rather than to instruct or to instruct indirectly by short inferences drawn from a long concatenation of circumstances is at once the business of this sort of composition and one of the characteristics of female genius the author does not apprehend it makes against her general position that this nation can boast a female critic poet historian linguist philosopher and moralist equal to most of the other sex to these particular instances others might be adduced but it is presumed that they only stand as exceptions against the rule without tending to invalidate the rule itself   in short it appears that the mind in each sex has some natural kind of bias which constitutes a distinction of character and that the happiness of both depends in a great measure on the preservation and observance of this distinction for where would be the superior pleasure and satisfaction resulting from mixed conversation if this difference were abolished if the qualities of both were invariably and exactly the same no benefit or entertainment would arise from the tedious and insipid uniformity of such an intercourse whereas considerable advantages are reaped from a select society of both sexes the rough angles and asperities of male manners are imperceptibly filed and gradually worn smooth by the polishing of female conversation and the refining of female taste while the ideas of women acquire strength and solidity by their associating with sensible intelligent and judicious men  on the whole even if fame be the object of pursuit is it not better to succeed as women than to fail as men to shine by walking honorably in the road which nature custom and education seem to have marked out rather than to counteract them all by moving awkwardly in a path diametrically opposite to be good originals rather than bad imitators in a word to be excellent women rather than indifferent men  on dissipation doglie certe allegrezze incerte petrarca as an argument in favor of modern manners it has been pleaded that the softer vices of luxury and dissipation belong rather to gentle and yielding tempers than to such as are rugged and ferocious that they are vices which increase civilization and tend to promote refinement and the cultivation of humannity  but this is an assertion the truth of which the experience of all ages contradicts nero was not less a tyrant for being a fiddler he the emperor caligula who wished the whole roman people had but one neck that he might dispatch them at a blow was himself the most debauched man in rome and sydney and russel were condemned to bleed under the most barbarous though most dissipated and voluptuous reign that ever disgraced the annals of britain  the love of dissipation is i believe allowed to be the reigning evil of the present day it is an evil which many content themselves with regretting without seeking to redress a dissipated life is censured in the very act of dissipation and prodigality of time is as gravely declaimed against at the card table as in the pulpit  the lover of dancing censures the amusements of the theater for their dullness and the gamester blames them both for their levity she whose whole soul is swallowed up in  opera extacies is astonished that her acquaintance can spend whole nights in preying like harpies on the fortunes of their fellow creatures while the grave sober sinner who passes her pale and anxious vigils in this fashionable sort of pillaging is no less surprised how the other can waste her precious time in hearing sounds for which she has no taste in a language she does not understand  in short every one seems convinced that the evil so much complained of does really exist somewhere though all are inwardly persuaded that it is not with themselves all desire a general reformation but few will listen to proposals of particular amendment the body must be restored but each limb begs to remain as it is and accusations which concern all will be likely to affect none they think that sin like matter is divisible and that what is scattered among so many cannot materially affect any one and thus individuals contribute separately to that evil which they in general lament  the prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware or are willing to allow on the conduct of the women this is one of the principal hinges on which the great machine of human society turns those who allow the influence which female graces have in contributing to polish the manners of men would do well to reflect how great an influence female morals must also have on their conduct how much then is it to be regretted that the british ladies should ever sit down contented to polish when they are able to reform to entertain when they might instruct and to dazzle for an hour when they are candidates for eternity  under the dispensation of mahomets law indeed these mental excellencies cannot be expected because the women are shut out from all opportunities of instruction and excluded from the endearing pleasures of a delightful and equal society and as a charming poet sings are taught to believe that for their inferior natures formed to delight and happy by delighting heaven has reserved no future paradise but bids them rove the paths of bliss secure of total death and careless of hereaster irene  these act consistently in studying none but exterior graces in cultivating only personal attractions and in trying to lighten the intolerable burden of time by the most frivolous and vain amusements they act in consequence of their own blind belief and the tyranny of their despotic masters for they have neither the freedom of a present choice nor the prospect of a future being  but in this land of civil and religious liberty where there is as little despotism exercised over the minds as over the persons of women they have every liberty of choice and every opportunity of improvement and how greatly does this increase their obligation to be exemplary in their general conduct attentive to the government of their families and instrumental to the good order of society  she who is at a loss to find amusements at home can no longer apologize for her dissipation abroad by saying she is deprived of the benefit and the pleasure of books and she who regrets being doomed to a state of dark and gloomy ignorance by the injustice or tyranny of the men complains of an evil which does not exist  it is a question frequently in the mouths of illiterate and dissipated females  what good is there in reading to what end does it conduce it is however too obvious to need insisting on that unless perverted as the best things may be reading answers many excellent purposes beside the great leading one and is perhaps the safest remedy for dissipation she who dedicates a portion of her leisure to useful reading feels her mind in a constant progressive state of improvement whilst the mind of a dissipated woman is continually losing ground an active spirit rejoiceth like the sun to run his daily course while indolence like the dial of ahaz goes backwards the advantages which the understanding receives from polite literature it is not here necessary to enumerate its effects on the moral temper is the present object of consideration the remark may perhaps be thought too strong but i believe it is true that next to religious influences an habit of study is the most probable preservative of the virtue of young persons those who cultivate letters have rarely a strong passion for promiscuous visiting or dissipated society study therefore induces a relish for domestic life the most desirable temper in the world for women study as it rescues the mind from an inordinate fondness for gaming dress and public amusements is an oeconomical propensity for a lady may read at much less expense than she can play at cards as it requires some application it gives the mind an habit of industry as it is a relief against that mental disease which the french emphatically call ennui it cannot fail of being beneficial to the temper and spirits i mean in the moderate degree in which ladies are supposed to use it as an enemy to indolence it becomes a social virtue as it demands the full exertion of our talents it grows a rational duty and when directed to the knowledge of the supreme being and his laws it rises into an act of religion  the rage for reformation commonly shows itself in a violent zeal for suppressing what is wrong rather than in a prudent attention to establish what is right but we shall never obtain a fair garden merely by rooting up weeds we must also plant flowers for the natural richness of the soil we have been clearing will not suffer it to lie barren but whether it shall be vainly or beneficially prolific depends on the culture what the present age has gained on one side by a more enlarged and liberal way of thinking seems to be lost on the other by excessive freedom and unbounded indulgence knowledge is not as heretofore confined to the dull cloister or the gloomy college but disseminated to a certain degree among both sexes and almost all ranks the only misfortune is that these opportunities do not seem to be so wisely improved or turned to so good an account as might be wished books of a pernicious idle and frivolous sort are too much multiplied and it is from the very redundancy of them that true knowledge is so scarce and the habit of dissipation so much increased  it has been remarked that the prevailing character of the present age is not that of gross immorality but if this is meant of those in the higher walks of life it is easy to discern that there can be but little merit in abstaining from crimes which there is but little temptation to commit it is however to be feared that a gradual defection from piety will in time draw after it all the bad consequences of more active vice for whether mounds and fences are suddenly destroyed by a sweeping torrent or worn away through gradual neglect the effect is equally destructive as a rapid fever and a consuming hectic are alike fatal to our natural health so are flagrant immorality and torpid indolence to our moral wellbeing  the philosophical doctrine of the slow recession of bodies from the sun is a lively image of the reluctance with which we first abandon the light of virtue the beginning of folly and the first entrance on a dissipated life cost some pangs to a well disposed heart but it is surprising to she how soon the progress ceases to be impeded by reflection or slackened by remorse for it is in moral as in natural things the motion in minds as well as bodies is accelerated by a nearer approach to the center to which they are tending if we recede slowly at first setting out we advance rapidly in our future course and to have begun to be wrong is already to have made a great progress  a constant habit of amusement relaxes the tone of the mind and renders it totally incapable of application study or virtue dissipation not only indisposes it votaries to every thing useful and excellent but disqualifies them for the enjoyment of pleasure itself it softens the soul so much that the most superficial employment becomes a labor and the slightest inconvenience an agony the luxurious sybarite must have lost all sense of real enjoyment and all relish for true gratification before he complained that he could not sleep because the rose leaves lay double under him  luxury and dissipation soft and gentle as their approaches are and silently as they throw their silken chains about the heart enslave it more than the most active and turbulent vices the mightiest conquerors have been conquered by these unarmed foes the flowery fetters are fastened before they are felt the blandishments of circe were more fatal to the mariners of ulysses than the strength of polypheme or the brutality of the laestrigons hercules after he had cleansed the augean stable and performed all the other labors enjoined him by euristheus found himself a slave to the softnesses of the heart and he who wore a club and a lions skin in the cause of virtue condescended to the most effeminate employments to gratify a criminal weakness hannibal who vanquished mighty nations was himself overcome by the love of pleasure and he who despised cold and want and danger and death on the alps was conquered and undone by the dissolute indulgences of capua  before the hero of the most beautiful and virtuous romance that ever was written i mean telemachus landed on the island of cyprus he unfortunately lost his prudent companion mentor in whom wisdom is so finely personisied at sirst he beheld with horror the wanton and dissolute manners of the voluptuous inhabitants the ill effects of their example were not immediate he did not fall into the commission of glaring enormities but his virtue was secretly and imperceptibly undermined his heart was softened by their pernicious society and the nerve of resolution was slackened he every day beheld with diminished indignation the worship which was offered to venus the disorders of luxury and profaneness became less and less terrible and the infectious air of the country enfeebled his courage and relaxed his principles in short he had ceased to love virtue long before he thought of committing actual vice and the duties of a manly piety were burdensome to him before he was so debased as to offer perfumes and burn incense on the altar of the licentious goddess nothing can be more admirable than the manner in which this allegory is conducted and the whole work not to mention its images machinery and other poetical beautics is written in the very sinest strain of morality in this latter respect it is evidently superior to the works of the ancients the moral of which is frequently tainted by the grossness of their mythology something of the purity of the christian religion may be discovered even in fenelons heathens and they catch a tincture of piety in passing through the hands of that amiable prelate   let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they be withered said solomons libertine alas he did not reflect that they withered in the very gathering the roses of pleasure seldom last long enough to adorn the brow of him who plucks them for they are the only roses which do not retain their sweetness after they have lost their beauty  the heathen poets often pressed on their readers the necessity of considering the shortness of life as an incentive to pleasure and voluptuousness lest the season for indulging in them should pass unimproved the dark and uncertain notions not to say the absolute disbelief which they entertained of a future state is the only apology that can be offered for this reasoning but while we censure their tenets let us not adopt their errors errors which would be infinitely more inexcusable in us who from the clearer views which revelation has given us shall not have their ignorance or their doubts to plead it were well if we availed ourselves of that portion of their precept which inculcates the improvement of every moment of our time but not like them to dedicate the moments so redeemed to the pursuit of sensual and perishable pleasures but to the securing of those which are spiritual in their nature and eternal in their duration  if indeed like the miserable the struldbrugs see voyage to laputa beings imagined by swift with a view to cure us of the irrational desire after immoderate length of days we were condemned to a wretched earthly immortality we should have an excuse for spending some portion of our time in dissipation as we might then pretend with some color of reason that we proposed at a distant period to enter on a better course of action or if we never formed any such resolution it would make no material difference to beings whose state was already unalterably fixed but of the scanty portion of days assigned to our lot not one should be lost in weak and irresolute procrastination  those who have not yet determined on the side of vanity who like hercules before he knew the queen of lydia and had learnt to spin have not resolved on their choice between virtue and pleasure may reflect that it is still in their power to imitate that hero in his noble choice and in his virtuous rejection they may also reflect with grateful triumph that christianity furnishes them with a better guide than the tutor of alcides and with a surer light than the doctrines of pagan philosophy  it is far from my design severely to condemn the innocent pleasures of life i would only beg leave to observe that those which are criminal should never be allowed and that even the most innocent will by immoderate use soon cease to be so  the women of this country were not sent into the world to shun society but to embellish it they were not designed for wilds and solitudes but for the amiable and endearing offices of social life they have useful stations to fill and important characters to sustain they are of a religion which does not impose penances but enjoins duties a religion of perfect purity but of perfect benevolence also a religion which does not condemn its followers to indolent seclusion from the world but assigns them the more dangerous though more honorable province of living uncorrupted in it in fine a religion which does not direct them to fly from the multitude that they may do nothing but which positively forbids them to follow a multitude to do evil  thoughts on conversation it has been advised and by very respectable authorities too that in conversation women should carefully conceal any knowledge or learning they may happen to possess i own with submission that i do not see either the necessity or propriety of this advice for if a young lady has that discretion and modesty without which all knowledge is little worth she will never make an ostentatious parade of it because she will rather be intent on acquiring more than on displaying what she has  i am at a loss to know why a young female is instructed to exhibit in the most advantageous point of view her skill in music her singing dancing taste in dress and her acquaintance with the most fashionable games and amusements while her piety is to be anxiously concealed and her knowledge affectedly disavowed lest the former should draw on her the appellation of an enthusiast or the latter that of a pedant  in regard to knowledge why should she for ever affect to be on her guard lest she should be found guilty of a small portion of it she need be the less solicitous about it as it seldom proves to be so very considerable as to excite astonishment or admiration for after all the acquisitions which her talents and her studies have enabled her to make she will generally speaking be found to have less of what is called learning than a common schoolboy  it would be to the last degree presumptuous and absurd for a young woman to pretend to give the ton to the company to interrupt the pleasure of others and her own opportunity of improvement by talking when she ought to listen or to introduce subjects out of the common road in order to show her own wit or expose the want of it in others but were the sex to be totally silent when any topic of literature happens to be discussed in their presence conversation would lose much of its vivacity and society would be robbed of one of its most interesting charms  how easily and effectually may a wellbred woman promote the most useful and elegant conversation almost without speaking a word for the modes of speech are scarcely more variable than the modes of silence the silence of listless ignorance and the silence of sparkling intelligence are perhaps as separately marked and as distinctly expressed as the same feelings could have been by the most unequivocal language a woman in a company where she has the least influence may promote any subject by a profound and invariable attention which shows that she is pleased with it and by an illuminated countenance which proves she understands it this obliging attention is the most flattering encouragement in the world to men of sense and letters to continue any topic of instruction or entertainment they happen to be engaged in it owed its introduction perhaps to accident the best introduction in the world for a subject of ingenuity which though it could not have been formally proposed without pedantry may be continued with ease and good humor but which will be frequently and effectually stopped by the listlessness inattention or whispering of silly girls whose weariness betrays their ignorance and whose impatience exposes their illbreeding a polite man however deeply interested in the subject on which he is conversing catches at the slightest hint to have done a look is a sufficient intimation and if a pretty simpleton who sits near him seems distraite he puts an end to his remarks to the great regret of the reasonable part of the company who perhaps might have gained more improvement by the continuance of such a conversation than a weeks reading would have yielded them for it is such company as this that give an edge to each others wit as iron sharpeneth iron  that silence is one of the great arts of conversation is allowed by cicero himself who says there is not only an art but even an eloquence in it and this opinion is confirmed by a great modern lord bacon  in the following little anecdote from one of the ancients  when many grecian philosophers had a solemn meeting before the ambassador of a foreign prince each endeavored to show his parts by the brilliancy of his conversation that the ambassador might have something to relate of the grecian wisdom one of them offended no doubt at the loquacity of his companions observed a profound silence when the ambassador turning to him asked but what have you to say that i may report it he made this laconic but very pointed reply tell your king that you have found one among the greeks who knew how to be silent  there is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than knowledge  this is wit the most captivating but the most dreaded of all talents the most dangerous to those who have it and the most feared by those who have it not though it is against all the rules yet i cannot find in my heart to abuse this charming quality he who is grown rich without it in safe and sober dullness shuns it as a disease and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant the moralist declaims against it as the source of irregularity and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy itself for he considers it as the parent of extravagance and beggary the cynic will ask of what use it is of very little perhaps no more is a flower garden and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amusement and delightful recreation a woman who possesses this quality has received a most dangerous present perhaps not less so than beauty itself especially it it be not sheathed in a temper peculiarly inoffensive chastised by a most correct judgment and restrained by more prudence than falls to the common lot  this talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge for as wit is the immediate property of its possessor and learning is only an acquaintance with the knowledge of other people there is much more danger that we should be vain of what is our own than of what we borrow  but wit like learning is not near so common a thing as is imagined let not therefore a young lady be alarmed at the acuteness of her own wit any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge the great danger is lest she should mistake pertness flippancy or imprudence for this brilliant quality or imagine she is witty only because she is indiscreet this is very frequently the case and this makes the name of wit so cheap while its real existence is so rare  lest the flattery of her acquaintance or an overweening opinion of her own qualifications should lead some vain and petulant girl into a false notion that she has a great deal of wit when she has only a redundancy of animal spirits she may not find it useless to attend to the definition of this quality by one who had as large a portion of it as most individuals could ever boast it is not a tale it is not a jest admired with laughter at a feast nor florid talk which can that title gain the prooss of wit for ever must remain neither can that have any place at which a virgin hides her face such dross the fire must purge away it is just the author blush there where the reader must cowley  but those who actually possess this rare talent cannot be too abstinent in the use of it it often makes admirers but it never makes friends i mean where it is the predominant feature and the unprotected and defenseless state of womanhood calls for friendship more than for admiration she who does not desire friends has a sordid and insensible soul but she who is ambitious of making every man her admirer has an invincible vanity and a cold heart  but to dwell only on the side of policy a prudent woman who has established the reputation of some genius will sufficiently maintain it without keeping her faculties always on the stretch to say good things nay if reputation alone be her object she will gain a more solid one by her forbearance as the wiser part of her acquaintance will ascribe it to the right motive which is not that she has less wit but that she has more judgment  the fatal fondness for indulging a spirit of ridicule and the injurious and irreparable consequences which sometimes attend the too prompt reply can never be too seriously or too severely condemned not to offend is the first step toward pleasing to give pain is as much an offense against humanity as against good breeding and surely it is as well to abstain from an action because it is sinful as because it is unpolite in company young ladies would do well before they speak to reflect if what they are going to say may not distress some worthy person present by wounding them in their persons families connexions or religious opinions if they find it will touch them in either of these i should advise them to suspect that what they were going to say is not so very good a thing as they at first imagined nay if even it was one of those bright ideas which venus has imbued with a fifth part of her nectar so much greater will be their merit in suppressing it if there was a probability it might offend indeed if they have the temper and prudence to make such a previous reflection they will be more richly rewarded by their own inward triumph at having suppressed a lively but severe remark than they could have been with the dissembled applauses of the whole company who with that complaisant deceit which good breeding too much authorizes affect openly to admire what they secretly resolve never to forgive  i have always been delighted with the story of the little girls eloquence in one of the childrens tales who received from a friendly fairy the gift that at every word she uttered pinks roses diamonds and pearls should drop from her mouth the hidden moral appears to be this that is was the sweetness of her temper which produced this pretty fanciful effect for when her malicious sister desired the same gift from the good natured tiny intelligence the venom of her own heart converted it into poisonous and loathsome reptiles  a man of sense and breeding will sometimes join in the laugh which has been raised at his expense by an illnatured repartee but if it was very cutting and one of those shocking sort of truths which as they can scarcely be pardoned even in private ought never to be uttered in public he does not laugh because he is pleased but because he wishes to conceal how much he is hurt as the sarcasm was uttered by a lady so far from seeming to resent it he will be the first to commend it but notwithstanding that he will remember it as a trait of malice when the whole company shall have forgotten it as a stroke of wit women are so far from being privileged by their sex to say unhandsome or cruel things that it is this very circumstance which renders them more intolerable when the arrow is lodged in the heart it is no relief to him who is wounded to reflect that the hand which shot it was a fair one  many women when they have a favorite point to gain or an earnest wish to bring any one over to their opinion often use a very disingenuous method they will state a case ambiguously and then avail themselves of it in whatever manner shall best answer their purpose leaving your mind in a state of indecision as to their real meaning while they triumph in the perplexity they have given you by the unfair conclusions they draw from premises equivocally stated they will also frequently argue from exceptions instead of rules and are astonished when you are not willing to be contented with a prejudice instead of a reason  in a sensible company of both sexes where women are not restrained by any other reserve than what their natural modesty imposes and where the intimacy of all parties authorizes the utmost freedom of communication should any one inquire what were the general sentiments on some particular subject it will i believe commonly happen that the ladies whose imaginations have kept pace with the narration have anticipated its end and are ready to deliver their sentiments on it as soon as it is finished while some of the male hearers whose minds were busied in settling the propriety comparing the circumstances and examining the consistencies of what was said are obliged to pause and discriminate before they think of answering nothing is so embarrassing as a variety of matter and the conversation of women is often more perspicuous because it is less labored  a man of deep reflection if he does not keep up an intimate commerce with the world will be sometimes so entangled in the intricacies of intense thought that he will have the appearance of a confused and perplexed expression while a sprightly woman will extricate herself with that lively and rash dexterity which will almost always please though it is very far from being always right it is easier to confound than to convince an opponent the former may be effected by a turn that has more happiness than truth in it many an excellent reasoner well skilled in the theory of the schools has felt himself discomfited by a reply which though as wide of the mark and as foreign to the question as can be conceived has disconcerted him more than the most startling proposition or the most accurate chain of reasoning could have done and he has borne the laugh of his fair antagonist as well as of the whole company though he could not but feel that his own argument was attended with the fullest demonstration so true is it that it is not always necessary to be right in order to be applauded  but let not a young ladys vanity be too much elated with this false applause which is given not to her merit but to her sex she has not perhaps gained a victory though she may be allowed a triumph and it should humble her to reflect that the tribute is paid not to her strength but her weakness it is worth while to discri minate between that applause which is given from the complaisance of others and that which is paid to our own merit  where great sprightliness is the natural bent of the temper girls should endeavor to habituate themselves to a custom of observing thinking and reasoning i do not mean that they should devote themselves to abstruse speculation or the study of logic but she who is accustomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts to reason justly and pertinently on common affairs and judiciously to deduce effects from their causes will be a better logician than some of those who claim the name because they have studied the art this is being learned without the rules the best definition perhaps of that sort of literature which is properest for the sex that species of knowledge which appears to be the result of reflection rather than of science sits peculiarly well on women it is not uncommon to find a lady who though she does not know a rule of syntax scarcely ever violates one and who constructs every sentence she utters with more propriety than many a learned dunce who has every rule of aristotle by heart and who can lace his own threadbare discourse with the golden shreds of cicero and virgil  it has been objected and i fear with some reason that female conversation is too frequently tinctured with a censorious spirit and that ladies are seldom apt to discover much tenderness for the errors of a fallen sister if it be so it is a grievous fault no arguments can justify no pleas can extenuate it to insult over the miseries of an unhappy creature is inhuman not to compassionate them is unchristian the worthy part of the sex always express themselves humanely on the failings of others in proportion to their own undeviating goodness  and here i cannot help remarking that young women do not always carefully distinguish between running into the error of detraction and its opposite extreme of indiscriminate applause this proceeds from the false idea they entertain that the direct contrary to what is wrong must be right thus the dread of being only suspected of one fault makes them actually guilty of another the desire of avoiding the imputation of envy impels them to be insincere and to establish a reputation for sweetness of temper and generosity they affect sometimes to speak of very indifferent characters with the most extravagant applause with such the hyperbole is a favorite figure and every degree of comparison but the superlative is rejected as cold and inexpressive but this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit and destroys the weight of their opinion on other occasions for people very soon discover what degree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity and those of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation which cannot distinguish the value of what it praises than the celebrated painter must have been at the judgment passed on his works by an ignorant spectator who being asked what he thought of such and such very capital but very different pieces cried out in an affected rapture all alike all alike  it has been proposed to the young as a maxim of supreme wisdom to manage so dexterously in conversation as to appear to be well acquainted with subjects of which they are totally ignorant and this by affecting silence in regard to those on which they are known to excel  but why counsel this disingenuous fraud why add to the numberless arts of deceit this practice of deceiving as it were on a settled principle if to disavow the knowledge they really have be a culpable affectation then certainly to insinuate an idea of their skill where they are actually ignorant is a most unworthy artifice  but of all the qualifications for conversation humility if not the most brilliant is the safest the most amiable and the most feminine the affectation of introducing subjects with which others are unacquainted and of displaying talents superior to the rest of the company is as dangerous as it is foolish  there are many who never can forgive another for being more agreeable and more accomplished than themselves and who can pardon any offense rather than an eclipsing merit had the nightingale in the fable conquered his vanity and resisted the temptation of showing a fine voice he might have escaped the talons of the hawk the melody of his singing was the cause of his destruction his merit brought him into danger and his vanity cost him his life  on envy envy came next envy with squinting eyes sick of a strange disease his neighbors health best then he lives when any better dies is never poor but in anothers wealth on best mens harms and griess he seeds his fill else his own maw does eat with spiteful will ill must the temper be where diet is so ill fletchers purple island envy says lord bacon has no holidays there cannot perhaps be a more lively and striking description of the miserable state of mind those endure who are tormented with this vice a spirit of emulation has been supposed to be the source of the greatest improvements and there is no doubt but the warmest rivalship will produce the most excellent effects but it is to be feared that a perpetual state of contest will injure the temper so essentially that the mischief will hardly be counterbalanced by any other advantages those whose progress is the most rapid will be apt to despise their less successful competitors who in return will feel the bitterest resentment against their more fortunate rivals among persons of real goodness this jealousy and contempt can never be equally felt because every advancement in piety will be attended with a proportionable increase of humility which will lead them to contemplate their own improvements with modesty and to view with charity the miscarriages of others  when an envious man is melancholy one may ask him in the words of bion what evil has befallen himself or what good has happened to another this last is the scale by which he principally measures his felicity and the very smiles of his friends are so many deductions from his own happiness the wants of others are the standard by which he rates his own wealth and he estimates his riches not so much by his own possessions as by the necessities of his neighbors  when the malevolent intend to strike a very deep and dangerous stroke of malice they generally begin the most remotely in the world from the subject nearest their hearts they set out with commending the object of their envy for some trifling quality or advantage which it is scarcely worth while to possess they next proceed to make a general profession of their own good will and regard for him thus artfully removing any suspicion of their design and clearing all obstructions for the insidious stab they are about to give for who will suspect them of an intention to injure the object of their peculiar and professed esteem the hearers belief of the fact grows in proportion to the seeming reluctance with which it is told and to the conviction he has that the relater is not influenced by any private pique or personal resentment but that the confession is extorted from him sorely against his inclination and purely on account of his zeal for truth  anger is less reasonable and more sincere than envy  anger breaks out abruptly envy is a great prefacer  anger wishes to be understood at once envy is fond of remote hints and ambiguities but obscure as its oracles are it never ceases to deliver them till they are perfectly comprehended  anger repeats the same circumstances over again envy invents new ones at every fresh recital  anger gives a broken vehement and interrupted narrative envy tells a more consistent and more probable though a falser tale  anger is excessively imprudent for it is impatient to disclose every thing it knows envy is discreet for it has a great deal to hide  anger never consults times or seasons envy waits for the lucky moment when the wound it meditates may be made the most exquisitely painful and the most incurably deep  anger uses more invective envy does more mischief  simple anger soons runs itself out of breath and is exhausted at the end of its tale but it is for that chosen period that envy has treasured up the most barbed arrow in its whole quiver  anger puts a man out of himself but the truly malicious generally preserve the appearance of selfpossession or they could not so effectually injure  the angry man sets out by destroying his whole credit with you at once for he very frankly confesses his abhorrence and detestation of the object of his abuse while the envious man carefully suppresses all his own share in the affair  the angry man defeats the end of his resentment by keeping himself continually before your eyes instead of his enemy while the envious man artfully brings forward the object of his malice and keeps himself out of sight  the angry man talks loudly of his own wrongs the envious of his adversarys injustice  a passionate person if his resentments are not complicated with malice divides his time between sinning and sorrowing and as the irascible passions cannot constantly be at work his heart may sometimes get a holiday  anger is a violent act envy a constant habit  no one can be always angry but he may be always envious  an angry mans enmity if he be generous will subside when the object of his resentment becomes unfortunate but the envious man can extract food from his malice out of calamity itself if he finds his adversary bears it with dignity or is pitied or assisted in it the rage of the passionate man is totally extinguished by the death of his enemy but the hatred of the malicious is not buried even in the grave of his rival he will envy the good name he has left behind him he will envy him the tears of his widow the prosperity of his children the esteem of his friends the praises of his epitaph  nay the very magnificence of his funeral  the ear of jealousy hears all things says the wise man frequently i believe more than is uttered which makes the company of persons infected with it still more dangerous  when you tell those of a malicious turn any circumstance that has happened to another though they perfectly know of whom you are speaking they often affect to be at a loss to forget his name or to misapprehend you in some respect or other and this merely to have an opportunity of slily gratifying their malice by mentioning some unhappy defect or personal infirmity he labors under and not contented to tack his every error to his name they will by way of farther explanation have recourse to the faults of his father or the misfortunes of his family and this with all the seeming simplicity and candor in the world merely for the sake of preventing mistakes and to clear up every doubt of his identity  if you are speaking of a lady for instance they will perhaps embellish their inquiries by asking if you mean her whose great grandfather was a bankrupt though she has the vanity to keep a chariot while others who are much better born walk on foot or they will afterward recollect that you may possibly mean her cousin of the same name whose mother was suspected of such or such an indiscretion though the daughter had the luck to make her fortune by marrying while her betters are overlooked  to hint at a fault does more mischief than speaking out for whatever is left for the imagination to finish will not fail to be overdone every hiatus will be more then filled up and every pause more than supplied there is less malice and less mischief too in telling a mans name than the initials of it as a worthier person may be involved in the most disgraceful suspicions by such a dangerous ambiguity  it is not uncommon for the envious after having attempted to deface the fairest character so industriously that they are afraid you will begin to detect their malice to endeavor to remove your suspicions effectually by assuring you that what they have just related is only the popular opinion they themselves can never believe things are so bad as they are said to be for their part it is a rule with them always to hope the best it is their way never to believe or report ill of any one they will however mention the story in all companies that they may do their friend the service of protesting their disbelief of it more reputations are thus hinted away by false friends than are openly destroyed by public enemies an if or a but or a mortified look or a languid defense or an ambiguous shake of the head or a hasty word affectedly recalled will demolish a character more effectually than the whole artillery of malice when openly levelled against it  it is not that envy never praises  no that would be making a public profession of itself and advertising its own malignity whereas the greatest success of its efforts depends on the concealment of their end when envy intends to strike a stroke of machiavelian policy it sometimes affects the language of the most exaggerated applause though it generally takes care that the subject of its panegyric shall be a very indifferent and common character so that it is well aware none of its praises will stick  it is the unhappy nature of envy not to be contented with positive misery but to be continually aggravating its own torments by comparing them with the felicities of others the eyes of envy are perpetually fixed on the object which disturbs it nor can it avert them from it though to procure itself the relief of a temporary forgetfulness on seeing the innocence of the first pair aside the devil turned for envy yet with jealous leer malign eyed them askance   as this enormous sin chiefly instigated the revolt and brought on the ruin of the angelic spirits so it is not improbable that it will be a principal instrument of misery in a future world for the envious to compare their desperate condition with the happiness of the children of god and to heighten their actual wretchedness by reflecting on what they have lost  perhaps envy like lying and ingratitude is practiced with more frequency because it is practiced with impunity but there being no human laws against these crimes is so far from an inducement to commit them that this very consideration would be sufficient to deter the wise and good if all others were ineffectual for of how heinous a nature must those sins be which are judged above the reach of human punishment and are reserved for the final justice of god himself  on the danger of sentimental or romantic connexions among the many evils which prevail under the sun the abuse of words is not the least considerable by the influence of time and the perversion of fashion the plainest and most unequivocal may be so altered as to have a meaning assigned them almost diametrically opposite to their original signification  the present age may be termed by way of distinction the age of sentitiment a word which in the implication it now bears was unknown to our plain ancestors sentiment is the varnish of virtue to conceal the deformity of vice and it is not uncommon for the same persons to make a jest of religion to break through the most solemn ties and engagements to practice every art of latent fraud and open seduction and yet to value themselves on speaking and writing sentimentally  but this refined jargon which has infested letters and tainted morals is chiefly admired and adopted by young ladies of a certain turn who read sentimental books write sentimental letters and contract sentimental friendships  error is never likely to do so much mischief as when it disguifes its real tendency and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance many a young woman who would be shocked at the imputation of an intrigue is extremely flattered at the idea of a sentimental connection though perhaps with a dangerous and designing man who by putting on this mask of plausibility and virtue disarms her of her prudence lays her apprehensions asleep and involves her in misery misery the more inevitable because unsuspected for she who apprehends no danger will not think it necessary to be always upon her guard but will rather invite than avoid the ruin which comes under so specious and so fair a form  such an engagement will be infinitely dearer to her vanity than an avowed and authorized attachment for one of these sentimental lovers will not scruple very seriously to assure a credulous girl that her unparalleled merit entitles her to the adoration of the whole world and that the universal homage of mankind is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute extorted by her charms no wonder then she should be easily prevailed on to believe that an individual is captivated by perfections which might enslave a million but she should remember that he who endeavors to intoxicate her with adulation intends one day most effectually to humble her for an artful man has always a secret design to pay himself in future for every present sacrifice and this prodigality of praise which he now appears to lavish with such thoughtless profusion is in fact a sum oeconomically laid out to supply his future necessities of this sum he keeps an exact estimate and at some distant day promises himself the most exorbitant interest for it if he has address and conduct and the object of his pursuit much vanity and some sensibility he seldom fails of success for so powerful will be his ascendancy over her mind that she will soon adopt his notions and opinions indeed it is more than probable she possessed most of them before having gradually acquired them in her initiation into the sentimental character to maintain that character with dignity and propriety it is necessary she should entertain the most elevated ideas of disproportionate alliances and disinterested love and consider fortune rank and reputation as mere chimerical distinctions and vulgar prejudices  the lover deeply versed in all the obliquities of fraud and skilled to wind himself into every avenue of the heart which indiscretion has left unguarded soon discovers on which side it is most accessible he avails himself of this weakness by addressing her in a language exactly consonant to her own ideas he attacks her with her own weapons and opposes rhapsody to sentiment  he professes so sovereign a contempt for the paltry concerns of money that she thinks it her duty to reward him for so generous a renunciation every plea he artfully advances of his own unworthiness is considered by her as a fresh demand which her gratitude must answer and she makes it a point of honor to sacrifice to him that fortune which he is too noble to regard these professions of humility are the common artifice of the vain and these protestations of generosity the refuge of the rapacious and among its many smooth mischiefs it is one of the sure and successful frauds of sentiment to affect the most frigid indifference to those external and pecuniary advantages which it is its great and real object to obtain  a sentimental girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her personal beauty for she has been daily accustomed to contemplate it herself and to hear of it from others she will not therefore be very solicitous for the confirmation of a truth so selfevident but she suspects that her pretensions to understanding are more likely to be disputed and for that reason greedily devours every compliment offered to those perfections which are less obvious and more refined she is persuaded that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty while it will be the most convincing proof of the taste sense and elegance of her admirer that he can discern and flatter those qualities in her a man of the character here supposed will easily insinuate himself into her affections by means of this latent but leading foible which may be called the guiding clue to a sentimental heart he will affect to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes and ensnares common hearts while he will bestow the most delicate praises on the beauties of her mind and finish the climax of adulation by hinting that she is superior to it  and when he tells her she hates flattery she says she does being then most flattered but nothing in general can end less delightfully than these sublime attachments even where no acts of seduction were ever practiced but they are suffered like mere sublunary connexions to terminate in the vulgar catastrophe of marriage that wealth which lately seemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover now appears to be the principal attraction in the eyes of the husband and he who but a few short weeks before in a transport of sentimental generosity wished her to have been a village maid with no portion but her crook and her beauty and that they might spend their days in pastoral love and innocence has now lost all relish for the arcadian life or any other life in which she must be his companion  on the other hand she who was lately an angel called and angellike adored is shocked to find herself at once stripped of all her celestial attributes this late divinity who scarcely yielded to her sisters of the sky now finds herself of less importance in the esteem of the man she has chosen than any other mere mortal woman no longer is she gratified with the tear of counterfeited passion the sigh of dissembled rapture or the language of premeditated adoration no longer is the altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations of fictitious fondness the incense of falsehood or the sacrifice of flattery  her apotheosis is ended  she feels herself degraded from the dignities and privileges of a goddess to all the imperfections vanities and weaknesses of a slighted woman and a neglected wife her faults which were so lately overlooked or mistaken for virtues are now as cassius says set in a notebook the passion which was vowed eternal lasted only a few short weeks and the indifference which was so far from being included in the bargain that it was not so much as suspected follows them through the whole tiresome journey of their insipid vacant joyless existence  thus much for the completion of the sentimental history if we trace it back to its beginning we shall sind that a damsel of this cast had her head originally turned by pernicious reading and her insanity confirmed by imprudent friendships she never fails to select a beloved confidante of her own turn and humor though if she can help it not quite so handsome as herself a violent intimacy ensues or to speak the language of sentiment an intimate union of souls immediately takes place which is wrought to the highest pitch by a secret and voluminous correspondence though they live in the same street or perhaps in the same house this is the fuel which principally feeds and supplies the dangerous flame of sentiment in this correspondence the two friends encourage each other in the falsest notions imaginable they represent romantic love as the great important business of human life and describe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of such elevated beings and fit only to employ the daughters of the plodding vulgar in these letters family affairs are misrepresented family secrets divulged and family misfortunes aggravated they are filled with vows of eternal amity and protestations of neverending love but interjections and quotations are the principal embellishments of these very sublime epistles every panegyric contained in them is extravagant and hyperbolical and every censure exaggerated and excessive in a favorite every frailty is heightened into a perfection and in a foe degraded into a crime the dramatic poets especially the most tender and romantic are quoted in almost every line and every pompous or pathetic thought is forced to give up its natural and obvious meaning and with all the violence of misapplication is compelled to suit some circumstance of imaginary woe of the fair transcriber alicia is not too mad for her heroics nor monimia too mild for her soft emotions  fathers have flinty hearts is an expression worth an empire and is always used with peculiar emphasis and enthusiasm for a favorite topic of these epistles is the grovelling spirit and sordid temper of the parents who will be sure to find no quarter at the hands of their daughters should they presume to be so unreasonable as to direct their course of reading interfere in their choice of friends or interrupt their very important correspondence but as these young ladies are fertile in but as these young ladies are fertile in expedients and as their genius is never more agreeably exercised than in finding resources they are not without their secret exultation in case either of the above interesting events should happen as they carry with them a certain air of tyranny and persecution which is very delightful for a prohibited correspondence is one of the great incidents of a sentimental life and a letter clandestinely received the supreme felicity of a sentimental lady  nothing can equal the astonishment of these soaring spirits when their plain friends or prudent relations presume to remonstrate with them on any impropriety in their conduct but if these worthy people happen to be somewhat advanced in life their contempt is then a little softened by pity at the reflection that such very antiquated poor creatures should pretend to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies of their great refinement sense and reading they consider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the sublime pleasures of a delicate and exalted passion as tyrants whose authority is to be contemned and as spies whose vigilance is to be eluded the prudence of these worthy friends they term suspicion and their experience dotage for they are persuaded that the face of things has so totally changed since their parents were young that though they might then judge tolerably for themselves yet they are now with all their advantages of knowledge and observation by no means qualified to direct their more enlightened daughters who if they have made a great progress in the sentimental walk will no more be influenced by the advice of their mother than they would go abroad in her laced pinner or her brocade suit  but young people never show their folly and ignorance more conspicuously than by this overconfidence in their own judgment and this haughty disdain of the opinion of those who have known more days youth has a quickness of apprehension which it is very apt to mistake for an acuteness of penetration but youth like cunning though very conceited is very shortsighted and never more so than when it disregards the instructions of the wise and the admonitions of the aged the same vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day which influence it now and nearly in the same manner one who well knew the world and its various vanities has said the thing which has been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun  it is also a part of the sentimental character to imagine that none but the young and the beautiful have any right to the pleasures of society or even to the common benefits and blessings of life ladies of this turn also affect the most lofty disregard for useful qualities and domestic virtues and this is a natural consequence for as this sort of sentiment is only a weed of idleness she who is constantly and usefully employed has neither leisure nor propensity to cultivate it  a sentimental lady principally values herself on the enlargement of her notions and her liberal way of thinking this superiority of soul chiefly manifests itself in the contempt of those minute delicacies and little decorums which trifling as they may be thought tend at once to dignify the character and to restrain the levity of the younger part of the sex  perhaps the error here complained of originates in mistaking sentiment and principle for each other now i conceive them to be extremely different sentiment is the virtue of ideas and principle the virtue of action sentiment has its seat in the head principle in the heart sentiment suggests fine harangues and subtle distinctions principle conceives just notions and performs good actions in consequence of them sentiment refines away the simplicity of truth and the plainness of piety and as a celebrated wit see voltaires prophecy concerning rousseau has remarked of his no less celebrated contemporary gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds sentiment may be called the athenian who knew what was right and principle the lacedemonian who practiced it  but these qualities will be better exemplified by an attentive consideration of two admirably drawn characters of milton which are beautifully delicately and distinctly marked these are belial who may not improperly be called the demon of sentiment and abdiel who may be termed the angel of principle  survey the picture of belial drawn by the sublimest hand that ever held the poetic pencil  a fairer person lost not heaven he seemed for dignity composed and high exploit but all was false and hollow though his tongue dropped manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful yet he pleased the ear paradise lost b ii here is a lively and exquisite representation of art subtilty wit fine breeding and polished manners on the whole of a very accomplished and sentimental spirit  now turn to the artless upright and unsophisticated abdiel faithful found among the faithless faithful only he among innumerable false unmoved unshaken unseducd unterrified his loyalty he kept his love his zeal nor number nor example with him wrought to swerve from truth or change his constant mind though single book v  but it is not from these descriptions just and striking as they are that their characters are so perfectly known as from an examination of their conduct through the remainder of this divine work in which it is well worth while to remark the consonancy of their actions with what the above pictures seem to promise it will also be observed that the contrast between them is kept up throughout with the utmost exactness of delineation and the most animated strength of coloring on a review it will be found that belial talked all and abdiel did all the former with words still clothed in reasons guise counseled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth not peace book ii  in abdiel you will constantly find the eloquence of action when tempted by the rebellious angels with what retorted scorn with what honest indignation he deserts their multitudes and retreats from their contagious society  all night the dreadless angel unpursued through heavens wide champain held his way book vi no wonder he was received with such acclamations of joy by the celestial powers when there was but one yes of so many myriads fallen but one returned not lost ibid  and afterward in a close contest with the arch fiend a noble stroke he lifted high on the proud crest of satan ibid  what was the effect of this courage of the vigilant and active seraph  amazement seized the rebel throne but greater rage to see thus foiled their mightiest abdiel had the superiority of belial as much in the warlike combat as in the peaceful counfels  nor was it ought but just that he who in debate of truth had won shond win in arms in both disputes alike victor but notwithstanding i have spoken with some asperity against sentiment as opposed to principle yet i am convinced that true genuine sentiment not the sort i have been describing may be so connected with principle as to bestow on it its brightest luster and its most captivating graces and enthusiasm is so far from being disagreeable that a portion of it is perhaps indispensably necessary in an engaging woman but it must be the enthusiasm of the heart not of the senses it must be the enthusiasm which grows up with a feeling mind and is cherished by a virtuous education not that which is compounded of irregular passions and artificially refined by books of unnatural fiction and improbable adventure i will even go so far as to assert that a young woman cannot have any real greatness of soul or true elevation of principle if she has not a tincture of what the vulgar would call romance but which persons of a certain way of thinking will discern to proceed from those fine feelings and that charming sensibility without which though a woman may be worthy yet she can never be amiable  but this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched as it is very apt to lead those who possess it into inconveniences from which less interesting characters are happily exempt young women of strong sensibility may be carried by the very amiableness of this temper into the most alarming extremes their tastes are passions they love and hate with all their hearts and scarcely suffer themselves to feel a reasonable preference before it strengthens into a violent attachment  when an innocent girl of this open trusting tender heart happens to meet with one of her own sex and age whose address and manners are engaging she is instantly seized with an ardent desire to commence a friendship with her she feels the most lively impatience at the restraints of company and the decorums of ceremony she longs to be alone with her longs to assure her of the warmth of her tenderness and generously ascribes to the fair stranger all the good qualities she feels in her own heart or rather all those which she has met with in her reading dispersed in a variety of heroines she is persuaded that her new friend unites them all in herself because she carries in her prepossessing countenance the promise of them all how cruel and how censorious would this inexperienced girl think her mother was who should venture to hint that the agreeable unknown had defects in her temper or exceptions in her character she would mistake these hints of discretion for the insinuations of an uncharitable disposition at first she would perhaps listen to them with a generous impatience and afterward with a cold and silent disdain she would despise them as the effect of prejudice misrepresentation or ignorance the more aggravated the censure the more vehemently would she protest in secret that her friendship for this dear injured creature who is raised much higher in her esteem by such injurious suspicions shall know no bounds as she is assured it can know no end  yet this trusting considence this honest indiscretion is at this early period of life as amiable as it is natural and will if wisely cultivated produce at its proper season fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded circumspection of premature and therefore artificial prudence men i believe are seldom struck with these sudden prepossessions in favor of each other they are not so unsuspecting nor so easily led away by the predominance of fancy they engage more warily and pass through the several stages of acquaintance intimacy and confidence by slower gradations but women if they are sometimes deceived in the choice of a friend enjoy even then an higher degree of satisfaction than if they never trusted for to be always clad in the burdensome armor of suspicion is more painful and inconvenient than to run the hazard of suffering now and then a transient injury  but the above observations only extend to the young and the inexperienced for i am very certain that women are capable of as faithful and as durable friendship as any of the other sex they can enter not only into all the enthusiastic tenderness but into all the solid fidelity of attachment and if we cannot oppose instances of equal weight with those of nysus and euryalus theseus and pirithous pylades and orestes let it be remembered that it is because the recorders of those characters were men and that the very existence of them is merely poetical  on true and false meekness a low voice and soft address are the common indications of a wellbred woman and should seem to be the natural effects of a meek and quiet spirit but they are only the outward and visible signs of it for they are no more meekness itself than a red coat is courage or a black one devotion  yet nothing is more common than to mistake the sign for the thing itself nor is any practice more frequent than that of endeavoring to acquire the exterior mark without once thinking to labor after the interior grace surely this is beginning at the wrong end like attacking the symptom and neglecting the disease to regulate the features while the soul is in tumults or to command the voice while the passions are without restraint is as idle as throwing odours into a stream when the source is polluted  the sapient king who knew better than any man the nature and the power of beauty has assured us that the temper of the mind has a strong influence upon the features wisdom makes the face to shine says that exquisite judge and surely no part of wisdom is more likely to produce this amiable effect than a placid serenity of soul  it will not be difficult to distinguish the true from the artificial meekness the former is universal and habitual the latter local and temporary every young female may keep this rule by her to enable her to form a just judgment of her own temper if she is not as gentle to her chambermaid as she is to her visitor she may rest satisfied that the spirit of gentleness is not in her  who would not be shocked and disappointed to behold a wellbred young lady soft and engaging as the doves of venus displaying a thousand graces and attractions to win the hearts of a large company and the instant they are gone to see her look mad as the pythian maid and all the frightened graces driven from her furious countenance only because her gown was brought home a quarter of an hour later than she expected or her ribbon sent half a shade lighter or darker than she ordered  all mens characters are said to proceed from their servants and this is more particularly true of ladies for as their situations are more domestic they lie more open to the inspection of their families to whom their real characters are easily and perfectly known for they seldom think it worth while to practice any disguise before those whose good opinion they do not value and who are obliged to submit to their most insupportable humors because they are paid for it  amongst women of breeding the exterior of gentleness is so uniformly assumed and the whole manner is so perfectly level and uni that it is next to impossible for a stranger to know any thing of their true dispositions by conversing with them and even the very features are so exactly regulated that physiognomy which may sometimes be trusted among the vulgar is with the polite a most lying science  a very termagant woman if she happens also to be a very artful one will be conscious she has so much to conceal that the dread of betraying her real temper will make her put on an overacted softness which from its very excess may be distinguished from the natural by a penetrating eye that gentleness is ever liable to be suspected for the counterfeited which is so excessive as to deprive people of the proper use of speech and motion or which as hamlet says makes them lisp and amble and nickname gods creatures  the countenance and manners of some very fashionable persons may be compared to the inscriptions on their monuments which speak nothing but good of what is within but he who knows any thing of the world or of the human heart will no more trust to the courtesy than he will depend on the epitaph  among the various artifices of factitious meekness one of the most frequent and most plausible is that of affecting to be always equally delighted with all persons and all characters the society of these languid beings is without confidence their friendship without attachment and their love without affection or even preference this insipid mode of conduct may be safe but i cannot think it has either taste sense or principle in it  these uniformly smiling and approving ladies who have neither the noble courage to reprehend vice nor the generous warmth to bear their honest testimony in the cause of virtue conclude every one to be illnatured who has any penetration and look upon a distinguishing judgment as want of tenderness but they should learn that this discernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper but from that long experience and thorough knowledge of the world which lead those who have it to scrutinize into the conduct and disposition of men before they trust entirely to those fair appearances which sometimes veil the most insidious purposes  we are perpetually mistaking the qualities and dispositions of our own hearts we elevate our failings into virtues and qualify our vices into weaknesses and hence arise so many false judgments respecting meekness selfignorance is at the root of all this mischief many ladies complain that for their part their spirit is so meek they can bear nothing whereas if they spoke truth they would say their spirit is so high and unbroken that they can bear nothing strange to plead their meekness as a reason why they cannot endure to be crossed and to produce their impatience of contradiction as a proof of their gentleness  meekness like most other virtues has certain limits which it no sooner exceeds than it becomes criminal servility of spirit is not gentleness but weakness and if allowed under the specious appearances it sometimes puts on will lead to the most dangerous compliances she who hears innocence maligned without vindicating it falsehood asserted without contradicting it or religion profaned without resenting it is not gentle but wicked  to give up the cause of an innocent injured friend if the popular cry happens to be against him is the most disgraceful weakness this was the case of madame de maintenon she loved the character and admired the talents of racine she caressed him while he had no enemies but wanted the greatness of mind or rather the common justice to protect him against the greatness of mind or rather the common justice to protect him against their resentment when he had and her favorite was abandoned to the suspicious jealousy of the king when a prudent remonstrance might have preserved him  but her tameness if not absolute connivance in the great massacre of the protestants in whose church she had been bred is a far more guilty instance of her weakness an instance which in spite of all her devotional zeal and incomparable prudence will disqualify her from shining in the annals of good women however she may be entitled to figure among the great and the fortunate compare her conduct with that of her undaunted and pious countryman and contemporary bougi who when louis would have prevailed on him to renounce his religion for a commission or a government nobly replied if i could be persuaded to betray my god for a marshals staff i might betray my king for a bribe of much less consequence  meekness is imperfect if it be not both active and passive if it will not enable us to subdue our own passions and resentments as well as qualify us to bear patiently the passions and resentments of others  before we give way to any violent emotion of anger it would perhaps be worth while to consider the value of the object which excites it and to reflect for a moment whether the thing we so ardently desire or so vehemently resent be really of as much importance to us as that delightful tranquillity of soul which we renounce in pursuit of it if on a fair calculation we find we are not likely to get as much as we are sure to lose then putting all religious considerations out of the question common sense and human policy will tell us we have made a foolish and unprofitable exchange inward quiet is a part of ones self the object of our resentment may be only a matter of opinion and certainly what makes a portion of our actual happiness ought to be too dear to us to be sacrificed for a trifling foreign perhaps imaginary good  the most pointed satire i remember to have read on a mind enslaved by anger is an observation of senecas alexander said he had two friends clitus and lysimachus the one he exposed to a lion the other to himself he who was turned loose to the beast escaped but clitus was murdered for he was turned loose to an angry man  a passionate womans happiness is never in her own keeping it is the sport of accident and the slave of events it is in the power of her acquaintance her servants but chiefly of her enemies and all her comforts lie at the mercy of others so far from being willing to learn of him who was meek and lowly she considers meekness as the want of a becoming spirit and lowliness as a despicable and vulgar meanness and an imperious woman will so little covet the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit that it is almost the only ornament she will not be solicitous to wear but resentment is a very expensive vice how dearly has it cost its votaries even from the sin of cain the first offender in this kind it is cheaper says a pious writer to forgive and save the charges  if it were only for mere human reasons it would turn to a better account to be patient nothing defeats the malice of an enemy like a spirit of forbearance the return of rage for rage cannot be so effectually provoking true gentleness like an impenetrable armor repels the most pointed shafts of malice they cannot pierce through this invulnerable shield but either fall hurtless to the ground or return to wound the hand that shot them  a meek spirit will not look out of itself for happiness because it finds a constant banquet at home yet by a sort of divine alchymy it will convert all external events to its own profit and be able to deduce some good even from the most unpromising it will extract comfort and satisfaction from the most barren circumstances it will suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock  but the supreme excellence of this complacent quality is that it naturally disposes the mind where it resides to the practice of every other that is amiable meekness may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues which levels every obstruction and smooths every difficulty that might impede their entrance or retard their progress  the peculiar importance and value of this amiable virtue may be farther seen in its permanency honors and dignities are transient beauty and riches frail and fugacious to a proverb would not the truly wise therefore wish to have some one possession which they might call their own in the severest exigencies but this wish can only be accomplished by acquiring and maintaining that calm and absolute selfpossession which as the world had no hand in giving so it cannot by the most malicious exertion of its power take away  thoughts on the cultivation of the heart and temper in the education of daughters i have not the foolish presumption to imagine that i can offer any thing new on a subject which has been so successfully treated by many learned and able writers i would only with all possible deference beg leave to hazard a few short remarks on that part of the subject of education which i would call the education of the heart i am well aware that this part also has not been less skilfully and forcibly discussed than the rest though i cannot at the same time help remarking that it does not appear to have been so much adopted into common practice  it appears then that notwithstanding the great and real improvements which have been made in the affair of female education and notwithstanding the more enlarged and generous views of it which prevail in the present day that there is still a very material defect which it is not in general enough the object of attention to remove this defect seems to consist in this that too little regard is paid to the dispositions of the mind that the indications of the temper are not properly cherished nor the affections of the heart sufficiently regulated  in the first education of girls as far as the customs which fashion establishes are right they should undoubredly be followed let the exterior be made a considerable object of attention but let it not be the principal let it not be the only one  let the graces be industriously cultivated but let them not be cultivated at the expense of the virtues  let the arms the head the whole person be carefully polished but let not the heart be the only portion of the human anatomy which shall be totally overlooked  the neglect of this cultivation seems to proceed as much from a bad taste as from a false principle the generality of people form their judgment of education by slight and sudden appearances which is certainly a wrong way of determining music dancing and languages gratify those who teach them by perceptible and almost immediate effects and when there happens to be no imbecility in the pupil nor deficiency in the master every superficial observer can in some measure judge of the progress  the effects of most of these accomplishments address themselves to the senses and there are more who can see and hear than there are who can judge and reflect  personal perfection is not only more obvious it is also more rapid and even in very accomplished characters elegance usually precedes principle  but the heart that natural seat of evil propensities that little troublesome empire of the passions is led to what is right by slow motions and imperceptible degrees it must be admonished by reproof and allured by kindness its liveliest advances are frequently impeded by the obstinacy of prejudice and its brightest promises often obscured by the tempests of passion it is slow in its acquisition of virtue and reluctant in its approaches to piety  there is another reason which proves this mental cultivation to be more important as well as more difficult than any other part of education in the usual fashionable accomplishments the business of acquiring them is almost always getting forwards and one difficulty is conquered before another other is suffered to show itself for a prudent teacher will level the road his pupil is to pass and smooth the inequalities which might retard her progress  but in morals which should be the great object constantly kept in view the task is far more difficult the unruly and turbulent desires of the heart are not so obedient one passion will start up before another is suppressed the subduing hercules cannot cut off the heads so often as the prolific hydra can produce them nor fell the stubborn antaeus so fast as he can recruit his strength and rise in vigorous and repeated opposition  if all the accomplishments could be bought at the price of a single virtue the purchase would be infinitely dear and however startling it may sound i think it is notwithstanding true that the labors of a good and wise mother who is anxious for her daughters most important interests will seem to be at variance with those of her instructors she will doubtless rejoice at her progress in any polite art but she will rejoice with trembling  humility and piety form the solid and durable basis on which she wishes to raise the superstructure of the accomplishments while the accomplishments themselves are frequently of that unsteady nature that if the foundation is not secured in proportion as the building is enlarged it will be overloaded and destroyed by those very ornaments which were intended to embellish what they have contributed to ruin  the more ostensible qualifications should be carefully regulated or they will be in danger of putting to flight the modest train of retreating virtues which cannot safely subsist before the bold eye of public observation or bear the bolder tongue of impudent and audacious flattery a tender mother cannot but feel an honest triumph in contemplating those excellencies in her daughter which deserve applause but she will also shudder at the vanity which that applause may excite and at those hitherto unknown ideas which it may awaken  the master it is his interest and perhaps his duty will naturally teach a girl to set her improvements in the most conspicuous point of light se fair valoir is the great principle industriously inculcated into her young heart and seems to be considered as a kind of fundamental maxim in education it is however the certain and effectual seed from which a thousand yet unborn vanities will spring this dangerous doctrine which yet is not without its uses will be counteracted by the prudent mother not in so many words but by a watchful and scarcely perceptible dexterity such an one will be more careful to have the talents of her daughter cultivated than exhibited  one would be led to imagine by the common mode of female education that life consisted of one universal holiday and that the only contest was who should be best enabled to excel in the sports and games that were to be celebrated on it merely ornamental accomplishments will but indifferently qualify a woman to perform the duties of life though it is highly proper she should possess them in order to furnish the amusements of it but is it right to spend so large a portion of life without some preparation for the business of living a lady may speak a little french and italian repeat a few passages in a theatrical tone play and sing have her dressing room hung with her own drawings and her person covered with her own tambour work and may notwithstanding have been very badly educated yet i am far from attempting to depreciate the value of these qualifications they are most of them not only highly becoming but often indispensably necessary and a polite education cannot be perfected without them but as the world seems to be very well apprised of their importance there is the less occasion to insist on their utility yet though wellbred young women should learn to dance sing recite and draw the end of a good education is not that they may become dancers singers players or painters its real object is to make them good daughters good wives good mistresses good members of society and good christians the above qualifications therefore are intended to adorn their leisure not to employ their lives for an amiable and wise woman will always have something better to value herself on than these advantages which however captivating are still but subordinate parts of a truly excellent character  but i am afraid parents themselves sometimes contribute to the error of which i am complaining do they not often set a higher value on those acquisitions which are calculated to attract observation and catch the eye of the multitude than on those which are valuable permanent and internal are they not sometimes more solicitous about the opinion of others respecting their children than about the real advantage and happiness of the children themselves to an injudicious and superficial eye the best educated girl may make the least brilliant figure as she will probably have less flippancy in her manner and less repartee in her expression and her acquirements to borrow bishop sprats idea will be rather enamelled than embossed but her merit will be known and acknowledged by all who come near enough to discern and have taste enough to distinguish it will be understood and admired by the man whose happiness she is one day to make whose family she is to govern and whose children she is to educate he will not seek for her in the haunts of dissipation for he knows he shall not find her there but he will seek for her in the bosom of retirement in the practice of every domestic virtue in the exertion of every amiable accomplishment exerted in the shade to enliven retirement to heighten the endearing pleasures of social intercourse and to embellish the narrow but charming circle of family delights to this amiable purpose a truly good and well educated young lady will dedicate her more elegant accomplishments instead of exhibiting them to attract admiration or depress inferiority  young girls who have more vivacity than understanding will often make a sprightly figure in conversation but this agreeable talent for entertaining others is frequently dangerous to themselves nor is it by any means to be desired or encouraged very early in life this immaturity of wit is helped on by frivolous reading which will produce its effect in much less time than books of solid instruction for the imagination is touched sooner than the understanding and effects are more rapid as they are more pernicious conversation should be the result of education not the precursor of it it is a golden fruit when suffered to grow gradually on the tree of knowledge but if precipitated by forced and unnatural means it will in the end become vapid in proportion as it is artificial  the best effects of a careful and religious education are often very remote they are to be discovered in future scenes and exhibited in untried connexions every event of life will be putting the heart into fresh situations and making demands on its prudence its firmness its integrity or its piety those whose business it is to form it can foresee none of these situations yet as far as human wisdom will allow they must enable it to provide for them all with an humble dependence on the divine assistance a welldisciplined soldier must learn and practice all his evolutions though he does not know on what service his leader may command him by what foe he shall be attacked not what mode of combat the enemy may use  one great art of education consists in not suffering the feelings to become too acute by unnecessary awakening nor too obtuse by the want of exertion the former renders them the source of calamity and totally ruins the temper while the latter blunts and debases them and produces a dull cold and selfish spirit for the mind is an instrument which if wound too high will lose its sweetness and if not enough strained will abate of its vigor  how cruel is it to extinguish by neglect or unkindness the precious sensibility of an open temper to chill the amiable glow of an ingenous soul and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous spirit these are of higher worth than all the documents of learning of dearer price than all the advantages which can be derived from the most refined and artificial mode of education  but sensibility and delicacy and an ingenous temper make no part of education exclaims the pedagogue  they are reducible to no class  they come under no article of instruction  they belong neither to languages nor to music  what an error they are a part of education and of infinitely more value than all their pedant discipline ever knew it is true they are ranged under no class but they are superior to all they are of more esteem than languages or music for they are the language of the heart and the music of the according passions yet this sensibility is in many instances so far from being cultivated that it is not uncommon to see those who affect more than usual sagacity cast a smile of supercilious pity at any indication of a warm generous or enthusiastic temper in the lively and the young as much as to say they will know better and will have more discretion when they are older but every appearance of amiable simplicity or of honest shame natures hasty conscience will be dear to sensible hearts they will carefully cherish every such indication in a young female for they will perceive that it is this temper wisely cultivated which will one day make her enamoured of the loveliness of virtue and the beauty of holiness from which she will acquire a taste for the doctrines of religion and a spirit to perform the duties of it and those who wish to make her ashamed of this charming temper and seek to dispossess her of it will it is to be feared give her nothing better in exchange but whoever reflects at all will easily discern how carefully this enthusiasm is to be directed and how judiciously its redundances are to be lopped away  prudence is not natural to children they can however substitute art in its stead but is it not much better that a girl should discover the faults incident to her age than conceal them under this dark and impenetrable veil i could almost venture to assert that there is something more becoming in the very errors of nature where they are undisguised than in the affectation of virtue itself where the reality is wanting and i am so far from being an admirer of prodigies that i am extremely apt to suspect them and am always infinitely better pleased with nature in her more common modes of operation the precise and premature wisdom which some girls have cunning enough to assume is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their natural failings can be as it effectually covers those secret bad dispositions which if they displayed themselves might be rectified the hypocrisy of assuming virtues which are not inherent in the heart prevents the growth and disclosure of those real ones which it is the great end of education to cultivate  but if the natural indications of the temper are to be suppressed and stifled where are the diagnostics by which the state of the mind is to be known the wise author of all things who did nothing in vain doubtless intended them as symptoms by which to judge of the diseases of the heart and it is impossible diseases should be cured before they are known if the stream be so cut off as to prevent communication or so choked up as to defeat discovery how shall we ever reach the source out of which are the issues of life  this cunning which of all the different dispositions girls discover is most to be dreaded is increased by nothing so much as by fear if those about them express violent and unreasonable anger at every trivial offense it will always promote this temper and will very frequently create it where there was a natural tendency to frankness the indiscreet transports of rage which many betray on every slight occasion and the little distinction they make between venial errors and premeditated crimes naturally dispose a child to conceal what she does not however care to suppress anger in one will not remedy the faults of another for how can an instrument of sin cure sin if a girl is kept in a state of perpetual and slavish terror she will perhaps have artifice enough to conceal those propensities which she knows are wrong or those actions which she thinks are most abnoxious to punishment but nevertheless she will not cease to indulge those propensities and to commit those actions when she can do it with impunity  good dispositions of themselves will go but a very little way unless they are confirmed into good principles and this cannot be effected but by a careful course of religious instruction and a patient and laborious cultivation of the moral temper  but notwithstanding girls should not be treated with unkindness nor the first openings of the passions blighted by cold severity yet i am of opinion that young females should be accustomed very early in life to a certain degree of restraint the natural cast of character and the moral distinctions between the sexes should not be disregarded even in childhood that bold independent enterprising spirit which is so much admired in boys should not when it happens to discover itself in the other sex be encouraged but suppressed girls should be taught to give up their opinions betimes and not pertinaciously to carry on a dispute even if they should know themselves to be in the right i do not mean that they should be robbed of the liberty of private judgment but that they should by no means be encouraged to contract a contentious or contradictory turn it is of the greatest importance to their future happiness that they should acquire a submissive temper and a forbearing spirit for it is a lesson which the world will not fail to make them frequently practice when they come abroad into it and they will not practice it the worse for having learnt it the sooner these early restraints in the limitation here meant are so far from being an effect of cruelty that they are the most indubitable marks of affection and are the more meritorious as they are severe trials of tenderness but all the beneficial effects which a mother can expect from this watchfulness will be entirely defeated if it is practiced occasionally and not habitually and if it ever appears to be used to gratify caprice illhumour or resentment  those who have children to educate ought to be extremely patient it is indeed a labor of love they should reflect that extraordinary talents are neither essential to the wellbeing of society nor to the happiness of individuals if that had been the case the beneficent father of the universe would not have made them so rare for it is as easy for an almighty creator to produce a newton as an ordinary man and he could have made those powers common which we now consider as wonderful without any miraculous exertion of his omnipotence if the existence of many newtons had been necessary to the perfection of his wise and gracious plan  surely therefore there is more piety as well as more sense in laboring to improve the talents which children actually have than in lamenting that they do not possess supernatural endowments or angelic perfections a passage of lord bacons furnishes an admirable incitement for endeavoring to carry the amiable and christian grace of charity to its farthest extent instead of indulging an overanxious care for more brilliant but less important acquisitions the desire of power in excess says he caused the angels to fall the desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall but in charity is no excess neither can men nor angels come into danger by it  a girl who has docility will seldom be found to want understanding enough for all the purposes of a social a happy and an useful life and when we behold the tender hope of fond and anxious love blasted by disappointment the defect will as often be discovered to proceed from the neglect or the error of cultivation as from the natural temper and those who lament the evil will sometimes be found to have occasioned it  it is as injudicious for parents to set out with too sanguine a dependence on the merit of their children as it is for them to be discouraged at every repulse when their wishes are defeated in this or that particular instance where they had treasured up some darling expectation this is so far from being a reason for relaxing their attention that it ought to be an additional motive for redoubling it those who hope to do a great deal must not expect to do every thing if they know any thing of the malignity of sin the blindness of prejudice or the corruption of the human heart they will also know that that heart will always remain after the very best possible education full of infirmity and imperfection extraordinary allowances therefore must be made for the weakness of nature in this its weakest state after much is done much will remain to do and much very much will still be left undone for this regulation of the passions and affections cannot be the work of education alone without the concurrence of divine grace operating on the heart why then should parents repine if their efforts are not always crowned with immediate success they should consider that they are not educating cherubims and seraphims but men and women creatures who at their best estate are altogether vanity how little then can be expected from them in the weakness and imbecility of infancy i have dwelt on this part of the subject the longer because i am certain that many who have set out with a warm and active zeal have cooled on the very first discouragement and have afterward almost totally remitted their vigilance through a criminal kind of despair  great allowances must be made for a profusion of gaiety loquacity and even indiscretion in children that there may be animation enough left to supply an active and useful character when the first fermentation of the youthful passions is over and the redundant spirits shall come to subside  if it be true as a consummate judge of human nature has observed that not a vanity is given in vain it is also true that there is scarcely a single passion which may not be turned to some good account if prudently rectified and skilfully turned into the road of some neighboring virtue it cannot be violently bent or unnaturally forced toward an object of a totally opposite nature but may be gradually inclined toward a correspondent but superior affection anger hatred resentment and ambition the most restless and turbulent passions which shake and distract the human soul may be led to become the most active opposers of sin after having been its most successful instruments our anger for instance which can never be totally subdued may be made to turn against ourselves for our weak and imperfect obedience  our hatred against every species of vice  our ambition which will not be discarded may be ennobled it will not change its name but its object it will despise what it lately valued nor be contented to grasp at less than immortality  thus the joys fears hopes desires all the passions and affections which separate in various currents from the soul will if directed into their proper channels after having fertilised wherever they have flowed return again to swell and enrich the parent source  that the very passions which appear the most uncontrollable and unpromising may be intended in the great scheme of providence to answer some important purpose is remarkably evidenced in the character and history of saint paul a remark on this subject by an ingenious old spanish writer which i will here take the liberty to translate will better illustrate my meaning  to convert the bitterest enemy into the most zealous advocate is the work of god for the instruction of man plutarch has observed that the medical science would be brought to the utmost perfection when poison should be converted into physic thus in the mortal disease of judaism and idolatry our blessed lord converted the adders venom of saul the persecutor into that cement which made paul the chosen vessel that manly activity that restless ardor that burning zeal for the law of his fathers that ardent thirst for the blood of christians did the son of god find necessary in the man who was one day to become the defender of his suffering people obras de quevedo vida de san pablo apostol   to win the passions therefore over to the cause of virtue answers a much nobler end than their extinction would possibly do even if that could be effected but it is their nature never to observe a neutrality they are either rebels or auxiliaries and an enemy subdued is an ally obtained if i may be allowed to change the allusion so soon i would say that the passions also resemble fires which are friendly and beneficial when under proper direction but if suffered to blaze without restraint they carry devastation along with them and if totally extinguished leave the benighted mind in a state of cold and comfortless inanity  but in speaking of the usefulness of the passions as instruments of virtue envy and lying must always be excepted these i am persuaded must either go on in still progressive mischief or else be radically cured before any good can be expected from the heart which has been infected with them for i never will believe that envy though passed through all the moral strainers can be refined into a virtuous emulation or lying improved into an agreeable turn for innocent invention almost all the other passions may be made to take an amiable hue but these two must either be totally extirpated or be always contented to preserve their original deformity and to wear their native black  on the importance of religion to the female character various are the reasons why the greater part of mankind cannot apply themselves to arts or letters particular studies are only suited to the capacities of particular persons some are incapable of applying to them from the delicacy of their sex some from the unsteadiness of youth and others from the imbecility of age many are precluded by the narrowness of their education and many by the straitness of their fortune the wisdom of god is wonderfully manifested in this happy and wellordered diversity in the powers and properties of his creatures since by thus admirably suiting the agent to the action the whole scheme of human affairs is carried on with the most agreeing and consistent economy and no chasm is left for want of an object to fill it exactly suited to its nature  but in the great and universal concern of religion both sexes and all ranks are equally interested the truly catholic spirit of christianity accommodates itself with an astonishing condescension to the circumstances of the whole human race it rejects none on account of their pecuniary wants their personal infirmities or their intellectual deficiencies no superiority of parts is the least recommendation nor is any depression of fortune the smallest objection none are too wise to be excused from performing the duties of religion nor are any too poor to be excluded from the consolations of its promises  if we admire the wisdom of god in having furnished different degrees of intelligence so exactly adapted to their different destinations and in having fitted every part of his stupendous work not only to serve its own immediate purpose but also to contribute to the beauty and perfection of the whole how much more ought we to adore that goodness which has perfected the divine plan by appointing one wide comprehensive and universal means of salvation a salvation which all are invited to partake by a means which all are capable of using which nothing but voluntary blindness can prevent our comprehending and nothing but wilful error can hinder us from embracing  the muses are coy and will only be wooed and won by some highlyfavoured suitors the sciences are lofty and will not stoop to the reach of ordinary capacities but wisdom by which the royal preacher means piety is a loving spirit she is easily seen of them that love her and found of all such as seek her nay she is so accessible and condescending that she preventeth them that desire her making herself first known unto them  we are told by the same animated writer that wisdom is the breath of the power of god how infinitely superior in grandeur and sublimity is this description to the origin of the wisdom of the heathens as described by their poets and mythologists in the exalted strains of the hebrew poetry we read that wisdom is the brightness of the everlasting light the unspotted mirror of the power of god and the image of his goodness  the philosophical author of the defense of learning observes that knowledge has something of venom and malignity in it when taken without its proper corrective and what that is the inspired saint paul teaches us by placing it as the immediate antidote knowledge puffs up but charity edifieth perhaps it is the vanity of human wisdom unchastised by this correcting principle which has made so many infidels it may proceed from the arrogance of a selfsufficient pride that some philosophers disdain to acknowledge their belief in a being who has judged proper to conceal from them the infinite wisdom of his counsels who to borrow the lofty language of the man of uz refused to consult them when he laid the foundations of the earth when he shut up the sea with doors and made the clouds the garment thereof  a man must be an infidel either from pride prejudice or bad education he cannot be one unawares or by surprise for infidelity is not occasioned by sudden impulse or violent temptation he may be hurried by some vehement desire into an immoral action at which he will blush in his cooler moments and which he will lament as the sad effect of a spirit unsubdued by religion but infidelity is a calm considerate act which cannot plead the weakness of the heart or the seduction of the senses even good men frequently fail in their duty through the infirmities of nature and the allurements of the world but the infidel errs on a plan on a settled and deliberate principle  but though the minds of men are sometimes fatally infected with this disease either through unhappy prepossession or some of the other causes above mentioned yet i am unwilling to believe that there is in nature so monstrously incongruous a being as a female infidel the least reflection on the temper the character and the education of women makes the mind revolt with horror from an idea so improbable and so unnatural  may i be allowed to observe that in general the minds of girls seem more aptly prepared in their early youth for the reception of serious impressions than those of the other sex and that their less exposed situations in more advanced life qualify them better for the preservation of them the daughters of good parents i mean are often more carefully instructed in their religious duties than the sons and this from a variety of causes they are not so soon sent from under the paternal eye into the bustle of the world and so early exposed to the contagion of bad example their hearts are naturally more flexible soft and liable to any kind of impression the forming hand may stamp on them and lastly as they do not receive the same classical education with boys their feeble minds are not obliged at once to receive and separate the precepts of christianity and the documents of pagan philosophy the necessity of doing this perhaps somewhat weakens the serious impressions of young men at least till the understanding is formed and confuses their ideas of piety by mixing them with so much heterogeneous matter they only casually read or hear read the scriptures of truth while they are obliged to learn by heart construe and repeat the poetical fables of the less than human gods of the ancients and as the excellent author of the internal evidence of the christian religion observes nothing has so much contributed to corrupt the true spirit of the christian institution as that partiality which we contract in our earliest education for the manners of pagan antiquity  girls therefore who do not contract this early partiality ought to have a clearer notion of their religious duties they are not obliged at an age when the judgment is so weak to distinguish between the doctrines of zeno of epicurus and of christ and to embarrass their minds with the various morals which were taught in the porch in the academy and on the mount  it is presumed that these remarks cannot possibly be so misunderstood as to be construed into the least disrespect to literature or a want of the highest reverence for a learned education the basis of all elegant knowledge they are only intended with all proper deference to point out to young women that however inferior their advantages of acquiring a knowledge of the belleslettres are to those of the other sex yet it depends on themselves not to be surpassed in this most important of all studies for which their abilities are equal and their opportunities perhaps greater  but the mere exemption from infidelity is so small a part of the religious character that i hope no one will attempt to claim any merit from this negative sort of goodness or value herself merely for not being the very worst thing she possibly can be let no mistaken girl fancy she gives a proof of her wit by her want of piety or that a contempt of things serious and sacred will exalt her understanding or raise her character even in the opinion of the most avowed male infidels for one may venture to affirm that with all their profligate ideas both of women and of religion neither bolingbroke wharton buckingham nor even lord chesterfield himself would have esteemed a woman the more for her being irreligious  with whatever ridicule a polite freethinker may affect to treat religion himself he will think it necessary his wife should entertain different notions of it he may pretend to despise it as a matter of opinion depending on creeds and systems but if he is a man of sense he will know the value of it as a governing principle which is to influence her conduct and direct her actions if he sees her unaffectedly sincere in the practice of her religious duties it will be a secret pledge to him that she will be equally exact in fulfilling the conjugal for he can have no reasonable dependence on her attachment to him if he has no opinion of her fidelity to god for she who neglects first duties gives but an indifferent proof of her disposition to fill up inferior ones and how can a man of any understanding whatever his own religious professions may be trust that woman with the care of his family and the education of his children who wants herself the best incentive to a virtuous life the belief that she is an accountable creature and the reflection that she has an immortal soul  cicero spoke it as the highest commendation of catos character that he embraced philosophy not for the sake of disputing like a philosopher but of living like one the chief purpose of christian knowledge is to promote the great end of a christian life every rational woman should no doubt be able to give a reason of the hope that is in her but this knowledge is best acquired and the duties consequent on it best performed by reading books of plain piety and practical devotion and not by entering into the endless feuds and engaging in the unprofitable contentions of partial controversialists nothing is more unamiable than the narrow spirit of party zeal nor more disgusting than to hear a woman deal out judgments and denounce vengeance against any one who happens to differ from her in some opinion perhaps of no real importance and which it is probable she may be just as wrong in rejecting as the object of her censure is in embracing a furious and unmerciful female bigot wanders as far beyond the limits prescribed to her sex as a thalestris or a joan darc violent debate has made as few converts as the sword and both these instruments are particularly unbecoming when wielded by a female hand  but though no one will be frightened out of their opinions yet they may be persuaded out of them they may be touched by the affecting earnestness of serious conversation and allured by the attractive beauty of a consistently serious life and while a young woman ought to dread the name of a wrangling polemic it is her duty to aspire after the honorable character of a sincere christian but this dignified character she can by no means deserve if she is ever afraid to avow her principles or ashamed to defend them a profligate who makes it a point to ridicule every thing which comes under the appearance of formal instruction will be disconcerted at the spirited yet modest rebuke of a pious young woman but there is as much efficacy in the manner of reproving profaneness as in the words if she corrects it with moroseness she defeats the effect of her remedy by her unskilful manner of administering it if on the other hand she affects to defend the insulted cause of god in a faint tone of voice and studied ambiguity of phrase or with an air of levity and a certain expression of pleasure in her eyes which proves she is secretly delighted with what she pretends to censure she injures religion much more than he did who publicly profaned it for she plainly indicates either that she does not believe or respect what she professes the other attacked it as an open foe she betrays it as a false friend no one pays any regard to the opinion of an avowed enemy but the desertion or treachery of a professed friend is dangerous indeed  it is a strange notion which prevails in the world that religion only belongs to the old and the melancholy and that it is not worth while to pay the least attention to it while we are capable of attending to any thing else they allow it to be proper enough for the clergy whose business it is and for the aged who have not spirits for any business at all but till they can prove that none except the clergy and the aged die it must be confessed that this is most wretched reasoning  great injury is done to the interests of religion by placing it in a gloomy and unamiable light it is sometimes spoken of as if it would actually make a handsome woman ugly or a young one wrinkled but can any thing be more absurd than to represent the beauty of holiness as the source of deformity  there are few perhaps so entirely plunged in business or absorbed in pleasure as not to intend at some future time to set about a religious life in good earnest but then they consider it as a kind of dernier ressort and think it prudent to defer flying to this disagreeable refuge till they have no relish left for any thing else do they forget that to perform this great business well requires all the strength of their youth and all the vigor of their unimpaired capacities to confirm this assertion they may observe how much the slightest indisposition even in the most active season of life disorders every faculty and disqualifies them for attending to the most ordinary affairs and then let them reflect how little able they will be to transact the most important of all business in the moment of excruciating pain or in the day of universal debility  when the senses are palled with excessive gratification when the eye is tired with seeing and the ear with hearing when the spirits are so sunk that the grasshopper is become a burden how shall the blunted apprehension be capable of understanding a new science or the wornout heart be able to relish a new pleasure  to put off religion till we have lost all taste for amusement to refuse listening to the voice of the charmer till our enfeebled organs can no longer listen to the voice of singing men and singing women and not to devote our days to heaven till we have no pleasure in them ourselves is but an ungracious offering and it is a wretched sacrisice to the god of heaven to present him with the remnants of decayed appetites and the leavings of extinguished passions  miscellaneous observations on genius taste good sense etc the author begs leave to offer an apology for introducing this essay which she fears may be thought foreign to her purpose but she hopes that her earnest desire of exciting a taste for literature in young ladies which encouraged her to hazard the following remarks will not obstruct her general design even if it does not actually promote it  good sense is as different from genius as perception is from invention yet though distinct qualities they frequently subsist together it is altogether opposite to wit but by no means inconsistent with it it is not science for there is such a thing as unlettered good sense yet though it is neither wit learning nor genius it is a substitute for each where they do not exist and the perfection of all where they do  good sense is so far from deserving the appellation of common sense by which it is frequently called that it is perhaps one of the rarest qualities of the human mind if indeed this name is given it in respect to its peculiar suitableness to the purposes of common life there is great propriety in it good sense appears to differ from taste in this that taste is an instantaneous decision of the mind a sudden relish of what is beautiful or disgust at what is defective in an object without waiting for the slower confirmation of the judgment good sense is perhaps that confirmation which establishes a suddenly conceived idea or feeling by the powers of comparing and reflecting they differ also in this that taste seems to have a more immediate reference to arts to literature and to almost every object of the senses while good sense rises to moral excellence and exerts its influence on life and manners taste is fitted to the perception and enjoyment of whatever is beautiful in art or nature good sense to the improvement of the conduct and the regulation of the heart  yet the term good sense is used indiscriminately to express either a finished taste for letters or an invariable prudence in the affairs of life it is sometimes applied to the most moderate abilities in which case the expression is certainly too strong and at others to the most shining when it is as much too weak and inadequate a sensible man is the usual but unappropriated phrase for every degree in the scale of understanding from the sober mortal who obtains it by his decent demeanor and solid dullness to him whose talents qualify him to rank with a bacon a harris or a johnson  genius is the power of invention and imitation it is an incommunicable faculty no art or skill of the possessor can bestow the smallest portion of it on another no pains or labor can reach the summit of perfection where the seeds of it are wanting in the mind yet it is capable of infinite improvement where it actually exists and is attended with the highest capacity of communicating instruction as well as delight to others  it is the peculiar property of genius tostrike out great or beautiful things it is the felicity of good sense not to do absurd ones genius breaks out in splendid sentiments and elevated ideas good sense confines its more circumscribed but perhaps more useful walk within the limits of prudence and propriety  the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling does glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poets pen turns them to shape and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name this is perhaps the finest picture of human genius that ever was drawn by a human pencil it presents a living image of a creative imagination or a power of inventing things which have no actual existence  with superficial judges who it must be confessed make up the greater part of the mass of mankind talents are only liked or understood to a certain degree lofty ideas are above the reach of ordinary apprehensions the vulgar allow those who possess them to be in a somewhat higher state of mind than themselves but of the vast gulf which separates them they have not the least conception they acknowledge a superiority but of its extent they neither know the value nor can conceive the reality it is true the mind as well as the eye can take in objects larger than itself but this is only true of great minds for a man of low capacity who considers a consummate genius resembles one who seeing a column for the first time and standing at too great a distance to take in the whole of it concludes it to be flat or like one unacquainted with the first principles of philosophy who finding the sensible horizon appear a plain surface can form no idea of the spherical form of the whole which he does not see and laughs at the account of antipodes which he cannot comprehend  whatever is excellent is also rare what is useful is more common how many thousands are born qualified for the coarse employments of life for one who is capable of excelling in the fine arts yet so it ought to be because our natural wants are more numerous and more importunate than the intellectual  whenever it happens that a man of distinguished talents has been drawn by mistake or precipitated by passion into any dangerous indiscretion it is common for those whose coldness of temper has supplied the place and usurped the name of prudence to boast of their own steadier virtue and triumph in their own superior caution only because they have never been assailed by a temptation strong enough to surprise them into error and with what a visible appropriation of the character to themselves do they constantly conclude with a cordial compliment to common sense they point out the beauty and usefulness of this quality so forcibly and explicitly that you cannot possibly mistake whose picture they are drawing with so flattering a pencil the unhappy man whose conduct has been so feelingly arraigned perhaps acted from good though mistaken motives at least from motives of which his censurer has not capacity to judge but the event was unfavourable nay the action might be really wrong and the vulgar maliciously take the opportunity of this single indiscretion to lift themselves nearer on a level with a character which except in this instance has always thrown them at the most disgraceful and mortifying distance  the elegant biographer of collins in his affecting apology for that unfortunate genius remarks that the gifts of imagination bring the heaviest task on the vigilance of reason and to bear those faculties with unerring rectitude or invariable propriety requires a degree of firmness and of cool attention which does not always attend the higher gifts of the mind yet difficult as nature herself seems to have rendered the task of regularity to genius it is the supreme consolation of dullness and of folly to point with gothic triumph to those excesses which are the overflowing of faculties they never enjoyed  what the greater part of the world mean by common sense will be generally found on a closer enquiry to be art fraud or selfishness that sort of saving prudence which makes men extremely attentive to their own safety or profit diligent in the pursuit of their own pleasures or interests and perfectly at their ease as to what becomes of the rest of mankind furies where their own property is concerned philosophers when nothing but the good of others is at stake and perfectly resigned under all calamities but their own  when we see so many accomplished wits of the present age as remarkable for the decorum of their lives as for the brilliancy of their writings we may believe that next to principle it is owing to their good sense which regulates and chastises their imaginations the vast conceptions which enable a true genius to ascend the sublimest heights may be so connected with the stronger passions as to give it a natural tendency to fly off from the strait line of regularity till good sense acting on the fancy makes it gravitate powerfully toward that virtue which is its proper center  add to this when it is considered with what imperfection the divine wisdom has thought sit to stamp every thing human it will be found that excellence and infirmity are so inseparably wound up in each other that a man derives the soreness of temper and irritability of nerve which make him uneasy to others and unhappy in himself from those exquisite feelings and that elevated pitch of thought by which as the apostle expresses it on a more serious cccasion he is as it were out of the body  it is not astonishing therefore when the spirit is carried away by the magnificence of its own ideas not touched but rapt not wakened but inspired that the frail body which is the natural victim of pain disease and death should not always be able to follow the mind in its aspiring flights but should be as imperfect as if it belonged only to an ordinary soul  besides might not providence intend to humble human pride by presenting to our eyes so mortifying a view of the weakness and infirmity of even his best work perhaps man who is already but a little lower than the angels might like the revolted spirits totally have shaken off obedience and submission to his creator had not god wisely tempered human excellence with a certain consciousness of its own imperfection but though this inevitable alloy of weakness may frequently be found in the best characters yet how can that be the source of triumph and exaltation to any which if properly weighed must be the deepest motive of humiliation to all a goodnatured man will be so far from rejoicing that he will be secretly troubled whenever he reads that the greatest roman moralist was tainted with avarice and the greatest british philosopher with venality  it is remarked by pope in his essay on criticism that ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss but i apprehend it does not therefore follow that to judge is more difficult than to write if this were the case the critic would be superior to the poet whereas it appears to be directly the contrary the critic says the great champion of shakespeare but fashions the body of a work the poet must add the soul which gives force and direction to its actions and gestures it should seem that the reason why so many more judge wrong than write ill is because the number of readers is beyond all proportion greater than the number of writers every man who reads is in some measure a critic and with very common abilities may point out real faults and material errors in a very well written book but it by no means follows that he is able to write any thing comparable to the work which he is capable of censuring and unless the numbers of those who write and of those who judge were more equal the calculation seems not to be quite fair  a capacity for relishing works of genius is the indubitable sign of a good taste but if a proper disposition and ability to enjoy the compositions of others entitle a man to the claim of reputation it is still a far inferior degree of merit to his who can invent and produce those compositions the bare disquisition of which gives the critic no small share of fame  the president of the royal academy in his admirable discourse on imitation has set the folly of depending on unassisted genius in the clearest light and has shown the necessity of adding the knowledge of others to our own native powers in his usual striking and masterly manner the mind says he is a barren soil is a soil soon exhausted and will produce no crop or only one unless it be continually fertilized and enriched with foreign matter  yet it has been objected that study is a great enemy to originality but even if this were true it would perhaps be as well that an author should give us the ideas of still better writers mixed and assimilated with the matter in his own mind as those crude and undigested thoughts which he values under the notion that they are original the sweetest honey neither tastes of the rose the honeysuckle nor the carnation yet it is compounded of the very essence of them all  if in the other fine arts this accumulation of knowledge is necessary it is indispensably so in poetry it is a fatal rashness for any one to trust too much to their own stock of ideas he must invigorate them by exercise polish them by conversation and increase them by every species of elegant and virtuous knowledge and the mind will not fail to reproduce with interest those seeds which are sown in it by study and observation above all let every one guard against the dangerous opinion that he knows enough an opinion that will weaken the energy and reduce the powers of the mind which though once perhaps vigorous and effectual will be sunk to a state of literary imbecility by cherishing vain and presumptuous ideas of its own independence  for instance it may not be necessary that a poet should be deeply skilled in the linnaean system but it must be allowed that a general acquaintance with plants and flowers will furnish him with a delightful and profitable species of instruction he is not obliged to trace nature in all her nice and varied operations with the minute accuracy of a boil or the laborious investigation of a newton but his good sense will point out to him that no inconsiderable portion of philosophical knowledge is requisite to the completion of his literart character the sciences are more independent and require little or no assistance from the graces of poetry but poetry if she would charm and instruct must not be so haughty she must be contented to borrow of the sciences many of her choicest allusions and many of her most graceful embellishments and does it not magnify the character of true poesy that she includes within herself all the scattered graces of every separate art  the rules of the great masters in criticism may not be so necessary to the forming a good taste as the examination of those original mines from whence they drew their treasures of knowledge  the three celebrated essays on the art of poetry do not teach so much by their laws as by their examples the dead letter of their rules is less instructive than the living spirit of their verse yet these rules are to a young poet what the study of logarithms is to a young mathematician they do not so much contribute to form his judgment as afford him the satisfaction of convincing him that he is right they do not preclude the difficulty of the operation but at the conclusion of it furnish him with a fuller demonstration that he has proceeded on proper principles when he has well studied the masters in whose schools the first critics formed themselves and fancies he has caught a spark of their divine flame it may be a good method to try his own compositions by the test of the critic rules so far indeed as the mechanism of poetry goes if the examination be fair and candid this trial like the touch of ithuriels spear will detect every latent error and bring to light every favorite failing  good taste always suits the measure of its admiration to the merit of the composition it examines it accommodates its praises or its censure to the excellence of a work and appropriates it to the nature of it general applause or indiscriminate abuse is the sign of a vulgar understanding there are certain blemishes which the judicious and goodnatured reader will heartily overlook but the false sublime the tumor which is intended for greatness the distorted figure the puerile conceit and the incongruous metaphor these are defects for which scarcely any other kind of merit can atone and yet there may be more hope of a writer especially if he be a a young one who is now and then guilty of some of these faults than of one who avoids them all not through judgment but feebleness and who instead of deviating into error is continually falling short of excellence the mere absence of error implies that moderate and inferior degree of merit with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic taste will be better satisfied than with the magnificent irregularities of exalted spirits it stretches some minds to an uneasy extension to be obliged to attend to compositions superlatively excellent and it contracts liberal souls to a painful narrowness to descend to books of inferior merit a work of capital genius to a man of an ordinary mind is the bed of procrustes to one of a short stature the man is too little to fill up the space assigned him and undergoes the torture in attempting it and a moderate or low production to a man of bright talents is the punishment inflicted by mezentius the living spirit has too much animation to endure patiently to be in contact with a dead body  taste seems to be a sentiment of the soul which gives the bias to opinion for we feel before we reflect without this sentiment all knowledge learning and opinion would be cold inert materials whereas they become active principles when stirred kindled and inflamed by this animating quality  there is another feeling which is called enthusiasm the enthusiasm of sensible hearts is so strong that it not only yields to the impulse with which striking objects act on it but such hearts help on the effect by their own sensibility in a scene where shakespeare and garrick give perfection to each other the feeling heart does not merely accede to the delirium they occasion it does more it is enamoured of it it solicits the delusion it sues to be deceived and grudgingly cherishes the sacred treasure of its feelings the poet and performer concur in carrying us beyond this visible diurnal sphere they bear us aloft in their airy course with unresisted rapidity if they meet not with any obstruction from the coldness of our own feelings perhaps only a few fine spirits can enter into the detail of their writing and acting but the multitude do not enjoy less acutely because they are not able philosophically to analyze the sources of their joy or sorrow if the others have the advantage of judging these have at least the privilege of feeling and it is not from complaisance to a few leading judges that they burst into peals of laughter or melt into delightful agony their hearts decide and that is a decision from which there lies no appeal it must however be confessed that the nicer separations of character and the lighter and almost imperceptible shades which sometimes distinguish them will not be intimately relished unless there be a consonancy of taste as well as feeling in the spectator though where the passions are principally concerned the profane vulgar come in for a larger portion of the universal delight than critics and connoisseurs are willing to allow them  yet enthusiasm though the natural concomitant of genius is no more genius itself than drunkenness is cheerfulness and that enthusiasm which discovers itself on occasions not worthy to excite it is the mark of a wretched judgment and a false taste  nature produces innumerable objects to imitate them is the province of genius to direct those imitations is the property of judgment to decide on their effects is the business of taste for taste who sits as supreme judge on the productions of genius is not satisfied when she merely imitates nature she must also says an ingenious french writer imitate beautiful nature it requires no less judgment to reject than to choose and genius might imitate what is vulgar under pretense that it was natural if taste did not carefully point out those objects which are most proper for imitation it also requires a very nice discernment to distinguish verisimilitude from truth for there is a truth in taste nearly as conclusive as demonstration in mathematics  genius when in the full impetuosity of its career often touches on the very brink of error and is perhaps never so near the verge of the precipice as when indulging its sublimest flights it is in those great but dangerous moments that the curb of vigilant judgment is most wanting while safe and sober dullness observes one tedious and insipid round of tiresome uniformity and steers equally clear of eccentricity and of beauty dullness has few redundancies to retrench few luxuriancies to prune and few irregularities to smooth these though errors are the errors of genius for there is rarely redundancy without plenitude or irregularity without greatness the excesses of genius may easily be retrenched but the deficiencies of dullness can never be supplied  those who copy from others will doubtless be less excellent than those who copy from nature to imitate imitators is the way to depart too far from the great original herself the latter copies of an engraving retain fainter and fainter traces of the subject to which the earlier impressions bore so strong a resemblance  it seems very extraordinary that it should be the most difficult thing in the world to be natural and that it should be harder to hit off the manners of real life and to delineate such characters as we converse with every day than to imagine such as do not exist but caricature is much easier than an exact outline and the coloring of fancy less difficult than that of truth  people do not always know what taste they have till it is awakened by some corresponding object nay genius itself is a fire which in many minds would never blaze if not kindled by some external cause  nature that munificent mother when she bestows the power of judging accompanies it with the capacity of enjoying the judgment which is clear sighted points out such objects as are calculated to inspire love and the heart instantaneously attaches itself to whatever is lovely  in regard to literary reputation a great deal depends on the state of learning in the particular age or nation in which an author lives in a dark and ignorant period moderate knowledge will entitle its possessor to a considerable share of fame whereas to be distinguished in a polite and lettered age requires striking parts and deep erudition  when a nation begins to emerge from a state of mental darkness and to strike out the first rudiments of improvement it chalks out a few strong but incorrect sketches gives the rude outlines of general art and leaves the filling up to the leisure of happier days and the refinement of more enlightened times their drawing is a rude sbozzo and their poetry wild minstrelsy  perfection of taste is a point which a nation no sooner reaches than it overshoots and it is more difficult to return to it after having passed it than it was to attain when they fell short of it where the arts begin to languish after having flourished they feldom indeed fall back to their original barbarism but a certain feebleness of exertion takes place and it is more difficult to recover them from this dying languor to their proper strength than it was to polish them from their former redeness for it is a less formidable undertaking to refine barbarity than to stop decay the first may be labored into elegance but the latter will rarely be strengthened into vigor  taste exerts itself at first but feebly and imperfectly it is repressed and kept back by a crowd of the most discouraging prejudices like an infant prince who though born to reign yet holds an idle scepter which he has not power to use but is obliged to see with the eyes and hear through the ears of other men  a writer of correct taste will hardly ever go out of his way even in search of embellishment he will study to attain the best end by the most natural means for he knows that what is not natural cannot be beautiful and that nothing can be beautiful out of its own place for an improper situation will convert the most striking beauty into a glaring defect when by a wellconnected chain of ideas or a judicious succession of events the reader is snatched to thebes or athens what can be more impertinent than for the poet to obstruct the operation of the passion he has just been kindling by introducing a conceit which contradicts his purpose and interrupts his business indeed we cannot be transported even in idea to those places if the poet does not manage so adroitly as not to make us sensible of the journey the instant we feel we are traveling the writers art fails and the delirium is at an end  proserpine says ovid would have been restored to her mother ceres had not ascalaphus seen her stop to gather a golden apple when the terms of her restoration were that she should taste nothing a story pregnant with instruction for lively writers who by neglecting the main business and going out of the way for false gratifications lose sight of the end they should principally keep in view it was this false taste that introduced the numberless concetti which disgrace the brightest of the italian poets and this is the reason why the reader only feels short and interrupted snatches of delight in perusing the brilliant but unequal compositions of ariosto instead of that unbroken and undiminished pleasure which he constantly receives from virgil from milton and generally from tasso the firstmentioned italian is the atalanta who will interrupt the most eager career to pick up the glittering mischief while the mantuan and the british bards like hippomenes press on warm in the pursuit and unseduced by temptation  a writer of real taste will take great pains in the perfection of his style to make the reader believe that he took none at all the writing which appears to be most easy will be generally found to be least imitable the most elegant verses are the most easily retained they fasten themselves on the memory without its making any effort to preserve them and we are apt to imagine that what is remembered with ease was written without difficulty  to conclude genius is a rare and precious gem of which few know the worth it is sitter for the cabinet of the connoisseur than for the commerce of mankind good sense is a bankbill convenient for change negotiable at all times and current in all places it knows the value of small things and considers that an aggregate of them makes up the sum of human affairs it elevates common concerns into matters of importance by performing them in the best manner and at the most suitable season good sense carries with it the idea of equality while genius is always suspected of a design to impose the burden of superiority and respect is paid to it with that reluctance which always attends other imposts the lower orders of mankind generally repining most at demands by which they are least liable to be affected  as it is the character of genius to penetrate with a lynxs beam into unfathomable abysses and uncreated worlds and to see what is not so it is the property of good sense to distinguish perfectly and judge accurately what really is good sense has not so piercing an eye but it has as clear a sight it does not penetrate so deeply but as far as it does see it discerns distinctly good sense is a judicious mechanic who can produce beauty and convenience out of suitable means but genius i speak with reverence of the immeasurable distance bears some remote resemblance to the divine architect who produced perfection of beauty without any visible materials who spoke and it was created who said let it be and it was  the end lately published by the same author ode to dragon mr garricks housedog at hampton price  d sir
