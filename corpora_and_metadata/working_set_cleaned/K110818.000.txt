the description and use of dr leakes forceps vindicated  price one shilling  a vindication of the forceps described and recommended by dr leake in which the injudicious and illiberal remarks on that subject signed thomas denman are examined and refuted  by a late pupil of dr leakes  london printed for j hinton in paternosterrow  m dcc lxxiv  to dr thomas denman it is now above three years since dr leake published a description of his new forceps with three blades together with an elegant copperplate print of that instrument from this publication though attended with considerable expense he derived no advantage since it was chiefly intended as a compliment to his pupils and to such other gentlemen of the profession as were particularly engaged in the province of midwifery it is true when his introductory lecture was lately published his paper on the forceps was annexed to it but without being mentioned in the advertisement or making any addition to the price of this i can speak with confidence as i had at that time the pleasure of attending the doctors lectures and was therefore well acquainted with the truth of the particulars which i now mention i was likewise one of the many who from the principles on which it was recommended thought this a valuable addition to the apparatus of midwifery nor has my experience of its use in practice hitherto failed to confirm this opinion but the merit of dr leakes forceps rests on a much better foundation than any thing i can pretend to advance in its favor many of the best accoucheurs both at home and abroad have been pleased to commend it as a considerable improvement many commissions were soon received by the instrumentmakers for sending it to different quarters and to my certain knowledge it has been for some time past a familiar instrument in the hands of several practitioners of the first name in france russia and holland as well as great britain and ireland  with so many and such respectable suffrages in its favor i thought the credit and use of the new forceps had been universally established till i was lately convinced by perusing your remarks on that instrument that there was at least one dissenting voice when or in what manner these remarks were first ushered into light i will not take upon me to say but i am apt to think they had a clandestine birth as i do not remember to have seen them advertised in the usual way a circumstance which would not have readily escaped me as my fondness for improvement especially at so great a distance from town makes me always very attentive to the article of new publications it was by mere accident therefore and only very lately that i had the happy opportunity of seeing this striking specimen of your candor and literary talents and as soon as i had glanced it over i was determined to employ my first intervals of leisure from the duties of my profession in vindicating dr leake from so illiberal and injurious an attack together with this motive you may attribute as much as you please to the vanity of a young man whom you may suspect perhaps of seeking for an occasion to try his strength in the lists of controversy and indeed to be perfectly ingenuous with you on this head i will frankly own that so far as it may be natural to take courage from the weakness of an adversary i did think i could never hope for a better opportunity of making a first essay with so little hazard to my reputation  in censuring dr leakes forceps which you are pleased to declare an ineffectual as well as a dangerous instrument you allege the public good as your sole inducement for undertaking the trouble of your precious remarks upon it this is certainly a good plea and worthy of a good man but it has been so often hackneyed and abused that we are sometimes apt to suspect a counterfeit it is a convenient pretense however when a man is either ashamed or afraid to avow his real motives and in the present case it would not perhaps be difficult to assign others but as this may be a matter of conjecture only i shall not insist upon it as i would not wish to attack even an ungenerous adversary by the sly method of insinuation  allowing you therefore the full merit of your pretended zeal for the public safety let me ask you why you did not sound the alarm sooner when as you say and would have it believed there was so much impending danger and such dreadful consequences to be apprehended from the use of this instrument let me still further ask you why at length these benevolent remarks of yours were not exhibited to the world in a public and open manner instead as i am informed of being privately handed about among such young and unexperienced gentlemen of the profession as were not competent judges of the subject did you mean that the poison conveyed in this artful and insidious manner should have time to operate and produce it effects before an antidote could be administered  as every man has an undoubted right to approve or disapprove of whatever is presented to public view i by no means blame you for making dr leakes forceps a subject of enquiry provided you had done it in the way of a candid examination founded on the evidence of his own description a mode of trial to which no author can reasonably object and to which every one has an undeniable claim but how far you have done justice to that gentleman in your quotations or the conclusions you draw from them will be left to the following strictures and the readers judgment without farther anticipation  you will please to observe sir that contrary to your method i shall quote and examine those your remarks fairly without perverting your meaning where that is to be found or omitting one part and inserting another as best suits my purpose i must likewise inform you that in quoting an author you have no right either to alter the diction or transpose the sentences especially in points of controversy because from thence may arise an alteration in the sense which may wholly misrepresent the original meaning both which you have frequently done without ceremony in your remarks on dr leakes paper on the new forceps with the skilful and candid i believe that paper might very safely have been left to vindicate itself but least your remarks puerile and superficial as they are should chance to mislead the unexperienced who sometimes mistake sound for sense i will proceed to examine and place them in their proper point of view  i shall pass over in a general way the selfconceit and finical precision as well as the childish vanity and formal parade with which you are pleased to bring forth your elaborate trifle which examined in all its parts will appear to every eye but your own a shapeless abortion deformed unfinished and sent before its time  in the first article of your remarks you take the liberty to assert that dr leakes description of the forceps is not correct but in what manner you make good that assertion the reader will best be able to judge from an exact quotation of his description compared with your own  dr leakes description of the forceps is as follows the forceps used in midwifery may be considered as an instrument consisting of two levers which act in contrary directions from one common center or fulcrum where their blades unite and are sustained by each other consequently their power on the body to be moved will be in proportion to the length of their levers or handles  the following in your description the forceps ought to be considered as an instrument consisting of two levers acting alternately from two centres which are those parts of the childs head undergoing the greatest friction  to speak thus is to assert that the forceps which is the active body finds a fulcrum or resting point upon the childs head which is wholly passive being the very part which is to be extracted i should be glad to ask how the childs head can be the part from which the blades act since it is demonstratively the part acted upon a very slender knowledge of mechanics might have taught you that every lever must necessarily act from its center of motion but on the contrary if the childs head afforded a center of motion to the blades of the forceps as you assert then it would follow that those blades considered as levers would not act from but toward their center of motion a thing so contrary to reason and common sense as to deserve no further attention in a word sir you have palpably confounded the idea of the part acted upon by the lever with that of the part from which it acts but perhaps you are about to establish some new principle in mechanics which may solve this paradox and prove that an active and a passive body is one and the same thing  you say  it is true that with respect to themselves viz the blades the center of motion will be at that part where they unite but when in the hands of the operator and containing a body within their curve the alternate motion necessary for the extraction of that body through a small space changes the whole circumstance  it is wholly inconsistent and improper thus to talk of motion or a center of motion in a body the forceps which as above you are describing totally at rest that is unemployed and not in the hands of the operator  again you say that when the blades are really in the hands of the operator then the whole circumstance is changed  without doubt the circumstance is changed but not at all in the manner you apprehend for if the blades contain a body within their curve the action for the extraction of that body must still be derived from their junction as a resting point otherwise they would want a fulcrum and therefore could not act at all  if this is difficult to be understood you may if you please suppose two blades without such junction to be passed up along the childs head and as these blades could not possibly then be locked they would not act on the childs head and consequently it could not be extracted  besides the blades of the forceps considered as two levers do not act alternately as you tell us for as both of them closely and equally embrace the childs head the one cannot possibly be made to act without the other their action therefore is not alternate but simultaneous  such frivolous and farfetched objections show that you have taken great pains to find them out and that you have been at whip and spur in pursuit of game but like an unskilful huntsman who mistakes the mettle of his stead as well as his own you have unfortunately quite unhorsed yourself in attempting the five bargate upon the whole either your knowledge of mechanics should have been greater or your presumption less in contradicting established and selfevident principles  so much for your accuracy and skill i shall next quote your second article verbatim as a curious specimen of your candor and the respect due to your superiors  reader please to attend to the following modest assertion  professors have generally misled us in the persuit of practical knowledge being too often of that order of men who are the bane of real improvement inquirunt says dr harvey non quomodo res sunt sed quid alii dicunt  if such professors are any where to be found your preceding remarks evidently show that you have no small title to be included in their number nomine mutato de te fabula narratur in a word if such reflections in one of real consequence whose judgment was ripened by time and experience would justly be thought uncommonly presuming and so replete with arrogance as to have got the better of both prudence and decency  what then shall be said of  dr thomas denman  thus you proceed  i believe there are reasons for suspecting that m crantz is but little qualified for laying down rules for the use of instruments in midwifery and m levrette is not unexceptionable authority  you ought to have mentioned those reasons at large otherwise an affertion so rude and injurious on your own authority only is claiming more credit than the reader may be willing to allow you for you must know that m crantz was an eminent professor of midwifery at vienna and that he wrote judiciously on the use of instruments in his dissert de re instrumentaria in art obstetricaria a book very necessary for your perusal  m levrette you say is not unexceptionable authority  if none but yours is opposed to it i believe it will remain unexceptionable to tell any other of the profession but yourself who levrette was would be unnecessary but as you have spelt his name wrong as often as you have had occasion to mention it it appears you have no better acquaintance with him than with the former gentleman whom you have so uncivilly censured levret of paris is sufficiently known throughout europe both by his writings and public lectures in short the merit and judgment of the two respectable authors in question are so universally acknowledged and their reputation so superior to your insignificant cavils that the present circumstance would be apt to put one in mind of a villagecur barking at the moon  i shall now proceed to quote the substance of what dr leake has advanced and to examine the propriety and validity of your remarks on the present subject  in his description of the forceps he speaks thus   h crantz professor of midwifery at vienna and levret of paris both observe that when the childs head is wedged within the bones of the pelvis capite incuneato it can scarcely ever be extracted by the common forceps recommended by smellie because of their shortness and as their blades are only curved in one direction whenever it happens that the hindhead is forced over the symphysis of the pubes it cannot be got hold of within the curve of the blades which being only applied along the ears in a straight direction are therefore apt to slip downwards over the face and to foil the operator in the extraction of the head this will the rather happen because they are made taper toward their points which will diminish their contact on the head and prevent them from taking a firm hold  so that they are the least serviceable in those very cases where they are the most wanted  that is where the pelvis is narrow for it must be allowed of all difficulties that which happens from the above cause is by far the most insurmountable obstacle to the birth since it can only be overcome by very strong pains which compress the head and force it to conform to the bony passage  your remarks on the preceding paragraph are as follows  when the head is incuneatum enclavee or wedged in the pelvis it is a case in which forceps of any kind cannot be used with prudence if we did try them we should happily miscarry in the attempt for if we succeeded dreadful would be the consequence to the parts of the mother crushed between the childs head and forceps on one hand and the bones of the pelvis on the other  the reader is here presented with a dish of all sorts  a perfect oleo but without a single grain of salt or seasoning curiously garnished with fresh rhetorical flowers but of the exotic kind such as that of miscarrying happily success being attended with dreadful consequences etc  you tell us that the doctrine of applying forceps before the bulk of the head has passed the superior aperture of the pelvis carries great danger and insurmountable difficulties on the face of it those who have endeavored to reduce it to practice for it is an old and obsolete doctrine have in their accounts given us histories of their attempting it of the difficulties they met with of the mischiefs they did and a retraction of their errors  according to your account this doctrine wears a very frightful and gorgonlike countenance  alas poor prostituted word doctrine how miserably art thou profaned and misapplied i fear thou will next be tacked to the method of making peasepottage or manufacturing muttonpies but to be serious was it not doing injustice to john bunyan by the comparison i should think i had been reading his description of the pilgrims progress through the vale of tears  when the greatest bulk of the head has passed the superior aperture of the pelvis the greatest difficulty is over as appears by the following quotation from dr leake and therefore the forceps are seldom ever then necessary except floodings or other dangerous symptoms should suddenly exhaust the patients strength  the short forceps may indeed be effectually applied when the childs head is low in the pelvis but where that is the case artificial assistance is seldom necessary the principal difficulty being then over and should any still remain it will now be removed by the concurrence of two causes viz the inferior parts of the pelvis will gradually dilate and give way to the pressure of the head which at the same time will be squeezed into a longitudinal form and therefore its transverse diameter in respect to the passage will become considerably less and less both which circumstances have a manifest tendency to facilitate the birth  those then and such like your remarks are more than sufficiently answered by the following quotation from dr leakes paper which shows the necessity and propriety of the practice he recommends and also that he was not unaware of cavil and criticism  i know that the application of the forceps is objected to by some till after the head has got below the brim of the pelvis on the supposition that the force applied to bring it down would prove injurious to the mother  but will not the violent and long continued compression of the soft parts viz the vagina and neck of the bladder etc when squeezed between the head and bones of the pelvis as two solid bodies be much more liable to endanger the patient  since instances may be found where a mortification has been the consequence and where the child which always suffers in proportion was also born dead  in cases therefore extremely laborious when the head is large  the pelvis narrow or both  where the patients strength is exhausted by a flooding  where she is suddenly attacked with convulsions faintings or other alarming symptoms and consequently where the labor pains are insufficient to bring forth the child the long double curved forceps hereafter described may be used with great safety and advantage either with or without the lever or third blade as occasion may require  every one who has had much experience knows that it is often improper as well as difficult and dangerous to turn the child and sometimes even impracticable without bursting the uterus or applying so much violence as might be fatal to the mother and to open the head of a living infant before the long forceps and every other expedient had been tried in vain would surely be deemed rash and unnatural practice  it may be observed that whatever dr leake recommends he always gives his reasons for it but what you advance is only mere matter of assertion or if you attempt any thing further such is your success that what you endeavor to prove still remains to be proved by some other person  the question is  what should be done for the safety of the mother when her strength is exhausted and her pains insufficient to bring the child so that she is every moment in danger of dying undelivered  dr leake admits there is danger in the operation but at the same time shows why there is much more when it is neglected and therefore of two evils the least is to be chosen especially since there is no other alternative than that one of killing the child by opening its head for he has shown that smellies forceps are much too short to reach and extract it thus situated and that it is by no means eligible to turn the child so that all you have been able to advance against this practice is mere invective being nothing but a few formidable epithets to excite horror and to deter the weak and timorous from using the forceps recommended by dr leake and lest his ingenious invention of combining the action of the forceps and lever should chance to pluck a feather out of your wing  you talk of dreadful consequences and crushing of heads as others would talk of cracking nuts but if such reasoning as this could prevail then the use of the short forceps of which you are so fond should also be rejected even when the childs head is below the brim of the pelvis for fear of lacerating the perinaeum and for the very same reason if it could be found to have any weight no surgeon would ever venture to cut for the stone lest the patient should die by the consequence of the operation  you say  it is supposed that the hindhead is forced over the symphysis of the pubes whenever this is the case it is not possible to apply forceps of any kind with advantage or without the utmost danger and i call upon every gentleman conversant in practice to confirm the truth of the assertion  it is not possible you say to apply forceps of any kind dr leake being apprized of the difficulty attending the application of all forceps in this particular case because of their lateral pressure which increases the longitudinal diameter of the head and forces the occiput still more over the pubes has therefore invented a third blade which combined with the forceps acts as a lever applied immediately to the resisting point or occiput and that without the least danger of hurting the mother a circumstance which has often happened by the use of the common lever  those things premised and duly attended to i think it will follow that you may call on gentlemen conversant in practice a long time before they answer to the truth of your assertion without your appeal is made to those who are as much averse to improvement as you seem to be yourself and who choose to grope in the dark when they might walk in open day  the following abstract from dr leakes description of his forceps will still more fully illustrate and explain the true nature and use of the lever or third blade and show under what particular circumstances its application becomes necessary and advantageous  when the forehead presents to the os sacrum and the hindhead to the pubes the long axis of the head intersects the short axis of the pelvis and therefore these parts may be considered as two ellipses crossing each other  a position of the head very unfavourable to the birth of the child  whenever this is the case a very capital inconvenience even in the long doublecurved forceps will occur for when they are thus applied on the sides of the head the more it is there compressed by the action of the blades the more will the hindhead be forced over the pubes and the forehead against the sacrum which will still add to the difficulty and consequently it cannot be extracted in this manner without great violence both to the mother and the child  this circumstance has happened to me in practice several times particularly in two laborious cases where the repeated application of the blades at the sides proved ineffectual and dangerous symptoms appearing i was afraid of further delay and therefore the patient being placed on her side i introduced them at the sacrum and pubes that is on the face and occiput and extracted the head with ease at the first effort  as this success was plainly owing to the compression of the longest part of the head it first suggested to me the hint of applying a pair of forceps with three blades one of which may be occasionally used as a lever which will act on the same principle as that of roonhuysens  but notwithstanding the seeming simplicity of roonhuysens lever it may be attended with the utmost danger for as the symphysis of the pubes is the center from which it acts and the point upon which the whole stress is laid whenever much force is applied to bring down the head action and reaction being the same the vagina neck of the bladder and nervous parts may be so violently bruised as to occasion a mortification or even the very symphysis of the pubes may happen to give way  to remedy this inconvenience which is the principal objection to the lever i have for some years past in my course of lectures on midwifery recommended an instrument consisting of three blades being in fact nothing more than a pair of long forceps with a double curve and the addition of a lever which may be applied without the least danger of hurting the mother for here the fulcrum of the lever is removed from the pubes to the junction of the two blades which not only act as a pair of forceps but at the same time afford a firm resting point for the third blade by means of a small pivot or central pin placed on the under side of one of their blades  after the introduction of the blades of these forceps at the sides of the childshead this lever is to be passed up between the occiput and pubes and as the pelvis there forms a kind of arch and is also extremely shallow by inclining the handle low toward the perinaeum it may be introduced without the least degree of violence  the additional blade or lever applied immediately to the resisting point or occiput where it rests at the pubes will not only effectually shorten the head and detach it from the place of its obstruction but will also prevent the forceps from slipping for if they tend down toward the face the lever which is fixed at the hindhead and sustained at the junction of the blades must be drawn down with them and consequently the head also will still be the more brought into the center of the pelvis and therefore more easily extracted which may be better understood by referring to the third figure in the copperplate  in short these two mechanical powers of the forceps and lever thus combined will mutually assist each other  for the lever will not only prevent the forceps from slipping but will also shorten the head and bring it down below the arch of the pubes into the center of the pelvis by which means it may be the more easily extracted on the other hand the forceps will afford a resting point to the lever from which it may effectually act without any sort of danger to the patient so that we have the advantages of both instruments without the defects of either  dr leake does not here vainly magnify the merit of inventing this new instrument but plainly tells us it was owing to a mere matter of accident which occurred to him in practice  you tell us that  the censure of dr smellie s forceps is unprofitable  you cannot then say that dr leake is mercenary but i must inform you that to censure and to disapprove are very different things those who are best acquainted with dr leake well know that he is less disposed to censure than commend and it is apparent he has not treated dr smellie in the disrespectful manner with which you mention the names of m leveret and h crantz  you next proceed as a panegyrist  dr smellie was a man of great candor industry and ingenuity and we are all indebted to him i have often heard dr leake in the course of his lectures mention his name with great respect and cheerfully subscribe to his merit  you say  we are all indebted to him those who have attended his lectures i presume will not deny it for your part sir had you been as grateful to the gentleman from whom you received your instructions in midwifery we should not have seen you engaged with him in a newspaper billingsgate contest a d       again you say  dr smellie s forceps are not taper at the point  not so taper as the point of a sword  but they are taper  verily they are taper  you add  the largeness of the head and narrowness of the pelvis are relative terms etc  this seems to be a new and very notable discovery and what makes it the more valuable it is not more difficult to be demonstrated than that two and one make three  you say  the case supposed in this paragraph i believe never can happen at the upper part of the pelvis  in what paragraph for you do not say whether in dr leakes or your own pray doctor what professor except such as you have mentioned in the beginning of your remarks ever talks of a case happening at the upper part of the pelvis i suppose you mean a case where the childs head could not happen to be so placed at the upper part of the pelvis if this is not your meaning the case you allude to must be a headless case a case without a head  a very piteous case indeed and such as probably never happened to any one except dr thomas denman  you proceed  my reason for preferring the straight forceps is a conviction that this opinion is true and that under these circumstances the curvilinear forceps become inconvenient  your reason is a conviction that this opinion is true  a very curious reason indeed but i shall say no more on this passage lest i make a mistake for i confess it is far too sublime for my comprehension  again you say  i know enough of the history of the vectes in as able hands as roonhuysens to convince any reasonable man that much mischief may and has been done by them  for this very reason dr leake has contrived a lever or vectes which occasionally combined with the forceps will produce all the effects of a lever without the least danger of hurting the mother  thus you proceed  roonhuysen s vectes changes its center of action and though it may be fixed against the symphysis of the pubes the ramus of the ischium near the obtuse process must become the fulcrum or you will not be able to extract the head  here it is presumed you meant to have said ignoramus and that by some unaccountable blunder of the printers the word ramus unluckily slipped in  you tell us that  the resisting point is not particularly where the hind head presses against the pubes but that the head is wedged and presses on many points  you seem here to have forgot what every practitioner in midwifery ought particularly to remember viz that the brim of the pelvis is an ellipsis from side to side and measured in that direction is one inch wider than from sacrum to pubes and consequently the head thus wedged in the bony passage must of course meet with most resistance where the pelvis is narrowest particularly as the long axis of the head is now turned to the narrow axis of the pelvis or as dr leake expresses it where two ellipses are crossing each other and therefore contrary to your assertion the resisting point must necessarily be where the hindhead presses against the pubes  you say  you object to the use of all curvilinear forceps  i suppose then you mean to make use of none at all for all forceps are curvilinear or they could not be forceps but all forceps have not a twofold curve which i presume is the thing you mean  thus sir you continue to speak and lest the elegance of your expressions should suffer by the least alteration i shall set them down verbatim  the curve of m levrett s forceps seems the most convenient and mr osborn has contrived a very elegant pair by diminishing the size of levrett s and very little alteration besides  just now you objected to the use of all such forceps but now all of a sudden levrets are the most convenient how does this accord  besides as you say that mr osborns forceps differs very little from levrets except in size it is not easy to conceive how a diminution of the size alone can properly be considered as a new invention but here let me ask you whether this contrivance of mr osborns whatever it may be was prior or subsequent to that described by dr leake a direct answer to this simple question might probably unfold the mystery and determine what merit is due to mr osborn from this very elegant pair of forceps  again you say  allowing dr leake the full force of his own reasoning i cannot conceive the advantage arising from this complicated instrument  here like the satyr in the fable you blow hot and cold with the same breath for hitherto you have endeavored to controvert his reasoning in the best manner you were able but now comes a kind of awkward and indirect assent  you say  you cannot conceive the advantage arising from this complicated instrument  the forceps recommended by dr leake is by no means complicated for whenever the lever is unnecessary they may always be applied alone with the same ease and safety and generally with a better effect than any other for the reasons which he has specified  thus you proceed  if we act with the forceps from handle to handle the third blade can do no service  the lever or third blade will effectually prevent the forceps from slipping down over the childs face which is a very capital advantage especially as it cannot in the least injure the mother more than the other two although we act with them from handle to handle  again you say  if we act with the lever the forceps are useless or prejudicial  you have before allowed that roonhuysens lever is a dangerous instrument but as dr leake has proved to a demonstration that the lever combined with the forceps may always be safely and advantageously applied both your assertions become evidently groundless indeed throughout the whole of your performance from a doting affection for every thing you have said on the subject you have never been fortunate enough to distinguish the very great difference between simple assertions and solid proofs the first are always ready at every mans call  upon the last depends the fair and equitable decision of all points of controversy whatever  i have now examined most of your remarks yet i confess that some of them are absolutely unanswerable  those sir alone are they which are utterly unintelligible and to conclude if i am not mistaken as you were when in speaking of the forceps you mistook the childs head for their center of motion all your views center in yourself though even that part of your design you have executed but very indifferently for your style is clumsy assuming and pedantic your objections are frivolous and unfairly urged and your assertions though positive and highly expressive of selfimportance are generally unsupported by reasoning and matter of fact  to conclude considering the air of exultation with which you set out it may be said with great justice and truth that the whole of your performance is most pompously poor indeed  you tell us that you pay great regard to dr leakes abilities i wish i could with a safe conscience say as much for you for if i was disposed to compliment you on your abilities your candor must suffer and if i had an opinion of your candor it must necessarily be at the expense of your abilities  thus sir you have shot your lilliputian arrows and wounded nothing but air when you can spare a little more of your precious time to advance any thing further on this subject for the public good i shall not be wanting in giving it due attention  finis
