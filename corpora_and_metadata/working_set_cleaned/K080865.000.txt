the castle of otranto a story  translated by william marshal gent from the original italian of onuphrio muralto canon of the church of st nicholas at otranto  dublin printed for elizabeth watts in skinnerrow mdcclxv  the translators preface the following work was found in the library of an ancient catholic family in the north of england it was printed at naples in the black letter in the year      how much sooner it was written does not appear the principal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of christianity but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of barbarism the style is the purest italian if the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have happened it must have been between  0   the era of the first crusade and      the date of the last or not long afterward there is no other circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in which the scene is laid the names of the actors are evidently fictitious and probably disguised on purpose yet the spanish names of the domestics seem to indicate that this work was not composed until the establishment of the arragonian kings in naples had made spanish appellations familiar in that country the beauty of the diction and the zeal of the author moderated however by singular judgment concur to make me think that the date of the composition was little antecedent to that of the impression letters were then in their most flourishing state in italy and contributed to dispel the empire of superstition at that time so forcibly attacked by the reformers it is not unlikely that an artful priest might endeavor to turn their own arms on the innovators and might avail himself of his abilities as an author to confirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions if this was his view he has certainly acted with signal address such a work as the following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books of controversy that have been written from the days of luther to the present hour  this solution of the authors motives is however offered as a mere conjecture whatever his views were or whatever effects the execution of them might have his work can only be laid before the public at present as a matter of entertainment even as such some apology for it is necessary miracles visions necromancy dreams and other preternatural events are exploded now even from romances that was not the case when our author wrote much less when the story itself is supposed to have happened belief in every kind of prodigy was so established in those dark ages that an author would not be faithful to the manners of the times who should omit all mention of them he is not bound to believe them himself but he must represent his actors as believing them  if this air of the miraculous is excused the reader will find nothing else unworthy of his perusal allow the possibility of the facts and all the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their situation there is no bombast no similes flowers digressions or unnecessary descriptions every thing tends directly to the catastrophe never is the readers attention relaxed the rules of the drama are almost observed throughout the conduct of the piece the characters are well drawn and still better maintained terror the authors principal engine prevents the story from ever languishing and it is so often contrasted by pity that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitude of interesting passions  some persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little serious for the general cast of the story but besides their opposition to the principal personages the art of the author is very observable in his conduct of the subalterns they discover many passages essential to the story which could not be well brought to light but by their naivete and simplicity in particular the womanish terror and foibles of bianca in the last chapter conduce essentially toward advancing the catastrophe  it is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favor of his adopted work more impartial readers may not be so much struck with the beauties of this piece as i was yet i am not blind to my authors defects i could wish he had grounded his plan on a more useful moral than this that the sins of fathers are visited on their children to the third and fourth generation i doubt whether in his time any more than at present ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of so remote a punishment and yet this moral is weakened by that less direct insinuation that even such anathema may be diverted by devotion to st nicholas here the interest of the monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the author however with all its faults i have no doubt but the english reader will be pleased with a sight of this performance the piety that reigns throughout the lessons of virtue that are inculcated and the rigid purity of the sentiments exempt this work from the censure to which romances are but too liable should it meet with the success i hope for i may be encouraged to reprint the original italian though it will tend to depreciate my own labor our language falls far short of the charms of the italian both for variety and harmony the latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative it is difficult in english to relate without falling too low or rising too high a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure language in common conversation every italian or frenchman of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice i cannot flatter myself with having done justice to my author in this respect his style is as elegant as his conduct of the passions is masterly it is pity that he did not apply his talents to what they were evidently proper for the theater  i will detain the reader no longer but to make one short remark though the machinery is invention and the names of the actors imaginary i cannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on truth the scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle the author seems frequently without design to describe particular parts the chamber says he on the right hand the door on the left hand the distance from the chapel to condra s apartment these and other passages are strong presumptions that the author had some certain building in his eye curious persons who have leisure to employ in such researches may possibly discover in the italian writers the foundation on which our author has built if a catastrophe at all resembling that which he describes is believed to have given rise to this work it will contribute to interest the reader and will make the castle of otranto a still more moving story  the castle of otranto a story etc chapter i manfred prince of otranto had one son and one daughter the latter a most beautiful virgin aged eighteen was called matilda conrad the son was three years younger a homely youth sickly and of no promising disposition yet he was the darling of his father who never showed any symptoms of affection to matilda manfred had contracted a marriage for his son with the marquis of vicenzas daughter isabella and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of manfred that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as conrads infirm state of health would permit manfreds impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbors the former indeed apprehending the severity of their princes disposition did not dare to utter their surmises on this precipitation hippilita his wife an amiable lady did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early considering his great youth and greater infirmities but she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility who had given him but one heir his tenants and subjects were less cautious in their discourses they attributed this hasty wedding to the princes dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy which was said to have pronounced that the castle and lordship of otranto should pass from the present family whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it it was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy and still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question yet these mysteries or contradictions did not make the populace adhere the less to their opinion  young conrads birthday was fixed for his espousals the company was assembled in the chapel of the castle and every thing ready for beginning the divine office when conrad himself was missing manfred impatient of the least delay and who had not observed his son retire dispatched one of his attendants to summon the young prince the servant who had not staid long enough to have crossed the court to conrads apartment came running back breathless in a frantic manner his eyes staring and foaming at the mouth he said nothing but pointed to the court the company were struck with terror and amazement the princess hippolita without knowing what was the matter but anxious for her son swooned away manfred less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination of the nuptials and at the folly of his domestic asked imperiously what was the matter the fellow made no answer but continued pointing toward the courtyard and at last after repeated questions put to him cried out oh the helmet the helmet in the mean time some of the company had run into the court from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks horror and surprise manfred who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son went himself to get information of what occasioned this strange confusion matilda remained endeavoring to assist her mother and isabella staid for the same purpose and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom for whom in truth she had conceived little affection  the first thing that struck manfreds eyes was a groupe of his servants endeavoring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable plumes he gazed without believing his sight what are ye doing cried manfred wrathfully where is my son a volly of voices replied oh my lord the prince the prince the helmet the helmet shocked with these lamentable sounds and dreading he knew not what he advanced hastily  but what a sight for a fathers eyes  he beheld his child dashed to pieces and almost buried under an enormous helmet an hundred times more large than any casque ever made for human being and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers  the horror of the spectacle the ignorance of all around how this misfortune had happened and above all the tremendous phenomenon before him took away the princes speech yet his silence lasted longer than even grief could occasion he fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain to believe a vision and seemed less attentive to his loss than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it he touched he examined the fatal casque nor could even the bleeding mangled remains of the young prince divert the eyes of manfred from the portent before him all who had known his partial fondness for young conrad were as much surprised at their princes insensibility as thunderstruck themselves at the miracle of the helmet they conveyed the disfigured corpse into the hall without receiving the least direction from manfred as little was he attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel on the contrary without mentioning the unhappy princesses his wife and daughter the first sounds that dropped from manfreds lips were take care of the lady isabella  the domestics without observing the singularity of this direction were guided by their affection to their mistress to consider it as peculiarly addressed to her situation and flew to her assistance they conveyed her to her chamber more dead than alive and indifferent to all the strange circumstances she heard except the death of her son matilda who doated on her mother smothered her own grief and amazement and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent isabella who had been treated by hippolita like a daughter and who returned that tenderness with equal duty and affection was scarce less assiduous about the princess at the same time endeavoring to partake and lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw matilda strove to suppress for whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship yet her own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts she felt no concern for the death of young conrad except commiseration and she was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her little felicity either from her destined bridegroom or from the severe temper of manfred who though he had distinguished her by great indulgence had imprinted her mind with terror from his causeless rigor to such amiable princesses as hippolita and matilda  while the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed manfred remained in the court gazing on the ominous casque and regardless of the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around him the few words he articulated tended solely to inquiries whether any man knew from whence it could have come nobody could give him the least information however as it seemed to be the sole object of his curiosity it soon became so to the rest of the spectators whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable as the catastrophe itself was unprecedented in the midst of their senseless guesses a young peasant whom rumor had drawn thither from a neighboring village observed that the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble of alfonso the good one of their former princes in the church of st nicholas villain what say thou cried manfred starting from his trance in a tempest of rage and seizing the young man by the collar how dare thou utter such treason thy life shall pay for it the spectators who as little comprehended the cause of the princes fury as all the rest they had seen were at a loss to unravel this new circumstance the young peasant himself was still more astonished not conceiving how he had offended the prince yet recollecting himself with a mixture of grace and humility he disengaged himself from manfreds gripe and then with an obeisance which discovered more jealousy of innocence than dismay he asked with respect of what he was guilty manfred more enraged at the vigor however decently exerted with which the young man had shaken off his hold than appeased by his submission ordered his attendants to seize him and if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials would have poignarded the peasant in their arms  during this altercation some of the vulgar spectators had run to the great church which stood near the castle and came back openmouthed declaring that the helmet was missing from alfonsos statue manfred at this news grew perfectly frantic and as if he sought a subject on which to vent the tempest within him he rushed again on the young peasant crying villain monster sorcerer it is thou have done this it is thou have slain my son the mob who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasonings caught the words from the mouth of their lord and reecchoed ay ay it is he it is he he has stolen the helmet from good alfonses tomb and dashed out the brains of our young prince with it  never reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet that had been in the church and that of steel before their eyes nor how impossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty to weild a piece of armor of so prodigious a weight  the folly of these ejaculations brought manfred to himself yet whether provoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the two helmets and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that in the church or wishing to bury any fresh rumors under so impertinent a supposition he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a necromancer and that till the church could take cognizance of the affair he would have the magician whom they had thus detected kept prisoner under the helmet itself which he ordered his attendants to raise and place the young man under it declaring he should be kept there without food with which his own infernal art might furnish him  it was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous sentence in vain did manfreds friends endeavor to divert him from this savage and illgrounded resolution the generality were charmed with their lords decision which to their apprehensions carried great appearance of justice as the magician was to be punished by the very instrument with which he had offended nor were they struck with the least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved for they firmly believed that by his diabolical skill he could easily supply himself with nutriment  manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed and appointing a guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the prisoner he dismissed his friends and attendants and retired to his own chamber after locking the gates of the castle in which he suffered none but his domestics to remain  in the mean time the care and zeal of the young ladies had brought the princess hippolita to herself who amidst the transports of her own sorrow frequently demanded news of her lord would have dismissed her attendants to watch over him and at last enjoined matilda to leave her and visit and comfort her father matilda who wanted no affectionate duty to manfred though she trembled at his austerity obeyed the orders of hippolita whom she tenderly recommended to isabella and enquiring of the domestics for her father was informed that he was retired to his chamber and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother and fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child she hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction yet solicitude for him backed by the commands of her mother encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had given a fault she had never been guilty of before the gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his door she heard him traverse his chamber backwards and forwards with disordered steps a mood which increased her apprehensions she was however just going to beg admittance when manfred suddenly opened his door and as it was now twilight concurring with the disorder of his mind he did not distinguish the person but asked angrily who it was matilda replied trembling my dearest father it is i your daughter manfred stepping back hastily cried begone i do not want a daughter and flinging back abruptly clapped the door against the terrified matilda  she was too well acquainted with her fathers impetuosity to venture a second intrusion when she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter a reception she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that the knowledge of it would give to hippolita who questioned her in the most anxious terms on the health of manfred and how he bore his loss matilda assured her he was well and supported his misfortune with manly fortitude but will he not let me see him said hippolita mornfully will he not permit me to blend my tears with his and shed a mothers sorrows in the bosom of her lord or do you deceive me matilda i know how manfred doated on his son is not the stroke too heavy for him has he not sunk under it  you do not answer me  alas i dread the worst  raise me my maidens i will i will see my lord bear me to him instantly he is dearer to me even than my children matilda made signs to isabella to prevent hippolitas rising and both those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and calm the princess when a servant on the part of manfred arrived and told isabella that his lord demanded to speak with her  with me cried isabella go said hippolita relieved by a message from her lord manfred cannot support the sight of his own family he thinks you less disordered than we are and dreads the shock of my grief console him dear isabella and tell him i will smother my own anguish rather than add to his  as it was now evening the servant who conducted isabella bore a torch before her when they came to manfred who was walking impatiently about the gallery he started and said hastily take away that light and begone then shutting the door impetuously he flung himself upon a bench against the wall and bade isabella fit by him she obeyed trembling i sent for you lady said he  and then stopped under great appearance of confusion my lord  yes i sent for you on a matter of great moment resumed he  dry your tears young lady  you have lost your bridegroom  yes cruel fate and i have lost the hopes of my race  but conrad was not worthy of your beauty  how my lord said isabella sure you do not suspect me of not feeling the concern i ought my duty and affection would have always  think no more of him interrupted manfred he was a sickly puny child and heaven has perhaps taken him away that i might not trust the honors of my house on so frail a foundation the line of manfred calls for numerous supports my foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes of my prudence  but it is better as it is i hope in a few years to have reason to rejoice at the death of conrad  words cannot paint the astonishment of isabella at first she apprehended that grief had disordered manfreds understanding her next thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare her she feared that manfred had perceived her indifference for his son and in consequence of that idea she replied good my lord do not doubt my tenderness my heart would have accompanied my hand conrad would have engrossed all my care and wherever fate shall dispose of me i shall always cherish his memory and regard your highness and the virtuous hippolita as my parents curse on hippolita cried manfred forget her from this moment as i do in short lady you have missed a husband undeserving of your charms they shall now be better disposed of instead of a sickly boy you shall have a husband in the prime of his age who will know how to value your beauties and who may expect a numerous offspring alas my lord said isabella my mind is too sadly engrossed by the recent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage if ever my father returns and it shall be his pleasure i shall obey as i did when i consented to give my hand to your son but until his return permit me to remain under your hospitable roof and employ the melancholy hours in asswaging yours hippolitas and the fair matildas affliction  i desired you once before said manfred angrily not to name that woman from this hour she must be a stranger to you as she must be to me  in short isabella since i cannot give you my son i offer you myself  heavens cried isabella waking from her delusion what do i hear you my lord you my fatherinlaw the father of conrad the husband of the virtuous and tender hippolita  i tell you said manfred imperiously hippolita is no longer my wife i divorce her from this hour too long has she cursed me by her unfruitfulness my fate depends on having sons  and this night i trust will give a new date to my hopes at those words he seized the cold hand of isabella who was halfdead with fright and horror she shrieked and started from him manfred rose to pursue her when the moon which was now up and gleamed in at the opposite casement presented to his sight the plumes of the fatal helmet which rose to the height of the windows waving backwards and forwards in a tempestuous manner and accompanied with a hollow and rustling sound isabella who gathered courage from her situation and who dreaded nothing so much as manfreds pursuit of his declaration cried look my lord see heaven itself declares against your impious intention  heaven nor hell shall impede my designs said manfred advancing again to seize the princess at that instant the portrait of his grandfather which hung over the bench where they had been sitting uttered a deep sigh and heaved its breast isabella whose back was turned to the picture saw not the motion nor knew whence the sound came but started and said hark my lord what sound was that and at the same time made toward the door manfred distracted between the flight of isabella who had now reached the stairs and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture which began to move had however advanced some steps after her still looking backwards on the portrait when he saw it quit its panel and descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air do i dream cried manfred returning or are the devils themselves in league against me speak infernal spectre or if thou art my grandsire why do thou too conspire against thy wretched descendent who too dearly pays for  ere he could finish the sentence the vision sighed again and made a sign to manfred to follow him lead on cried manfred i will follow thee to the gulf of perdition the spectre marched sedately but dejected to the end of the gallery and turned into a chamber on the right hand manfred accompanied him at a little distance full of anxiety and horror but resolved as he would have entered the chamber the door was clapped to with violence by an invisible hand the prince collecting courage from this delay would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot but found that it resisted his utmost efforts since hell will not satisfy my curiosity said manfred i will use the human means in my power for preserving my race isabella shall not escape me  that lady whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had quitted manfred continued her flight to the bottom of the principal staircase there she stopped not knowing whither to direct her steps nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the prince the gates of the castle she knew were locked and guards placed in the court should she as her heart prompted her go and prepare hippolita for the cruel destiny that awaited her she did not doubt but manfred would seek her there and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he meditated without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his passions delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he had conceived or produce some circumstance in her favor if she could for that night at least avoid his odious purpose  yet where conceal herself how avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make throughout the castle as these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind she recollected a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the church of st nicholas could she reach the altar before she was overtaken she knew even manfreds violence would not dare to profane the sacredness of the place and she determined if no other means of deliverance offered to shut herself up for ever among the holy virgins whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral in this resolution she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase and hurried toward the secret passage  the lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloisters and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the door that opened into the cavern an awful silence reigned throughout those subterraneous regions except now and then some blasts of wind that shook the doors she had passed and which grating on the rusty hinges were reecchoed through that long labyrinth of darkness every murmur struck her with new terror  yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of manfred urging his domestics to pursue her she trod as softly as impatience would give her leave  yet frequently stopped and listened to hear if she was followed in one of those moments she thought she heard a sigh she shuddered and recoiled a few paces in a moment she thought she heard the step of some person her blood curdled she concluded it was manfred every suggestion that horror could inspire rushed into her mind she condemned her rash flight which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries were not likely to draw any body to her assistance  yet the sound seemed not to come from behind  if manfred knew where she was he must have followed her she was still in one of the cloisters and the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come cheared with this reflection and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the prince she was going to advance when a door that stood a jar at some distance to the left was opened gently but ere her lamp which she held up could discover who opened it the person retreated precipitately on seeing the light  isabella whom every incident was sufficient to dismay hesitated whether she should proceed her dread of manfred soon outweighed every other terror the very circumstance of the person avoiding her gave her a sort of courage it could only be she thought some domestic belonging to the castle her gentleness had never raised her an enemy and conscious innocence bade her hope that unless sent by the princes order to seek her his servants would rather assist than prevent her flight fortifying herself with these reflections and believing by what she could observe that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern she approached the door that had been opened but a sudden gust of wind that met her at the door extinguished her lamp and left her in total darkness  words cannot paint the horror of the princesss situation alone in so dismal a place her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day hopeless of escaping expecting every moment the arrival of manfred and far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of somebody she knew not whom who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts all these thoughts crowded on her distracted mind and she was ready to sink under her apprehensions she addressed herself to every saint in heaven and inwardly implored their assistance for a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair at last as softly as was possible she felt for the door and having found it entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the sigh and steps it gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault which seemed to be fallen in and from whence hung a fragment of earth or building she could not distinguish which that appeared to have been crushed inwards she advanced eagerly toward this chasm when she discerned a human form standing close against the wall  she shrieked believing it the ghost of her betrothed conrad the figure advancing said in a submissive voice be not alarmed lady i will not injure you isabella a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the stranger and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened the door recovered her spirits enough to reply sir whoever you are take pity on a wretched princess standing on the brink of destruction assist me to escape from this fatal castle or in few moments i may be made miserable for ever alas said the stranger what can i do to assist you i will die in your defense but i am unacquainted with the castle and want  oh said isabella hastily interrupting him help me but to find a trapdoor that must be hereabout and it is the greatest service you can do me for i have not a minute to lose saying these words she felt about on the pavement and directed the stranger to search likewise for a smooth piece of brass enclosed in one of the stones that said she is the lock which opens with a spring of which i know the secret if we can find that i may escape  if not alas courteous stranger i fear i shall have involved you in my misfortunes manfred will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight and you will fall a victim to his resentment i value not my life said the stranger and it will be some comfort to lose it in trying to deliver you from his tyranny generous youth said isabella how shall i ever requite  as she uttered those words a ray of moonshine streaming through a cranny of the ruin above shone directly on the lock they sought  oh transport said isabella here is the trapdoor and taking out a key she touched the spring which starting aside discovered an iron ring lift up the door said the princess the stranger obeyed and beneath appeared some stone steps descending into a vault totally dark we must go down here said isabella follow me dark and dismal as it is we cannot miss our way it leads directly to the church of st nicholas  but perhaps added the princess modestly you have no reason to leave the castle nor have i farther occasion for your service in few minutes i shall be safe from manfreds rage  only let me know to whom i am so much obliged i will never quit you said the stranger eagerly until i have placed you in safety  nor think me princess more generous than i am though you are my principal care  the stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed approaching and they soon distinguished these words talk not to me of necromancers i tell you she must be in the castle i will find her in spite of enchantment  oh heavens cried isabella it is the voice of manfred make haste or we are ruined and shut the trapdoor after you saying this she descended the steps precipitately and as the stranger hastened to follow her he let the door slip out of his hands it fell and the spring closed over it he tried in vain to open it not having observed isabellas method of touching the spring nor had he many moments to make an essay the noise of the falling door had been heard by manfred who directed by the sound hastened thither attended by his servants with torches it must be isabella cried manfred before he entered the vault she is escaping by the subterraneous passage but she cannot have got far  what was the astonishment of the prince when instead of isabella the light of the torches discovered to him the young peasant whom he thought confined under the fatal helmet traitor said manfred how came thou here i thought thee in durance above in the court i am no traitor replied the young man boldly nor am i answerable for your thoughts presumptuous villain cried manfred do thou provoke my wrath tell me how have thou escaped from above thou have corrupted thy guards and their lives shall answer it my poverty said the peasant calmly will disculpate them though the ministers of a tyrants wrath to thee they are faithful and but too willing to execute the orders which you unjustly imposed upon them art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance said the prince  but tortures shall force the truth from thee tell me i will know thy accomplices there was my accomplice said the youth smiling and pointing to the roof manfred ordered the torches to be held up and perceived that one of the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced its way through the pavement of the court as his servants had let it fall over the peasant and had broken through into the vault  gap through which the peasant had  himself some minutes before he was found by isabella was that the way by which thou did descend said manfred it was said the youth but what noise was that said manfred which i heard as i entered the cloister a door clapped said the peasant i heard it as well as you what door said manfred hastily i am not acquainted with your castle said the peasant this is the first time i ever entered it and this vault the only part of it within which i ever was but i tell thee said manfred wishing to find out if the youth had discovered the trapdoor it was this way i heard the noise my servants heard it too  my lord interrupted one of them officiously to be sure it was the trapdoor and he was going to make his escape peace blockhead said the prince angrily if he was going to escape how should he come on this side i will know from his own mouth what noise it was i heard tell me truly thy life depends on thy veracity my veracity is dearer to me than my life said the peasant nor would i purchase the one by forfeiting the other indeed young philosopher said manfred contemptuously tell me then what was the noise i heard ask me what i can answer said he and put me to death instantly if i tell you a lie manfred growing impatient at the steady valor and indifference of the youth cried well then thou man of truth answer was it the fall of the trapdoor that i heard it was said the youth it was said the prince and how did thou come to know there was a trapdoor here i saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine replied he but what told thee it was a lock said manfred how did thou discover the secret of opening it providence that delivered me from the helmet was able to direct me to the spring of a lock said he providence should have gone a little farther and have placed thee out of the reach of my resentment said manfred when providence had taught thee to open the lock it abandoned thee for a fool who did not know how to make use of its favors why did thou not pursue the path pointed out for thy escape why did thou shut the trapdoor before thou had descended the steps i might ask you my lord said the peasant how i totally unacquainted with your castle was to know that those steps led to any outlet but i scorn to evade your questions wherever those steps lead to perhaps i should have explored the way  i could not be in a worse situation than i was but the truth is i let the trapdoor fall your immediate arrival followed i had given the alarm  what imported it to me whether i was seized a minute sooner or a minute later thou art a resolute villain for thy years said manfred  yet on reflection i suspect thou do but trifle with me thou have not yet told me how thou did open the lock that i will show you my lord said the peasant and taking up a fragment of stone that had fall from above he laid himself on the trapdoor and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered it meaning to gain time for the escape of the princess this presence of mind joined to the frankness of the youth staggered manfred he even felt a disposition toward pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime manfred was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in cruelty unprovoked the circumstances of his fortune had given an asperity to his temper which was naturally humane and his virtues were always ready to operate when his passions did not obscure his reason  while the prince was in this suspense a confused noise of voices ecchoed through the distant vaults as the sound approached he distinguished the clamours of some of his domestics whom he had dispersed through the castle in search of isabella calling out where is my lord where is the prince here i am said manfred as they came nearer have you found the princess the first that arrived replied oh my lord i am glad we have found you  found me said manfred have you found the princess we thought we had my lord said the fellow looking terrified  but  but what cried the prince has she escaped  jaquez and i my lord  yes i and diego interrupted the second who came up in still greater consternation  speak one of you at a time said manfred i ask you where is the princess we do not know said they both together but we are frightened out of our wits  so i think blockheads said manfred what is it has scared you thus  oh my lord said jaquez diego has seen such a sight your highness would not believe our eyes  what new absurdity is this cried manfred  give me a direct answer or by heaven  why my lord if it please your highness to hear me said the poor fellow diego and i  yes i and jaquez cried his comrade  did not i forbid you to speak both at a time said the prince you jaquez answer for the other fool seems more distracted than thou art what is the matter my gracious lord said jaquez if it please your highness to hear me diego and i according to your highnesss orders went to search for the young lady but being apprehensive that we might meet the ghost of my young lord your highnesss son god rest his soul as he has not received christian burial  sot cried manfred in a rage is it only a ghost then that thou have seen oh worse worse my lord cried diego i had rather have seen ten whole ghosts  grant me patience said manfred these blockheads distract me  out of my sight diego and thou jaquez tell me in one word art thou sober art thou raving thou wast wont to have some sense has the other sot frighted himself and thee too speak what is it he fancies he has seen why my lord replied jaquez trembling i was going to tell your highness that since the calamitous mifortune of my young lord god rest his precious soul not one of us your highnesss faithful servants indeed we are my lord though poor men i say not one of us has dared to set a foot about the castle but two together so diego and i thinking that my young lady might be in the great gallery went up there to look for her and tell her your highness wanted something to impart to her  o blundering fools cried manfred and in the mean time she has made her escape because you were afraid of goblings  why thou knave she left me in the gallery i came from thence myself for all that she may be there still for ought i know said jaquez but the devil shall have me before i seek her there again  poor diego i do not believe he will ever recover it recover what said manfred am i never to learn what it is has terrified these rascals  but i lose my time follow me slave i will see if she is in the gallery  for heavens sake my dear good lord cried jaquez do not go to the gallery satan himself i believe is in the great chamber next to the gallery  manfred who hitherto had treated the terror of his servants as an idle panic was struck at this new circumstance he recollected the apparition of the portrait and the sudden closing of the door at the end of the gallery  his voice faltered and he asked with disorder what is in the great chamber my lord said jaquez when diego and i came into the gallery he went first for he said he had more courage than i so when we came into the gallery we found nobody we looked under every bench and stool and still we found nobody  were all the pictures in their places said manfred yes my lord answered jaquez but we did not think of looking behind them  well well said manfred proceed when we came to the door of the great chamber continued jaquez we found it shut  and could not you open it said manfred oh yes my lord would to heaven we had not replied he  nay it was not i neither it was diego he was grown foolhardy and would go on though i advised him not  if ever i open a door that is shut again  trifle not said manfred shuddering but tell me what you saw in the great chamber on opening the door  i my lord said jaquez i saw nothing i was behind diego  but i heard the noise  jaquez said manfred in a solemn tone of voice tell me i adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors what was it thou saw what was it thou heardst it was diego saw it my lord it was not i replied jaquez i only heard the noise diego had no sooner opened the door than he cried out and ran back  i ran back too and said is it the ghost the ghost no no said diego and his hair stood an end  it is a giant i believe he is all clad in armor for i saw his foot and part of his leg and they are as large as the helmet below in the court as he said these words my lord we heard a violent motion and the rattling of armor as if the giant was rising for diego has told me since that he believes the giant was lying down for the foot and leg were stretched at length on the floor before we could get to the end of the gallery we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind us but we did not dare turn back to see if the giant was following us  yet now i think on it we must have heard him if he had pursued us  but for heavens sake good my lord send for the chaplain and have the castle exorcised for for certain it is enchanted ay pray do my lord cried all the servants at once or we must leave your highnesss service  peace dotards said manfred and follow me i will know what all this means we my lord cried they with one voice we would not go up to the gallery for your highnesss revenue the young peasant who had stood silent now spoke will your highess said he permit me to try this adventure my life is of consequence to nobody i fear no bad angel and have offended no good one your behavior is above your seeming said manfred viewing him with surprise and admiration  hereafter i will reward your bravery  but now continued he with a sigh i am so circumstanced that i dare trust no eyes but my own  however i give you leave to accompany me  manfred when he first followed isabella from the gallery had gone directly to the apartment of his wife concluding the princess had retired thither hippolita who knew his step rose with anxious fondness to meet her lord whom she had not seen since the death of their son she would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his bosom but he pushed her rudely off and said where is isabella isabella my lord said the astonished hippolita yes isabella cried manfred imperiously i want isabella my lord replied matilda who perceived how much his behavior had shocked her mother she has not been with us since your highness summoned her to your apartment tell me where she is said the prince i do not want to know where she has been my good lord said hippolita your daughter tells you the truth isabella left us by your command and has not returned since  but my good lord compose yourself retire to your rest this dismal day has disordered you isabella shall wait your orders in the morning what then you know where she is cried manfred tell me directly for i will not lose an instant  and you woman speaking to his wife order your chaplain to attend me forthwith isabella said hippolita calmly is retired i suppose to her chamber she is not accustomed to watch at this late hour gracious my lord continued she let me know what has disturbed you has isabella offended you trouble me not with questions said manfred but tell me where she is matilda shall call her said the princess  sit down my lord and resume your wonted fortitude  what art thou jealous of isabella replied he that you wish to be present at our interview good heavens my lord said hippolita what is it your highness means thou will know ere many minutes are passed said the cruel prince send your chaplain to me and wait my pleasure here at these words he flung out of the room in search of isabella leaving the amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating  manfred was now returning from the vault attended by the peasant and a few of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him he ascended the staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery at the door of which he met hippolita and her chaplain when diego had been dismissed by manfred he had gone directly to the princesss apartment with the alarm of what he had seen that excellent lady who no more than manfred doubted of the reality of the vision yet affected to treat it as a delirium of the servant willing however to save her lord from any additional shock and prepared by a series of grief not to tremble at any accession to it she determined to make herself the first sacrifice if fate had marked the present hour for their destruction dismissing the reluctant matilda to her rest who in vain sued for leave to accompany her mother and attended only by her chaplain hippolita had visited the gallery and great chamber and now with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours she met her lord and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable and no doubt an impression made by fear and the dark and dismal hour of the night on the minds of his servants she and the chaplain had examined the chamber and found every thing in the usual order  manfred though persuaded like his wife that the vision had been no work of fancy recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown him ashamed too of his inhuman treatment of a princess who returned every injury with new marks of tenderness and duty he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes  but not less ashamed of feeling remorse toward one against whom he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage he curbed the yearnings of his heart and did not dare to lean even toward pity the next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy presuming on the unshaken submission of hippolita he flattered himself that she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce but would obey if it was his pleasure in endeavoring to persuade isabella to give him her hand  but ere he could indulge this horrid hope he reflected that isabella was not to be found coming to himself he gave orders that every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded and charged his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass out the young peasant to whom he spoke favorably he ordered to remain in a small chamber on the stairs in which there was a palletbed and the key of which he took away himself telling the youth he would talk with him in the morning then dismissing his attendants and bestowing a fullen kind of halfnod on hippolita he retired to his own chamber  chap ii matilda who by hippolitas order had retired to her apartment was illdisposed to take any rest the shocking fate of her brother had deeply affacted her she was surprised at not seeing isabella but the strange words which had fallen from her father and his obscure menace to the princess his wife accompanied by the most furious behavior had filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm she waited anxiously for the return of bianca a young damsel that attended her whom she had sent to learn what was become of isabella bianca soon appeared and informed her mistress of what she had gathered from the servants that isabella was no where to be found she related the adventure of the young peasant who had been discovered in the vault though with many simple additions from the incoherent accounts of the domestics and she dwelled principally on the gigantic leg and foot which had been seen in the gallerychamber this last circumstance had terrified bianca so much that she was rejoiced when matilda told her that she would not go to rest but would watch till the princess should rise  the young princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of isabella and on the threats of manfred to her mother but what business could he have so urgent with the chaplain said matilda does he intend to have my brothers body interred privately in the chapel oh madam said bianca now i guess as you are become his heiress he is impatient to have you married he has always been raving for more sons i warrant he is now impatient for grandsons as sure as i live madam i shall see you a bride at last  good madam you will not cast off your faithful bianca you will not put donna rosara over me now you are a great princess my poor bianca said matilda how fast your thoughts amble i a great princess what have thou seen in manfreds behavior since my brothers death that bespeaks any increase of tenderness to me no bianca his heart was ever a stranger to me  but he is my father and i must not complain nay if heaven shuts my fathers heart against me it overpays my little merit in the tenderness of my mother  o that dear mother yes bianca it is there i feel the rugged temper of manfred i can support his harshness to me with patience but it wounds my soul when i am witness to his causeless severity toward her oh madam said bianca all men use their wives so when they are weary of them  and yet you congratulated me but now said matilda when you fancied my father intended to dispose of me i would have you a great lady replied bianca come what will i do not wish to see you moped in a convent as you would be if you had your will and if my lady your mother who knows that a bad husband is better than no husband at all did not hinder you  bless me what noise is that st nicholas forgive me i was but in jest it is the wind said matilda whistling through the battlements in the tower above you have heard it a thousand times nay said bianca there was no harm neither in what i said it is no sin to talk of matrimony  and so madam as i was saying if my lord manfred should offer you a handsome young prince for a bridegroom you would drop him a curtsy and tell him you had rather take the veil thank heaven i am in no such danger said matilda you know how many proposals for me he has rejected  and you thank him like a dutiful daughter do you madam  but come madam suppose tomorrow morning he was to send for you to the great council chamber and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young prince with large black eyes a smooth white forehead and manly curling locks like jet in short madam a young hero resembling the picture of the good alfonso in the gallery which you sit and gaze at for hours together  do not speak lightly of that picture interrupted matilda sighing i know the adoration with which i look at that picture is uncommon  but i am not in love with a colored panel the character of that virtuous prince the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his memory the orisons which i know not why she has enjoined me to pour forth at his tomb all have concurred to persuade me that some how or other my destiny is linked with something relating to him  lord madam how should that be said bianca i have always heard that your family was no way related to his and i am sure i cannot conceive why my lady the princess sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb he is no saint by the almanac if you must pray why does not she bid you address yourself to our great st nicholas i am sure he is the saint i pray to for a husband perhaps my mind would be less affected said matilda if my mother would explain her reasons to me but it is the mystery she observes that inspires me with this  i know not what to call it as she never acts from caprice i am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom  nay i know there is in her agony of grief for my brothers death she dropped some words that intimated as much  oh dear madam cried bianca what were they no said matilda if a parent lets fall a word and wishes it recalled it is not for a child to utter it what was she sorry for what she had said asked bianca  i am sure madam you may trust me  with my own little secrets when i have any i may said matilda but never with my mothers a child ought to have no ears or eyes but as a parent directs well to be sure madam you were born to be a saint said bianca and there is no resisting ones vocation you will end in a convent at last but there is my lady isabella would not be so reserved to me she will let me talk to her of young men and when a handsome cavalier has come to the castle she has owned to me that she wished your brother conrad resembled him bianca said the princess i do not allow you to mention my friend disrespectfully isabella is of a cheerful disposition but her soul is pure as virtue itself she knows your idle babbling humor and perhaps has now and then encouraged it to divert melancholy and enliven the solitude in which my father keeps us  blessed mary said bianca starting there it is again  dear madam do you hear nothing  this castle is certainly haunted  peace said matilda and listen i did think i heard a voice  but it must be fancy your terrors i suppose have infected me indeed indeed madam said bianca halfweeping with agony i am sure i heard a voice does any body lie in the chamber beneath said the princess nobody has dared to lie there answered bianca since the great astrologer that was your brothers tutor drowned himself for certain madam his ghost and the young princes are now met in the chamber below  for heavens sake let us fly to your mothers apartment i charge you not to stir said matilda if they are spirits in pain we may ease their sufferings by questioning them they can mean no hurt to us for we have not injured them  and if they should shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another reach me my beads we will say a prayer and then speak to them oh dear lady i would not speak to a ghost for the world cried bianca  as she said those words they heard the casement of the little chamber below matildas open they listened attentively and in few minutes thought they heard a person sing but could not distinguish the words this can be no evil spirit said the princess in a low voice it is undoubtedly one of the family  open the window and we shall know the voice i dare not indeed madam said bianca thou art a very fool said matilda opening the window gently herself the noise the princess made was however heard by the person beneath who stopped and they concluded had heard the casement open is any body below said the princess if there is speak yes said an unknown voice who is it said matilda a stranger replied the voice what stranger said she and how did thou come there at this unusual hour when all the gates of the castle are locked i am not here willingly answered the voice  but pardon me lady if i have disturbed your rest i knew not that i was overheard sleep had forsaken me i left a restless couch and came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach of morning impatient to be dismissed from this castle thy words and accents said matilda are of a melancholy cast if thou art unhappy i pity thee if poverty afflicts thee let me know it i will mention thee to the princess whose beneficent soul ever melts for the distressed and she will relieve thee i am indeed unhappy said the stranger and i know what wealth is but i do not complain of the lot which heaven has cast for me i am young and healthy and am not ashamed of owing my support to myself  yet think me not proud or that i disdain your generous offers i will remember you in my orisons and will pray for blessings on your gracious self and your noble mistress  if i sigh lady it is for others not for myself now i have it madam said bianca whispering the princess this is certainly the young peasant and by my conscience he is in love  well this is a charming adventure  do madam let us sift him he does not know you but takes you for one of my lady hippolitas women art thou not ashamed bianca said the princess what right have we to pry into the secrets of this young mans heart he seems virtuous and frank and tells us he is unhappy are those circumstances that authorize us to make a property of him how are we entitled to his confidence lord madam how little you know of love replied bianca why lovers have no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress and would you have me become a peasants confident said the princess well then let me talk to him said bianca though i have the honor of being your highnesss maid of honor i was not always so great besides if love levels ranks it raises them too i have a respect for any young man in love  peace simpleton said the princess though he said he was unhappy it does not follow that he must be in love think of all that has happened today and tell me if there are no misfortunes but what love causes stranger resumed the princess if thy misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy own fault and are within the compass of the princess hippolitas power to redress i will take upon me to answer that she will be thy protectress when thou art dismissed from this castle repair to holy father jerome at the convent adjoining to the church of st nicholas and make thy story known to him as far as thou think meet he will not fail to inform the princess who is the mother of all that want her assistance farewell it is not seemly for me to hold farther converse with a man at this unwonted hour may the saints guard thee gracious lady replied the peasant  but oh if a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minutes audience farther  am i so happy  the casement is not shut  might i venture to ask  speak quickly said matilda the morning dawns a pace should the laborers come into the fields and perceive us  what would thou ask  i know not how  i know not if i dare  said the young stranger faltering  yet the humanity with which you have spoken to me emboldens  lady dare i trust you  heavens said matilda what do thou mean with what would thou trust me  speak boldly if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a virtuous breast  i would ask said the peasant recollecting himself whether what i have heard from the domestics is true that the princess is missing from the castle what imports it to thee to know replied matilda thy first words bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity do thou come hither to pry into the secrets of manfred  adieu i have been mistaken in thee saying these words she shut the casement hastily without giving the young man time to reply i had acted more wisely said the princess to bianca with some sharpness if i had let thee converse with this peasant his inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own it is not fit for me to argue with your highness replied bianca but perhaps the questions i should have put to him would have been more to the purpose than those you have been pleased to ask him oh no doubt said matilda you are a very discreet personage may i know what you would have asked him a bystander often sees more of the game than those that play answered bianca does your highness think madam that his question about my lady isabella was the result of mere curiosity no no madam there is more in it than you great folks are aware of lopez told me that all the servants believe this young fellow contrived my lady isabellas escape  now pray madam observe  you and i both know that my lady isabella never much fancied the prince your brother  well he is killed just in the critical minute  i accuse nobody a helmet falls from the moon  so my lord your father says but lopez and all the servants say that this young spark is a magician and stole it from alfonsos tomb  have done with this rhapsody of impertinence said matilda nay madam as you please cried bianca  yet it is very particular though that my lady isabella should be missing the very same day and that this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth of the trapdoor  i accuse nobody  but if my young lord came honestly by his death  dare not on thy duty said matilda to breathe a suspicion on the purity of my dear isabellas same  purity or not purity said bianca gone she is  a stranger is found that nobody knows you question him yourself he tells you he is in love or unhappy it is the same thing  nay he owned he was unhappy about others and is any body unhappy about another unless they are in love with them and at the very next word he asks innocently poor soul if my lady isabella is missing  to be sure said matilda thy observations are not totally without foundation  isabellas flight amazes me the curiosity of this stranger is very particular  yet isabella never concealed a thought from me  so she told you said bianca to fish out your secrets  but who knows madam but this stranger may be some prince in disguise  do madam let me open the window and ask him a few questions no replied matilda i will ask him myself if he knows aught of isabella he is not worthy that i should converse farther with him she was going to open the casement when they heard the bell ring at the posterngate of the castle which is on the right hand of the tower where matilda lay this prevented the princess from renewing the conversation with the stranger  after continuing silent for some time i am persuaded said she to bianca that whatever be the cause of isabellas flight it had no unworthy motive if this stranger was accessory to it she must be satisfied of his fidelity and worth i observed did not you bianca that his words were tinctured with an uncommon effusion of piety it was no ruffians speech his phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth i told you madam said bianca that i was sure he was some prince in disguise  yet said matilda if he was privy to her escape how will you account for his not accompanying her in her flight why expose himself unnecessarily and rashly to my fathers resentment as for that madam replied she if he could get from under the helmet he will find ways of eluding your fathers anger i do not doubt but he has some talisman or other about him  you resolve every thing into magic said matilda  but a man who has any intercourse with infernal spirits does not dare to make use of those tremendous and holy words which he uttered did thou not observe with what fervor he vowed to remember me to heaven in his prayers  yes isabella was undoubtedly convinced of his piety commend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel that consult to elope said bianca no no madam my lady isabella is of another guess mould than you take her for she used indeed to sigh and lift up her eyes in your company because she knows you are a saint  but when your back was turned  you wrong her said matilda isabella is no hypocrite she has a due sense of devotion but never affected a call she has not on the contrary she always combated my inclination for the cloister and though i own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me though it seems inconsistent with the freindship between us i cannot forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil she wished to see me married though my dower would have been a loss to her and my brothers children for her sake i will believe well of this young peasant then you do think there is some liking between them said bianca  while she was speaking a servant came hastily into the chamber and told the princess that the lady isabella was found where said matilda she has taken sanctuary in st nicholass church replied the servant father jerome has brought the news himself he is below with his highness where is my mother said matilda she is in her own chamber madam and has asked for you  manfred had risen at the first dawn of light and gone to hippolitas apartment to inquire if she knew ought of isabella while he was questioning her word was brought that jerome demanded to speak with him manfred little suspecting the cause of the friars arrival and knowing he was employed by hippolita in her charities ordered him to be admitted intending to leave them together while he pursued his search after isabella is your business with me or the princess said manfred with both replied the holy man the lady isabella  what of her interrupted manfred eagerly  is at st nicholass altar replied jerome that is no business of hippolita said manfred with confusion let us retire to my chamber father and inform me how she came thither no my lord replied the good man with an air of firmness and authority that daunted even the resolute manfred who could not help revering the saintlike virtues of jerome my commission is to both and with your highnesss goodliking in the presence of both i shall deliver it  but first my lord i must interrogate the princess whether she is acquainted with the cause of the lady isabellas retirement from your castle  no on my soul said hippolita does isabella charge me with being privy to it  father interrupted manfred i pay due reverence to your holy profession but i am sovereign here and will allow no meddling priest to interfere in the affairs of my domestic if you have ought to say attend me to my chamber  i do not use to let my wife be acquainted with the secret affairs of my state they are not within a womans province my lord said the holy man i am no intruder into the secrets of families my office is to promote peace to heal divisions to preach repentance and teach mankind to curb their headstrong passions i forgive your highnesss uncharitable apostrophe i know my duty and am the minister of a mightier prince than manfred hearken to him who speaks through my organs manfred trembled with rage and shame hippolitas countenance declared her astonishment and impatience to know where this would end her silence more strongly spoke her observance of manfred  the lady isabella resumed jerome commends herself to both your highnesses she thanks both for the kindness with which she has been treated in your castle she deplores the loss of your son and her own misfortune in not becoming the daughter of such wise and noble princes whom she shall always respect as parents she prays for uninterrupted union and felicity between you  manfreds color changed but as it is no longer possible for her to be allied to you she entreats your consent to remain in sanctuary till she can learn news of her father or by the certainty of his death be at liberty with the approbation of her guardians to dispose of herself in suitable marriage i shall give no such consent said the prince but insist on her return to the castle without delay i am answerable for her person to her guardians and will not brook her being in any hands but my own your highness will recollect whether that can any longer be proper replied the friar i want no monitor said manfred coloring isabellas conduct leaves room for strange suspicions  and that young villain who was at least the accomplice of her flight if not the cause of it  the cause interrupted jerome was a young man the cause this is not to be borne cried manfred am i to be bearded in my own palace by an insolent monk thou art privy i guess to their amors i would pray to heaven to clear up your uncharitable surmises said jerome if your highness were not satisfied in your conscience how unjustly you accuse me i do pray to heaven to pardon that uncharitableness and i implore your highness to leave the princess at peace in that holy place where she is not liable to be disturbed by such vain and worldly fantasies as discourses of love from any man cant not to me said manfred but return and bring the princess to her duty it is my duty to prevent her return hither said jerome she is where orphans and virgins are safest from the snares and wiles of this world and nothing but a parents authority shall take her thence i am her parent cried manfred and demand her she wished to have you for her parent said the friar but heaven that forbad that connection has for ever dissolved all ties betwixt you and i announce to your highness  stop audacious man said manfred and dread my displeasure holy father said hippolita it is your office to be no respecter of persons you must speak as your duty prescribes but it is my duty to hear nothing that it pleases not my lord i should hear attend the prince to his chamber i will retire to my oratory and pray to the blessed virgin to inspire you with her holy councils and to restore the heart of my gracious lord to its wonted peace and gentleness excellent woman said the friar  my lord i attend your pleasure  manfred accompanied by the friar passed to his own apartment where shutting the door i perceive father said he that isabella has acquainted you with my purpose now hear my resolve and obey reasons of state most urgent reasons my own and the safety of my people demand that i should have a son it is in vain to expect an heir from hippolita i have made choice of isabella you must bring her back and you must do more i know the influence you have with hippolita her conscience is in your hands she is i allow a faultless woman her soul is set on heaven and scorns the little grandeur of this world you can withdraw her from it entirely persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our marriage and to retire into a monastery  she shall endow one if she will and she shall have the means of being as liberal to your order as she or you can wish thus you will divert the calamities that are hanging over our heads and have the merit of saving the principality of otranto from destruction you are a prudent man and though the warmth of my temper betrayed me into some unbecoming expressions i honor your virtue and wish to be indebted to you for the repose of my life and the preservation of my family  the will of heaven be done said the friar i am but its worthless instrument it makes use of my tongue to tell thee prince of thy unwarrantable designs the injuries of the virtuous hippolita have mounted to the throne of pity by me thou art reprimanded for thy adulterous intention of repudiating her by me thou art warned not to pursue the incestuous design on thy contracted daughter heaven that delivered her from thy fury when the judgments so recently fallen on thy house ought to have inspired thee with other thoughts will continue to watch over her even i a poor and despised friar am able to protect her from thy violence  i sinner as i am and uncharitably reviled by your highness as an accomplice of i know not what amors scorn the allurements with which it has pleased thee to tempt mine honesty i love my order i honor devout souls i respect the piety of thy princess  but i will not betray the confidence she reposes in me nor serve even the cause of religion by foul and sinful compliances  but for sooth the welfare of the state depends on your highness having a son heaven mocks the shortsighted views of man but yestermorn whose house was so great so flourishing as manfreds  where is young conrad now  my lord i respect your tears  but i mean not to check them  let them flow prince they will weigh more with heaven toward the welfare of thy subjects than a marriage which founded on lust or policy could never prosper the scepter which passed from the race of alfonso to thine cannot be preserved by a match which the church will never allow if it is the will of the most high that manfreds name must perish resign yourself my lord to its decrees and thus deserve a crown that can never pass away  come my lord i like this sorrow  let us return to the princess she is not apprised of your cruel intentions nor did i mean more than to alarm you you saw with what gentle patience with what efforts of love she heard she rejected hearing the extent of your guilt i know she longs to fold you in her arms and assure you of her unalterable affection father said the prince you mistake my compunction true i honor hippolitas virtues i think her a saint and wish it were for my souls health to tie faster the knot that has united us  but alas father you know not the bitterest of my pangs it is some time that i have had scruples on the legality of our union hippolita is related to me in the fourth degree  it is true we had a dispensation but i have been informed that she had also been contracted to another this it is that sits heavy at my heart to this state of unlawful wedlock i impute the visitation that has fallen on me in the death of conrad  ease my conscience of this burden dissolve our marriage and accomplish the work of godliness which your divine exhortations have commenced in my soul  how cutting was the anguish which the good man felt when he perceived this turn in the wily prince he trembled for hippolita whose ruin he saw was determined and he feared if manfred had no hope of recovering isabella that his impatience for a son would direct him to some other object who might not be equally proof against the temptation of manfreds rank for some time the holy man remained absorbed in thought at length conceiving some hope from delay he thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the prince from despairing of recovering isabella her the friar knew he could dispose from her affection to hippolita and from the aversion she had expressed to him for manfreds addresses to second his views till the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce with this intention as if struck with the princes scruples he at length said my lord i have been pondering on what your highness has said and if in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive of your repugnance to your virtuous lady far be it from me to endeavor to harden your heart the church is an indulgent mother unfold your griefs to her she alone can administer comfort to your soul either by satisfying your conscience or upon examination of your scruples by setting you at liberty and indulging you in the lawful means of continuing your lineage in the latter case if the lady isabella can be brought to consent  manfred who concluded that he had either overreached the good man or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance was overjoyed at this sudden turn and repeated the most magnificent promises if he should succeed by the friars mediation the well meaning priest suffered him to deceive himself fully determined to traverse his views instead of seconding them  since we now understand one another resumed the prince i expect father that you satisfy me in one point who is the youth that i found in the vault he must have been privy to isabellas flight tell me truly is he her lover or is he an agent for anothers passion i have often suspected isabellas indifference to my son a thousand circumstances crowd on my mind that confirm that suspicion she herself was so conscious of it that while i discoursed her in the gallery she outran my suspicions and endeavored to justify herself from coolness to conrad the friar who knew nothing of the youth but what he had learnt occasionally from the princess ignorant what was become of him and not sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of manfreds temper conceived that it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind they might be turned to some use hereafter either by prejudicing the prince against isabella if he persisted in that union or by diverting his attention to a wrong scent and employing his thoughts on a visionary intrigue prevent his engaging in any new pursuit with this unhappy policy he answered in a manner to confirm manfred in the belief of some connection between isabella and the youth the prince whose passions wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze fell into a rage at the idea of what the friar suggested i will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue cried he and quitting jerome abruptly with a command to remain there till his return he hastened to the great hall of the castle and ordered the peasant to be brought before him  thou hardened young impostor said the prince as soon as he saw the youth what becomes of thy boasted veracity now it was providence was it and the light of the moon that discovered the lock of the trapdoor to thee tell me audacious boy who thou art and how long thou have been acquainted with the princess  and take care to answer with less equivocation than thou did last night or tortures shall wring the truth from thee the young man perceiving that his share in the flight of the princess was discovered and concluding that any thing he should say could no longer be of service or detriment to her replied i am no impostor my lord nor have i deserved opprobrious language i answered to every question your highness put to me last night with the same veracity that i shall speak now and that will not be from fear of your tortures but because my soul abhors a falsehood please to repeat your questions my lord i am ready to give you all the satisfaction in my power you know my questions replied the prince and only want time to prepare an evasion speak directly who art thou and how long have thou been known to the princess i am a labourer at the next village said the peasant my name is theodore the princess found me in the vault last night before that hour i never was in her presence i may believe as much or as little as i please of this said manfred but i will hear thy own story before i examine into the truth of it tell me what reason did the princess give thee for making her escape thy life depends to thy answer she told me replied theodore that she was on the brink of destruction and that if she could not escape from the castle she was in danger in a few moments of being made miserable for ever and on this slight foundation on a silly girls report said manfred thou did hazard my displeasure i fear no mans displeasure said theodore when a woman in distress puts herself under my protection  during this examination matilda was going to the apartment of hippolita at the upper end of the hall where manfred sat was a boarded gallery with latticed windows through which matilda and bianca were to pass hearing her fathers voice and seeing the servants assembled round him she stopped to learn the occasion the prisoner soon drew her attention the steady and composed manner in which he answered and the gallantry of his last reply which were the first words she heard distinctly interested her in his favor his person was noble handsome and commanding even in that situation but his countenance soon engrossed her whole care heavens bianca said the princess softly do i dream or is not that youth the exact resemblance of alfonsos picture in the gallery she could say no more for her fathers voice grew louder at every word this bravado said he surpasses all thy former insolence thou shall experience the wrath with which thou dare to trifle seize him continued manfred and bind him  the first news the princess hears of her champion shall be that he has lost his head for her sake the injustice of which thou art guilty toward me said theodore convinces me that i have done a good deed in delivering the princess from thy tyranny may she be happy whatever becomes of me this is a lover cried manfred in a rage a peasant within sight of death is not animated by such sentiments tell me tell me rash boy who thou art or the rack shall force thy secret from thee thou have threatened me with death already said the youth for the truth i have told thee if that is all the encouragement i am to expect for sincerity i am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity farther then thou will not speak said manfred i will not replied he bear him away into the courtyard said manfred i will see his head this instant severed from his body  matilda fainted at hearing those words bianca shrieked and cried help help the princess is dead manfred started at this ejaculation and demanded what was the matter the young peasant who heard it too was struck with horror and asked eagerly the same question but manfred ordered him to be hurried into the court and kept there for execution till he had informed himself of the cause of biancas shrieks when he learned the meaning he treated it as a womanish panic and ordering matilda to be carried to her apartment he rushed into the court and calling for one of his guards bade theodore kneel down and prepare to receive the fatal blow  the undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation that touched every heart but manfreds he wished earnestly to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the princess but fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her he desisted the only boon he deigned to ask was that he might be permitted to have a confessor and make his peace with heaven manfred who hoped by the confessors means to come at the youths history readily granted his request and being convinced that father jerome was now in his interest he ordered him to be called and shrift the prisoner the holy man who had little foreseen the catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned fell on his knees to the prince and adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent blood he accused himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion endeavored to disculpate the youth and left no method untried to soften the tyrants rage manfred more incensed than appeased by jeromes intercession whose retractation now made him suspect he had been imposed upon by both commanded the friar to do his duty telling him he would not allow the prisoner many minutes for confession nor do i ask many my lord said the unhappy young man my sins thank heaven have not been numerous nor exceed what might be expected at my years dry your tears good father and let us dispatch this is a bad world nor have i had cause to leave it with regret oh wretched youth said jerome how can thou bear the fight of me with patience i am thy murderer it is i have brought this dismal hour upon thee i forgive thee from my soul said the youth as i hope heaven will pardon me hear my confession father and give me thy blessing how can i prepare thee for thy passage as i ought said jerome thou can not be saved without pardoning thy foes  and can thou forgive that impious man there i can said theodore i do  and does not this touch thee cruel prince said the friar i sent for thee to confess him said manfred sternly not to plead for him thou did first incense me against him  his blood be on thy head it will it will said the good man in an agony of sorrow thou and i must never hope to go where this blessed youth is going dispatch said manfred i am no more to be moved by the whining of priests than by the shrieks of women what said the youth is it possible that my fate could have occasioned what i heard is the princess then again in thy power thou do but remember me of thy wrath said manfred prepare thee for this moment is thy last the youth who felt his indignation rise and who was touched with the sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators as well as into the friar suppressed his emotions and putting off his doublet and unbuttoning his collar knelt down to his prayers as he stooped his shirt slipped down below his shoulder and discovered the mark of a bloody arrow gracious heaven cried the holy man starting what do i see it is my child my theodore  the passions that ensued must be conceived they cannot be painted the tears of the assistants were suspended by wonder rather than stopped by joy they seemed to inquire in the eyes of their lord what they ought to feel surprise doubt tenderness respect succeeded each other in the countenance of the youth he received with modest submission the effusion of the old mans tears and embraces yet afraid of giving a loose to hope and suspecting from what had passed the inflexibility of manfreds temper he cast a glance toward the prince as if to say can thou be unmoved at such a scene as this  manfreds heart was capable of being touched he forgot his anger in his astonishment yet his pride forbade his owning himself affected he even doubted whether this discovery was not a contrivance of the friar to save the youth what may this mean said he how can he be thy son is it consistent with thy profession or reputed sanctity to avow a peasants offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amors oh god said the holy man do thou question his being mine could i feel the anguish i do if i were not his father spare him good prince spare him and revile me as thou please spare him spare him cried the attendants for this good mans sake peace said manfred sternly i must know more ere i am disposed to pardon a saints bastard may be no saint himself injurious lord said theodore add not insult to cruelty if i am this venerable mans son though no prince as thou art know the blood that flows in my vains  yes said the friar interrupting him his blood is noble nor is he that abject thing my lord you speak him he is my lawful son and sicily can boast of few houses more ancient than that of falconara  but alas my lord what is blood what is nobility we are all reptiles miserable sinful creatures it is piety alone that can distinguish us from the dust whence we sprung and whither we must return  truce to your sermon said manfred you forget you are no longer friar jerome but the count of falconara let me know your history you will have time to moralize hereafter if you should not happen to obtain the grace of that sturdy criminal there mother of god said the friar is it possible my lord can refuse a father the life of his only his longlost child trample me my lord scorn afflict me accept my life for his but spare my son thou can feel then said manfred what it is to lose an only son  a little hour ago thou did preach up resignation to me my house if fate so pleased must perish  but the counts of falconara  alas my lord said jerome i confess i have offended but aggravate not an old mans sufferings i boast not of my family nor think of such vanities  it is nature that pleads for this boy it is the memory of the dear woman that bore him  is she theodore is she dead  her soul has long been with the blessed said theodore oh how cried jerome tell me  no  she is happy thou art all my care now  most dread lord will you  will you grant me my poor boys life return to thy convent answered manfred conduct the princess hither obey me in what else thou know and i promise thee the life of thy son  oh my lord said jerome is my honesty the price i must pay for this dear youths safety  for me cried theodore let me die a thousand deaths rather than stain thy conscience what is it the tyrant would exact of thee is the princess still safe from his power protect her thou venerable old man and let all the weight of his wrath fall on me jerome endeavored to check the impetuosity of the youth and ere manfred could reply the trampling of horses was heard and a brazen trumpet which hung without the gate of the castle was suddenly sounded at the same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet which still remained at the other end of the court were tempestuously agitated and nodded thrice as if bowed by some invisible wearer  chap iii manfreds heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet father said he to jerome whom he now ceased to treat as count of falconara what mean these portents if i have offended  the plumes were shaken with greater violence than before unhappy prince that i am cried manfred  holy father will you not assist me with your prayers my lord replied jerome heaven is no doubt displeased with your mockery of its servants submit yourself to the church and cease to persecute her ministers dismiss this innocent youth and learn to respect the holy character i wear heaven will not be trifled with you see  the trumpet sounded again i acknowledge i have been too hasty said manfred father do you go to the wicket and demand who is at the gate do you grant me the life of theodore replied the friar i do said manfred but inquire who is without  jerome falling on the neck of his son discharged a flood of tears that spoke the fullness of his soul you promised to go to the gate said manfred i thought replied the friar your highness would excuse my thanking you first in this tribute of my heart go dearest sir said theodore obey the prince i do not deserve that you should delay his satisfaction for me  jerome inquiring who was without was answered a herald from whom said he from the knight of the gigantic sabre said the herald and i must speak with the usurper of otranto jerome returned to the prince and did not fail to repeat the message in the very words it had been uttered the first sounds struck manfred with terror but when he heard himself styled usurper his rage rekindled and all his courage revived usurper  insolent villain cried he who dares to question my title retire father this is no business for monks i will meet this presumptuous man myself go to your convent and prepare the princesss return your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity his life depends on your obedience good heaven my lord cried jerome your highness did but this instant freely pardon my child  have you so soon forgot the interposition of heaven heaven replied manfred does not send heralds to question the title of a lawful prince  i doubt whether it even notifies its will through friars  but that is your affair not mine at present you know my pleasure and it is not a saucy herald that shall save your son if you do not return with the princess  it was in vain for the holy man to reply manfred commanded him to be conducted to the posterngate and shut out from the castle and he ordered some of his attendants to carry theodore to the top of the black tower and guard him strictly scarce permitting the father and son to exchange a hasty embrace at parting he then withdrew to the hall and seating himself in princely state ordered the herald to be admitted to his presence  well thou insolent said the prince what would thou with me i come replied he to thee manfred usurper of the principality of otranto from the renowned and invincible knight the knight of the gigantic sabre in the name of his lord frederic marquis of vicenza he demands the lady isabella daughter of that prince whom thou have basely and traitorously got into thy power by bribing her false guardians during his absence and he requires thee to resign the principality of otranto which thou have usurped from the said lord frederic the nearest of blood to the last rightful lord alfonso the good if thou do not instantly comply with these just demands he defies thee to single combat to the last extremity and so saying the herald cast down his warder  and where is this braggart who sends thee said manfred at the distance of a league said the herald he comes to make good his lords claim against thee as he is a true knight and thou an usurper and ravisher  injurious as this challenge was manfred reflected that it was not his interest to provoke the marquis he knew how wellfounded the claim of frederic was nor was this the first time he had heard of it frederics ancestors had assumed the style of princes of otranto from the death of alfonso the good without issue but manfred his father and grandfather had been too powerful for the house of vicenza to dispossess them frederic a martial and amorous young prince had married a beautiful young lady of whom he was enamoured and who had died in childbed of isabella her death affected him so much that he had taken the cross and gone to the holy land where he was wounded in an engagement against the infidels made prisoner and reported to be dead when the news reached manfreds ears he bribed the guardians of the lady isabella to deliver her up to him as a bride for his son conrad by which alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the two houses this motive on conrads death had cooperated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself and the same reflection determined him now to endeavor at obtaining the consent of frederic to this marriage a like policy inspired him with the thought of inviting frederics champion into his castle lest he should be informed of isabellas flight which he strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the knights retinue  herald said manfred as soon as he had digested these reflections return to thy master and tell him ere we liquidate our differences by the sword manfred would hold some converse with him bid him welcome to my castle where by my faith as i am a true knight he shall have courteous reception and full security for himself and followers if we cannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means i swear he shall depart in safety and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of arms so help me god and his holy trinity the herald made three obeissances and retired  during this interview jeromes mind was agitated by a thousand contrary passions he trembled for the life of his son and his first thought was to persuade isabella to return to the castle yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union with manfred he dreaded hippolitas unbounded submission to the will of her lord and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce if he could get access to her yet should manfred discover that the obstruction came from him it might be equally fatal to theodore he was impatient to know whence came the herald who with so little management had questioned the title of manfred yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent lest isabella should leave it and her flight be imputed to him he returned disconsolately to the monastery uncertain on what conduct to resolve a monk who met him in the porch and observed his melancholy air said alas brother is it then true that we have lost our excellent princess hippolita the holy man started and cried what meanest thou brother i come this instant from the castle and left her in perfect health martelli replied the other friar passed by the convent but a quarter of an hour ago on his way from the castle and reported that her highness was dead all our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy transit to a better life and willed me to wait thy arrival they know thy holy attachment to that good lady and are anxious for the affliction it will cause in thee  indeed we have all reason to weep she was a mother to our house  but this life is but a pilgrimage we must not murmur  we shall all follow her may our end be like here is good brother thou dreamest said jerome i tell thee i come from the castle and left the princess well  where is the lady isabella  poor gentlewoman replied the friar i told her the sad news and offered her spiritual comfort i reminded her of the transitory condition of mortality and advised her to take the veil i quoted the example of the holy princess sanchia of arragon  thy zeal was laudable said jerome impatiently but at present it was unnecessary hippolita is well  at least i trust in the lord she is i heard nothing to the contrary  yet methinks the princes earnestness  well brother but where is the lady isabella i know not said the friar she wept much and said she would retire to her chamber jerome left his comrade abruptly and hasted to the princess but she was not in her chamber he inquired of the domestics of the convent but could learn no news of her he searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church and dispatched messengers round the neighborhood to get intelligence if she had been seen but to no purpose nothing could equal the good mans perplexity he judged that isabella suspecting manfred of having precipitated his wifes death had taken the alarm and withdrawn herself to some more secret place of concealment this new flight would probably carry the princes fury to the height the report of hippolitas death though it seemed almost incredible increased his consternation and though isabellas escape bespoke her aversion of manfred for a husband jerome could feel no comfort from it while it endangered the life of his son he determined to return to the castle and made several of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to manfred and if necessary join their intercession with his for theodore  the prince in the mean time had passed into the court and ordered the gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger knight and his train in a few minutes the cavalcade arrived first came two harbingers with wands next a herald followed by two pages and two trumpets then an hundred footguards these were attended by as many horse after them fifty footman clothed in scarlet and black the colors of the knight then a led horse two heralds on each side of a gentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of vicenza and otranto quarterly  a circumstance that much offended manfred  but he stifled his resentment two more pages the knights confessor telling his beads fifty more footmen clad as before two knights habited in complete armor their beavers down comrades to the principal knight the squires of the two knights carrying their shields and devices the knights own squire an hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword and seeming to faint under the weight of it the knight himself on a chestnut steed in complete armor his lance in the rest his face entirely concealed by his vizor which was surmounted by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers fifty footguards with drums and trumpets closed the procession which wheeled off to the right and left to make room for the principal knight  as soon as he approached the gate he stopped and the herald advancing read again the words of the challenge manfreds eyes were fixed on the gigantic sword and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel but his attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him he turned and beheld the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as before it required intrepidity like manfreds not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to announce his fate yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested he said boldly sir knight whoever thou art i bid thee welcome if thou art of mortal mould thy valor shall meet its equal and if thou art a true knight thou will scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point be these omens from heaven or hell manfred trusts to the righteousness of his cause and to the aid of st nicholas who has ever protected his house alight sir knight and repose thyself tomorrow thou shall have a fair field and heaven befriend the juster side  the knight made no reply but dismounting was conducted by manfred to the great hall of the castle as they traversed the court the knight stopped to gaze at the miraculous casque and kneeling down seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes rising he made a sign to the prince to lead on as soon as they entered the hall manfred proposed to the stranger to disarm but the knight shook his head in token of refusal sir knight said manfred this is not courteous but by my good faith i will not cross thee nor shall thou have cause to complain of the prince of otranto no treachery is designed on my part i hope none is intended on thine here take my gage giving him his ring your friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality rest here until refreshments are brought i will but give orders for the accommodation of your train and return to you the three knights bowed as accepting his courtesy manfred directed the strangers retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital founded by the princess hippolita for the reception of pilgrims as they made the circuit of the court to return toward the gate the gigantic sword burst from the supporters and falling to the ground opposite to the helmet remained immovable manfred almost hardened to preternatural appearances surmounted the shock of this new prodigy and returning to the hall where by this time the feast was ready he invited his silent guests to take their places manfred however ill his heart was at ease endeavored to inspire the company with mirth he put several questions to them but was answered only by signs they raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves and that sparingly sirs said the prince ye are the first guests i ever treated within these walls who scorned to hold any intercourse with me nor has it often been customary i ween for princes to hazard their state and dignity against strangers and mutes you say you come in the name of frederic of vicenza i have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous knight nor would he i am bold to say think it beneath him to mix in social converse with a prince that is his equal and not unknown by deeds in arms  still ye are silent  well be it as it may  by the laws of hospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this roof ye shall do your pleasures  but come give me a goblet of wine ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses the principal knight sighed and crossed himself and was rising from the board  sir knight said manfred what i said was but in sport i shall constrain you in nothing use your good liking since mirth is not your mood let us be sad business may hit your fancies better let us withdraw and hear if what i have to unfold may be better relished than the vain efforts i have made for your pastime  manfred then conducting the three knights into an inner chamber shut the door and inviting them to be seated began thus addressing himself to the chief personage  you come sir knight as i understand in the name of the marquis of vicenza to redemand the lady isabella his daughter who has been contracted in the face of holy church to my son by the consent of her legal guardians and to require me to resign my dominions to your lord who gives himself for the nearest of blood to prince alfonso whose soul god rest i shall speak to the latter article of your demands first you must know your lord knows that i enjoy the principality of otranto from my father don manuel as he received it from his father don ricardo alfonso their predecessor dying childless in the holy land bequeathed his estates to my grandfather don ricardo in consideration of his faithful services  the stranger shook his head  sir knight said manfred warmly ricardo was a valiant and upright man he was a pious man witness his munificent foundation of the adjoining church and two convents he was peculiarly patronized by st nicholas  my grandfather was incapable  i say sir don ricardo was incapable  excuse me your interruption has disordered me  i venerate the memory of my grandfather  well sirs he held this estate he held it by his good sword and by the favor of st nicholas  so did my father and so sirs will i come what come will  but frederic your lord is nearest in blood  i have consented to put my title to the issue of the sword  does that imply a vicious title  i might have asked where is frederic your lord report speaks him dead in captivity you say your actions say he lives  i question it not  i might sirs i might  but i do not other princes would bid frederic take his inheritance by force if he can they would not stake their dignity on a single combat they would not submit it to the decision of unknown mutes  pardon me gentlemen i am too warm but suppose yourselves in my situation as ye are stout knights would it not move your choler to have your own and the honor of your ancestors called in question  but to the point ye require me to deliver up the lady isabella  sirs i must ask if ye are authorized to receive her the knight nodded receive her  continued manfred well you are authorized to receive her  but gentle knight may i ask if you have full powers the knight nodded it is well said manfred then hear what i have to offer  ye see gentleman before you the most unhappy of men he began to weep afford me your compassion i am entitled to it indeed i am know i have lost my only hope my joy the support of my house  conrad died yester morning the knights discovered signs of surprise yes sirs fate has disposed of my son isabella is at liberty  do you then restore her cried the chief knight breaking silence afford me your patience said manfred i rejoice to find by this testimony of your good will that this matter may be adjusted without blood it is no interest of mine dictates what little i have farther to say ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world the loss of my son has weaned me from earthly cares power and greatness have no longer any charms in my eyes i wished to transmit the scepter i had received from my ancestors with honor to my son  but that is ever life itself is so indifferent to me that i accepted your defiance with joy a good knight cannot go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his vocation whatever is the will of heaven i submit for alas sirs i am a man of many sorrows manfred is no object of envy  but no doubt you are acquainted with my story the knight made signs of ignorance and seemed curious to have manfred proceed is it possible sirs continued the prince that my story should be a secret to you have you heard nothing relating to me and the princess hippolita they shook their heads  no thus then sirs it is you think me ambitious ambition alas is composed of more rugged materials if i were ambitious i should not for so many years have been a prey to all the hell of conscientious scruples  but i weary your patience i will be brief know then that i have long been troubled in mind on my union with the princess hippolita  oh sirs if ye were acquainted with that excellent woman if ye knew that i adore her like a mistress and cherish her as a friend  but man was not born for perfect happiness she shares my scruples and with her consent i have brought this matter before the church for we are related within the forbidden degrees i expect every hour the definitive sentence that must separate us for ever  i am sure you feel for me  i see you do  pardon these tears the knights gazed on each other wondering where this would end manfred continued the death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety i thought of nothing but resigning my dominions and retiring for ever from the sight of mankind my only difficulty was to fix on a successor who would be tender of my people and to dispose of the lady isabella who is dear to me as my own blood i was willing to restore the line of alfonso even in his most distant kindred and though pardon me i am satisfied it was his will that ricardos lineage should take place of his own relations yet where was i to search for those relations i knew of none but frederic your lord he was a captive to the infidels or dead and were he living and at home would he quit the flourishing state of vicenza for the inconsiderable principality of otranto if he would not could i bear the thought of seeing a hard unfeeling viceroy set over my poor faithful people  for sirs i love my people and thank heaven am beloved by them  but ye will ask whither tends this long discourse briefly then thus sirs heaven in your arrival seems to point out a remedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes the lady isabella is at liberty i shall soon be so  i would submit to any thing for the good of my people  were it not the best the only way to extinguish the feuds between our families if i was to take the lady isabella to wife  you start  but though hippolitas virtues will ever be dear to me a prince must not consider himself he is born for his people  a servant at that instant entering the chamber apprized manfred that jerome and several of his brethren demanded immediate access to him  the prince provoked at this interruption and fearing that the friar would discover to the strangers that isabella had taken sanctuary was going to forbid jeromes entrance but recollecting that he was certainly arrived to notify the princesss return manfred began to excuse himself to the knights for leaving them for a few moments but was prevented by the arrival of the friars manfred angrily reprimanded them for their intrusion and would have forced them back from the chamber but jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed he declared aloud the flight of isabella with protestations of his own innocence manfred distracted at the news and not less at its coming to the knowledge of the strangers uttered nothing but incoherent sentences now upbraiding the friar now apologizing to the knights earnest to know what was become of isabella yet equally afraid of their knowing impatient to pursue her yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit he offered to dispatch messengers in quest of her  but the chief knight no longer keeping silence reproached manfred in bitter terms for his dark and ambigucus dealing and demanded the cause of isabellas first absence from the castle manfred casting a stern look at jerome implying a command of silence pretended that on conrads death he had placed her in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her jerome who trembled for his sons life did not dare contradict this falsehood but one of his brethren not under the same anxiety declared frankly that she had fled to their church in the preceding night the prince in vain endeavored to stop this discovery which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion the principal stranger amazed at the contradictions he heard and more than half persuaded that manfred had secreted the princess notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her flight rushing to the door said thou traitorprince isabella shall be found manfred endeavored to hold him but the other knights assisting their comrade he broke from the prince and hastened into the court demanding his attendants manfred finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit offered to accompany him and summoning his attendants and taking jerome and some of the friars to guide them they issued from the castle manfred privately giving orders to have the knights company secured while to the knight he affected to dispatch a messenger to require their assistance  the company had no sooner quitted the castle than matilda who felt herself deeply interested for the young peasant since she had seen him condemned to death in the hall and whose thoughts had been taken up with concerting measures to save him was informed by some of the female attendants that manfred had dispatched all his men various ways in pursuit of isabella he had in his hurry given this order in general terms not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon theodore but forgetting it the domestics officious to obey so peremptory a prince and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty to join in any precipitate chase had to a man left the castle matilda disengaging herself from her women stole up to the black tower and unbolting the door presented herself to the astonished theodore young man said she though filial duty and womanly modesty condemn the step i am taking yet holy charity surmounting all other ties justifies this act fly the doors of thy prison are open my father and his domestics are absent but they may soon return be gone in safety and may the angels of heaven direct thy course thou art surely one of those angels said the enraptured theodore none but a blessed saint could speak could act  could look like thee  may i not know the name of my divine protectress methought thou namedst thy father is it possible can manfreds blood feel holy pity  lovely lady thou answerest not  but how art thou here thyself why do thou neglect thy own safety and waste a thought on a wretch like theodore let us fly together the life thou bestowest shall be dedicated to thy defense alas thou mistakest said matilda sighing i am manfreds daughter but no dangers await me amazement said theodore but last night i blessed myself for yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably returns me now still thou art in an error said the princess but this is no time for explanation fly virtuous youth while it is in my power to save thee should my father return thou and i both should indeed have cause to tremble how said theodore think thou charming maid that i will accept of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to thee better i endured a thousand deaths  i run no risk said matilda but by thy delay depart it cannot be known that i assisted thy flight swear by the faints above said theodore that thou can not be suspected else here i vow to await whatever can befall me oh thou art too generous said matilda but rest assured that no suspicion can alight on me give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou do not deceive me said theodore and let me bathe it with the warm tears of gratitude  forbear said the princess this must not be alas said theodore i have never known but calamity until this hour  perhaps shall never know other fortune again suffer the chaste raptures of holy gratitude it is my soul would print its effusions on thy hand forbear and be gone said matilda  how would isabella approve of seeing thee at my feet who is isabella said the young man with surprise ah me i fear said the princess i am serving a deceitful one  have thou forgot thy curiosity this morning thy looks thy actions all thy beauteous self seems an emanation of divinity said theodore but thy words are dark and mysterious  speak lady speak to thy servants comprehension  thou understandest but too well said matilda but once more i command thee to be gone thy blood which i may preserve will be on my head if i waste the time in vain discourse i go lady said theodore because it is thy will and because i would not bring the gray hairs of my father with sorrow to the grave say but adored lady that i have thy gentle pity  stay said matilda i will conduct thee to the subterraneous vault by which isabella escaped it will lead thee to the church of st nicholas where thou may take sanctuary  what said theodore was it another and not thy lovely self that i assisted to find the subterraneous passage it was said matilda but ask no more i tremble to see thee still abide here fly to the sanctuary  to sanctuary said theodore no princess sanctuaries are for helpless damsels or for criminals theodores soul is free from guilt nor will wear the appearance of it give me a sword lady and thy father shall learn that theodore scorns an ignominious flight rash youth said matilda thou would not dare to lift thy presumptuous arm against the prince of otranto not against thy father indeed i dare not said theodore excuse me lady i had forgotten  but could i gaze on thee and remember thou art sprung from the tyrant manfred  but he is thy father and from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion a deep and hollow groan which seemed to come from above startled the princess and theodore good heaven we are overheard said the princess they listened but perceiving no farther noise they both concluded it the effect of pentup vapors and the princess preceding theodore softly carried him to her fathers armory where equipping him with a complete suit he was conducted by matilda to the posterngate avoid the town said the princess and all the western side of the castle it is there the search must be making by manfred and the strangers but hie thee to the opposite quarter yonder behind that forest to the east is a chain of rocks hollowed into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the seacoast there thou may lie concealed till thou can make signs to some vessel to put on shore and take thee off go heaven be thy guide  and sometimes in thy prayers remember  matilda theodore flung himself at her feet and seizing her lily hand which with struggles she suffered him to kiss he vowed on the earliest opportunity to get himself knighted and fervently entreated her permission to swear himself eternally her knight  ere the princess could reply a clap of thunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements theodore regardless of the tempest would have urged his suit but the princess dismayed retreated hastily into the castle and commanded the youth to be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed he sighed and retired but with eyes fixed on the gate until matilda closing it put an end to an interview in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a passion which both now tasted for the first time  theodore went pensively to the convent to acquaint his father with his deliverance there he learned the absence of jerome and the pursuit that was making after the lady isabella with some particulars of whose story he now first became acquainted the generous galantry of his nature prompted him to wish to assist her but the monks could lend him no lights to guess at the route she had taken he was not tempted to wander far in search of her for the idea of matilda had imprinted itself so strongly on his heart that he could not bear to absent himself at much distance from her abode the tenderness jerome had expressed for him concurred to confirm this reluctance and he even persuaded himself that filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the castle and monastery until jerome should return at night theodore at length determined to repair to the forest that matilda had pointed out to him arriving there he sought the gloomiest shades as best suited to the pleasing melancholy that reigned in his mind in this mood he roved insensibly to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits he recollected to have heard this tradition and being of a brave and adventurous disposition he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth he had not penetrated far before he thought he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him theodore though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be believed had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause to the malice of the powers of darkness he thought the place more likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are reported to molest and bewilder travelers he had long burned with impatience to approve his valor  drawing his sabre he marched sedately onwards still directing his steps as the imperfect rustling sound before him led the way the armor he wore was a like indication to the person who avoided him theodore now convinced that he was not mistaken redoubled his pace and evidently gained on the person that fled whose haste increasing theodore came up just as a woman fell breathless before him he hasted to raise her but her terror was so great that he apprehended she would faint in his arms he used every gentle word to dispel her alarms and assured her that far from injuring he would defend her at the peril of his life the lady recovering her spirits from his courteous demeanor and gazing on her protector said sure i have heard that voice before not to my knowledge replied theodore unless as i conjecture thou art the lady isabella  merciful heaven cried she thou art not sent in quest of me art thou and saying those words she threw herself at his feet and besought him not to deliver her up to manfred to manfred cried theodore  no lady i have once already delivered thee from his tyranny and it shall fare hard with me now but i will place thee out of the reach of his daring is it possible said she that thou should be the generous unknown whom i met last night in the vault of the castle sure thou art not a mortal but my guardian angel on my knees let me thank  hold gentle princess said theodore nor demean thyself before a poor and friendless young man if heaven has selected me for thy deliverer it will accomplish its work and strengthen my arm in thy cause  but come lady we are too near the mouth of the cavern let us seek its inmost recesses i can have no tranquillity till i have placed thee beyond the reach of danger alas what mean you sir said she though all your actions are noble though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul is it fitting that i should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats should we be found together what would a censorious world think of my conduct i respect your virtuous delicacy said theodore nor do you harbor a suspicion that wounds my honor i meant to conduct you into the most private cavity of these rocks and then at the hazard of my life to guard their entrance against every living thing besides lady continued he drawing a deep sigh beauteous and all perfect as your form is and though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring know my soul is dedicated to another and although  a sudden noise prevented theodore from proceeding they soon distinguished these sounds isabella what ho isabella  the trembling princess relapsed into her former agony of fear theodore endeavored to encourage her but in vain he assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under manfreds power and begging her to remain concealed he went forth to prevent the person in search of her from approaching  at the mouth of the cavern he found an armed knight discoursing with a peasant who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock the knight was preparing to seek her when theodore placing himself in his way with his sword drawn sternly forbad him at his peril to advance and who art thou who dare to cross my way said the knight haughtily one who does not dare more than he will perform said theodore i seek the lady isabella said the knight and understand she has taken refuge among these rocks impede me not or thou will repent having provoked my resentment thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible said theodore return whence thou came or we shall soon know whose resentment is most terrible the stranger who was the principal knight that had arrived from the marquis of vicenza had galloped from manfred as he was busied in getting information of the princess and giving various orders to prevent her falling into the power of the three knights their chief had suspected manfred of being privy to the princesss absconding and this insult from a man who he concluded was stationed by that prince to secret her confirming his suspicions he made no reply but discharging a blow with his sabre at theodore would soon have removed all obstruction if theodore who took him for one of manfreds captains and who had no sooner given the provocation than prepared to support it had not received the stroke on his shield the valor that had so long been smothered in his breast broke forth at once he rushed impetuously on the knight whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy deeds the combat was furious but not long theodore wounded the knight in three several places and at last disarmed him as he fainted with the loss of blood the peasant who had fled at the first onset had given the alarm to some of manfreds domestics who by his orders were dispersed through the forest in pursuit of isabella they came up as the knight fell whom they soon discovered to be the noble stranger theodore notwithstanding his hatred to manfred could not behold the victory he had gained without emotions of pity and generosity but he was more touched when he learned the quality of his adversary and was informed that he was no retainer but an enemy of manfred he assisted the servants of the latter in disarming the knight and in endeavoring to staunch the blood that flowed from his wounds the knight recovering his speech said in a faint and faltering voice generous foe we have both been in an error i took thee for an instrument of the tyrant i perceive thou have made the like mistake  it is too late for excuses  i faint  if isabella is at hand  call her  i have important secrets to  he is dying said one of the attendants has nobody a crucifix about them andrea do thou pray over him  fetch some water said theodore and pour it down his throat while i hasten to the princess  saying this he flew to isabella and in few words told her modestly that he had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from her fathers court who wished ere he died to impart something of consequence to her the princess who had been transported at hearing the voice of theodore as he called to her to come forth was astonished at what she heard suffering herself to be conducted by theodore the new proof of whose valor recalled her dispersed spirits she came where the bleeding knight lay speechless on the ground  but her fears returned when she beheld the domestics of manfred she would again have fled if theodore had not made her observe that they were unarmed and had not threatened them with instant death if they should dare to seize the princess the stranger opening his eyes and beholding a woman said  art thou  pray tell me truly  art thou isabella of vicenza i am said she good heaven restore thee  then thou  then thou  said the knight struggling for utterance  see  thy father  give me one  oh amazement horror what do i hear what do i see cried isabella my father you my father how came you here sir for heavens sake speak  oh run for help or he will expire  it is most true said the wounded knight exerting all his force i am frederic thy father  yes i came to deliver thee  it will not be  give me a parting kiss and take  sir said theodore do not exhaust yourself suffer us to convey you to the castle  to the castle said isabella is there no help nearer than the castle would you expose my father to the tyrant if he goes thither i dare not accompany him  and yet can i leave him my child said frederic it matters not for me whither i am carried a few minutes will place me beyond danger  but while i have eyes to dote on thee forsake me not dear isabella this brave knight  i know not who he is will protect thy innocence  sir you will not abondon my child will you theodore shedding tears over his victim and vowing to guard the princess at the expense of his life persuaded frederic to suffer himself to be conducted to the castle they placed him on a horse belonging to one of the domestics after binding up his wounds as well as they were able theodore marched by his side and the affected isabella who could not bear to quit him followed mournfully behind  chap iv the sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle than they were met by hippolita and matilda whom isabella had sent one of the domestics before to advertise of their approach the ladies causing frederic to be conveyed into the nearest chamber retired while the surgeons examined his wounds matilda blushed at seeing theodore and isabella together but endeavored to conceal it by embracing the latter and condoling with her on her fathers mischance the surgeons soon came to acquaint hippolita that none of the marquiss wounds were dangerous and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter and the princesses theodore under pretense of expressing his joy at being freed from his apprehensions of the combat being fatal to frederic could not resist the impulse of following matilda her eyes were so often cast down on meeting his that isabella who regarded theodore as attentively as he gazed on matilda soon divined who the object was that he had told her in the cave engaged his affections while this mute scene passed hippolita demanded of frederic the cause of his having taken that mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter and threw in various apologies to excuse her lord for the match contracted between their children frederic however incensed against manfred was not insensible to the courtesy and benevolence of hippolita but he was still more struck with the lovely form of matilda wishing to detain them by his bedside he informed hippolita of his story he told her that while prisoner to the infidels he had dreamed that his daughter of whom he had learned no news since his captivity was detained in a castle where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes and that if he obtained his liberty and repaired to a wood near joppa he would learn more alarmed at this dream and incapable of obeying the direction given by it his chains became more grievous than ever but while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his liberty he received the agreeable news that the confederate princes who were warring in palestine had paid his ransom he instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in his dream for three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without seeing a human form but on the evening of the third they came to a cell in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death applying rich cordials they brought the saintlike man to his speech my sons said he i am bounden to your charity  but it is in vain  i am going to my eternal rest  yet i die with the satisfaction of performing the will of heaven when first i repaired to this solitude after seeing my country become a prey to unbelievers  it is alas above fifty years since i was witness to that dreadful scene st nicholas appeared to me and revealed a secret which he had me never reveal to mortal man but on my deathbed this is that tremendous hour and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors to whom i was ordered to reveal my trust as soon as ye have done the last offices to this wretched corse dig under the seventh tree on the left hand of this poor cave and your pains will  oh good heaven receive my soul with those words the devout man breathed his last by break of day continued frederic when we had committed the holy relics to earth we dug according to direction  but what was our astonishment when about the depth of six feet we discovered an enormous sabre  the very weapon yonder in the court on the blade which was then partly out of the scabbard though since closed by our efforts in removing it were written the following lines  no excuse me madam added the marquis turning to hippolita if i forbear to repeat them i respect your sex and rank and would not be guilty of offending your ear with sounds injurious to aught that is dear to you  he paused hippolita trembled she did not doubt but frederic was destined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten her house looking with anxious fondness at matilda a silent tear stole down her cheek but recollecting herself she said proceed my lord heaven does nothing in vain mortals must receive its divine behests with lowliness and submission it is our part to deprecate its wrath or bow to its decrees repeat the sentence my lord we listen resigned frederic was grieved that he had proceeded so far the dignity and patient firmness of hippolita penetrated him with respect and the tender silent affection with which the princess and her daughter regarded each other melted him almost to tears yet apprehensive that his forbearance to obey would be more alarming he repeated in a faltering and low voice the following lines  where ever a casque that suits this sword is found with perils is thy daughter compassed round alfonso s blood alone can save the maid and quiet a long restless princes shade what is there in these lines said theodore impatiently that affects these princesses why were they to be shocked by a mysterious delicacy that has so little foundation your words are rude young man said the marquis and though fortune has favored you once  my honored lord said isabella who resented theodores warmth which she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for matilda discompose not yourself for the glosing of a peasants son he forgets the reverence he owes you but he is not accustomed  hippolita concerned at the heat that had arisen checked theodore for his boldness but with an air acknowledging his zeal and changing the conversation demanded of frederic where he had left her lord as the marquis was going to reply they heard a noise without and rising to inquire the cause manfred jerome and part of the troop who had met an imperfect rumor of what had happened entered the chamber manfred advanced hastily toward frederics bed to condole with him on his misfortune and to learn the circumstances of the combat when starting in an agony of terror and amazement he cried ha what art thou thou dreadful spectre is my hour come  my dearest gracious lord cried hippolita clasping him in her arms what is it you see why do you fix your eye balls thus  what cried manfred breathless  do thou see nothing hippolita is this ghastly phantom sent to me alone  to me who did not  for mercys sweetest self my lord said hippolita resume your soul command your reason there is none here but us your friends  what is not that alfonso cried manfred do thou not see him can it be my brains delirium  this my lord said hippolita this is theodore the youth who has been so unfortunate  theodore said manfred mournfully and striking his forehead  theodore or a phantom he has unhinged the soul of manfred  but how comes he here and how comes he in armor i believe he went in search of isabella said hippolita of isabella said manfred relapsing into rage  yes yes that is not doubtful  but how did he escape from durance in which i left him was it isabella or this hypocritical old friar that procured his enlargement  and would a parent be criminal my lord said theodore if he meditated the deliverance of his child jerome amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son and without foundation knew not what to think he could not comprehend how theodore had escaped how he came to be armed and to encounter frederic still he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend to inflame manfreds wrath against his son jeromes silence convinced manfred that he had contrived theodores release  and is it thus thou ungrateful old man said the prince addressing himself to the friar that thou repayest mine and hippolitas bounties and not content with traversing my hearts nearest wishes thou armest thy bastard and bring him into my own castle to insult me my lord said theodore you wrong my father nor he nor i are capable of harboring a thought against your peace is it insolence thus to surrender myself to your highnesss pleasure added he laying his sword respectfully at manfreds feet behold my bosom strike my lord if you suspect that a disloyal thought is lodged there there is not a sentiment engraven on my heart that does not venerate you and yours the grace and fervor with which theodore uttered these words interested every person present in his favor even manfred was touched  yet still possessed with his resemblance to alfonso his admiration was dashed with secret horror rise said he thy life is not my present purpose  but tell me thy history and how thou came connected with this old traitor here my lord said jerome eagerly  peace impostor said manfred i will not have him prompted my lord said theodore i want no assistance my story is very brief i was carried at five years of age to algiers with my mother who had been taken by corsairs from the coast of sicily she died of grief in less than a twelvemonth  the tears gushed from jeromes eyes on whose countenance a thousand anxious passions stood expressed before she died continued theodore she bound a writing about my arm under my garments which told me i was the son of the count falconara  it is most true said jerome i am that wretched father  again i enjoin thee silence said manfred proceed i remained in slavery said theodore until within these two years when attending on my master in his cruizes i was delivered by a christian vessel which overpowered the pirate and discovering myself to the captain he generously put me on shore in sicily  but alas instead of finding a father i learned that his estate which was situated on the coast had during his absence been laid waste by the rover who had carried my mother and me into captivity that his castle had been burnt to the ground and that my father on his return had sold what remained and was retired into a religious house in the kingdom of naples but where no man could inform me destitute and friendless hopeless almost of attaining the transport of a parents embrace i took the first opportunity of setting sail for naples from whence within these six days i wandered into this province still supporting myself by the labor of my hands nor until yestermorn did i believe that heaven had reserved any lot for me but peace of mind and contented poverty this my lord is theodores story i am blessed beyond my hope in finding a father i am unfortunate beyond my desert in having incurred your highnesss displeasure he ceased a murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience this is not all said frederic i am bound in honor to add what he suppresses though he is modest i must be generous  he is one of the bravest youths on christian ground he is warm too and from the short knowledge i have of him i will pledge myself for his veracity if what he reports of himself were not true he would not utter it  and for me youth i honor a frankness which becomes thy birth but now and thou did offend me yet the noble blood which flows in thy vains may well be allowed to boil out when it has so recently traced itself to its source come my lord turning to manfred if i can pardon him surely you may it is not the youths fault if you took him for a spectre this bitter taunt galled the soul of manfred if beings from another world replied he haughtily have power to impress my mind with awe it is more than living man can do nor could a striplings arm  my lord interrupted hippolita your guest has occasion for repose shall we not leave him to his rest saying this and taking manfred by the hand she took leave of frederic and led the company forth the prince not sorry to quit a conversation which recalled to mind the discovery he had made of his most secret sensations suffered himself to be conducted to his own apartment after permitting theodore though under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow a condition the young man gladly accepted to retire with his father to the convent matilda and isabella were too much occupied with their own reflections and too little content with each other to wish for farther converse that night they separated each to her chamber with more expressions of ceremony and fewer of affection than had passed between them since their childhood  if they parted with small cordiality they did but meet with greater impatience as soon as the sun was risen their minds were in a situation that excluded sleep and each recollected a thousand questions which she wished she had put to the other overnight matilda reflected that isabella had been twice delivered by theodore in very critical situations which she could not believe accidental his eyes it was true had been fixed on her in frederics chamber but that might have been to disguise his passion for isabella from the fathers of both it were better to clear this up  she wished to know the truth lest she should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for isabellas lover thus jealousy prompted and at the same time borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity  isabella not less restless had better foundation for her suspicions both theodores tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged  it was true  yet perhaps matilda might not correspond to his passion  she had ever appeared insensible to love all her thoughts were set on heaven  why did i dissuade her said isabella to herself i am punished for my generosity  but when did they meet where  it cannot be i have deceived myself  perhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each other  it must be some other object that has prepossessed his affections  if it is i am not so unhappy as i thought if it is not my friend matilda  how can i stoop to wish for the affection of a man who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted me with his indifference and that at the very moment in which common courtesy demanded at least expressions of civility i will go to my dear matilda who will confirm me in this becoming pride  man is false  i will advise with her on taking the veil she will rejoice to find me in this disposition and i will acquaint her that i no longer oppose her inclination for the cloister in this frame of mind and determined to open her heart entirely to matilda she went to that princesss chamber whom she found already dressed and leaning pensively on her arm this attitude so correspondent to what she felt herself revived isabellas suspicions and destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend they blushed at meeting and were too much novices to disguise their sensations with address after some unmeaning questions and replies matilda demanded of isabella the cause of her flight the latter who had almost forgotten manfreds passion so entirely was she occupied by her own concluding that matilda referred to her last escape from the convent which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening replied martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was dead  oh said matilda interrupting her bianca has explained that mistake to me on seeing me faint she cried out the princess is dead and martelli who had come for the usual dole to the castle  and what made you faint said isabella indifferent to the rest matilda blushed and stammered  my father  he was sitting in judgment on a criminal  what criminal said isabella eagerly  a young man said matilda  i believe  i think it was that young man that  what theodore said isabella yes answered she i never saw him before i do not know how he had offended my father  but as he has been of service to you i am glad my lord has pardoned him  served me replied isabella do you term it serving me to wound my father and almost occasion his death though it is but since yesterday that i am blessed with knowing a parent i hope matilda does not think i am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness of that audacious youth and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any affection for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my being no matilda my heart abhors him and if you still retain the friendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy you will detest a man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever matilda held down her head and replied i hope my dearest isabella does not doubt her matildas friendship i never beheld that youth until yesterday he is almost a stranger to me but as the surgeons have pronounced your father out of danger you ought not to harbor uncharitable resentment against one who i am persuaded did not know the marquis was related to you you plead his cause very pathetically said isabella considering he is so much a stranger to you i am mistaken or he returns your charity what mean you said matilda nothing said isabella repenting that she had given matilda a hint of theodores inclination for her then changing the discourse she asked matilda what occasioned manfred to take theodore for a spectre bless me said matilda did not you observe his extreme resemblance to the portrait of alfonso in the gallery i took notice of it to bianca even before i saw him in armor but with the helmet on he is the very image of that picture i do not much observe pictures said isabella much less have i examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have done  ah matilda your heart is in danger  but let me warn you as a friend  he has owned to me that he is in love it cannot be with you for yesterday was the first time you ever met  was it not certainly replied matilda but why does my dearest isabella conclude from any thing i have said that  she paused  then continuing he saw you first and i am far from having the vanity to think that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to you  may you be happy isabella whatever is the fate of matilda my lovely friend said isabella whose heart was too honest to resist a kind expression it is you that theodore admires i saw it i am persuaded of it nor shall a thought of my own happiness suffer me to interfere with yours this frankness drew tears from the gentle matilda and jealousy that for a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens soon gave way to the natural sincerity and candor of their souls each confessed to the other the impression that theodore had made on her and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity each insisting on yielding her claim to her friend at length the dignity of isabellas virtue reminding her of the preference which theodore had almost declared for her rival made her determine to conquer her passion and cede the beloved object to her friend  during this contest of amity hippolita entered her daughters chamber madam said she to isabella you have so much tenderness for matilda and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house that i can have no secrets with my child which are not proper for you to hear the princesses were all attention and anxiety know then madam continued hippolita and you my dearest matilda that being convinced by all the events of these two last ominous days that heaven purposes the scepter of otranto should pass from manfreds hands into those of the marquis frederic i have been perhaps inspired with the thought of averting our total destruction by the union of our rival houses with this view i have been proposing to manfred my lord to tender this dear dear child to frederic your father  me to lord frederic cried matilda  good heavens my gracious mother  and have you named it to my father i have said hippolita he listened benignly to my proposal and is gone to break it to the marquis ah wretched princess cried isabella what have thou done what ruin has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing for thyself for me and for matilda ruin from me to you and to my child said hippolita what can this mean alas said isabella the purity of your own heart prevents your seeing the depravity of others manfred your lord that impious man  hold said hippolita you must not in my presence young lady mention manfred with disrespect he is my lord and husband and  will not long be so said isabella if his wicked purposes can be carried into execution this language amazes me said hippolita your feeling isabella is warm but until this hour i never knew it betray you into intemperance what deed of manfred authorizes you to treat him as a murderer an assassin thou virtuous and too credulous princess replied isabella it is not thy life he aims at  it is to separate himself from thee to divorce thee to  to divorce me to divorce my mother cried hippolita and matilda at once  yes said isabella and to complete his crime he meditates  i cannot speak it what can surpass what thou have already uttered said matilda hippolita was silent grief choked her speech and the recollection of manfreds late ambiguous discourses confirmed what she heard excellent dear lady madam mother cried isabella flinging herself at hippolitas feet in a transport of passion trust me believe me i will die a thousand deaths sooner than consent to injure you than yield to so odious  oh  this is too much cried hippolita what crimes does one crime suggest rise dear isabella i do not doubt your virtue oh matilda this stroke is too heavy for thee weep not my child and not a murmur i charge thee remember he is thy father still  but you are my mother too said matilda servently and you are virtuous you are guiltless  oh must not i must not i complain you must not said hippolita  come all will yet be well manfred in the agony for the loss of thy brother knew not what he said perhaps isabella misunderstood him his heart is good  and my child thou know not all there is a destiny hangs over us the hand of providence is stretched out  oh could i but save thee from the wreck  yes continued she in a firmer tone perhaps the sacrifice of myself may atone for all  i will go and offer myself to this divorce  it boots not what becomes of me i will withdraw into the neighboring monastery and waste the remainder of life in prayers and tears for my child and  the prince thou art as much too good for this world said isabella as manfred is execrable  but think not lady that thy weakness shall determine for me i swear hear me all ye angels  stop i adjure thee cried hippolita remember thou do not depend on thyself thou have a father  my father is too pious too noble interrupted isabella to command an impious deed but should he command it can a father enjoin a cursed act i was contracted to the son can i wed the father  no madam no force should not drag me to manfreds hated bed i loath him i abhor him divine and human laws forbid  and my friend my dearest matilda would i wound her tender soul by injuring her adored mother my own mother  i never have known another  oh she is the mother of both cried matilda can we can we isabella adore her too much my lovely children said the touched hippolita your tenderness overpowers me  but i must not give way to it it is not ours to make election for ourselves heaven our fathers and our husbands must decide for us have patience until you hear what manfred and frederic have determined if the marquis accepts matildas hand i know she will readily obey heaven may interpose and prevent the rest what means my child continued she seeing matilda fall at her feet with a flood of speechless tears  but no answer me not my daughter i must not hear a word against the pleasure of thy father oh doubt not my obedience my dreadful obedience to him and to you said matilda but can i most respected of women can i experience all this tenderness this world of goodness and conceal a thought from the best of mothers what are thou going to utter said isabella trembling recollect thyself matilda no isabella said the princess i should not deserve this incomparable parent if the inmost recesses of my soul harbored a thought without her permission  nay i have offended her i have suffered a passion to enter my heart without her avowal  but here i disclaim it here i vow to heaven and her  my child my child said hippolita what words are these what new calamities has fate in store for us thou a passion thou in this hour of destruction  oh i see all my guilt said matilda i abhor myself if i cost my mother a pang she is the dearest thing i have on earth  oh i will never never behold him more isabella said hippolita thou art conscious to this unhappy secret whatever it is speak  what cried matilda have i so forfeited my mothers love that she will not permit me even to speak my own guilt oh wretched wretched matilda thou art too cruel said isabella to hippolita can thou behold this anguish of a virtuous mind and not commiserate it not pity my child said hippolita catching matilda in her arms  oh i know she is good she is all virtue all tenderness and duty i do forgive thee my excellent my only hope the princesses then revealed to hippolita their mutual inclination for theodore and the purpose of isabella to resign him to matilda hippolita blamed their imprudence and showed them the improbability that either father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a man though nobly born some comfort it gave her to find their passion of so recent a date and that theodore had had but little cause to suspect it in either she strictly enjoined them to avoid all correspondence with him this matilda fervently promised but isabella who flattered herself that she meant no more than to promote his union with her friend could not determine to avoid him and made no reply i will go to the convent said hippolita and order new masses to be said for a deliverance from these calamities  oh my mother said matilda you mean to quit us you mean to take sanctuary and to give my father an opportunity of pursuing his fatal intention alas on my knees i supplicate you to forbear  will you leave me a prey to frederic i will follow you to the convent  be at peace my child said hippolita i will return instantly i will never abandon thee until i know it is the will of heaven and for thy benefit do not deceive me said matilda i will not marry frederic until thou command it  alas what will become of me why that exclamation said hippolita i have promised thee to return  ah my mother replied matilda stay and save me from myself a frown from thee can do more than all my fathers severity i have given away my heart and you alone can make me recall it no more said hippolita thou must not relapse matilda i can quit theodore said she but must i wed another let me attend thee to the altar and shut myself from the world for ever thy fate depends on thy father said hippolita i have ill bestowed my tenderness if it has taught thee to revere aught beyond him adieu my child i go to pray for thee  hippolitas real purpose was to demand of jerome whether in conscience she might not consent to the divorce she had often urged manfred to resign the principality which the delicacy of her conscience rendered an hourly burden to her these scruples concurred to make the separation from her husband appear less dreadful to her than it would have seemed in any other situation  jerome at quitting the castle overnight had questioned theodore severely why he had accused him to manfred of being privy to his escape theodore owned it had been with design to prevent manfreds suspicion from alighting on matilda and added the holiness of jeromes life and character secured him from the tyrants wrath jerome was heartily grieved to discover his sons inclination for that princess and leaving him to his rest promised in the morning to acquaint him with important reasons for conquering his passion theodore like isabella was too recently acquainted with parental authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart he had little curiosity to learn the friars reasons and less disposition to obey them the lovely matilda had made stronger impressions on him than filial affection all night he pleased himself with visions of love and it was not till late after the morningoffice that he recollected the friars commands to attend him at alfonsos tomb  young man said jerome when he saw him this tardiness does not please me have a fathers commands already so little weight theodore made awkward excuses and attributed his delay to having overslept himself and on whom were thy dreams employed said the friar sternly his son blushed come come resumed the friar inconsiderate youth this must not be eradicate this guilty passion from thy breast  guilty passion cried theodore can guilt dwell with innocent beauty and virtuous modesty it is sinful replied the friar to cherish those whom heaven has doomed to destruction a tyrants race must be swept from the earth to the third and fourth generation will heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the guilty said theodore the fair matilda has virtues enough  to undo thee interrupted jerome have thou so soon forgotten that twice the savage manfred has pronounced thy sentence nor have i forgotten sir said theodore that the charity of his daughter delivered me from his power i can forget injuries but never benefits the injuries thou have received from manfreds race said the friar are beyond what thou can conceive  reply not but view this holy image beneath this marble monument rest the ashes of the good alfonso a prince adorned with every virtue the father of his people the delight of mankind kneel head strong boy and list while a father unfolds a state of horror that will expel every sentiment from thy soul but sensations of sacred vengeance  alfonso much injured prince let thy unsatisfied shade sit awful on the troubled air while these trembling lips  ha who comes there  the most wretched of women said hippolita entering the choir good father art thou at leisure  but why this kneeling youth what means the horror imprinted on each countenance why at this venerable tomb  alas have thou seen aught we were pouring forth our orisons to heaven replied the friar with some confusion to put an end to the woes of this deplorable province join with us lady thy spotless soul may obtain an exemption from the judgments which the portents of these days but too speakingly denounced against thy house i pray fervently to heaven to divert them said the pious princess thou know it has been the occupation of my life to wrest a blessing for my lord and my harmless children  one alas is taken from me would heaven but hear me for my poor matilda father intercede for her  every heart will bless her cried theodore with rapture  be dumb rash youth said jerome and thou fond princess contend not with the powers above the lord gives and the lord takes away bless his holy name and submit to his decrees i do most devoutly said hippolita but will he not spare my only comfort must matilda perish too  ah father i came  but dismiss thy son no ear but thine must hear what i have to utter may heaven grant thy every wish most excellent princess said theodore retiring jerome frowned  hippolita then acquainted the friar with the proposal she had suggested to manfred his approbation of it and the tender of matilda that he was gone to make to frederic jerome could not conceal his dislike of the motion which he covered under pretense of the improbability that frederic the nearest of blood to alfonso and who was come to claim his succession would yield to an alliance with the usurper of his right but nothing could equal the perplexity of the friar when hippolita confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation and demanded his opinion on the legality of her acquiescence  the friar catched eagerly at her request of his advice and without explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of manfred and isabella he painted to hippolita in the most alarming colors the sinfulness of her consent denounced judgments against her if she complied and enjoined her in the severest terms to treat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal  manfred in the mean time had broken his purpose to frederic and proposed the double marriage that weak prince who had been struck with the charms of matilda listened but too eagerly to the offer he forgot his enmity to manfred whom he saw but little hope of dispossessing by force and flattering himself that no issue might succeed from the union of his daughter with the tyrant he looked upon his own succession to the principality as facilitated by wedding matilda he made faint opposition to the proposal affecting for form only not to acquiesce unless hippolita should consent to the divorce manfred took that upon himself transported with his success and impatient to see himself in a situation to expect sons he hastened to his wifes apartment determined to extort her compliance he learned with indignation that she was absent at the convent his guilt suggested to him that she had probably been informed by isabella of his purpose he doubted whether her retirement to the convent did not import an intention of remaining there until she could raise obstacles to their divorce and the suspicions he had already entertained of jerome made him apprehend that the friar would not only traverse his views but might have inspired hippolita with the resolution of taking sanctuary impatient to unravel this clue and to defeat its success manfred hastened to the convent and arrived there as the friar was earnestly exhorting the princess never to yield to the divorce  madam said manfred what business drew you hither why did you not await my return from the marquis i came to implore a blessing on your councils replied hippolita my councils do not need a friars intervention said manfred  and of all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom you delight to confer with profane prince said jerome is it at the altar that thou chusest to insult the servants of the altar  but manfred thy impious schemes are known heaven and this virtuous lady know them  nay frown not prince the church despises thy menaces her thunders will be heard above thy wrath dare to proceed in thy cursed purpose of a divorce until her sentence be known and here i lance her anathema at thy head audacious rebel said manfred endeavoring to conceal the awe with which the friars words inspired him do thou presume to threaten the lawful prince thou art no lawful prince said jerome thou art no prince  go discuss thy claim with frederic and when that is done  it is done replied manfred frederic accepts matildas hand and is content to wave his claim unless i have no male issue  as he spoke those words three drops of blood fell from the nose of alfonsos statue manfred turned pale and the princess sunk on her knees behold said the friar mark this miraculous indication that the blood of alfonso will never mix with that of manfred my gracious lord said hippolita let us submit ourselves to heaven think not thy ever obedient wife rebels against thy authority i have no will but that of my lord and the church to that reverend tribunal let us apply it does not depend on us to burst the bonds that unite us if the church shall approve the dissolution of our marrage be it so  i have but few years and those of sorrow to pass where can they be worn away so well as at the foot of this altar in prayers for thine and matildas safety  but thou shall not remain here until then said manfred repair with me to the castle and there i will advise on the proper measures for a divorce  but this meddling friar comes not thither my hospitable roof shall never more harbor a traitor  and for thy reverences offspring continued he i banish him from my dominions he i ween is no sacred personage nor under the protection of the church whoever weds isabella it shall not be father falconaras startedup son they start up said the friar who are suddenly beheld in the seat of lawful princes but they wither away like the grass and their place knows them no more manfred casting a look of scorn at the friar led hippolita forth but at the door of the church whispered one of his attendants to remain concealed about the convent and bring him instant notice if any one from the castle should repair thither  chap v every reflection which manfred made on the friars behavior conspired to persuade him that jerome was privy to an amor between isabella and theodore but jeromes new presumption so dissonant from his former meekness suggested still deeper apprehensions the prince even suspected that the friar depended on some secret support from frederic whose arrival coinciding with the novel appearance of theodore seemed to bespeak a correspondence still more was he troubled with the resemblance of theodore to alfonsos portrait the latter he knew had unquestionably died without issue frederic had consented to bestow isabella on him these contradictions agitated his mind with numberless pangs he saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties the one was to resign his dominions to the marquis  pride ambition and his reliance on ancient prophecies which had pointed out a possibility of his preserving them to his posterity combated that thought the other was to press his marriage with isabella after long ruminating on these anxious thoughts as he marched silently with hippolita to the castle he at last discoursed with that princess on the subject of his disquiet and used every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to even her promise of promoting the divorce hippolita needed little persuasion to bend her to his pleasure she endeavored to win him over to the measure of resigning his dominions but finding her exhortations fruitless she assured him that as far as her conscience would allow she would raise no opposition to a separation though without better founded scruples than what he yet alleged she would not engage to be active in demanding it  this compliance though inadequate was sufficient to raise manfreds hopes he trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his suit at the court of rome whither he resolved to engage frederic to take a journey on purpose that prince had discovered so much passion for matilda that manfred hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out or withdrawing his daughters charms according as the marquis should appear more or less disposed to cooperate in his views even the absence of frederic would be a material point gained until he could take farther measures for his security  dismissing hippolita to her apartment he repaired to that of the marquis but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he met bianca that damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the young ladies it immediately occured to him to sift her on the subject of isabella and theodore calling her aside into the recess of the oriel window of the hall and soothing her with many fair words and promises he demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state of isabellas affections i my lord no my lord  yes my lord  poor lady she is wonderfully alarmed about her fathers wounds but i tell her he will do well dont your highness think so i do not ask you replied manfred what she thinks about her father but you are in her secrets come be a good girl and tell me is there any young man  ha  you understand me  lord bless me understand your highness no not i i told her a few vulnerary herbs and repose  i am not talking replied the prince impatiently about her father i know he will do well  bless me i rejoice to hear your highness say so for though i thought it not right to let my young lady despond methought his greatness had a wan look and a something  i remember when young ferdinand was wounded by the venetian  thou answerest from the point interrupted manfred but here take this jewel perhaps that may fix thy attention  nay no reverences my favor shall not stop here  come tell me truly how stands isabellas heart well your highness has such a way said bianca  to be sure  but can your highness keep a secret if it should ever come out of your lips  it shall not it shall not cried manfred  nay but swear your highness  by my halidame if it should ever be known that i said it  why truth is truth i do not think my lady isabella ever much affectioned my young lord your son  yet he was a sweet youth as one should see  i am sure if i had been a princess  but bless me i must attend my lady matilda she will marvel what is become of me  stay cried manfred thou have not satisfied my question have thou ever carried any message any letter  i good gracious cried bianca i carry a letter  i would not to be a queen i hope your highness thinks though i am poor i am honest  did your highness never hear what count marsigli offered me when he came a wooing to my lady matilda i have not leisure said manfred to listen to thy tales i do not question thy honesty but it is thy duty to conceal nothing from me how long has isabella been acquainted with theodore nay there is nothing can escape your highness said bianca  not that i know any thing of the matter  theodore to be sure is a proper young man and as my lady matilda says the very image of good alfonso has not your highness remarked it yes yes  no  thou torturest me said manfred where did they meet when  who my lady matilda said bianca no no not matilda isabella when did isabella first become acquainted with this theodore virgin mary said bianca how should i know thou do know said manfred and i must know i will  lord your highness is not jealous of young theodore said bianca  jealous no no why should i be jealous  perhaps i mean to unite them  if i were sure isabella would have no repugnance  repugnance no i will warrant her said bianca he is as comely a youth as ever trod on christian ground we are all in love with him there is not a soul in the castle but would be rejoiced to have him for our prince  i mean when it shall please heaven to call your highness to itself  indeed said manfred has it gone so far oh this cursed friar  but i must not lose time  go bianca attend isabella but i charge thee not a word of what has passed find out how she is affected toward theodore bring me good news and that ring has a companion wait at the foot of the winding staircase i am going to visit the marquis and will talk farther with thee at my return  manfred after some general conversation desired frederic to dismiss the two knights his companions having to talk with him on urgent affairs as soon as they were alone he began in artful guise to sound the marquis on the subject of matilda and finding him disposed to his wish he let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration of their marriage unless  at that instant bianca burst into the room with a wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror oh my lord my lord cried she we are all undone it is come again it is come again what is come again cried manfred amazed  oh the hand the giant the hand  support me i am terrified out of my senses cried bianca i will not sleep in the castle tonight where shall i go my things may come after me tomorrow  would i had been content to wed francisco this comes of ambition what has terrified thee thus young woman said the marquis thou art safe here be not alarmed oh your greatness is wonderful good said bianca but i dare not  no pray let me go  i had rather leave every thing behind me than stay another hour under this roof go to thou have lost thy senses said manfred interrupt us not we were communing on important matters  my lord this wench is subject to fits  come with me bianca  oh the saints no said bianca  for certain it comes to warn your highness why should it appear to me else i say my hours morning and evening  oh if your highness had believed diego it is the same hand that he saw the foot to in the gallerychamber  father jerome has often told us the prophesy would be out one of these days  bianca said he mark my words  thou ravest said manfred in a rage be gone and keep these fooleries to frighten thy companions  what my lord cried bianca do you think i have seen nothing go to the foot of the great stairs yourself  as i live i saw it saw what tell us fair maid what thou have seen said frederic can your highness listen said manfred to the delirium of a silly wench who has heard stories of apparitions until she believes them this is more than fancy said the marquis her terror is too natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination tell us fair maiden what it is has moved thee thus yes my lord thank your greatness said bianca  i believe i look very pale i shall be better when i have recovered myself  i was going to my lady isabellas chamber by his highnesss order  we do want the circumstances interrupted manfred since his highness will have it so proceed but be brief lord your highness thwarts one so replied bianca  i fear my hair  i am sure i never in my life  well as i was telling your greatness i was going by his highnesss order to my lady isabellas chamber she lies in the watchetcoloured chamber on the right hand one pair of stairs so when i came to the great stairs  i was looking on his highnesss present here  grant me patience said manfred will this wench never come to the point what imports it to the marquis that i gave thee a bawble for thy faithful attendance on my daughter we want to know what thou saw i was going to tell your highness said bianca if you would permit me  so as i was rubbing the ring  i am sure i had not gone up three steps but i heard the rattling of armor for all the world such a clatter as diego says he heard when the giant turned him about in the gallerychamber  what does she mean my lord said the marquis is your castle haunted by giants and goblins lord what has not your greatness heard the story of the giant in the gallerychamber cried bianca i marvel his highness has not told you  may hap you do not know there is a prophecy  this trifling is intolerable interrupted manfred let us dismiss this silly wench my lord we have more important affairs to discuss by your favor said frederic these are no trifles the enormous sabre i was directed to in the wood yon casque its fellow  are these visions of this poor maidens brain  so jaquez thinks may it please your greatness said bianca he says this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange revolution for my part i should not be surprised if it was to happen tomorrow for as i was saying when i heard the clattering of armor i was all in a cold sweat  i looked up and if your greatness will believe me i saw upon the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armor as big as big  i thought i should have swooned  i never stopped until i came hither  would i were well out of this castle my lady matilda told me but yestermorning that her highness hippolita knows something  thou art an insolent cried manfred  lord marquis it much misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront me are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to my honor pursue your claim by manly daring or let us bury our feuds as was proposed by the intermarriage of our children but trust me it ill becomes a prince of your bearing to practice on mercenary wenches  i scorn your imputation said frederic until this hour i never set eyes on this damsel i have given her no jewel  my lord my lord your conscience your guilt accuses you and would throw the suspicion on me  but keep your daughter and think no more of isabella the judgments already fallen on your house forbid my matching into it  manfred alarmed at the resolute tone in which frederic delivered these words endeavored to pacify him dismissing bianca he made such submissions to the marquis and threw in such artful encomiums on matilda that frederic was once more staggered however as his passion was of so recent a date it could not at once surmount the scruples he had conceived he had gathered enough from biancas discourse to persuade him that heaven declared itself against manfred the proposed marriages too removed his claim to a distance and the principality of otranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of it with matilda still he would not adsolutely recede from his engagements but purposing to gain time he demanded of manfred if it was true in fact that hippolita consented to the divorce the prince transported to find no other obstacle and depending on his influence over his wife assured the marquis it was so and that he might satisfy himself of the truth from her own mouth  as they were thus discoursing word was brought that the banquet was prepared manfred conducted frederic to the great hall where they were received by hippolita and the young princesses manfred placed the marquis next to matilda and seated himself between his wife and isabella hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity but the young ladies were silent and melancholy manfred who was determined to pursue his point with the marquis in the remainder of the evening pushed on the feast until it waxed late affecting unrestrained gaiety and plying frederic with repeated goblets of wine the latter more upon his guard than manfred wished declined his frequent challenges on pretense of his late loss of blood while the prince to raise his own disordered spirits and to counterfeit unconcern indulged himself in plentiful draughts though not to the intoxication of his senses  the evening being far advanced the banquet concluded manfred would have withdrawn with frederic but the latter pleading weakness and want of repose retired to his chamber galantly telling the prince that his daughter should amuse his highness until himself could attend him manfred accepted the party and to the no small grief of isabella accompanied her to her apartment matilda waited on her mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle  soon as the company were dispersed their several ways frederic quitting his chamber enquired if hippolita was alone and was told by one of her attendants who had not noticed her going forth that at that hour she generally withdrew to her oratory where he probably would find her the marquis during the repast had beheld matilda with increase of passion he now wished to find hippolita in the disposition her lord had promised the portents that had alarmed him were forgotten in his desires stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of hippolita he entered it with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce having perceived that manfred was resolved to make the possession of isabella an unalterable condition before he would grant matilda to his wishes  the marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the princesss apartment concluding her as he had been advertized in her oratory he passed on the door was ajar the evening gloomy and overcast pushing open the door gently he saw a person kneeling before the alter as he approached nearer it seemed not a woman but one in a long woollen weed whose back was toward him the person seemed absorbed in prayer the marquis was about to return when the figure rising stood some moments fixed in meditation without regarding him the marquis expecting the holy person to come forth and meaning to excuse his uncivil interruption said reverend father i sought the lady hippolita  hippolita replied a hollow voice came thou to this castle to seek hippolita  and then the figure turning slowly round discovered to frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton wrapped in a hermits cowl angels of grace protect me cried frederic recoiling deserve their protection said the spectre frederic falling on his knees adjured the phantom to take pity on him do thou not remember me said the apparition remember the wood of joppa art thou that holy hermit cried frederic trembling  can i do aught for thy eternal peace  wast thou delivered from bondage said the spectre to pursue carnal delights have thou forgotten the buried sabre and the behest of heaven engraven on it  i have not i have not said frederic  but say blessed spirit what is thy errand to me what remains to be done to forget matilda said the apparition  and vanished  frederics blood froze in his veins for some minutes he remained motionless then falling prostrate on his face before the alter he besought the intercession of every saint for pardon a flood of tears succeeded to this transport and the image of the beauteous matilda rushing in spite of him on his thoughts he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and passion ere he could recover from this agony of his spirits the princess hippolita with a taper in her hand entered the oratory alone seeing a man without motion on the floor she gave a shriek concluding him dead her fright brought frederic to himself rising suddenly his face bedewed with tears he would have rushed from her presence but hippolita stopping him conjured him in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder and by what strange chance she had found him there in that posture ah virtuous princess said the marquis penetrated with grief  and stopped for the love of heaven my lord said hippolita disclose the cause of this transport what mean these doleful sounds this alarming exclamation on my name what woes has heaven still in store for the wretched hippolita  yet silent  by every pitying angel i adjure thee noble prince continued she falling at his feet to disclose the purport of what lies at thy heart  i see thou feel for me thou feel the sharp pangs that thou inflictest  speak for pity  does aught thou know concern my child  i cannot speak cried frederic bursting from her  oh matilda  quitting the princess thus abruptly he hastened to his own apartment at the door of it he was accosted by manfred who flushed by wine and love had come to seek him and to propose to waste some hours of the night in music and revelling frederic offended at an invitation so dissonant from the mood of his soul pushed him rudely aside and entering his chamber flung the door intemperately against manfred and bolted it inwards the haughty prince enraged at this unaccountable behavior withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal excesses as he crossed the court he was met by the domestic whom he had planted at the convent as a spy on jerome and theodore this man almost breathless with the haste he had made informed his lord that theodore and some lady from the castle were at that instant in private conference at the tomb of alfonso in st nicholass church he had dogged theodore thither but the gloominess of the night had prevented his discovering who the woman was  manfred whose spirits were inflamed and whom isabella had driven from her on his urging his passion with too little reserve did not doubt but the inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience to meet theodore provoked by this conjecture and enraged at her father he hastened secretly to the great church gliding softly between the ailes and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly through the illuminated windows he stole toward the tomb of alfonso of the persons he sought the first sounds to which he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought the first sounds he could distinguish were  does it alas depend on me manfred will never permit our union  no this shall prevent it cried the tyrant drawing his dagger and plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke  ah me i am slain cried matilda sinking good heaven receive my soul savage inhuman monster what have thou done cried theodore rushing on him and wrenching his dagger from him  stop stop thy impious hand cried matilda it is my father manfred waking as from a trance beat his breast twisted his hands in his locks and endeavored to recover his dagger from theodore to dispatch himself theodore scarce less distracted and only mastering the transports of his grief to asist matilda had now by his cries drawn some of the monks to his aid while part of them endeavored in concert with the afflicted theodore to stop the blood of the dying princess the rest prevented manfred from laying violent hands on himself  matilda resigning herself patiently to her fate acknowledged with looks of grateful love the zeal of theodore yet often as her faintness would permit her speech its way she begged the assistants to comfort her father jerome by this time had learnt the fatal news and reached the church his looks seemed to reproach theodore but turning to manfred he said now tyrant behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and devoted head the blood of alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance and heaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination that thou might shed thy own blood at the foot of that princes sepulcher  cruel man cried matilda to aggravate the woes of a parent may heaven bless my father and forgive him as i do my lord my gracious sire do thou forgive thy child indeed i came not hither to meet theodore i found him praying at this tomb whither my mother sent me to intercede for thee for her  dearest father bless your child and say you forgive her  forgive thee murderous monster cried manfred  can assassins forgive i took thee for isabella but heaven directed my bloody hand to the heart of my child  oh matilda  i cannot utter it  can thou forgive the blindness of my rage i can i do and may heaven confirm it said matilda  but while i have life to ask it  oh my mother what will she feel will you comfort her my lord will you not put her away indeed she loves you  oh i am faint bear me to the castle  can i live to have her close my eyes  theodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be born into the convent but her instances were so pressing to be carried to the castle that placing her on a litter they conveyed her thither as she requested theodore supporting her head with his arm and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love still endeavored to inspire her with hopes of life jerome on the other side comforted her with discourses of heaven and holding a crucifix before her which she bathed with inocent tears prepared her for her passage to immortality manfred plunged in the deepest afflion followed the litter in despair  ere they reached the castle hippolita informed of the dreadful catastrophe had flown to meet her murdered child but when she saw the afflicted procession the mightiness of her grief deprived her of her senses and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon isabella and frederic who attended her were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow matilda alone seemed insensible to her own situation every thought was lost in tenderness for her mother ordering the litter to stop as soon as hippolita was brought to herself she asked for her father he approached unable to speak matilda seizing his hand and her mothers locked them in her own and then clasped them to her heart manfred could not support this act of pathetic piety he dashed himself on the ground and cursed the day he was born isabella apprehensive that these struggles of passion were more than matilda could support took upon herself to order manfred to be borne to his apartment while she caused matilda to be conveyed to the nearest chamber hippolita scarce more alive than her daughter was regardless of every thing but her but when the tender isabellas care would have likewise removed her while the surgeons examined matildas wound she cried remove me never never i lived but in her and will expire with her matilda raised her eyes at her mothers voice but closed them again without speaking her sinking pulse and the damp coldness of her hand soon dispelled all hopes of recovery theodore followed the surgeons into the outer chamber and heard them pronounce the fatal sentence with a transport equal to frenzy  since she cannot live mine cried he at least she shall be mine in death  father jerome will you not join our hands cried he to the friar who with the marquis had accompanied the surgeons what means thy distracted rashness said jerome is this an hour for marriage it is it is cried theodore alas there is no other young man thou art too unadvised said frederic do thou think we are to listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate what pretensions have thou to the princess those of a prince said theodore of the sovereign of otranto this reverend man my father has informed me who i am thou ravest said the marquis there is no prince of otranto but myself now manfred by murder by sacrilegious murder has forfeited all pretensions my lord said jerome assuming an air of command he tells you true it was not my purpose the secret should have been divulged so soon but fate presses onward to its work what his hot headed passion has revealed my tongue confirms know prince that when alfonso set sail for the holy land  is this a season for explanations cried theodore father come and unite me to the princess she shall be mine  in every other thing i will dutifully obey you my life my adored matilda continued theodore rushing back into the inner chamber will you not be mine will you not bless your  isabella made signs to him to be silent apprehending the princess was near her end what is she dead cried theodore is it possible the violence of his exclamations brought matilda to herself lifting up her eyes she looked round for her mother  life of my soul i am here cried hippolita think not i will quit thee oh you are too good said matilda  but weep not for me my mother i am going where sorrow never dwells  isabella thou have loved me wot thou not supply my fondness to this dear dear woman  indeed i am faint oh my child my child said hippolita in a flood of tears can i not withhold thee a moment  it will not be said matilda  commend me to heaven  where is my father forgive him dearest mother  forgive him my death it was an error  oh i had forgotten  dearest mother i vowed never to see theodore more  perhaps that has drawn down this calamity  but it was not intentional  can you pardon me  oh wound not my agonizing soul said hippolita thou never could offend me  alas she faints help help  i would say something more said matilda struggling but it wonnot be  isabella  theodore  for my sake  oh  she expired isabella and her women tore hippolita from the corse but theodore threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it he printed a thousand kisses on her claycold hands and uttered every expression that despairing love could dictate  isabella in the mean time was accompanying the afflicted hippolita to her apartment but in the middle of the court they were met by manfred who distracted with his own thoughts and anxious once more to behold his daughter was advancing to the chamber where she lay as the moon was now at its height he read in the countenance of this unhappy company the event he dreaded what is she dead cried he in wild confusion  a clap of thunder at that instant shook the castle to its foundations the earth rocked and the clank of more than mortal armor was heard behind frederic and jerome thought the last day was at hand the latter forcing theodore along with them rushed into the court the moment theodore appeared the walls of the castle behind manfred were thrown down with a mighty force and the form of alfonso dilated to an immense magnitude appeared in the center of the ruins behold in theodore the true heir of alfonso said the vision and having pronounced those words accompanied by a clap of thunder it ascended solemnly toward heaven where the clouds parting asunder the form of st nicholas was seen and receiving alfonsos shade they were soon wrapped from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory  the beholders fell prostrate on their faces acknowledging the divine will the first that broke silence was hippolita my lord said she to the desponding manfred behold the vanity of human greatness conrad is gone matilda is no more in theodore we view the true prince of otranto by what miracle he is so i know not  suffice it to us our doom is pronounced shall we not can we but dedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live in deprecating the farther wrath of heaven heaven ejects us  whither can we fly but to you holy cells that yet offer us a retreat  thou guiltless but unhappy woman unhappy by my crimes replied manfred my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions oh could  but it cannot be  ye are lost in wonder  let me at last do justice on myself to heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction i have left to offer to offended heaven my story has drawn down these judgments let my confession atone  but ah what can atone for usurpation and a murdered child a child murdered in a consecrated place  list sirs and may this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants  alfonso ye all know died in the holy land  ye would interrupt me ye would say he came not fairly to his end  it is most true  why else this bitter cup which manfred must drink to the dregs ricardo my grandfather was his chamberlain  i would draw a veil over my ancestors crimes  but it is in vain alfonso died by poison a fictitious will declared ricardo his heir his crimes pursued him  yet he lost no conrad no matilda i pay the price of usurpation for all a storm overtook him haunted by his guilt he vowed to st nicholas to found a church and two convents if he lived to reach otranto the sacrifice was accepted the saint appeared to him in a dream and promised that ricardos posterity should reign in otranto until the rightful owner should be grown too large to inhabit the castle and as long as issuemale from ricardos loins should remain to enjoy it  alas alas nor male nor female except myself remains of all his wretched race  i have done  the woes of these three days speak the rest how this young man can be alfonsos heir i know not  yet i do not doubt it his are these dominions i resign them  yet i knew not alfonso had an heir  i question not the will of heaven  poverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space until manfred shall be summoned to ricardo  what remains is my part to declare said jerome when alfonso set sail for the holy land he was driven by a storm to the coast of sicily the other vessel which bore ricardo and his train as your lordship must have heard was separated from him it is most true said manfred and the title you give me is more than an outcast can claim  well be it so  proceed jerome blushed and continued for three months lord alfonso was windbound in sicily there he became enamoured of a fair virgin named victoria he was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures they were married yet deeming this amor incongruous with the holy vow of arms by which he was bound he determined to conceal their nuptials until his return from the crusado when he purposed to seek and acknowledge her for his lawful wife he left her pregnant during his absence she was delivered of a daughter but scarce had she felt a mothers pangs ere she heard the fatal rumor of her lords death and the succession of ricardo what could a friendless helpless woman do would her testimony avail  yet my lord i have an authentic writing  it needs not said manfred the horrors of these days the vision we have but now seen all corroborate thy evidence beyond a thousand parchments matildas death and my expulsion  be composed my lord said hippolita this holy man did not mean to recall your griefs jerome proceeded  i shall not dwell on what is needless the daughter of which victoria was delivered was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on me victoria died and the secret remained locked in my breast theodores narrative has told the rest  the friar ceased the disconsolate company retired to the remaining part of the castle in the morning manfred signed his abdication of the principality with the approbation of hippolita and each took on them the habit of religion in the neighboring convents frederic offered his daughter to the new prince which hippolitas tenderness for isabella concurred to promote but theodores grief was too fresh to admit the thought of another love and it was not until after frequent discourses with isabella of his dear matilda that he was persuaded he could know no happiness but in the society of one with whom he could for ever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession of his soul  finis
