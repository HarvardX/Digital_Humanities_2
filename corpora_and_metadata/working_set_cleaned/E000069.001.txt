the social contract or principles of political right fœderis æquas dicamus leges vergil æneid xi     foreword this little treatise is part of a longer work which i began years ago without realising my limitations and long since abandoned of the various fragments that might have been extracted from what i wrote this is the most considerable and i think the least unworthy of being offered to the public the rest no longer exists     book i i mean to inquire if in the civil order there can be any sure and legitimate rule of administration men being taken as they are and laws as they might be in this inquiry i shall endeavour always to unite what right sanctions with what is prescribed by interest in order that justice and utility may in no case be divided i enter upon my task without proving the importance of the subject i shall be asked if i am a prince or a legislator to write on politics i answer that i am neither and that is why i do so if i were a prince or a legislator i should not waste time in saying what wants doing i should do it or hold my peace as i was born a citizen of a free state and a member of the sovereign i feel that however feeble the influence my voice can have on public affairs the right of voting on them makes it my duty to study them and i am happy when i reflect upon governments to find my inquiries always furnish me with new reasons for loving that of my own country chapter i subject of the first book man is born free and everywhere he is in chains one thinks himself the master of others and still remains a greater slave than they how did this change come about i do not know what can make it legitimate that question i think i can answer if i took into account only force and the effects derived from it i should say as long as a people is compelled to obey and obeys it does well as soon as it can shake off the yoke and shakes it off it does still better for   regaining its liberty by the same right as took it away either it is justified in resuming it or there was no justification for those who took it away but the social order is a sacred right which is the basis of all other rights nevertheless this right does not come from nature and must therefore be founded on conventions before coming to that i have to prove what i have just asserted chapter ii the first societies the most ancient of all societies and the only one that is natural is the family and even so the children remain attached to the father only so long as they need him for their preservation as soon as this need ceases the natural bond is dissolved the children released from the obedience they owed to the father and the father released from the care he owed his children return equally to independence if they remain united they continue so no longer naturally but voluntarily and the family itself is then maintained only by convention this common liberty results from the nature of man his first law is to provide for his own preservation his first cares are those which he owes to himself and as soon as he reaches years of discretion he is the sole judge of the proper means of preserving himself and consequently becomes his own master the family then may be called the first model of political societies the ruler corresponds to the father and the people to the children and all being born free and equal alienate their liberty only for their own advantage the whole difference is that in the family the love of the father for his children repays him for the care he takes of them while in the state the pleasure of commanding takes the place of the love which the chief cannot have for the peoples under him grotius denies that all human power is established in favour of the governed and quotes slavery as an example his usual method of reasoning is constantly to establish   right by fact  it would be possible to employ a more logical method but none could be more favourable to tyrants it is then according to grotius doubtful whether the human race belongs to a hundred men or that hundred men to the human race and throughout his book he seems to incline to the former alternative which is also the view of hobbes on this showing the human species is divided into so many herds of cattle each with its ruler who keeps guard over them for the purpose of devouring them as a shepherd is of a nature superior to that of his flock the shepherds of men i e their rulers are of a nature superior to that of the peoples under them thus philo tells us the emperor caligula reasoned concluding equally well either that kings were gods or that men were beasts the reasoning of caligula agrees with that of hobbes and grotius aristotle before any of them had said that men are by no means equal naturally but that some are born for slavery and others for dominion aristotle was right but he took the effect for the cause nothing can be more certain than that every man born in slavery is born for slavery slaves lose everything in their chains even the desire of escaping from them they love their servitude as the comrades of ulysses loved their brutish condition  if then there are slaves by nature it is because there have been slaves against nature force made the first slaves and their cowardice perpetuated the condition i have said nothing of king adam or emperor noah father of the three great monarchs who shared out the universe like the children of saturn whom some scholars have recognised in them i trust to getting due thanks for my moderation for being a direct descendant of one of these princes perhaps of the eldest branch how do i know that a verification of titles might not leave me the   legitimate king of the human race in any case there can be no doubt that adam was sovereign of the world as robinson crusoe was of his island as long as he was its only inhabitant and this empire had the advantage that the monarch safe on his throne had no rebellions wars or conspirators to fear chapter iii the right of the strongest the strongest is never strong enough to be always the master unless he transforms strength into right and obedience into duty hence the right of the strongest which though to all seeming meant ironically is really laid down as a fundamental principle but are we never to have an explanation of this phrase force is a physical power and i fail to see what moral effect it can have to yield to force is an act of necessity not of will—at the most an act of prudence in what sense can it be a duty suppose for a moment that this socalled right exists i maintain that the sole result is a mass of inexplicable nonsense for if force creates right the effect changes with the cause every force that is greater than the first succeeds to its right as soon as it is possible to disobey with impunity disobedience is legitimate and the strongest being always in the right the only thing that matters is to act so as to become the strongest but what kind of right is that which perishes when force fails if we must obey perforce there is no need to obey because we ought and if we are not forced to obey we are under no obligation to do so clearly the word right adds nothing to force in this connection it means absolutely nothing obey the powers that be if this means yield to force it is a good precept but superfluous i can answer for its never being violated all power comes from god i admit but so does all sickness does that mean that we are forbidden to call in the doctor a brigand surprises   me at the edge of a wood must i not merely surrender my purse on compulsion but even if i could withhold it am i in conscience bound to give it up for certainly the pistol he holds is also a power let us then admit that force does not create right and that we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers in that case my original question recurs chapter iv slavery since no man has a natural authority over his fellow and force creates no right we must conclude that conventions form the basis of all legitimate authority among men if an individual says grotius can alienate his liberty and make himself the slave of a master why could not a whole people do the same and make itself subject to a king there are in this passage plenty of ambiguous words which would need explaining but let us confine ourselves to the word alienate to alienate is to give or to sell now a man who becomes the slave of another does not give himself he sells himself at the least for his subsistence but for what does a people sell itself a king is so far from furnishing his subjects with their subsistence that he gets his own only from them and according to rabelais kings do not live on nothing do subjects then give their persons on condition that the king takes their goods also i fail to see what they have left to preserve it will be said that the despot assures his subjects civil tranquillity granted but what do they gain if the wars his ambition brings down upon them his insatiable avidity and the vexatious conduct of his ministers press harder on them than their own dissensions would have done what do they gain if the very tranquillity they enjoy is one of their miseries tranquillity is found also in dungeons but is that enough to make them desirable places to live in the greeks imprisoned in the cave of the cyclops  0 lived there very tranquilly while they were awaiting their turn to be devoured to say that a man gives himself gratuitously is to say what is absurd and inconceivable such an act is null and illegitimate from the mere fact that he who does it is out of his mind to say the same of a whole people is to suppose a people of madmen and madness creates no right even if each man could alienate himself he could not alienate his children they are born men and free their liberty belongs to them and no one but they has the right to dispose of it before they come to years of discretion the father can in their name lay down conditions for their preservation and wellbeing but he cannot give them irrevocably and without conditions such a gift is contrary to the ends of nature and exceeds the rights of paternity it would therefore be necessary in order to legitimise an arbitrary government that in every generation the people should be in a position to accept or reject it but were this so the government would be no longer arbitrary to renounce liberty is to renounce being a man to surrender the rights of humanity and even its duties for him who renounces everything no indemnity is possible such a renunciation is incompatible with mans nature to remove all liberty from his will is to remove all morality from his acts finally it is an empty and contradictory convention that sets up on the one side absolute authority and on the other unlimited obedience is it not clear that we can be under no obligation to a person from whom we have the right to exact everything does not this condition alone in the absence of equivalence or exchange in itself involve the nullity of the act for what right can my slave have against me when all that he has belongs to me and his right being mine this right of mine against myself is a phrase devoid of meaning grotius and the rest find in war another origin for the socalled right of slavery the victor having as they hold the right of killing the vanquished the latter can buy back his life at the price of his liberty and this convention is the more legitimate because it is to the advantage of both parties    but it is clear that this supposed right to kill the conquered is by no means deducible from the state of war men from the mere fact that while they are living in their primitive independence they have no mutual relations stable enough to constitute either the state of peace or the state of war cannot be naturally enemies war is constituted by a relation between things and not between persons and as the state of war cannot arise out of simple personal relations but only out of real relations private war or war of man with man can exist neither in the state of nature where there is no constant property nor in the social state where everything is under the authority of the laws individual combats duels and encounters are acts which cannot constitute a state while the private wars authorised by the establishments of louis ix king of france and suspended by the peace of god are abuses of feudalism in itself an absurd system if ever there was one and contrary to the principles of natural right and to all good polity war then is a relation not between man and man but between state and state and individuals are enemies only accidentally not as men nor even as citizens  but as soldiers not as members of their country but as its defenders finally each state can have for enemies only other states and not men for between things disparate in nature there can be no real relation furthermore this principle is in conformity with the established rules of all times and the constant practice of all civilised peoples declarations of war are intimations    less to powers than to their subjects the foreigner whether king individual or people who robs kills or detains the subjects without declaring war on the prince is not an enemy but a brigand even in real war a just prince while laying hands in the enemys country on all that belongs to the public respects the lives and goods of individuals he respects rights on which his own are founded the object of the war being the destruction of the hostile state the other side has a right to kill its defenders while they are bearing arms but as soon as they lay them down and surrender they cease to be enemies or instruments of the enemy and become once more merely men whose life no one has any right to take sometimes it is possible to kill the state without killing a single one of its members and war gives no right which is not necessary to the gaining of its object these principles are not those of grotius they are not based on the authority of poets but derived from the nature of reality and based on reason the right of conquest has no foundation other than the right of the strongest if war does not give the conqueror the right to massacre the conquered peoples the right to enslave them cannot be based upon a right which does not exist no one has a right to kill an enemy except when he cannot make him a slave and the right to enslave him cannot therefore be derived from the right to kill him it is accordingly an unfair exchange to make him buy at the price of his liberty his life over which the victor holds no right is it not clear that there is a vicious circle in founding the right of life and death on the right of slavery and the right of slavery on the right of life and death even if we assume this terrible right to kill everybody i maintain that a slave made in war or a conquered people is under no obligation to a master except to obey him as far as he is compelled to do so by taking an equivalent for his life the victor has not done him a favour instead of killing him without profit he has killed him usefully so far then is he from acquiring over him any authority in addition to that of force that the state of war continues to subsist between them their mutual relation is the effect of it and the usage of the right of    war does not imply a treaty of peace a convention has indeed been made but this convention so far from destroying the state of war presupposes its continuance so from whatever aspect we regard the question the right of slavery is null and void not only as being illegitimate but also because it is absurd and meaningless the words slave and right contradict each other and are mutually exclusive it will always be equally foolish for a man to say to a man or to a people i make with you a convention wholly at your expense and wholly to my advantage i shall keep it as long as i like and you will keep it as long as i like chapter v that we must always go back to a first convention even if i granted all that i have been refuting the friends of despotism would be no better off there will always be a great difference between subduing a multitude and ruling a society even if scattered individuals were successively enslaved by one man however numerous they might be i still see no more than a master and his slaves and certainly not a people and its ruler i see what may be termed an aggregation but not an association there is as yet neither public good nor body politic the man in question even if he has enslaved half the world is still only an individual his interest apart from that of others is still a purely private interest if this same man comes to die his empire after him remains scattered and without unity as an oak falls and dissolves into a heap of ashes when the fire has consumed it a people says grotius can give itself to a king then according to grotius a people is a people before it gives itself the gift is itself a civil act and implies public deliberation it would be better before examining the act by which a people gives itself to a king to examine that by which it has become a people for this act being necessarily prior to the other is the true foundation of society indeed if there were no prior convention where unless the election were unanimous would be the obligation on    the minority to submit to the choice of the majority how have a hundred men who wish for a master the right to vote on behalf of ten who do not the law of majority voting is itself something established by convention and presupposes unanimity on one occasion at least chapter vi the social compact i suppose men to have reached the point at which the obstacles in the way of their preservation in the state of nature show their power of resistance to be greater than the resources at the disposal of each individual for his maintenance in that state that primitive condition can then subsist no longer and the human race would perish unless it changed its manner of existence but as men cannot engender new forces but only unite and direct existing ones they have no other means of preserving themselves than the formation by aggregation of a sum of forces great enough to overcome the resistance these they have to bring into play by means of a single motive power and cause to act in concert this sum of forces can arise only where several persons come together but as the force and liberty of each man are the chief instruments of his selfpreservation how can he pledge them without harming his own interests and neglecting the care he owes to himself this difficulty in its bearing on my present subject may be stated in the following terms— the problem is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate and in which each while uniting himself with all may still obey himself alone and remain as free as before this is the fundamental problem of which the social contract provides the solution the clauses of this contract are so determined by the nature of the act that the slightest modification would make them vain and ineffective so that although they have perhaps never been formally set forth they are everywhere the same and everywhere tacitly admitted and    recognised until on the violation of the social compact each regains his original rights and resumes his natural liberty while losing the conventional liberty in favour of which he renounced it these clauses properly understood may be reduced to one—the total alienation of each associate together with all his rights to the whole community for in the first place as each gives himself absolutely the conditions are the same for all and this being so no one has any interest in making them burdensome to others moreover the alienation being without reserve the union is as perfect as it can be and no associate has anything more to demand for if the individuals retained certain rights as there would be no common superior to decide between them and the public each being on one point his own judge would ask to be so on all the state of nature would thus continue and the association would necessarily become inoperative or tyrannical finally each man in giving himself to all gives himself to nobody and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same right as he yields others over himself he gains an equivalent for everything he loses and an increase of force for the preservation of what he has if then we discard from the social compact what is not of its essence we shall find that it reduces itself to the following terms— each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will and in our corporate capacity we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole at once in place of the individual personality of each contracting party this act of association creates a moral and collective body composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes and receiving from this act its unity its common identity its life and its will this public person so formed by the union of all other persons formerly took the name of city  and now takes that of    republic or body politic it is called by its members state when passive sovereign when active and power when compared with others like itself those who are associated in it take collectively the name of people and severally are called citizens as sharing in the sovereign power and subjects as being under the laws of the state but these terms are often confused and taken one for another it is enough to know how to distinguish them when they are being used with precision chapter vii the sovereign this formula shows us that the act of association comprises a mutual undertaking between the public and the individuals and that each individual in making a contract as we may say with himself is bound in a double capacity as a member of the sovereign he is bound to the individuals and as a member of the state to the sovereign but the maxim of civil right that no one is bound by undertakings made to himself does not apply in this case for there is a great difference between incurring an obligation to yourself and incurring one to a whole of which you form a part attention must further be called to the fact that public deliberation while competent to bind all the subjects to the sovereign because of the two different capacities in which each of them may be regarded cannot for the opposite reason bind the sovereign to itself and    that it is consequently against the nature of the body politic for the sovereign to impose on itself a law which it cannot infringe being able to regard itself in only one capacity it is in the position of an individual who makes a contract with himself and this makes it clear that there neither is nor can be any kind of fundamental law binding on the body of the people—not even the social contract itself this does not mean that the body politic cannot enter into undertakings with others provided the contract is not infringed by them for in relation to what is external to it it becomes a simple being an individual but the body politic or the sovereign drawing its being wholly from the sanctity of the contract can never bind itself even to an outsider to do anything derogatory to the original act for instance to alienate any part of itself or to submit to another sovereign violation of the act by which it exists would be selfannihilation and that which is itself nothing can create nothing as soon as this multitude is so united in one body it is impossible to offend against one of the members without attacking the body and still more to offend against the body without the members resenting it duty and interest therefore equally oblige the two contracting parties to give each other help and the same men should seek to combine in their double capacity all the advantages dependent upon that capacity again the sovereign being formed wholly of the individuals who compose it neither has nor can have any interest contrary to theirs and consequently the sovereign power need give no guarantee to its subjects because it is impossible for the body to wish to hurt all its members we shall also see later on that it cannot hurt any in particular the sovereign merely by virtue of what it is is always what it should be this however is not the case with the relation of the subjects to the sovereign which despite the common interest would have no security that they would fulfil their undertakings unless it found means to assure itself of their fidelity in fact each individual as a man may have a particular will contrary or dissimilar to the general will which    he has as a citizen his particular interest may speak to him quite differently from the common interest his absolute and naturally independent existence may make him look upon what he owes to the common cause as a gratuitous contribution the loss of which will do less harm to others than the payment of it is burdensome to himself and regarding the moral person which constitutes the state as a persona ficta because not a man he may wish to enjoy the rights of citizenship without being ready to fulfil the duties of a subject the continuance of such an injustice could not but prove the undoing of the body politic in order then that the social compact may not be an empty formula it tacitly includes the undertaking which alone can give force to the rest that whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled to do so by the whole body this means nothing less than that he will be forced to be free for this is the condition which by giving each citizen to his country secures him against all personal dependence in this lies the key to the working of the political machine this alone legitimises civil undertakings which without it would be absurd tyrannical and liable to the most frightful abuses chapter viii the civil state the passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very remarkable change in man by substituting justice for instinct in his conduct and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked then only when the voice of duty takes the place of physical impulses and right of appetite does man who so far had considered only himself find that he is forced to act on different principles and to consult his reason before listening to his inclinations although in this state he deprives himself of some advantages which he got from nature he gains in return others so great his faculties are so stimulated and developed his ideas so extended his feelings so ennobled and his whole soul so uplifted that did not    the abuses of this new condition often degrade him below that which he left he would be bound to bless continually the happy moment which took him from it for ever and instead of a stupid and unimaginative animal made him an intelligent being and a man let us draw up the whole account in terms easily commensurable what man loses by the social contract is his natural liberty and an unlimited right to everything he tries to get and succeeds in getting what he gains is civil liberty and the proprietorship of all he possesses if we are to avoid mistake in weighing one against the other we must clearly distinguish natural liberty which is bounded only by the strength of the individual from civil liberty which is limited by the general will and possession which is merely the effect of force or the right of the first occupier from property which can be founded only on a positive title we might over and above all this add to what man acquires in the civil state moral liberty which alone makes him truly master of himself for the mere impulse of appetite is slavery while obedience to a law which we prescribe to ourselves is liberty but i have already said too much on this head and the philosophical meaning of the word liberty does not now concern us chapter ix real property each member of the community gives himself to it at the moment of its foundation just as he is with all the resources at his command including the goods he possesses this act does not make possession in changing hands change its nature and become property in the hands of the sovereign but as the forces of the city are incomparably greater than those of an individual public possession is also in fact stronger and more irrevocable without being any more legitimate at any rate from the point of view of foreigners for the state in relation to its members is master of all their goods by the social contract which within the state is the basis of all rights  0 but in relation to other powers it is so only by the right of the first occupier which it holds from its members the right of the first occupier though more real than the right of the strongest becomes a real right only when the right of property has already been established every man has naturally a right to everything he needs but the positive act which makes him proprietor of one thing excludes him from everything else having his share he ought to keep to it and can have no further right against the community this is why the right of the first occupier which in the state of nature is so weak claims the respect of every man in civil society in this right we are respecting not so much what belongs to another as what does not belong to ourselves in general to establish the right of the first occupier over a plot of ground the following conditions are necessary first the land must not yet be inhabited secondly a man must occupy only the amount he needs for his subsistence and in the third place possession must be taken not by an empty ceremony but by labour and cultivation the only sign of proprietorship that should be respected by others in default of a legal title in granting the right of first occupancy to necessity and labour are we not really stretching it as far as it can go is it possible to leave such a right unlimited is it to be enough to set foot on a plot of common ground in order to be able to call yourself at once the master of it is it to be enough that a man has the strength to expel others for a moment in order to establish his right to prevent them from ever returning how can a man or a people seize an immense territory and keep it from the rest of the world except by a punishable usurpation since all others are being robbed by such an act of the place of habitation and the means of subsistence which nature gave them in common when nuñez balbao standing on the seashore took possession of the south seas and the whole of south america in the name of the crown of castille was that enough to dispossess all their actual inhabitants and to shut out from them all the princes of the world on such a showing these ceremonies are idly multiplied and the catholic king need only take possession all at once from his apartment of the whole    universe merely making a subsequent reservation about what was already in the possession of other princes we can imagine how the lands of individuals where they were contiguous and came to be united became the public territory and how the right of sovereignty extending from the subjects over the lands they held became at once real and personal the possessors were thus made more dependent and the forces at their command used to guarantee their fidelity the advantage of this does not seem to have been felt by ancient monarchs who called themselves king of the persians scythians or macedonians and seemed to regard themselves more as rulers of men than as masters of a country those of the present day more cleverly call themselves kings of france spain england etc thus holding the land they are quite confident of holding the inhabitants the peculiar fact about this alienation is that in taking over the goods of individuals the community so far from despoiling them only assures them legitimate possession and changes usurpation into a true right and enjoyment into proprietorship thus the possessors being regarded as depositaries of the public good and having their rights respected by all the members of the state and maintained against foreign aggression by all its forces have by a cession which benefits both the public and still more themselves acquired so to speak all that they gave up this paradox may easily be explained by the distinction between the rights which the sovereign and the proprietor have over the same estate as we shall see later on it may also happen that men begin to unite one with another before they possess anything and that subsequently occupying a tract of country which is enough for all they enjoy it in common or share it out among themselves either equally or according to a scale fixed by the sovereign however the acquisition be made the right which each individual has to his own estate is always subordinate to the right which the community has over all without this there would be neither stability in the social tie nor real force in the exercise of sovereignty i shall end this chapter and this book by remarking on a fact on which the whole social system should rest i e that instead of destroying natural inequality the fundamental    compact substitutes for such physical inequality as nature may have set up between men an equality that is moral and legitimate and that men who may be unequal in strength or intelligence become every one equal by convention and legal right  book ii chapter i that sovereignty is inalienable the first and most important deduction from the principles we have so far laid down is that the general will alone can direct the state according to the object for which it was instituted i e the common good for if the clashing of particular interests made the establishment of societies necessary the agreement of these very interests made it possible the common element in these different interests is what forms the social tie and were there no point of agreement between them all no society could exist it is solely on the basis of this common interest that every society should be governed i hold then that sovereignty being nothing less than the exercise of the general will can never be alienated and that the sovereign who is no less than a collective being cannot be represented except by himself the power indeed may be transmitted but not the will in reality if it is not impossible for a particular will to agree on some point with the general will it is at least impossible for the agreement to be lasting and constant    for the particular will tends by its very nature to partiality while the general will tends to equality it is even more impossible to have any guarantee of this agreement for even if it should always exist it would be the effect not of art but of chance the sovereign may indeed say i now will actually what this man wills or at least what he says he wills but it cannot say what he wills tomorrow i too shall will because it is absurd for the will to bind itself for the future nor is it incumbent on any will to consent to anything that is not for the good of the being who wills if then the people promises simply to obey by that very act it dissolves itself and loses what makes it a people the moment a master exists there is no longer a sovereign and from that moment the body politic has ceased to exist this does not mean that the commands of the rulers cannot pass for general wills so long as the sovereign being free to oppose them offers no opposition in such a case universal silence is taken to imply the consent of the people this will be explained later on chapter ii that sovereignty is indivisible sovereignty for the same reason as makes it inalienable is indivisible for will either is or is not general  it is the will either of the body of the people or only of a part of it in the first case the will when declared is an act of sovereignty and constitutes law in the second it is merely a particular will or act of magistracy—at the most a decree but our political theorists unable to divide sovereignty in principle divide it according to its object into force and will into legislative power and executive power into rights of taxation justice and war into internal administration and power of foreign treaty sometimes they confuse all these sections and sometimes they distinguish    them they turn the sovereign into a fantastic being composed of several connected pieces it is as if they were making man of several bodies one with eyes one with arms another with feet and each with nothing besides we are told that the jugglers of japan dismember a child before the eyes of the spectators then they throw all the members into the air one after another and the child falls down alive and whole the conjuring tricks of our political theorists are very like that they first dismember the body politic by an illusion worthy of a fair and then join it together again we know not how this error is due to a lack of exact notions concerning the sovereign authority and to taking for parts of it what are only emanations from it thus for example the acts of declaring war and making peace have been regarded as acts of sovereignty but this is not the case as these acts do not constitute law but merely the application of a law a particular act which decides how the law applies as we shall see clearly when the idea attached to the word law has been defined if we examined the other divisions in the same manner we should find that whenever sovereignty seems to be divided there is an illusion the rights which are taken as being part of sovereignty are really all subordinate and always imply supreme wills of which they only sanction the execution it would be impossible to estimate the obscurity this lack of exactness has thrown over the decisions of writers who have dealt with political right when they have used the principles laid down by them to pass judgment on the respective rights of kings and peoples every one can see in chapters iii and iv of the first book of grotius how the learned man and his translator barbeyrac entangle and tie themselves up in their own sophistries for fear of saying too little or too much of what they think and so offending the interests they have to conciliate grotius a refugee in france illcontent with his own country and desirous of paying his court to louis xiii to whom his book is dedicated spares no pains to rob the peoples of all their rights and invest kings with them by every conceivable artifice this would also have been much to the taste of barbeyrac who    dedicated his translation to george i of england but unfortunately the expulsion of james ii which he called his abdication compelled him to use all reserve to shuffle and to tergiversate in order to avoid making william out a usurper if these two writers had adopted the true principles all difficulties would have been removed and they would have been always consistent but it would have been a sad truth for them to tell and would have paid court for them to noone save the people moreover truth is no road to fortune and the people dispenses neither ambassadorships nor professorships nor pensions chapter iii whether the general will is fallible it follows from what has gone before that the general will is always right and tends to the public advantage but it does not follow that the deliberations of the people are always equally correct our will is always for our own good but we do not always see what that is the people is never corrupted but it is often deceived and on such occasions only does it seem to will what is bad there is often a great deal of difference between the will of all and the general will the latter considers only the common interest while the former takes private interest into account and is no more than a sum of particular wills but take away from these same wills the pluses and minuses that cancel one another  and the general will remains as the sum of the differences if when the people being furnished with adequate information held its deliberations the citizens had no communication one with another the grand total of the small differences would always give the general will and    the decision would always be good but when factions arise and partial associations are formed at the expense of the great association the will of each of these associations becomes general in relation to its members while it remains particular in relation to the state it may then be said that there are no longer as many votes as there are men but only as many as there are associations the differences become less numerous and give a less general result lastly when one of these associations is so great as to prevail over all the rest the result is no longer a sum of small differences but a single difference in this case there is no longer a general will and the opinion which prevails is purely particular it is therefore essential if the general will is to be able to express itself that there should be no partial society within the state and that each citizen should think only his own thoughts  which was indeed the sublime and unique system established by the great lycurgus but if there are partial societies it is best to have as many as possible and to prevent them from being unequal as was done by solon numa and servius these precautions are the only ones that can guarantee that the general will shall be always enlightened and that the people shall in no way deceive itself chapter iv the limits of the sovereign power if the state is a moral person whose life is in the union of its members and if the most important of its cares is the care for its own preservation it must have a universal and compelling force in order to move and dispose each part as may be most advantageous to the whole as nature gives each man absolute power over all his    members the social compact gives the body politic absolute power over all its members also and it is this power which under the direction of the general will bears as i have said the name of sovereignty but besides the public person we have to consider the private persons composing it whose life and liberty are naturally independent of it we are bound then to distinguish clearly between the respective rights of the citizens and the sovereign  and between the duties the former have to fulfil as subjects and the natural rights they should enjoy as men each man alienates i admit by the social compact only such part of his powers goods and liberty as it is important for the community to control but it must also be granted that the sovereign is sole judge of what is important every service a citizen can render the state he ought to render as soon as the sovereign demands it but the sovereign for its part cannot impose upon its subjects any fetters that are useless to the community nor can it even wish to do so for no more by the law of reason than by the law of nature can anything occur without a cause the undertakings which bind us to the social body are obligatory only because they are mutual and their nature is such that in fulfilling them we cannot work for others without working for ourselves why is it that the general will is always in the right and that all continually will the happiness of each one unless it is because there is not a man who does not think of each as meaning him and consider himself in voting for all this proves that equality of rights and the idea of justice which such equality creates originate in the preference each man gives to himself and accordingly in the very nature of man it proves that the general will to be really such must be general in its object as well as its essence that it must both come from all and apply to all and that it loses its natural rectitude when it is directed to some particular and determinate object because in such a case we are judging of something    foreign to us and have no true principle of equity to guide us indeed as soon as a question of particular fact or right arises on a point not previously regulated by a general convention the matter becomes contentious it is a case in which the individuals concerned are one party and the public the other but in which i can see neither the law that ought to be followed nor the judge who ought to give the decision in such a case it would be absurd to propose to refer the question to an express decision of the general will which can be only the conclusion reached by one of the parties and in consequence will be for the other party merely an external and particular will inclined on this occasion to injustice and subject to error thus just as a particular will cannot stand for the general will the general will in turn changes its nature when its object is particular and as general cannot pronounce on a man or a fact when for instance the people of athens nominated or displaced its rulers decreed honours to one and imposed penalties on another and by a multitude of particular decrees exercised all the functions of government indiscriminately it had in such cases no longer a general will in the strict sense it was acting no longer as sovereign but as magistrate this will seem contrary to current views but i must be given time to expound my own it should be seen from the foregoing that what makes the will general is less the number of voters than the common interest uniting them for under this system each necessarily submits to the conditions he imposes on others and this admirable agreement between interest and justice gives to the common deliberations an equitable character which at once vanishes when any particular question is discussed in the absence of a common interest to unite and identify the ruling of the judge with that of the party from whatever side we approach our principle we reach the same conclusion that the social compact sets up among the citizens an equality of such a kind that they all bind themselves to observe the same conditions and should therefore all enjoy the same rights thus from the very nature of the compact every act of sovereignty    i e every authentic act of the general will binds or favours all the citizens equally so that the sovereign recognises only the body of the nation and draws no distinctions between those of whom it is made up what then strictly speaking is an act of sovereignty it is not a convention between a superior and an inferior but a convention between the body and each of its members it is legitimate because based on the social contract and equitable because common to all useful because it can have no other object than the general good and stable because guaranteed by the public force and the supreme power so long as the subjects have to submit only to conventions of this sort they obey noone but their own will and to ask how far the respective rights of the sovereign and the citizens extend is to ask up to what point the latter can enter into undertakings with themselves each with all and all with each we can see from this that the sovereign power absolute sacred and inviolable as it is does not and cannot exceed the limits of general conventions and that every man may dispose at will of such goods and liberty as these conventions leave him so that the sovereign never has a right to lay more charges on one subject than on another because in that case the question becomes particular and ceases to be within its competency when these distinctions have once been admitted it is seen to be so untrue that there is in the social contract any real renunciation on the part of the individuals that the position in which they find themselves as a result of the contract is really preferable to that in which they were before instead of a renunciation they have made an advantageous exchange instead of an uncertain and precarious way of living they have got one that is better and more secure instead of natural independence they have got liberty instead of the power to harm others security for themselves and instead of their strength which others might overcome a right which social union makes invincible their very life which they have devoted to the state is by it constantly protected and when they risk it in the states defence what more are they doing than giving back what they have received from it what are they doing that they would not do more often and with  0 greater danger in the state of nature in which they would inevitably have to fight battles at the peril of their lives in defence of that which is the means of their preservation all have indeed to fight when their country needs them but then no one has ever to fight for himself do we not gain something by running on behalf of what gives us our security only some of the risks we should have to run for ourselves as soon as we lost it chapter v the right of life and death the question is often asked how individuals having no right to dispose of their own lives can transfer to the sovereign a right which they do not possess the difficulty of answering this question seems to me to lie in its being wrongly stated every man has a right to risk his own life in order to preserve it has it ever been said that a man who throws himself out of the window to escape from a fire is guilty of suicide has such a crime ever been laid to the charge of him who perishes in a storm because when he went on board he knew of the danger the social treaty has for its end the preservation of the contracting parties he who wills the end wills the means also and the means must involve some risks and even some losses he who wishes to preserve his life at others expense should also when it is necessary be ready to give it up for their sake furthermore the citizen is no longer the judge of the dangers to which the law desires him to expose himself and when the prince says to him it is expedient for the state that you should die he ought to die because it is only on that condition that he has been living in security up to the present and because his life is no longer a mere bounty of nature but a gift made conditionally by the state the deathpenalty inflicted upon criminals may be looked on in much the same light it is in order that we may not fall victims to an assassin that we consent to die if we ourselves turn assassins in this treaty so far from disposing    of our own lives we think only of securing them and it is not to be assumed that any of the parties then expects to get hanged again every malefactor by attacking social rights becomes on forfeit a rebel and a traitor to his country by violating its laws he ceases to be a member of it he even makes war upon it in such a case the preservation of the state is inconsistent with his own and one or the other must perish in putting the guilty to death we slay not so much the citizen as an enemy the trial and the judgment are the proofs that he has broken the social treaty and is in consequence no longer a member of the state since then he has recognised himself to be such by living there he must be removed by exile as a violator of the compact or by death as a public enemy for such an enemy is not a moral person but merely a man and in such a case the right of war is to kill the vanquished but it will be said the condemnation of a criminal is a particular act i admit it but such condemnation is not a function of the sovereign it is a right the sovereign can confer without being able itself to exert it all my ideas are consistent but i cannot expound them all at once we may add that frequent punishments are always a sign of weakness or remissness on the part of the government there is not a single illdoer who could not be turned to some good the state has no right to put to death even for the sake of making an example any one whom it can leave alive without danger the right of pardoning or exempting the guilty from a penalty imposed by the law and pronounced by the judge belongs only to the authority which is superior to both judge and law i e the sovereign even its right in this matter is far from clear and the cases for exercising it are extremely rare in a wellgoverned state there are few punishments not because there are many pardons but because criminals are rare it is when a state is in decay that the multitude of crimes is a guarantee of impunity under the roman republic neither the senate nor the consuls ever attempted to pardon even the people never did so though it sometimes revoked its own decision frequent pardons mean that crime will soon    need them no longer and noone can help seeing whither that leads but i feel my heart protesting and restraining my pen let us leave these questions to the just man who has never offended and would himself stand in no need of pardon chapter vi law by the social compact we have given the body politic existence and life we have now by legislation to give it movement and will for the original act by which the body is formed and united still in no respect determines what it ought to do for its preservation what is well and in conformity with order is so by the nature of things and independently of human conventions all justice comes from god who is its sole source but if we knew how to receive so high an inspiration we should need neither government nor laws doubtless there is a universal justice emanating from reason alone but this justice to be admitted among us must be mutual humanly speaking in default of natural sanctions the laws of justice are ineffective among men they merely make for the good of the wicked and the undoing of the just when the just man observes them towards everybody and nobody observes them towards him conventions and laws are therefore needed to join rights to duties and refer justice to its object in the state of nature where everything is common i owe nothing to him whom i have promised nothing i recognise as belonging to others only what is of no use to me in the state of society all rights are fixed by law and the case becomes different but what after all is a law as long as we remain satisfied with attaching purely metaphysical ideas to the word we shall go on arguing without arriving at an understanding and when we have defined a law of nature we shall be no nearer the definition of a law of the state i have already said that there can be no general will directed to a particular object such an object must be either within or outside the state if outside a will which is alien to it cannot be in relation to it general    if within it is part of the state and in that case there arises a relation between whole and part which makes them two separate beings of which the part is one and the whole minus the part the other but the whole minus a part cannot be the whole and while this relation persists there can be no whole but only two unequal parts and it follows that the will of one is no longer in any respect general in relation to the other but when the whole people decrees for the whole people it is considering only itself and if a relation is then formed it is between two aspects of the entire object without there being any division of the whole in that case the matter about which the decree is made is like the decreeing will general this act is what i call a law when i say that the object of laws is always general i mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract and never a particular person or action thus the law may indeed decree that there shall be privileges but cannot confer them on anybody by name it may set up several classes of citizens and even lay down the qualifications for membership of these classes but it cannot nominate such and such persons as belonging to them it may establish a monarchical government and hereditary succession but it cannot choose a king or nominate a royal family in a word no function which has a particular object belongs to the legislative power on this view we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws since they are acts of the general will nor whether the prince is above the law since he is a member of the state nor whether the law can be unjust since no one is unjust to himself nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws since they are but registers of our wills we see further that as the law unites universality of will with universality of object what a man whoever he be commands of his own motion cannot be a law and even what the sovereign commands with regard to a particular matter is no nearer being a law but is a decree an act not of sovereignty but of magistracy i therefore give the name republic to every state that is governed by laws no matter what the form of its administration may be for only in such a case does the    public interest govern and the res publica rank as a reality every legitimate government is republican  what government is i will explain later on laws are properly speaking only the conditions of civil association the people being subject to the laws ought to be their author the conditions of the society ought to be regulated solely by those who come together to form it but how are they to regulate them is it to be by common agreement by a sudden inspiration has the body politic an organ to declare its will who can give it the foresight to formulate and announce its acts in advance or how is it to announce them in the hour of need how can a blind multitude which often does not know what it wills because it rarely knows what is good for it carry out for itself so great and difficult an enterprise as a system of legislation of itself the people wills always the good but of itself it by no means always sees it the general will is always in the right but the judgment which guides it is not always enlightened it must be got to see objects as they are and sometimes as they ought to appear to it it must be shown the good road it is in search of secured from the seductive influences of individual wills taught to see times and spaces as a series and made to weigh the attractions of present and sensible advantages against the danger of distant and hidden evils the individuals see the good they reject the public wills the good it does not see all stand equally in need of guidance the former must be compelled to bring their wills into conformity with their reason the latter must be taught to know what it wills if that is done public enlightenment leads to the union of understanding and will in the social body the parts are made to work exactly together and the whole is raised to its highest power this makes a legislator necessary    chapter vii the legislator in order to discover the rules of society best suited to nations a superior intelligence beholding all the passions of men without experiencing any of them would be needed this intelligence would have to be wholly unrelated to our nature while knowing it through and through its happiness would have to be independent of us and yet ready to occupy itself with ours and lastly it would have in the march of time to look forward to a distant glory and working in one century to be able to enjoy in the next  it would take gods to give men laws what caligula argued from the facts plato in the dialogue called the politicus argued in defining the civil or kingly man on the basis of right but if great princes are rare how much more so are great legislators the former have only to follow the pattern which the latter have to lay down the legislator is the engineer who invents the machine the prince merely the mechanic who sets it up and makes it go at the birth of societies says montesquieu the rulers of republics establish institutions and afterwards the institutions mould the rulers  he who dares to undertake the making of a peoples institutions ought to feel himself capable so to speak of changing human nature of transforming each individual who is by himself a complete and solitary whole into part of a greater whole from which he in a manner receives his life and being of altering mans constitution for the purpose of strengthening it and of substituting a partial and moral existence for the physical and independent existence nature has conferred on us all he must in a word take away from man his own resources and give him instead new ones alien to him and incapable of being made use of without the help of other men the more    completely these natural resources are annihilated the greater and the more lasting are those which he acquires and the more stable and perfect the new institutions so that if each citizen is nothing and can do nothing without the rest and the resources acquired by the whole are equal or superior to the aggregate of the resources of all the individuals it may be said that legislation is at the highest possible point of perfection the legislator occupies in every respect an extraordinary position in the state if he should do so by reason of his genius he does so no less by reason of his office which is neither magistracy nor sovereignty this office which sets up the republic nowhere enters into its constitution it is an individual and superior function which has nothing in common with human empire for if he who holds command over men ought not to have command over the laws he who has command over the laws ought not any more to have it over men or else his laws would be the ministers of his passions and would often merely serve to perpetuate his injustices his private aims would inevitably mar the sanctity of his work when lycurgus gave laws to his country he began by resigning the throne it was the custom of most greek towns to entrust the establishment of their laws to foreigners the republics of modern italy in many cases followed this example geneva did the same and profited by it  rome when it was most prosperous suffered a revival of all the crimes of tyranny and was brought to the verge of destruction because it put the legislative authority and the sovereign power into the same hands nevertheless the decemvirs themselves never claimed the right to pass any law merely on their own authority nothing we propose to you they said to the people can pass into law without your consent romans be yourselves the authors of the laws which are to make you happy    he therefore who draws up the laws has or should have no right of legislation and the people cannot even if it wishes deprive itself of this incommunicable right because according to the fundamental compact only the general will can bind the individuals and there can be no assurance that a particular will is in conformity with the general will until it has been put to the free vote of the people this i have said already but it is worth while to repeat it thus in the task of legislation we find together two things which appear to be incompatible an enterprise too difficult for human powers and for its execution an authority that is no authority there is a further difficulty that deserves attention wise men if they try to speak their language to the common herd instead of its own cannot possibly make themselves understood there are a thousand kinds of ideas which it is impossible to translate into popular language conceptions that are too general and objects that are too remote are equally out of its range each individual having no taste for any other plan of government than that which suits his particular interest finds it difficult to realise the advantages he might hope to draw from the continual privations good laws impose for a young people to be able to relish sound principles of political theory and follow the fundamental rules of statecraft the effect would have to become the cause the social spirit which should be created by these institutions would have to preside over their very foundation and men would have to be before law what they should become by means of law the legislator therefore being unable to appeal to either force or reason must have recourse to an authority of a different order capable of constraining without violence and persuading without convincing this is what has in all ages compelled the fathers of nations to have recourse to divine intervention and credit the gods with their own wisdom in order that the peoples submitting to the laws of the state as to those of nature and recognising the same power in the formation of the city as in that of man might obey freely and bear with docility the yoke of the public happiness this sublime reason far above the range of the common    herd is that whose decisions the legislator puts into the mouth of the immortals in order to constrain by divine authority those whom human prudence could not move  but it is not anybody who can make the gods speak or get himself believed when he proclaims himself their interpreter the great soul of the legislator is the only miracle that can prove his mission any man may grave tablets of stone or buy an oracle or feign secret intercourse with some divinity or train a bird to whisper in his ear or find other vulgar ways of imposing on the people he whose knowledge goes no further may perhaps gather round him a band of fools but he will never found an empire and his extravagances will quickly perish with him idle tricks form a passing tie only wisdom can make it lasting the judaic law which still subsists and that of the child of ishmael which for ten centuries has ruled half the world still proclaim the great men who laid them down and while the pride of philosophy or the blind spirit of faction sees in them no more than lucky impostures the true political theorist admires in the institutions they set up the great and powerful genius which presides over things made to endure we should not with warburton conclude from this that politics and religion have among us a common object but that in the first periods of nations the one is used as an instrument for the other chapter viii the people as before putting up a large building the architect surveys and sounds the site to see if it will bear the weight the wise legislator does not begin by laying down laws good in themselves but by investigating the fitness of    the people for which they are destined to receive them plato refused to legislate for the arcadians and the cyrenæans because he knew that both peoples were rich and could not put up with equality and good laws and bad men were found together in crete because minos had inflicted discipline on a people already burdened with vice a thousand nations have achieved earthly greatness that could never have endured good laws even such as could have endured them could have done so only for a very brief period of their long history most peoples like most men are docile only in youth as they grow old they become incorrigible when once customs have become established and prejudices inveterate it is dangerous and useless to attempt their reformation the people like the foolish and cowardly patients who rave at sight of the doctor can no longer bear that any one should lay hands on its faults to remedy them there are indeed times in the history of states when just as some kinds of illness turn mens heads and make them forget the past periods of violence and revolutions do to peoples what these crises do to individuals horror of the past takes the place of forgetfulness and the state set on fire by civil wars is born again so to speak from its ashes and takes on anew fresh from the jaws of death the vigour of youth such were sparta at the time of lycurgus rome after the tarquins and in modern times holland and switzerland after the expulsion of the tyrants but such events are rare they are exceptions the cause of which is always to be found in the particular constitution of the state concerned they cannot even happen twice to the same people for it can make itself free as long as it remains barbarous but not when the civic impulse has lost its vigour then disturbances may destroy it but revolutions cannot mend it it needs a master and not a liberator free peoples be mindful of this maxim liberty may be gained but can never be recovered youth is not infancy there is for nations as for men a period of youth or shall we say maturity before which they should not be made subject to laws but the maturity of a people is not always easily recognisable and if it is anticipated the work is spoilt one people  0 is amenable to discipline from the beginning another not after ten centuries russia will never be really civilised because it was civilised too soon peter had a genius for imitation but he lacked true genius which is creative and makes all from nothing he did some good things but most of what he did was out of place he saw that his people was barbarous but did not see that it was not ripe for civilisation he wanted to civilise it when it needed only hardening his first wish was to make germans or englishmen when he ought to have been making russians and he prevented his subjects from ever becoming what they might have been by persuading them that they were what they are not in this fashion too a french teacher turns out his pupil to be an infant prodigy and for the rest of his life to be nothing whatsoever the empire of russia will aspire to conquer europe and will itself be conquered the tartars its subjects or neighbours will become its masters and ours by a revolution which i regard as inevitable indeed all the kings of europe are working in concert to hasten its coming chapter ix the people continued as nature has set bounds to the stature of a wellmade man and outside those limits makes nothing but giants or dwarfs similarly for the constitution of a state to be at its best it is possible to fix limits that will make it neither too large for good government nor too small for selfmaintenance in every body politic there is a maximum strength which it cannot exceed and which it only loses by increasing in size every extension of the social tie means its relaxation and generally speaking a small state is stronger in proportion than a great one a thousand arguments could be advanced in favour of this principle first long distances make administration more difficult just as a weight becomes heavier at the end of a longer lever administration therefore becomes more and more burdensome as the distance grows greater for in the first place each city has its own which is paid for    by the people each district its own still paid for by the people then comes each province and then the great governments satrapies and viceroyalties always costing more the higher you go and always at the expense of the unfortunate people last of all comes the supreme administration which eclipses all the rest all these overcharges are a continual drain upon the subjects so far from being better governed by all these different orders they are worse governed than if there were only a single authority over them in the meantime there scarce remain resources enough to meet emergencies and when recourse must be had to these the state is always on the eve of destruction this is not all not only has the government less vigour and promptitude for securing the observance of the laws preventing nuisances correcting abuses and guarding against seditious undertakings begun in distant places the people has less affection for its rulers whom it never sees for its country which to its eyes seems like the world and for its fellowcitizens most of whom are unknown to it the same laws cannot suit so many diverse provinces with different customs situated in the most various climates and incapable of enduring a uniform government different laws lead only to trouble and confusion among peoples which living under the same rulers and in constant communication one with another intermingle and intermarry and coming under the sway of new customs never know if they can call their very patrimony their own talent is buried virtue unknown and vice unpunished among such a multitude of men who do not know one another gathered together in one place at the seat of the central administration the leaders overwhelmed with business see nothing for themselves the state is governed by clerks finally the measures which have to be taken to maintain the general authority which all these distant officials wish to escape or to impose upon absorb all the energy of the public so that there is none left for the happiness of the people there is hardly enough to defend it when need arises and thus a body which is too big for its constitution gives way and falls crushed under its own weight again the state must assure itself a safe foundation    if it is to have stability and to be able to resist the shocks it cannot help experiencing as well as the efforts it will be forced to make for its maintenance for all peoples have a kind of centrifugal force that makes them continually act one against another and tend to aggrandise themselves at their neighbours expense like the vortices of descartes thus the weak run the risk of being soon swallowed up and it is almost impossible for any one to preserve itself except by putting itself in a state of equilibrium with all so that the pressure is on all sides practically equal it may therefore be seen that there are reasons for expansion and reasons for contraction and it is no small part of the statesmans skill to hit between them the mean that is most favourable to the preservation of the state it may be said that the reason for expansion being merely external and relative ought to be subordinate to the reasons for contraction which are internal and absolute a strong and healthy constitution is the first thing to look for and it is better to count on the vigour which comes of good government than on the resources a great territory furnishes it may be added that there have been known states so constituted that the necessity of making conquests entered into their very constitution and that in order to maintain themselves they were forced to expand ceaselessly it may be that they congratulated themselves greatly on this fortunate necessity which none the less indicated to them along with the limits of their greatness the inevitable moment of their fall chapter x the people continued a body politic may be measured in two ways—either by the extent of its territory or by the number of its people and there is between these two measurements a right relation which makes the state really great the men make the state and the territory sustains the men the right relation therefore is that the land should suffice for the maintenance of the inhabitants and that there    should be as many inhabitants as the land can maintain in this proportion lies the maximum strength of a given number of people for if there is too much land it is troublesome to guard and inadequately cultivated produces more than is needed and soon gives rise to wars of defence if there is not enough the state depends on its neighbours for what it needs over and above and this soon gives rise to wars of offence every people to which its situation gives no choice save that between commerce and war is weak in itself it depends on its neighbours and on circumstances its existence can never be more than short and uncertain it either conquers others and changes its situation or it is conquered and becomes nothing only insignificance or greatness can keep it free no fixed relation can be stated between the extent of territory and the population that are adequate one to the other both because of the differences in the quality of land in its fertility in the nature of its products and in the influence of climate and because of the different tempers of those who inhabit it for some in a fertile country consume little and others on an ungrateful soil much the greater or less fecundity of women the conditions that are more or less favourable in each country to the growth of population and the influence the legislator can hope to exercise by his institutions must also be taken into account the legislator therefore should not go by what he sees but by what he foresees he should stop not so much at the state in which he actually finds the population as at that to which it ought naturally to attain lastly there are countless cases in which the particular local circumstances demand or allow the acquisition of a greater territory than seems necessary thus expansion will be great in a mountainous country where the natural products i e woods and pastures need less labour where we know from experience that women are more fertile than in the plains and where a great expanse of slope affords only a small level tract that can be counted on for vegetation on the other hand contraction is possible on the coast even in lands of rocks and nearly barren sands because there fishing makes up to a great extent for the lack of landproduce because the inhabitants have to    congregate together more in order to repel pirates and further because it is easier to unburden the country of its superfluous inhabitants by means of colonies to these conditions of lawgiving must be added one other which though it cannot take the place of the rest renders them all useless when it is absent this is the enjoyment of peace and plenty for the moment at which a state sets its house in order is like the moment when a battalion is forming up that when its body is least capable of offering resistance and easiest to destroy a better resistance could be made at a time of absolute disorganisation than at a moment of fermentation when each is occupied with his own position and not with the danger if war famine or sedition arises at this time of crisis the state will inevitably be overthrown not that many governments have not been set up during such storms but in such cases these governments are themselves the states destroyers usurpers always bring about or select troublous times to get passed under cover of the public terror destructive laws which the people would never adopt in cold blood the moment chosen is one of the surest means of distinguishing the work of the legislator from that of the tyrant what people then is a fit subject for legislation one which already bound by some unity of origin interest or convention has never yet felt the real yoke of law one that has neither customs nor superstitions deeply ingrained one which stands in no fear of being overwhelmed by sudden invasion one which without entering into its neighbours quarrels can resist each of them singlehanded or get the help of one to repel another one in which every member may be known by every other and there is no need to lay on any man burdens too heavy for a man to bear one which can do without other peoples and without which all others can do  one which is    neither rich nor poor but selfsufficient and lastly one which unites the consistency of an ancient people with the docility of a new one legislation is made difficult less by what it is necessary to build up than by what has to be destroyed and what makes success so rare is the impossibility of finding natural simplicity together with social requirements all these conditions are indeed rarely found united and therefore few states have good constitutions there is still in europe one country capable of being given laws—corsica the valour and persistency with which that brave people has regained and defended its liberty well deserves that some wise man should teach it how to preserve what it has won i have a feeling that some day that little island will astonish europe chapter xi the various systems of legislation if we ask in what precisely consists the greatest good of all which should be the end of every system of legislation we shall find it reduce itself to two main objects liberty and equality—liberty because all particular dependence means so much force taken from the body of the state and equality because liberty cannot exist without it i have already defined civil liberty by equality we should understand not that the degrees of power and riches are to be absolutely identical for everybody but that power shall never be great enough for violence and shall always be exercised by virtue of rank and law and that in respect of riches no citizen shall ever be wealthy enough to buy another and none poor enough to be forced to sell himself  which implies on the part of the great    moderation in goods and position and on the side of the common sort moderation in avarice and covetousness such equality we are told is an unpractical ideal that cannot actually exist but if its abuse is inevitable does it follow that we should not at least make regulations concerning it it is precisely because the force of circumstances tends continually to destroy equality that the force of legislation should always tend to its maintenance but these general objects of every good legislative system need modifying in every country in accordance with the local situation and the temper of the inhabitants and these circumstances should determine in each case the particular system of institutions which is best not perhaps in itself but for the state for which it is destined if for instance the soil is barren and unproductive or the land too crowded for its inhabitants the people should turn to industry and the crafts and exchange what they produce for the commodities they lack if on the other hand a people dwells in rich plains and fertile slopes or in a good land lacks inhabitants it should give all its attention to agriculture which causes men to multiply and should drive out the crafts which would only result in depopulation by grouping in a few localities the few inhabitants there are  if a nation dwells on an extensive and convenient coastline let it cover the sea with ships and foster commerce and navigation it will have a life that will be short and glorious if on its coasts the sea washes nothing but almost inaccessible rocks let it remain barbarous and ichthyophagous it will have a quieter perhaps a better and certainly a happier life in a word besides the principles that are common to all every nation has in itself something that gives them a particular application and makes its legislation peculiarly its own thus among the jews long ago and more recently among the arabs the chief object was religion among the athenians letters at carthage and tyre commerce at rhodes shipping at sparta war at rome virtue the author of    the spirit of the laws has shown with many examples by what art the legislator directs the constitution towards each of these objects what makes the constitution of a state really solid and lasting is the due observance of what is proper so that the natural relations are always in agreement with the laws on every point and law only serves so to speak to assure accompany and rectify them but if the legislator mistakes his object and adopts a principle other than circumstances naturally direct if his principle makes for servitude while they make for liberty or if it makes for riches while they make for populousness or if it makes for peace while they make for conquest—the laws will insensibly lose their influence the constitution will alter and the state will have no rest from trouble till it is either destroyed or changed and nature has resumed her invincible sway chapter xii the division of the laws if the whole is to be set in order and the commonwealth put into the best possible shape there are various relations to be considered first there is the action of the complete body upon itself the relation of the whole to the whole of the sovereign to the state and this relation as we shall see is made up of the relations of the intermediate terms the laws which regulate this relation bear the name of political laws and are also called fundamental laws not without reason if they are wise for if there is in each state only one good system the people that is in possession of it should hold fast to this but if the established order is bad why should laws that prevent men from being good be regarded as fundamental besides in any case a people is always in a position to change its laws however good for if it choose to do itself harm who can have a right to stop it the second relation is that of the members one to another or to the body as a whole and this relation should    be in the first respect as unimportant and in the second as important as possible each citizen would then be perfectly independent of all the rest and at the same time very dependent on the city which is brought about always by the same means as the strength of the state can alone secure the liberty of its members from this second relation arise civil laws we may consider also a third kind of relation between the individual and the law a relation of disobedience to its penalty this gives rise to the setting up of criminal laws which at bottom are less a particular class of law than the sanction behind all the rest along with these three kinds of law goes a fourth most important of all which is not graven on tablets of marble or brass but on the hearts of the citizens this forms the real constitution of the state takes on every day new powers when other laws decay or die out restores them or takes their place keeps a people in the ways in which it was meant to go and insensibly replaces authority by the force of habit i am speaking of morality of custom above all of public opinion a power unknown to political thinkers on which none the less success in everything else depends with this the great legislator concerns himself in secret though he seems to confine himself to particular regulations for these are only the arc of the arch while manners and morals slower to arise form in the end its immovable keystone among the different classes of laws the political which determine the form of the government are alone relevant to my subject book iii before speaking of the different forms of government let us try to fix the exact sense of the word which has not yet been very clearly explained    chapter i government in general i warn the reader that this chapter requires careful reading and that i am unable to make myself clear to those who refuse to be attentive every free action is produced by the concurrence of two causes one moral i e the will which determines the act the other physical i e the power which executes it when i walk towards an object it is necessary first that i should will to go there and in the second place that my feet should carry me if a paralytic wills to run and an active man wills not to they will both stay where they are the body politic has the same motive powers here too force and will are distinguished will under the name of legislative power and force under that of executive power without their concurrence nothing is or should be done we have seen that the legislative power belongs to the people and can belong to it alone it may on the other hand readily be seen from the principles laid down above that the executive power cannot belong to the generality as legislature or sovereign because it consists wholly of particular acts which fall outside the competency of the law and consequently of the sovereign whose acts must always be laws the public force therefore needs an agent of its own to bind it together and set it to work under the direction of the general will to serve as a means of communication between the state and the sovereign and to do for the collective person more or less what the union of soul and body does for man here we have what is in the state the basis of government often wrongly confused with the sovereign whose minister it is what then is government an intermediate body set up between the subjects and the sovereign to secure their mutual correspondence charged with the execution of the laws and the maintenance of liberty both civil and political the members of this body are called magistrates or kings that is to say governors and the whole body bears  0 the name prince  thus those who hold that the act by which a people puts itself under a prince is not a contract are certainly right it is simply and solely a commission an employment in which the rulers mere officials of the sovereign exercise in their own name the power of which it makes them depositaries this power it can limit modify or recover at pleasure for the alienation of such a right is incompatible with the nature of the social body and contrary to the end of association i call then government or supreme administration the legitimate exercise of the executive power and prince or magistrate the man or the body entrusted with that administration in government reside the intermediate forces whose relations make up that of the whole to the whole or of the sovereign to the state this last relation may be represented as that between the extreme terms of a continuous proportion which has government as its mean proportional the government gets from the sovereign the orders it gives the people and for the state to be properly balanced there must when everything is reckoned in be equality between the product or power of the government taken in itself and the product or power of the citizens who are on the one hand sovereign and on the other subject furthermore none of these three terms can be altered without the equality being instantly destroyed if the sovereign desires to govern or the magistrate to give laws or if the subjects refuse to obey disorder takes the place of regularity force and will no longer act together and the state is dissolved and falls into despotism or anarchy lastly as there is only one mean proportional between each relation there is also only one good government possible for a state but as countless events may change the relations of a people not only may different governments be good for different peoples but also for the same people at different times in attempting to give some idea of the various relations that may hold between these two extreme terms i shall    take as an example the number of a people which is the most easily expressible suppose the state is composed of ten thousand citizens the sovereign can only be considered collectively and as a body but each member as being a subject is regarded as an individual thus the sovereign is to the subject as ten thousand to one i e each member of the state has as his share only a tenthousandth part of the sovereign authority although he is wholly under its control if the people numbers a hundred thousand the condition of the subject undergoes no change and each equally is under the whole authority of the laws while his vote being reduced to one hundred thousandth part has ten times less influence in drawing them up the subject therefore remaining always a unit the relation between him and the sovereign increases with the number of the citizens from this it follows that the larger the state the less the liberty when i say the relation increases i mean that it grows more unequal thus the greater it is in the geometrical sense the less relation there is in the ordinary sense of the word in the former sense the relation considered according to quantity is expressed by the quotient in the latter considered according to identity it is reckoned by similarity now the less relation the particular wills have to the general will that is morals and manners to laws the more should the repressive force be increased the government then to be good should be proportionately stronger as the people is more numerous on the other hand as the growth of the state gives the depositaries of the public authority more temptations and chances of abusing their power the greater the force with which the government ought to be endowed for keeping the people in hand the greater too should be the force at the disposal of the sovereign for keeping the government in hand i am speaking not of absolute force but of the relative force of the different parts of the state it follows from this double relation that the continuous proportion between the sovereign the prince and the people is by no means an arbitrary idea but a necessary consequence of the nature of the body politic it follows    further that one of the extreme terms viz the people as subject being fixed and represented by unity whenever the duplicate ratio increases or diminishes the simple ratio does the same and is changed accordingly from this we see that there is not a single unique and absolute form of government but as many governments differing in nature as there are states differing in size if ridiculing this system any one were to say that in order to find the mean proportional and give form to the body of the government it is only necessary according to me to find the square root of the number of the people i should answer that i am here taking this number only as an instance that the relations of which i am speaking are not measured by the number of men alone but generally by the amount of action which is a combination of a multitude of causes and that further if to save words i borrow for a moment the terms of geometry i am none the less well aware that moral quantities do not allow of geometrical accuracy the government is on a small scale what the body politic which includes it is on a great one it is a moral person endowed with certain faculties active like the sovereign and passive like the state and capable of being resolved into other similar relations this accordingly gives rise to a new proportion within which there is yet another according to the arrangement of the magistracies till an indivisible middle term is reached i e a single ruler or supreme magistrate who may be represented in the midst of this progression as the unity between the fractional and the ordinal series without encumbering ourselves with this multiplication of terms let us rest content with regarding government as a new body within the state distinct from the people and the sovereign and intermediate between them there is between these two bodies this essential difference that the state exists by itself and the government only through the sovereign thus the dominant will of the prince is or should be nothing but the general will or the law his force is only the public force concentrated in his hands and as soon as he tries to base any absolute and independent act on his own authority the tie that binds the whole together begins to be loosened if finally    the prince should come to have a particular will more active than the will of the sovereign and should employ the public force in his hands in obedience to this particular will there would be so to speak two sovereigns one rightful and the other actual the social union would evaporate instantly and the body politic would be dissolved however in order that the government may have a true existence and a real life distinguishing it from the body of the state and in order that all its members may be able to act in concert and fulfil the end for which it was set up it must have a particular personality a sensibility common to its members and a force and will of its own making for its preservation this particular existence implies assemblies councils power of deliberation and decision rights titles and privileges belonging exclusively to the prince and making the office of magistrate more honourable in proportion as it is more troublesome the difficulties lie in the manner of so ordering this subordinate whole within the whole that it in no way alters the general constitution by affirmation of its own and always distinguishes the particular force it possesses which is destined to aid in its preservation from the public force which is destined to the preservation of the state and in a word is always ready to sacrifice the government to the people and never to sacrifice the people to the government furthermore although the artificial body of the government is the work of another artificial body and has we may say only a borrowed and subordinate life this does not prevent it from being able to act with more or less vigour or promptitude or from being so to speak in more or less robust health finally without departing directly from the end for which it was instituted it may deviate more or less from it according to the manner of its constitution from all these differences arise the various relations which the government ought to bear to the body of the state according to the accidental and particular relations by which the state itself is modified for often the government that is best in itself will become the most pernicious if the relations in which it stands have altered according to the defects of the body politic to which it belongs    chapter ii the constituent principle in the various forms of government to set forth the general cause of the above differences we must here distinguish between government and its principle as we did before between the state and the sovereign the body of the magistrate may be composed of a greater or a less number of members we said that the relation of the sovereign to the subjects was greater in proportion as the people was more numerous and by a clear analogy we may say the same of the relation of the government to the magistrates but the total force of the government being always that of the state is invariable so that the more of this force it expends on its own members the less it has left to employ on the whole people the more numerous the magistrates therefore the weaker the government this principle being fundamental we must do our best to make it clear in the person of the magistrate we can distinguish three essentially different wills first the private will of the individual tending only to his personal advantage secondly the common will of the magistrates which is relative solely to the advantage of the prince and may be called corporate will being general in relation to the government and particular in relation to the state of which the government forms part and in the third place the will of the people or the sovereign will which is general both in relation to the state regarded as the whole and to the government regarded as a part of the whole in a perfect act of legislation the individual or particular will should be at zero the corporate will belonging to the government should occupy a very subordinate position and consequently the general or sovereign will should always predominate and should be the sole guide of all the rest according to the natural order on the other hand these different wills become more active in proportion as they are concentrated thus the general will is always the    weakest the corporate will second and the individual will strongest of all so that in the government each member is first of all himself then a magistrate and then a citizen—in an order exactly the reverse of what the social system requires this granted if the whole government is in the hands of one man the particular and the corporate will are wholly united and consequently the latter is at its highest possible degree of intensity but as the use to which the force is put depends on the degree reached by the will and as the absolute force of the government is invariable it follows that the most active government is that of one man suppose on the other hand we unite the government with the legislative authority and make the sovereign prince also and all the citizens so many magistrates then the corporate will being confounded with the general will can possess no greater activity than that will and must leave the particular will as strong as it can possibly be thus the government having always the same absolute force will be at the lowest point of its relative force or activity these relations are incontestable and there are other considerations which still further confirm them we can see for instance that each magistrate is more active in the body to which he belongs than each citizen in that to which he belongs and that consequently the particular will has much more influence on the acts of the government than on those of the sovereign for each magistrate is almost always charged with some governmental function while each citizen taken singly exercises no function of sovereignty furthermore the bigger the state grows the more its real force increases though not in direct proportion to its growth but the state remaining the same the number of magistrates may increase to any extent without the government gaining any greater real force for its force is that of the state the dimension of which remains equal thus the relative force or activity of the government decreases while its absolute or real force cannot increase moreover it is a certainty that promptitude in execution diminishes as more people are put in charge of it where prudence is made too much of not enough is made of    fortune opportunity is let slip and deliberation results in the loss of its object i have just proved that the government grows remiss in proportion as the number of the magistrates increases and i previously proved that the more numerous the people the greater should be the repressive force from this it follows that the relation of the magistrates to the government should vary inversely to the relation of the subjects to the sovereign that is to say the larger the state the more should the government be tightened so that the number of the rulers diminish in proportion to the increase of that of the people it should be added that i am here speaking of the relative strength of the government and not of its rectitude for on the other hand the more numerous the magistracy the nearer the corporate will comes to the general will while under a single magistrate the corporate will is as i said merely a particular will thus what may be gained on one side is lost on the other and the art of the legislator is to know how to fix the point at which the force and the will of the government which are always in inverse proportion meet in the relation that is most to the advantage of the state chapter iii the division of governments we saw in the last chapter what causes the various kinds or forms of government to be distinguished according to the number of the members composing them it remains in this to discover how the division is made in the first place the sovereign may commit the charge of the government to the whole people or to the majority of the people so that more citizens are magistrates than are mere private individuals this form of government is called democracy or it may restrict the government to a small number so that there are more private citizens than magistrates and this is named aristocracy lastly it may concentrate the whole government in the    hands of a single magistrate from whom all others hold their power this third form is the most usual and is called monarchy or royal government it should be remarked that all these forms or at least the first two admit of degree and even of very wide differences for democracy may include the whole people or may be restricted to half aristocracy in its turn may be restricted indefinitely from half the people down to the smallest possible number even royalty is susceptible of a measure of distribution sparta always had two kings as its constitution provided and the roman empire saw as many as eight emperors at once without it being possible to say that the empire was split up thus there is a point at which each form of government passes into the next and it becomes clear that under three comprehensive denominations government is really susceptible of as many diverse forms as the state has citizens there are even more for as the government may also in certain aspects be subdivided into other parts one administered in one fashion and one in another the combination of the three forms may result in a multitude of mixed forms each of which admits of multiplication by all the simple forms there has been at all times much dispute concerning the best form of government without consideration of the fact that each is in some cases the best and in others the worst if in the different states the number of supreme magistrates should be in inverse ratio to the number of citizens it follows that generally democratic government suits small states aristocratic government those of middle size and monarchy great ones this rule is immediately deducible from the principle laid down but it is impossible to count the innumerable circumstances which may furnish exceptions chapter iv democracy he who makes the law knows better than any one else how it should be executed and interpreted it seems then    impossible to have a better constitution than that in which the executive and legislative powers are united but this very fact renders the government in certain respects inadequate because things which should be distinguished are confounded and the prince and the sovereign being the same person form so to speak no more than a government without government it is not good for him who makes the laws to execute them or for the body of the people to turn its attention away from a general standpoint and devote it to particular objects nothing is more dangerous than the influence of private interests in public affairs and the abuse of the laws by the government is a less evil than the corruption of the legislator which is the inevitable sequel to a particular standpoint in such a case the state being altered in substance all reformation becomes impossible a people that would never misuse governmental powers would never misuse independence a people that would always govern well would not need to be governed if we take the term in the strict sense there never has been a real democracy and there never will be it is against the natural order for the many to govern and the few to be governed it is unimaginable that the people should remain continually assembled to devote their time to public affairs and it is clear that they cannot set up commissions for that purpose without the form of administration being changed in fact i can confidently lay down as a principle that when the functions of government are shared by several tribunals the less numerous sooner or later acquire the greatest authority if only because they are in a position to expedite affairs and power thus naturally comes into their hands besides how many conditions that are difficult to unite does such a government presuppose first a very small state where the people can readily be got together and where each citizen can with ease know all the rest secondly great simplicity of manners to prevent business from multiplying and raising thorny problems next a large measure of equality in rank and fortune without which equality of rights and authority cannot long subsist lastly little or no luxury—for luxury either comes of    riches or makes them necessary it corrupts at once rich and poor the rich by possession and the poor by covetousness it sells the country to softness and vanity and takes away from the state all its citizens to make them slaves one to another and one and all to public opinion this is why a famous writer has made virtue the fundamental principle of republics for all these conditions could not exist without virtue but for want of the necessary distinctions that great thinker was often inexact and sometimes obscure and did not see that the sovereign authority being everywhere the same the same principle should be found in every wellconstituted state in a greater or less degree it is true according to the form of the government it may be added that there is no government so subject to civil wars and intestine agitations as democratic or popular government because there is none which has so strong and continual a tendency to change to another form or which demands more vigilance and courage for its maintenance as it is under such a constitution above all the citizen should arm himself with strength and constancy and say every day of his life what a virtuous count palatine  said in the diet of poland malo periculosam libertatem quam quietum servitium were there a people of gods their government would be democratic so perfect a government is not for men chapter v aristocracy we have here two quite distinct moral persons the government and the sovereign and in consequence two general wills one general in relation to all the citizens the other only for the members of the administration thus although the government may regulate its internal policy as it pleases it can never speak to the people save  0 in the name of the sovereign that is of the people itself a fact which must not be forgotten the first societies governed themselves aristocratically the heads of families took counsel together on public affairs the young bowed without question to the authority of experience hence such names as priests elders senate and gerontes the savages of north america govern themselves in this way even now and their government is admirable but in proportion as artificial inequality produced by institutions became predominant over natural inequality riches or power  were put before age and aristocracy became elective finally the transmission of the fathers power along with his goods to his children by creating patrician families made government hereditary and there came to be senators of twenty there are then three sorts of aristocracy—natural elective and hereditary the first is only for simple peoples the third is the worst of all governments the second is the best and is aristocracy properly so called besides the advantage that lies in the distinction between the two powers it presents that of its members being chosen for in popular government all the citizens are born magistrates but here magistracy is confined to a few who become such only by election  by this means uprightness understanding experience and all other claims to preeminence and public esteem become so many further guarantees of wise government moreover assemblies are more easily held affairs better discussed and carried out with more order and diligence and the credit of the state is better sustained abroad by venerable senators than by a multitude that is unknown or despised in a word it is the best and most natural arrangement    that the wisest should govern the many when it is assured that they will govern for its profit and not for their own there is no need to multiply instruments or get twenty thousand men to do what a hundred picked men can do even better but it must not be forgotten that corporate interest here begins to direct the public power less under the regulation of the general will and that a further inevitable propensity takes away from the laws part of the executive power if we are to speak of what is individually desirable neither should the state be so small nor a people so simple and upright that the execution of the laws follows immediately from the public will as it does in a good democracy nor should the nation be so great that the rulers have to scatter in order to govern it and are able to play the sovereign each in his own department and beginning by making themselves independent end by becoming masters but if aristocracy does not demand all the virtues needed by popular government it demands others which are peculiar to itself for instance moderation on the side of the rich and contentment on that of the poor for it seems that thoroughgoing equality would be out of place as it was not found even at sparta furthermore if this form of government carries with it a certain inequality of fortune this is justifiable in order that as a rule the administration of public affairs may be entrusted to those who are most able to give them their whole time but not as aristotle maintains in order that the rich may always be put first on the contrary it is of importance that an opposite choice should occasionally teach the people that the deserts of men offer claims to preeminence more important than those of riches chapter vi monarchy so far we have considered the prince as a moral and collective person unified by the force of the laws and the depositary in the state of the executive power we have    now to consider this power when it is gathered together into the hands of a natural person a real man who alone has the right to dispose of it in accordance with the laws such a person is called a monarch or king in contrast with other forms of administration in which a collective being stands for an individual in this form an individual stands for a collective being so that the moral unity that constitutes the prince is at the same time a physical unity and all the qualities which in the other case are only with difficulty brought together by the law are found naturally united thus the will of the people the will of the prince the public force of the state and the particular force of the government all answer to a single motive power all the springs of the machine are in the same hands the whole moves towards the same end there are no conflicting movements to cancel one another and no kind of constitution can be imagined in which a less amount of effort produces a more considerable amount of action archimedes seated quietly on the bank and easily drawing a great vessel afloat stands to my mind for a skilful monarch governing vast states from his study and moving everything while he seems himself unmoved but if no government is more vigorous than this there is also none in which the particular will holds more sway and rules the rest more easily everything moves towards the same end indeed but this end is by no means that of the public happiness and even the force of the administration constantly shows itself prejudicial to the state kings desire to be absolute and men are always crying out to them from afar that the best means of being so is to get themselves loved by their people this precept is all very well and even in some respects very true unfortunately it will always be derided at court the power which comes of a peoples love is no doubt the greatest but it is precarious and conditional and princes will never rest content with it the best kings desire to be in a position to be wicked if they please without forfeiting their mastery political sermonisers may tell them to their hearts content that the peoples strength being their own their first interest is that the people should be prosperous numerous and formidable they are well aware that    this is untrue their first personal interest is that the people should be weak wretched and unable to resist them i admit that provided the subjects remained always in submission the princes interest would indeed be that it should be powerful in order that its power being his own might make him formidable to his neighbours but this interest being merely secondary and subordinate and strength being incompatible with submission princes naturally give the preference always to the principle that is more to their immediate advantage this is what samuel put strongly before the hebrews and what macchiavelli has clearly shown he professed to teach kings but it was the people he really taught his prince is the book of republicans  we found on general grounds that monarchy is suitable only for great states and this is confirmed when we examine it in itself the more numerous the public administration the smaller becomes the relation between the prince and the subjects and the nearer it comes to equality so that in democracy the ratio is unity or absolute equality again as the government is restricted in numbers the ratio increases and reaches its maximum when the government is in the hands of a single person there is then too great a distance between prince and people and the state lacks a bond of union to form such a bond there must be intermediate orders and princes personages and nobility to compose them but no such things suit a small state to which all class differences mean ruin if however it is hard for a great state to be well governed it is much harder for it to be so by a single man and every one knows what happens when kings substitute others for themselves an essential and inevitable defect which will always    rank monarchical below republican government is that in a republic the public voice hardly ever raises to the highest positions men who are not enlightened and capable and such as to fill them with honour while in monarchies those who rise to the top are most often merely petty blunderers petty swindlers and petty intriguers whose petty talents cause them to get into the highest positions at court but as soon as they have got there serve only to make their ineptitude clear to the public the people is far less often mistaken in its choice than the prince and a man of real worth among the kings ministers is almost as rare as a fool at the head of a republican government thus when by some fortunate chance one of these born governors takes the helm of state in some monarchy that has been nearly overwhelmed by swarms of gentlemanly administrators there is nothing but amazement at the resources he discovers and his coming marks an era in his countrys history for a monarchical state to have a chance of being well governed its population and extent must be proportionate to the abilities of its governor it is easier to conquer than to rule with a long enough lever the world could be moved with a single finger to sustain it needs the shoulders of hercules however small a state may be the prince is hardly ever big enough for it when on the other hand it happens that the state is too small for its ruler in these rare cases too it is ill governed because the ruler constantly pursuing his great designs forgets the interests of the people and makes it no less wretched by misusing the talents he has than a ruler of less capacity would make it for want of those he had not a kingdom should so to speak expand or contract with each reign according to the princes capabilities but the abilities of a senate being more constant in quantity the state can then have permanent frontiers without the administration suffering the disadvantage that is most felt in monarchical government is the want of the continuous succession which in both the other forms provides an unbroken bond of union when one king dies another is needed elections leave dangerous intervals and are full of storms and unless the citizens are disinterested and upright to a    degree which very seldom goes with this kind of government intrigue and corruption abound he to whom the state has sold itself can hardly help selling it in his turn and repaying himself at the expense of the weak the money the powerful have wrung from him under such an administration venality sooner or later spreads through every part and peace so enjoyed under a king is worse than the disorders of an interregnum what has been done to prevent these evils crowns have been made hereditary in certain families and an order of succession has been set up to prevent disputes from arising on the death of kings that is to say the disadvantages of regency have been put in place of those of election apparent tranquillity has been preferred to wise administration and men have chosen rather to risk having children monstrosities or imbeciles as rulers to having disputes over the choice of good kings it has not been taken into account that in so exposing ourselves to the risks this possibility entails we are setting almost all the chances against us there was sound sense in what the younger dionysius said to his father who reproached him for doing some shameful deed by asking did i set you the example no answered his son but your father was not king everything conspires to take away from a man who is set in authority over others the sense of justice and reason much trouble we are told is taken to teach young princes the art of reigning but their education seems to do them no good it would be better to begin by teaching them the art of obeying the greatest kings whose praises history tells were not brought up to reign reigning is a science we are never so far from possessing as when we have learnt too much of it and one we acquire better by obeying than by commanding nam utilissimus idem ac brevissimus bonarum malarumque rerum delectus cogitare quid aut nolueris sub alio principe aut volueris  one result of this lack of coherence is the inconstancy of royal government which regulated now on one scheme    and now on another according to the character of the reigning prince or those who reign for him cannot for long have a fixed object or a consistent policy—and this variability not found in the other forms of government where the prince is always the same causes the state to be always shifting from principle to principle and from project to project thus we may say that generally if a court is more subtle in intrigue there is more wisdom in a senate and republics advance towards their ends by more consistent and better considered policies while every revolution in a royal ministry creates a revolution in the state for the principle common to all ministers and nearly all kings is to do in every respect the reverse of what was done by their predecessors this incoherence further clears up a sophism that is very familiar to royalist political writers not only is civil government likened to domestic government and the prince to the father of a family—this error has already been refuted—but the prince is also freely credited with all the virtues he ought to possess and is supposed to be always what he should be this supposition once made royal government is clearly preferable to all others because it is incontestably the strongest and to be the best also wants only a corporate will more in conformity with the general will but if according to plato  the king by nature is such a rarity how often will nature and fortune conspire to give him a crown and if royal education necessarily corrupts those who receive it what is to be hoped from a series of men brought up to reign it is then wanton selfdeception to confuse royal government with government by a good king to see such government as it is in itself we must consider it as it is under princes who are incompetent or wicked for either they will come to the throne wicked or incompetent or the throne will make them so these difficulties have not escaped our writers who all the same are not troubled by them the remedy they say is to obey without a murmur god sends bad kings in his wrath and they must be borne as the scourges of    heaven such talk is doubtless edifying but it would be more in place in a pulpit than in a political book what are we to think of a doctor who promises miracles and whose whole art is to exhort the sufferer to patience we know for ourselves that we must put up with a bad government when it is there the question is how to find a good one chapter vii mixed governments strictly speaking there is no such thing as a simple government an isolated ruler must have subordinate magistrates a popular government must have a head there is therefore in the distribution of the executive power always a gradation from the greater to the lesser number with the difference that sometimes the greater number is dependent on the smaller and sometimes the smaller on the greater sometimes the distribution is equal when either the constituent parts are in mutual dependence as in the government of england or the authority of each section is independent but imperfect as in poland this last form is bad for it secures no unity in the government and the state is left without a bond of union is a simple or a mixed government the better political writers are always debating the question which must be answered as we have already answered a question about all forms of government simple government is better in itself just because it is simple but when the executive power is not sufficiently dependent upon the legislative power i e when the prince is more closely related to the sovereign than the people to the prince this lack of proportion must be cured by the division of the government for all the parts have then no less authority over the subjects while their division makes them all together less strong against the sovereign the same disadvantage is also prevented by the appointment of intermediate magistrates who leave the government entire and have the effect only of balancing the    two powers and maintaining their respective rights government is then not mixed but moderated the opposite disadvantages may be similarly cured and when the government is too lax tribunals may be set up to concentrate it this is done in all democracies in the first case the government is divided to make it weak in the second to make it strong for the maxima of both strength and weakness are found in simple governments while the mixed forms result in a mean strength chapter viii that all forms of government do not suit all countries liberty not being a fruit of all climates is not within the reach of all peoples the more this principle laid down by montesquieu is considered the more its truth is felt the more it is combated the more chance is given to confirm it by new proofs in all the governments that there are the public person consumes without producing whence then does it get what it consumes from the labour of its members the necessities of the public are supplied out of the superfluities of individuals it follows that the civil state can subsist only so long as mens labour brings them a return greater than their needs the amount of this excess is not the same in all countries in some it is considerable in others middling in yet others nil in some even negative the relation of product to subsistence depends on the fertility of the climate on the sort of labour the land demands on the nature of its products on the strength of its inhabitants on the greater or less consumption they find necessary and on several further considerations of which the whole relation is made up on the other side all governments are not of the same nature some are less voracious than others and the differences between them are based on this second principle that the further from their source the public contributions are removed the more burdensome they become    the charge should be measured not by the amount of the impositions but by the path they have to travel in order to get back to those from whom they came when the circulation is prompt and wellestablished it does not matter whether much or little is paid the people is always rich and financially speaking all is well on the contrary however little the people gives if that little does not return to it it is soon exhausted by giving continually the state is then never rich and the people is always a people of beggars it follows that the more the distance between people and government increases the more burdensome tribute becomes thus in a democracy the people bears the least charge in an aristocracy a greater charge and in monarchy the weight becomes heaviest monarchy therefore suits only wealthy nations aristocracy states of middling size and wealth and democracy states that are small and poor ⚓ ✪ in fact the more we reflect the more we find the difference between free and monarchical states to be this in the former everything is used for the public advantage in the latter the public forces and those of individuals are affected by each other and either increases as the other grows weak finally instead of governing subjects to make them happy despotism makes them wretched in order to govern them we find then in every climate natural causes according to which the form of government which it requires can be assigned and we can even say what sort of inhabitants it should have unfriendly and barren lands where the product does not repay the labour should remain desert and uncultivated or peopled only by savages lands where mens labour brings in no more than the exact minimum necessary to subsistence should be inhabited by barbarous peoples in such places all polity is impossible lands where the surplus of product over labour is only middling are suitable for free peoples those in which the soil is abundant and fertile and gives a great product for a little labour call for monarchical government in order that the surplus of superfluities among the subjects may be consumed by the luxury of the prince for it is better for this  0 excess to be absorbed by the government than dissipated among the individuals i am aware that there are exceptions but these exceptions themselves confirm the rule in that sooner or later they produce revolutions which restore things to the natural order general laws should always be distinguished from individual causes that may modify their effects if all the south were covered with republics and all the north with despotic states it would be none the less true that in point of climate despotism is suitable to hot countries barbarism to cold countries and good polity to temperate regions i see also that the principle being granted there may be disputes on its application it may be said that there are cold countries that are very fertile and tropical countries that are very unproductive but this difficulty exists only for those who do not consider the question in all its aspects we must as i have already said take labour strength consumption etc into account take two tracts of equal extent one of which brings in five and the other ten if the inhabitants of the first consume four and those of the second nine the surplus of the first product will be a fifth and that of the second a tenth the ratio of these two surpluses will then be inverse to that of the products and the tract which produces only five will give a surplus double that of the tract which produces ten but there is no question of a double product and i think no one would put the fertility of cold countries as a general rule on an equality with that of hot ones let us however suppose this equality to exist let us if you will regard england as on the same level as sicily and poland as egypt—further south we shall have africa and the indies further north nothing at all to get this equality of product what a difference there must be in tillage in sicily there is only need to scratch the ground in england how men must toil but where more hands are needed to get the same product the superfluity must necessarily be less consider besides that the same number of men consume much less in hot countries the climate requires sobriety for the sake of health and europeans who try to    live there as they would at home all perish of dysentery and indigestion we are says chardin carnivorous animals wolves in comparison with the asiatics some attribute the sobriety of the persians to the fact that their country is less cultivated but it is my belief that their country abounds less in commodities because the inhabitants need less if their frugality he goes on were the effect of the nakedness of the land only the poor would eat little but everybody does so again less or more would be eaten in various provinces according to the lands fertility but the same sobriety is found throughout the kingdom they are very proud of their manner of life saying that you have only to look at their hue to recognise how far it excels that of the christians in fact the persians are of an even hue their skins are fair fine and smooth while the hue of their subjects the armenians who live after the european fashion is rough and blotchy and their bodies are gross and unwieldy the nearer you get to the equator the less people live on meat they hardly touch rice maize curcur millet and cassava are their ordinary food there are in the indies millions of men whose subsistence does not cost a halfpenny a day even in europe we find considerable differences of appetite between northern and southern peoples a spaniard will live for a week on a germans dinner in the countries in which men are more voracious luxury therefore turns in the direction of consumption in england luxury appears in a wellfilled table in italy you feast on sugar and flowers luxury in clothes shows similar differences in climates in which the changes of season are prompt and violent men have better and simpler clothes where they clothe themselves only for adornment what is striking is more thought of than what is useful clothes themselves are then a luxury at naples you may see daily walking in the pausilippeum men in goldembroidered upper garments and nothing else it is the same with buildings magnificence is the sole consideration where there is nothing to fear from the air in paris and london you desire to be lodged warmly and comfortably in madrid you have superb salons but not a window that closes and you go to bed in a mere hole    in hot countries foods are much more substantial and succulent and the third difference cannot but have an influence on the second why are so many vegetables eaten in italy because there they are good nutritious and excellent in taste in france where they are nourished only on water they are far from nutritious and are thought nothing of at table they take up all the same no less ground and cost at least as much pains to cultivate it is a proved fact that the wheat of barbary in other respects inferior to that of france yields much more flour and that the wheat of france in turn yields more than that of northern countries from which it may be inferred that a like gradation in the same direction from equator to pole is found generally but is it not an obvious disadvantage for an equal product to contain less nourishment to all these points may be added another which at once depends on and strengthens them hot countries need inhabitants less than cold countries and can support more of them there is thus a double surplus which is all to the advantage of despotism the greater the territory occupied by a fixed number of inhabitants the more difficult revolt becomes because rapid or secret concerted action is impossible and the government can easily unmask projects and cut communications but the more a numerous people is gathered together the less can the government usurp the sovereigns place the peoples leaders can deliberate as safely in their houses as the prince in council and the crowd gathers as rapidly in the squares as the princes troops in their quarters the advantage of tyrannical government therefore lies in acting at great distances with the help of the rallyingpoints it establishes its strength like that of the lever  grows with distance the strength of the people on the other hand acts only when concentrated when spread abroad    it evaporates and is lost like powder scattered on the ground which catches fire only grain by grain the least populous countries are thus the fittest for tyranny fierce animals reign only in deserts chapter ix the marks of a good government the question what absolutely is the best government is unanswerable as well as indeterminate or rather there are as many good answers as there are possible combinations in the absolute and relative situations of all nations but if it is asked by what sign we may know that a given people is well or ill governed that is another matter and the question being one of fact admits of an answer it is not however answered because everyone wants to answer it in his own way subjects extol public tranquillity citizens individual liberty the one class prefers security of possessions the other that of person the one regards as the best government that which is most severe the other maintains that the mildest is the best the one wants crimes punished the other wants them prevented the one wants the state to be feared by its neighbours the other prefers that it should be ignored the one is content if money circulates the other demands that the people shall have bread even if an agreement were come to on these and similar points should we have got any further as moral qualities do not admit of exact measurement agreement about the mark does not mean agreement about the valuation for my part i am continually astonished that a mark so simple is not recognised or that men are of so bad faith as not to admit it what is the end of political association the preservation and prosperity of its members and what is the surest mark of their preservation and prosperity their numbers and population seek then nowhere else this mark that is in dispute the rest being equal the government under which without external aids without naturalisation or colonies the    citizens increase and multiply most is beyond question the best the government under which a people wanes and diminishes is the worst calculators it is left for you to count to measure to compare  chapter x the abuse of government and its tendency to degenerate as the particular will acts constantly in opposition to the general will the government continually exerts itself against the sovereignty the greater this exertion becomes the more the constitution changes and as there is in this case no other corporate will to create an equilibrium    by resisting the will of the prince sooner or later the prince must inevitably suppress the sovereign and break the social treaty this is the unavoidable and inherent defect which from the very birth of the body politic tends ceaselessly to destroy it as age and death end by destroying the human body there are two general courses by which government degenerates i e when it undergoes contraction or when the state is dissolved government undergoes contraction when it passes from the many to the few that is from democracy to aristocracy and from aristocracy to royalty to do so is its natural propensity  if it took the backward course from    the few to the many it could be said that it was relaxed by this inverse sequence is impossible indeed governments never change their form except when their energy is exhausted and leaves them too weak to keep what they have if a government at once extended its sphere and relaxed its stringency its force would become absolutely nil and it would persist still less it is therefore necessary to wind up the spring and tighten the hold as it gives way or else the state it sustains will come to grief the dissolution of the state may come about in either of two ways first when the prince ceases to administer the state in accordance with the laws and usurps the sovereign power a remarkable change then occurs not the government but the state undergoes contraction i mean that the great state is dissolved and another is formed within it composed solely of the members of the government which becomes for the rest of the people merely master and tyrant so that the moment the government usurps the sovereignty the social compact is broken and all private citizens recover by right their natural liberty and are forced but not bound to obey the same thing happens when the members of the government severally usurp the power they should exercise only as a body this is as great an infraction of the laws and results in even greater disorders there are then so to speak as many princes as there are magistrates and the state no less divided than the government either perishes or changes its form when the state is dissolved the abuse of government whatever it is bears the common name of anarchy to distinguish democracy degenerates into ochlocracy and aristocracy into oligarchy and i would add that royalty degenerates into tyranny but this last word is ambiguous and needs explanation in vulgar usage a tyrant is a king who governs violently and without regard for justice and law in the exact sense a tyrant is an individual who arrogates to himself    the royal authority without having a right to it this is how the greeks understood the word tyrant they applied it indifferently to good and bad princes whose authority was not legitimate  tyrant and usurper are thus perfectly synonymous terms in order that i may give different things different names i call him who usurps the royal authority a tyrant and him who usurps the sovereign power a despot the tyrant is he who thrusts himself in contrary to the laws to govern in accordance with the laws the despot is he who sets himself above the laws themselves thus the tyrant cannot be a despot but the despot is always a tyrant chapter xi the death of the body politic such is the natural and inevitable tendency of the best constituted governments if sparta and rome perished what state can hope to endure for ever if we would set up a longlived form of government let us not even dream of making it eternal if we are to succeed we must not attempt the impossible or flatter ourselves that we are endowing the work of man with a stability of which human conditions do not permit the body politic as well as the human body begins to die as soon as it is born and carries in itself the causes of its destruction but both may have a constitution that is more or less robust and suited to preserve them a longer or a shorter time the constitution of man is the work of nature that of the state the work of art it is not in    mens power to prolong their own lives but it is for them to prolong as much as possible the life of the state by giving it the best possible constitution the best constituted state will have an end but it will end later than any other unless some unforeseen accident brings about its untimely destruction the lifeprinciple of the body politic lies in the sovereign authority the legislative power is the heart of the state the executive power is its brain which causes the movement of all the parts the brain may become paralysed and the individual still live a man may remain an imbecile and live but as soon as the heart ceases to perform its functions the animal is dead the state subsists by means not of the laws but of the legislative power yesterdays law is not binding today but silence is taken for tacit consent and the sovereign is held to confirm incessantly the laws it does not abrogate as it might all that it has once declared itself to will it wills always unless it revokes its declaration why then is so much respect paid to old laws for this very reason we must believe that nothing but the excellence of old acts of will can have preserved them so long if the sovereign had not recognised them as throughout salutary it would have revoked them a thousand times this is why so far from growing weak the laws continually gain new strength in any well constituted state the precedent of antiquity makes them daily more venerable while wherever the laws grow weak as they become old this proves that there is no longer a legislative power and that the state is dead chapter xii how the sovereign authority maintains itself the sovereign having no force other than the legislative power acts only by means of the laws and the laws being solely the authentic acts of the general will the sovereign cannot act save when the people is assembled the people in assembly i shall be told is    a mere chimera it is so today but two thousand years ago it was not so has mans nature changed the bounds of possibility in moral matters are less narrow than we imagine it is our weaknesses our vices and our prejudices that confine them base souls have no belief in great men vile slaves smile in mockery at the name of liberty let us judge of what can be done by what has been done i shall say nothing of the republics of ancient greece but the roman republic was to my mind a great state and the town of rome a great town the last census showed that there were in rome four hundred thousand citizens capable of bearing arms and the last computation of the population of the empire showed over four million citizens excluding subjects foreigners women children and slaves what difficulties might not be supposed to stand in the way of the frequent assemblage of the vast population of this capital and its neighbourhood yet few weeks passed without the roman people being in assembly and even being so several times it exercised not only the rights of sovereignty but also a part of those of government it dealt with certain matters and judged certain cases and this whole people was found in the public meetingplace hardly less often as magistrates than as citizens if we went back to the earliest history of nations we should find that most ancient governments even those of monarchical form such as the macedonian and the frankish had similar councils in any case the one incontestable fact i have given is an answer to all difficulties it is good logic to reason from the actual to the possible chapter xiii the same continued it is not enough for the assembled people to have once fixed the constitution of the state by giving its sanction to a body of law it is not enough for it to have set up a perpetual government or provided once for all for the  0 election of magistrates besides the extraordinary assemblies unforeseen circumstances may demand there must be fixed periodical assemblies which cannot be abrogated or prorogued so that on the proper day the people is legitimately called together by law without need of any formal summoning but apart from these assemblies authorised by their date alone every assembly of the people not summoned by the magistrates appointed for that purpose and in accordance with the prescribed forms should be regarded as unlawful and all its acts as null and void because the command to assemble should itself proceed from the law the greater or less frequency with which lawful assemblies should occur depends on so many considerations that no exact rules about them can be given it can only be said generally that the stronger the government the more often should the sovereign show itself this i shall be told may do for a single town but what is to be done when the state includes several is the sovereign authority to be divided or is it to be concentrated in a single town to which all the rest are made subject neither the one nor the other i reply first the sovereign authority is one and simple and cannot be divided without being destroyed in the second place one town cannot any more than one nation legitimately be made subject to another because the essence of the body politic lies in the reconciliation of obedience and liberty and the words subject and sovereign are identical correlatives the idea of which meets in the single word citizen i answer further that the union of several towns in a single city is always bad and that if we wish to make such a union we should not expect to avoid its natural disadvantages it is useless to bring up abuses that belong to great states against one who desires to see only small ones but how can small states be given the strength to resist great ones as formerly the greek towns resisted the great king and more recently holland and switzerland have resisted the house of austria nevertheless if the state cannot be reduced to the right limits there remains still one resource this is to allow no capital to make the seat of government move from    town to town and to assemble by turn in each the provincial estates of the country people the territory evenly extend everywhere the same rights bear to every place in it abundance and life by these means will the state become at once as strong and as well governed as possible remember that the walls of towns are built of the ruins of the houses of the countryside for every palace i see raised in the capital my minds eye sees a whole country made desolate chapter xiv the same continued the moment the people is legitimately assembled as a sovereign body the jurisdiction of the government wholly lapses the executive power is suspended and the person of the meanest citizen is as sacred and inviolable as that of the first magistrate for in the presence of the person represented representatives no longer exist most of the tumults that arose in the comitia at rome were due to ignorance or neglect of this rule the consuls were in them merely the presidents of the people the tribunes were mere speakers  the senate was nothing at all these intervals of suspension during which the prince recognises or ought to recognise an actual superior have always been viewed by him with alarm and these assemblies of the people which are the aegis of the body politic and the curb on the government have at all times been the horror of rulers who therefore never spare pains objections difficulties and promises to stop the citizens from having them when the citizens are greedy cowardly and pusillanimous and love ease more than liberty they do not long hold out against the redoubled efforts of the government and thus as the resisting force incessantly grows the sovereign authority ends by disappearing and most cities fall and perish before their time    but between the sovereign authority and arbitrary government there sometimes intervenes a mean power of which something must be said chapter xv deputies or representatives as soon as public service ceases to be the chief business of the citizens and they would rather serve with their money than with their persons the state is not far from its fall when it is necessary to march out to war they pay troops and stay at home when it is necessary to meet in council they name deputies and stay at home by reason of idleness and money they end by having soldiers to enslave their country and representatives to sell it it is through the hustle of commerce and the arts through the greedy selfinterest of profit and through softness and love of amenities that personal services are replaced by money payments men surrender a part of their profits in order to have time to increase them at leisure make gifts of money and you will not be long without chains the word finance is a slavish word unknown in the citystate in a country that is truly free the citizens do everything with their own arms and nothing by means of money so far from paying to be exempted from their duties they would even pay for the privilege of fulfilling them themselves i am far from taking the common view i hold enforced labour to be less opposed to liberty than taxes the better the constitution of a state is the more do public affairs encroach on private in the minds of the citizens private affairs are even of much less importance because the aggregate of the common happiness furnishes a greater proportion of that of each individual so that there is less for him to seek in particular cares in a wellordered city every man flies to the assemblies under a bad government no one cares to stir a step to get to them because no one is interested in what happens there because it is foreseen that the general will will not prevail and lastly    because domestic cares are allabsorbing good laws lead to the making of better ones bad ones bring about worse as soon as any man says of the affairs of the state what does it matter to me the state may be given up for lost the lukewarmness of patriotism the activity of private interest the vastness of states conquest and the abuse of government suggested the method of having deputies or representatives of the people in the national assemblies these are what in some countries men have presumed to call the third estate thus the individual interest of two orders is put first and second the public interest occupies only the third place sovereignty for the same reason as makes it inalienable cannot be represented it lies essentially in the general will and will does not admit of representation it is either the same or other there is no intermediate possibility the deputies of the people therefore are not and cannot be its representatives they are merely its stewards and can carry through no definitive acts every law the people has not ratified in person is null and void—is in fact not a law the people of england regards itself as free but it is grossly mistaken it is free only during the election of members of parliament as soon as they are elected slavery overtakes it and it is nothing the use it makes of the short moments of liberty it enjoys shows indeed that it deserves to lose them the idea of representation is modern it comes to us from feudal government from that iniquitous and absurd system which degrades humanity and dishonours the name of man in ancient republics and even in monarchies the people never had representatives the word itself was unknown it is very singular that in rome where the tribunes were so sacrosanct it was never even imagined that they could usurp the functions of the people and that in the midst of so great a multitude they never attempted to pass on their own authority a single plebiscitum we can however form an idea of the difficulties caused sometimes by the people being so numerous from what happened in the time of the gracchi when some of the citizens had to cast their votes from the roofs of buildings    where right and liberty are everything disadvantages count for nothing among this wise people everything was given its just value its lictors were allowed to do what its tribunes would never have dared to attempt for it had no fear that its lictors would try to represent it to explain however in what way the tribunes did sometimes represent it it is enough to conceive how the government represents the sovereign law being purely the declaration of the general will it is clear that in the exercise of the legislative power the people cannot be represented but in that of the executive power which is only the force that is applied to give the law effect it both can and should be represented we thus see that if we looked closely into the matter we should find that very few nations have any laws however that may be it is certain that the tribunes possessing no executive power could never represent the roman people by right of the powers entrusted to them but only by usurping those of the senate in greece all that the people had to do it did for itself it was constantly assembled in the public square the greeks lived in a mild climate they had no natural greed slaves did their work for them their great concern was with liberty lacking the same advantages how can you preserve the same rights your severer climates add to your needs  for half the year your public squares are uninhabitable the flatness of your languages unfits them for being heard in the open air you sacrifice more for profit than for liberty and fear slavery less than poverty what then is liberty maintained only by the help of slavery it may be so extremes meet everything that is not in the course of nature has its disadvantages civil society most of all there are some unhappy circumstances in which we can only keep our liberty at others expense and where the citizen can be perfectly free only when the slave is most a slave such was the case with sparta as for you modern peoples you have no slaves but you are slaves yourselves you pay for their    liberty with your own it is in vain that you boast of this preference i find in it more cowardice than humanity i do not mean by all this that it is necessary to have slaves or that the right of slavery is legitimate i am merely giving the reasons why modern peoples believing themselves to be free have representatives while ancient peoples had none in any case the moment a people allows itself to be represented it is no longer free it no longer exists all things considered i do not see that it is possible henceforth for the sovereign to preserve among us the exercise of its rights unless the city is very small but if it is very small it will be conquered no i will show later on how the external strength of a great people  may be combined with the convenient polity and good order of a small state chapter xvi that the institution of government is not a contract the legislative power once well established the next thing is to establish similarly the executive power for this latter which operates only by particular acts not being of the essence of the former is naturally separate from it were it possible for the sovereign as such to possess the executive power right and fact would be so confounded that no one could tell what was law and what was not and the body politic thus disfigured would soon fall a prey to the violence it was instituted to prevent as the citizens by the social contract are all equal all can prescribe what all should do but no one has a right to demand that another shall do what he does not do himself it is strictly this right which is indispensable for giving the body politic life and movement that the sovereign in instituting the government confers upon the prince    it has been held that this act of establishment was a contract between the people and the rulers it sets over itself—a contract in which conditions were laid down between the two parties binding the one to command and the other to obey it will be admitted i am sure that this is an odd kind of contract to enter into but let us see if this view can be upheld first the supreme authority can no more be modified than it can be alienated to limit it is to destroy it it is absurd and contradictory for the sovereign to set a superior over itself to bind itself to obey a master would be to return to absolute liberty moreover it is clear that this contract between the people and such and such persons would be a particular act and from this it follows that it can be neither a law nor an act of sovereignty and that consequently it would be illegitimate it is plain too that the contracting parties in relation to each other would be under the law of nature alone and wholly without guarantees of their mutual undertakings a position wholly at variance with the civil state he who has force at his command being always in a position to control execution it would come to the same thing if the name contract were given to the act of one man who said to another i give you all my goods on condition that you give me back as much of them as you please there is only one contract in the state and that is the act of association which in itself excludes the existence of a second it is impossible to conceive of any public contract that would not be a violation of the first chapter xvii the institution of government under what general idea then should the act by which government is instituted be conceived as falling i will begin by stating that the act is complex as being composed of two others—the establishment of the law and its execution by the former the sovereign decrees that there shall    be a governing body established in this or that form this act is clearly a law by the latter the people nominates the rulers who are to be entrusted with the government that has been established this nomination being a particular act is clearly not a second law but merely a consequence of the first and a function of government the difficulty is to understand how there can be a governmental act before government exists and how the people which is only sovereign or subject can under certain circumstances become a prince or magistrate it is at this point that there is revealed one of the astonishing properties of the body politic by means of which it reconciles apparently contradictory operations for this is accomplished by a sudden conversion of sovereignty into democracy so that without sensible change and merely by virtue of a new relation of all to all the citizens become magistrates and pass from general to particular acts from legislation to the execution of the law this changed relation is no speculative subtlety without instances in practice it happens every day in the english parliament where on certain occasions the lower house resolves itself into grand committee for the better discussion of affairs and thus from being at one moment a sovereign court becomes at the next a mere commission so that subsequently it reports to itself as house of commons the result of its proceedings in grand committee and debates over again under one name what it has already settled under another it is indeed the peculiar advantage of democratic government that it can be established in actuality by a simple act of the general will subsequently this provisional government remains in power if this form is adopted or else establishes in the name of the sovereign the government that is prescribed by law and thus the whole proceeding is regular it is impossible to set up government in any other manner legitimately and in accordance with the principles so far laid down    chapter xviii how to check the usurpations of government what we have just said confirms chapter xvi and makes it clear that the institution of government is not a contract but a law that the depositaries of the executive power are not the peoples masters but its officers that it can set them up and pull them down when it likes that for them there is no question of contract but of obedience and that in taking charge of the functions the state imposes on them they are doing no more than fulfilling their duty as citizens without having the remotest right to argue about the conditions when therefore the people sets up an hereditary government whether it be monarchical and confined to one family or aristocratic and confined to a class what it enters into is not an undertaking the administration is given a provisional form until the people chooses to order it otherwise it is true that such changes are always dangerous and that the established government should never be touched except when it comes to be incompatible with the public good but the circumspection this involves is a maxim of policy and not a rule of right and the state is no more bound to leave civil authority in the hands of its rulers than military authority in the hands of its generals it is also true that it is impossible to be too careful to observe in such cases all the formalities necessary to distinguish a regular and legitimate act from a seditious tumult and the will of a whole people from the clamour of a faction here above all no further concession should be made to the untoward possibility than cannot in the strictest logic be refused it from this obligation the prince derives a great advantage in preserving his power despite the people without it being possible to say he has usurped it for seeming to avail himself only of his rights he finds it very easy to extend them and to prevent under the pretext of keeping the peace assemblies that are destined to the reestablishment of order with the result that he takes advantage of a silence he does not allow to    be broken or of irregularities he causes to be committed to assume that he has the support of those whom fear prevents from speaking and to punish those who dare to speak thus it was that the decemvirs first elected for one year and then kept on in office for a second tried to perpetuate their power by forbidding the comitia to assemble and by this easy method every government in the world once clothed with the public power sooner or later usurps the sovereign authority the periodical assemblies of which i have already spoken are designed to prevent or postpone this calamity above all when they need no formal summoning for in that case the prince cannot stop them without openly declaring himself a lawbreaker and an enemy of the state the opening of these assemblies whose sole object is the maintenance of the social treaty should always take the form of putting two propositions that may not be suppressed which should be voted on separately the first is does it please the sovereign to preserve the present form of government the second is does it please the people to leave its administration in the hands of those who are actually in charge of it i am here assuming what i think i have shown that there is in the state no fundamental law that cannot be revoked not excluding the social compact itself for if all the citizens assembled of one accord to break the compact it is impossible to doubt that it would be very legitimately broken grotius even thinks that each man can renounce his membership of his own state and recover his natural liberty and his goods on leaving the country  it would be indeed absurd if all the citizens in assembly could not do what each can do by himself  0 book iv chapter i that the general will is indestructible as long as several men in assembly regard themselves as a single body they have only a single will which is concerned with their common preservation and general wellbeing in this case all the springs of the state are vigorous and simple and its rules clear and luminous there are no embroilments or conflicts of interests the common good is everywhere clearly apparent and only good sense is needed to perceive it peace unity and equality are the enemies of political subtleties men who are upright and simple are difficult to deceive because of their simplicity lures and ingenious pretexts fail to impose upon them and they are not even subtle enough to be dupes when among the happiest people in the world bands of peasants are seen regulating affairs of state under an oak and always acting wisely can we help scorning the ingenious methods of other nations which make themselves illustrious and wretched with so much art and mystery a state so governed needs very few laws and as it becomes necessary to issue new ones the necessity is universally seen the first man to propose them merely says what all have already felt and there is no question of factions or intrigues or eloquence in order to secure the passage into law of what every one has already decided to do as soon as he is sure that the rest will act with him theorists are led into error because seeing only states that have been from the beginning wrongly constituted they are struck by the impossibility of applying such a policy to them they make great game of all the absurdities a clever rascal or an insinuating speaker might get the people of paris or london to believe they do not know that cromwell would have been put to the bells by the people of berne and the duc de beaufort on the treadmill by the genevese    but when the social bond begins to be relaxed and the state to grow weak when particular interests begin to make themselves felt and the smaller societies to exercise an influence over the larger the common interest changes and finds opponents opinion is no longer unanimous the general will ceases to be the will of all contradictory views and debates arise and the best advice is not taken without question finally when the state on the eve of ruin maintains only a vain illusory and formal existence when in every heart the social bond is broken and the meanest interest brazenly lays hold of the sacred name of public good the general will becomes mute all men guided by secret motives no more give their views as citizens than if the state had never been and iniquitous decrees directed solely to private interest get passed under the name of laws does it follow from this that the general will is exterminated or corrupted not at all it is always constant unalterable and pure but it is subordinated to other wills which encroach upon its sphere each man in detaching his interest from the common interest sees clearly that he cannot entirely separate them but his share in the public mishaps seems to him negligible beside the exclusive good he aims at making his own apart from this particular good he wills the general good in his own interest as strongly as any one else even in selling his vote for money he does not extinguish in himself the general will but only eludes it the fault he commits is that of changing the state of the question and answering something different from what he is asked instead of saying by his vote it is to the advantage of the state he says it is of advantage to this or that man or party that this or that view should prevail thus the law of public order in assemblies is not so much to maintain in them the general will as to secure that the question be always put to it and the answer always given by it i could here set down many reflections on the simple right of voting in every act of sovereignty—a right which noone can take from the citizens—and also on the right of stating views making proposals dividing and discussing which the government is always most careful    to leave solely to its members but this important subject would need a treatise to itself and it is impossible to say everything in a single work chapter ii voting it may be seen from the last chapter that the way in which general business is managed may give a clear enough indication of the actual state of morals and the health of the body politic the more concert reigns in the assemblies that is the nearer opinion approaches unanimity the greater is the dominance of the general will on the other hand long debates dissensions and tumult proclaim the ascendancy of particular interests and the decline of the state this seems less clear when two or more orders enter into the constitution as patricians and plebeians did at rome for quarrels between these two orders often disturbed the comitia even in the best days of the republic but the exception is rather apparent than real for then through the defect that is inherent in the body politic there were so to speak two states in one and what is not true of the two together is true of either separately indeed even in the most stormy times the plebiscita of the people when the senate did not interfere with them always went through quietly and by large majorities the citizens having but one interest the people had but a single will at the other extremity of the circle unanimity recurs this is the case when the citizens having fallen into servitude have lost both liberty and will fear and flattery then change votes into acclamation deliberation ceases and only worship or malediction is left such was the vile manner in which the senate expressed its views under the emperors it did so sometimes with absurd precautions tacitus observes that under otho the senators while they heaped curses on vitellius contrived at the same time to make a deafening noise in    order that should he ever become their master he might not know what each of them had said on these various considerations depend the rules by which the methods of counting votes and comparing opinions should be regulated according as the general will is more or less easy to discover and the state more or less in its decline there is but one law which from its nature needs unanimous consent this is the social compact for civil association is the most voluntary of all acts every man being born free and his own master noone under any pretext whatsoever can make any man subject without his consent to decide that the son of a slave is born a slave is to decide that he is not born a man if then there are opponents when the social compact is made their opposition does not invalidate the contract but merely prevents them from being included in it they are foreigners among citizens when the state is instituted residence constitutes consent to dwell within its territory is to submit to the sovereign  apart from this primitive contract the vote of the majority always binds all the rest this follows from the contract itself but it is asked how a man can be both free and forced to conform to wills that are not his own how are the opponents at once free and subject to laws they have not agreed to i retort that the question is wrongly put the citizen gives his consent to all the laws including those which are passed in spite of his opposition and even those which punish him when he dares to break any of them the constant will of all the members of the state is the general will by virtue of it they are citizens and free  when in the popular assembly a law is proposed what the people is asked is not exactly whether it approves or    rejects the proposal but whether it is in conformity with the general will which is their will each man in giving his vote states his opinion on that point and the general will is found by counting votes when therefore the opinion that is contrary to my own prevails this proves neither more nor less than that i was mistaken and that what i thought to be the general will was not so if my particular opinion had carried the day i should have achieved the opposite of what was my will and it is in that case that i should not have been free this presupposes indeed that all the qualities of the general will still reside in the majority when they cease to do so whatever side a man may take liberty is no longer possible in my earlier demonstration of how particular wills are substituted for the general will in public deliberation i have adequately pointed out the practicable methods of avoiding this abuse and i shall have more to say of them later on i have also given the principles for determining the proportional number of votes for declaring that will a difference of one vote destroys equality a single opponent destroys unanimity but between equality and unanimity there are several grades of unequal division at each of which this proportion may be fixed in accordance with the condition and the needs of the body politic there are two general rules that may serve to regulate this relation first the more grave and important the questions discussed the nearer should the opinion that is to prevail approach unanimity secondly the more the matter in hand calls for speed the smaller the prescribed difference in the numbers of votes may be allowed to become where an instant decision has to be reached a majority of one vote should be enough the first of these two rules seems more in harmony with the laws and the second with practical affairs in any case it is the combination of them that gives the best proportions for determining the majority necessary    chapter iii elections in the elections of the prince and the magistrates which are as i have said complex acts there are two possible methods of procedure choice and lot both have been employed in various republics and a highly complicated mixture of the two still survives in the election of the doge at venice election by lot says montesquieu is democratic in nature i agree that it is so but in what sense the lot he goes on is a way of making choice that is unfair to nobody it leaves each citizen a reasonable hope of serving his country these are not reasons if we bear in mind that the election of rulers is a function of government and not of sovereignty we shall see why the lot is the method more natural to democracy in which the administration is better in proportion as the number of its acts is small in every real democracy magistracy is not an advantage but a burdensome charge which cannot justly be imposed on one individual rather than another the law alone can lay the charge on him on whom the lot falls for the conditions being then the same for all and the choice not depending on any human will there is no particular application to alter the universality of the law in an aristocracy the prince chooses the prince the government is preserved by itself and voting is rightly ordered the instance of the election of the doge of venice confirms instead of destroying this distinction the mixed form suits a mixed government for it is an error to take the government of venice for a real aristocracy if the people has no share in the government the nobility is itself the people a host of poor barnabotes never gets near any magistracy and its nobility consists merely in the empty title of excellency and in the right to sit in the great council as this great council is as numerous as our general council at geneva its illustrious members have no more privileges than our plain citizens it is    indisputable that apart from the extreme disparity between the two republics the bourgeoisie of geneva is exactly equivalent to the patriciate of venice our natives and inhabitants correspond to the townsmen and the people of venice our peasants correspond to the subjects on the mainland and however that republic be regarded if its size be left out of account its government is no more aristocratic than our own the whole difference is that having no liferuler we do not like venice need to use the lot election by lot would have few disadvantages in a real democracy in which as equality would everywhere exist in morals and talents as well as in principles and fortunes it would become almost a matter of indifference who was chosen but i have already said that a real democracy is only an ideal when choice and lot are combined positions that require special talents such as military posts should be filled by the former the latter does for cases such as judicial offices in which good sense justice and integrity are enough because in a state that is well constituted these qualities are common to all the citizens neither lot nor vote has any place in monarchical government the monarch being by right sole prince and only magistrate the choice of his lieutenants belongs to none but him when the abbé de saintpierre proposed that the councils of the king of france should be multiplied and their members elected by ballot he did not see that he was proposing to change the form of government i should now speak of the methods of giving and counting opinions in the assembly of the people but perhaps an account of this aspect of the roman constitution will more forcibly illustrate all the rules i could lay down it is worth the while of a judicious reader to follow in some detail the working of public and private affairs in a council consisting of two hundred thousand men    chapter iv the roman comitia we are without wellcertified records of the first period of romes existence it even appears very probable that most of the stories told about it are fables indeed generally speaking the most instructive part of the history of peoples that which deals with their foundation is what we have least of experience teaches us every day what causes lead to the revolutions of empires but as no new peoples are now formed we have almost nothing beyond conjecture to go upon in explaining how they were created the customs we find established show at least that these customs had an origin the traditions that go back to those origins that have the greatest authorities behind them and that are confirmed by the strongest proofs should pass for the most certain these are the rules i have tried to follow in inquiring how the freest and most powerful people on earth exercised its supreme power after the foundation of rome the newborn republic that is the army of its founder composed of albans sabines and foreigners was divided into three classes which from this division took the name of tribes each of these tribes was subdivided into ten curiæ and each curia into decuriæ headed by leaders called curiones and decuriones besides this out of each tribe was taken a body of one hundred equites or knights called a century which shows that these divisions being unnecessary in a town were at first merely military but an instinct for greatness seems to have led the little township of rome to provide itself in advance with a political system suitable for the capital of the world out of this original division an awkward situation soon arose the tribes of the albans ramnenses and the sabines tatienses remained always in the same condition while that of the foreigners luceres continually grew as more and more foreigners came to live at rome so that it soon surpassed the others in strength servius remedied this dangerous fault by changing the principle    of cleavage and substituting for the racial division which he abolished a new one based on the quarter of the town inhabited by each tribe instead of three tribes he created four each occupying and named after one of the hills of rome thus while redressing the inequality of the moment he also provided for the future and in order that the division might be one of persons as well as localities he forbade the inhabitants of one quarter to migrate to another and so prevented the mingling of the races he also doubled the three old centuries of knights and added twelve more still keeping the old names and by this simple and prudent method succeeded in making a distinction between the body of knights and the people without a murmur from the latter to the four urban tribes servius added fifteen others called rural tribes because they consisted of those who lived in the country divided into fifteen cantons subsequently fifteen more were created and the roman people finally found itself divided into thirtyfive tribes as it remained down to the end of the republic the distinction between urban and rural tribes had one effect which is worth mention both because it is without parallel elsewhere and because to it rome owed the preservation of her morality and the enlargement of her empire we should have expected that the urban tribes would soon monopolise power and honours and lose no time in bringing the rural tribes into disrepute but what happened was exactly the reverse the taste of the early romans for country life is well known this taste they owed to their wise founder who made rural and military labours go along with liberty and so to speak relegated to the town arts crafts intrigue fortune and slavery since therefore all romes most illustrious citizens lived in the fields and tilled the earth men grew used to seeking there alone the mainstays of the republic this condition being that of the best patricians was honoured by all men the simple and laborious life of the villager was preferred to the slothful and idle life of the bourgeoisie of rome and he who in the town would have been but a wretched proletarian became as a labourer in the fields a respected citizen not without reason says varro did our greatsouled ancestors establish in the village the    nursery of the sturdy and valiant men who defended them in time of war and provided for their sustenance in time of peace pliny states positively that the country tribes were honoured because of the men of whom they were composed while cowards men wished to dishonour were transferred as a public disgrace to the town tribes the sabine appius claudius when he had come to settle in rome was loaded with honours and enrolled in a rural tribe which subsequently took his family name lastly freedmen always entered the urban and never the rural tribes nor is there a single example throughout the republic of a freedman though he had become a citizen reaching any magistracy this was an excellent rule but it was carried so far that in the end it led to a change and certainly to an abuse in the political system first the censors after having for a long time claimed the right of transferring citizens arbitrarily from one tribe to another allowed most persons to enrol themselves in whatever tribe they pleased this permission certainly did no good and further robbed the censorship of one of its greatest resources moreover as the great and powerful all got themselves enrolled in the country tribes while the freedmen who had become citizens remained with the populace in the town tribes both soon ceased to have any local or territorial meaning and all were so confused that the members of one could not be told from those of another except by the registers so that the idea of the word tribe became personal instead of real or rather came to be little more than a chimera it happened in addition that the town tribes being more on the spot were often the stronger in the comitia and sold the state to those who stooped to buy the votes of the rabble composing them as the founder had set up ten curiæ in each tribe the whole roman people which was then contained within the walls consisted of thirty curiæ each with its temples its gods its officers its priests and its festivals which were called compitalia and corresponded to the paganalia held in later times by the rural tribes when servius made his new division as the thirty curiæ could not be shared equally between his four tribes  00 and as he was unwilling to interfere with them they became a further division of the inhabitants of rome quite independent of the tribes but in the case of the rural tribes and their members there was no question of curiæ as the tribes had then become a purely civil institution and a new system of levying troops having been introduced the military divisions of romulus were superfluous thus although every citizen was enrolled in a tribe there were very many who were not members of a curia servius made yet a third division quite distinct from the two we have mentioned which became in its effects the most important of all he distributed the whole roman people into six classes distinguished neither by place nor by person but by wealth the first classes included the rich the last the poor and those between persons of moderate means these six classes were subdivided into one hundred and ninetythree other bodies called centuries which were so divided that the first class alone comprised more than half of them while the last comprised only one thus the class that had the smallest number of members had the largest number of centuries and the whole of the last class only counted as a single subdivision although it alone included more than half the inhabitants of rome in order that the people might have the less insight into the results of this arrangement servius tried to give it a military tone in the second class he inserted two centuries of armourers and in the fourth two of makers of instruments of war in each class except the last he distinguished young and old that is those who were under an obligation to bear arms and those whose age gave them legal exemption it was this distinction rather than that of wealth which required frequent repetition of the census or counting lastly he ordered that the assembly should be held in the campus martius and that all who were of age to serve should come there armed the reason for his not making in the last class also the division of young and old was that the populace of whom it was composed was not given the right to bear arms for its country a man had to possess a hearth to acquire the right to defend it and of all the troops of  0  beggars who today lend lustre to the armies of kings there is perhaps not one who would not have been driven with scorn out of a roman cohort at a time when soldiers were the defenders of liberty in this last class however proletarians were distinguished from capite censi the former not quite reduced to nothing at least gave the state citizens and sometimes when the need was pressing even soldiers those who had nothing at all and could be numbered only by counting heads were regarded as of absolutely no account and marius was the first who stooped to enrol them without deciding now whether this third arrangement was good or bad in itself i think i may assert that it could have been made practicable only by the simple morals the disinterestedness the liking for agriculture and the scorn for commerce and for love of gain which characterised the early romans where is the modern people among whom consuming greed unrest intrigue continual removals and perpetual changes of fortune could let such a system last for twenty years without turning the state upside down we must indeed observe that morality and the censorship being stronger than this institution corrected its defects at rome and that the rich man found himself degraded to the class of the poor for making too much display of his riches from all this it is easy to understand why only five classes are almost always mentioned though there were really six the sixth as it furnished neither soldiers to the army nor votes in the campus martius  and was almost without function in the state was seldom regarded as of any account these were the various ways in which the roman people was divided let us now see the effect on the assemblies when lawfully summoned these were called comitia they were usually held in the public square at rome or in the campus martius and were distinguished as comitia curiata comitia centuriata and comitia tributa according to the form under which they were convoked the  0  comitia curiata were founded by romulus the centuriata by servius and the tributa by the tribunes of the people no law received its sanction and no magistrate was elected save in the comitia and as every citizen was enrolled in a curia a century or a tribe it follows that no citizen was excluded from the right of voting and that the roman people was truly sovereign both de jure and de facto for the comitia to be lawfully assembled and for their acts to have the force of law three conditions were necessary first the body or magistrate convoking them had to possess the necessary authority secondly the assembly had to be held on a day allowed by law and thirdly the auguries had to be favourable the reason for the first regulation needs no explanation the second is a matter of policy thus the comitia might not be held on festivals or marketdays when the countryfolk coming to rome on business had not time to spend the day in the public square by means of the third the senate held in check the proud and restive people and meetly restrained the ardour of seditious tribunes who however found more than one way of escaping this hindrance laws and the election of rulers were not the only questions submitted to the judgment of the comitia as the roman people had taken on itself the most important functions of government it may be said that the lot of europe was regulated in its assemblies the variety of their objects gave rise to the various forms these took according to the matters on which they had to pronounce in order to judge of these various forms it is enough to compare them romulus when he set up curiæ had in view the checking of the senate by the people and of the people by the senate while maintaining his ascendancy over both alike he therefore gave the people by means of this assembly all the authority of numbers to balance that of power and riches which he left to the patricians but after the spirit of monarchy he left all the same a greater advantage to the patricians in the influence of their clients on the majority of votes this excellent institution of patron and client was a masterpiece of statesmanship and humanity without which the patriciate  0  being flagrantly in contradiction to the republican spirit could not have survived rome alone has the honour of having given to the world this great example which never led to any abuse and yet has never been followed as the assemblies by curiæ persisted under the kings till the time of servius and the reign of the later tarquin was not regarded as legitimate royal laws were called generally leges curiatæ under the republic the curiæ still confined to the four urban tribes and including only the populace of rome suited neither the senate which led the patricians nor the tribunes who though plebeians were at the head of the welltodo citizens they therefore fell into disrepute and their degradation was such that thirty lictors used to assemble and do what the comitia curiata should have done the division by centuries was so favourable to the aristocracy that it is hard to see at first how the senate ever failed to carry the day in the comitia bearing their name by which the consuls the censors and the other curule magistrates were elected indeed of the hundred and ninetythree centuries into which the six classes of the whole roman people were divided the first class contained ninetyeight and as voting went solely by centuries this class alone had a majority over all the rest when all these centuries were in agreement the rest of the votes were not even taken the decision of the smallest number passed for that of the multitude and it may be said that in the comitia centuriata decisions were regulated far more by depth of purses than by the number of votes but this extreme authority was modified in two ways first the tribunes as a rule and always a great number of plebeians belonged to the class of the rich and so counterbalanced the influence of the patricians in the first class the second way was this instead of causing the centuries to vote throughout in order which would have meant beginning always with the first the romans always chose one by lot which proceeded alone to the election after this all the centuries were summoned another day according to their rank and the same election was  0  repeated and as a rule confirmed thus the authority of example was taken away from rank and given to the lot on a democratic principle from this custom resulted a further advantage the citizens from the country had time between the two elections to inform themselves of the merits of the candidate who had been provisionally nominated and did not have to vote without knowledge of the case but under the pretext of hastening matters the abolition of this custom was achieved and both elections were held on the same day the comitia tributa were properly the council of the roman people they were convoked by the tribunes alone at them the tribunes were elected and passed their plebiscita the senate not only had no standing in them but even no right to be present and the senators being forced to obey laws on which they could not vote were in this respect less free than the meanest citizens this injustice was altogether illconceived and was alone enough to invalidate the decrees of a body to which all its members were not admitted had all the patricians attended the comitia by virtue of the right they had as citizens they would not as mere private individuals have had any considerable influence on a vote reckoned by counting heads where the meanest proletarian was as good as the princeps senatus it may be seen therefore that besides the order which was achieved by these various ways of distributing so great a people and taking its votes the various methods were not reducible to forms indifferent in themselves but the results of each were relative to the objects which caused it to be preferred without going here into further details we may gather from what has been said above that the comitia tributa were the most favourable to popular government and the comitia centuriata to aristocracy the comitia curiata in which the populace of rome formed the majority being fitted only to further tyranny and evil designs naturally fell into disrepute and even seditious persons abstained from using a method which too clearly revealed their projects it is indisputable that the whole majesty of the roman people lay solely in the comitia centuriata which  0  alone included all for the comitia curiata excluded the rural tribes and the comitia tributa the senate and the patricians as for the method of taking the vote it was among the ancient romans as simple as their morals although not so simple as at sparta each man declared his vote aloud and a clerk duly wrote it down the majority in each tribe determined the vote of the tribe the majority of the tribes that of the people and so with curiæ and centuries this custom was good as long as honesty was triumphant among the citizens and each man was ashamed to vote publicly in favour of an unjust proposal or an unworthy subject but when the people grew corrupt and votes were bought it was fitting that voting should be secret in order that purchasers might be restrained by mistrust and rogues be given the means of not being traitors i know that cicero attacks this change and attributes partly to it the ruin of the republic but though i feel the weight ciceros authority must carry on such a point i cannot agree with him i hold on the contrary that for want of enough such changes the destruction of the state must be hastened just as the regimen of health does not suit the sick we should not wish to govern a people that has been corrupted by the laws that a good people requires there is no better proof of this rule than the long life of the republic of venice of which the shadow still exists solely because its laws are suitable only for men who are wicked the citizens were provided therefore with tablets by means of which each man could vote without any one knowing how he voted new methods were also introduced for collecting the tablets for counting voices for comparing numbers etc but all these precautions did not prevent the good faith of the officers charged with these functions  from being often suspect finally to prevent intrigues and trafficking in votes edicts were issued but their very number proves how useless they were towards the close of the republic it was often necessary to have recourse to extraordinary expedients in order  0  to supplement the inadequacy of the laws sometimes miracles were supposed but this method while it might impose on the people could not impose on those who governed sometimes an assembly was hastily called together before the candidates had time to form their factions sometimes a whole sitting was occupied with talk when it was seen that the people had been won over and was on the point of taking up a wrong position but in the end ambition eluded all attempts to check it and the most incredible fact of all is that in the midst of all these abuses the vast people thanks to its ancient regulations never ceased to elect magistrates to pass laws to judge cases and to carry through business both public and private almost as easily as the senate itself could have done chapter v the tribunate when an exact proportion cannot be established between the constituent parts of the state or when causes that cannot be removed continually alter the relation of one part to another recourse is had to the institution of a peculiar magistracy that enters into no corporate unity with the rest this restores to each term its right relation to the others and provides a link or middle term between either prince and people or prince and sovereign or if necessary both at once this body which i shall call the tribunate is the preserver of the laws and of the legislative power it serves sometimes to protect the sovereign against the government as the tribunes of the people did at rome sometimes to uphold the government against the people as the council of ten now does at venice and sometimes to maintain the balance between the two as the ephors did at sparta the tribunate is not a constituent part of the city and should have no share in either legislative or executive power but this very fact makes its own power the greater for while it can do nothing it can prevent  0  anything from being done it is more sacred and more revered as the defender of the laws than the prince who executes them or than the sovereign which ordains them this was seen very clearly at rome when the proud patricians for all their scorn of the people were forced to bow before one of its officers who had neither auspices nor jurisdiction the tribunate wisely tempered is the strongest support a good constitution can have but if its strength is ever so little excessive it upsets the whole state weakness on the other hand is not natural to it provided it is something it is never less than it should be it degenerates into tyranny when it usurps the executive power which it should confine itself to restraining and when it tries to dispense with the laws which it should confine itself to protecting the immense power of the ephors harmless as long as sparta preserved its morality hastened corruption when once it had begun the blood of agis slaughtered by these tyrants was avenged by his successor the crime and the punishment of the ephors alike hastened the destruction of the republic and after cleomenes sparta ceased to be of any account rome perished in the same way the excessive power of the tribunes which they had usurped by degrees finally served with the help of laws made to secure liberty as a safeguard for the emperors who destroyed it as for the venetian council of ten it is a tribunal of blood an object of horror to patricians and people alike and so far from giving a lofty protection to the laws it does nothing now they have become degraded but strike in the darkness blows of which no one dare take note the tribunate like the government grows weak as the number of its members increases when the tribunes of the roman people who first numbered only two and then five wished to double that number the senate let them do so in the confidence that it could use one to check another as indeed it afterwards freely did the best method of preventing usurpations by so formidable a body though no government has yet made use of it would be not to make it permanent but to regulate the periods during which it should remain in abeyance these intervals which should not be long enough to give  0  abuses time to grow strong may be so fixed by law that they can easily be shortened at need by extraordinary commissions this method seems to me to have no disadvantages because as i have said the tribunate which forms no part of the constitution can be removed without the constitution being affected it seems to be also efficacious because a newly restored magistrate starts not with the power his predecessor exercised but with that which the law allows him chapter vi the dictatorship the inflexibility of the laws which prevents them from adapting themselves to circumstances may in certain cases render them disastrous and make them bring about at a time of crisis the ruin of the state the order and slowness of the forms they enjoin require a space of time which circumstances sometimes withhold a thousand cases against which the legislator has made no provision may present themselves and it is a highly necessary part of foresight to be conscious that everything cannot be foreseen it is wrong therefore to wish to make political institutions so strong as to render it impossible to suspend their operation even sparta allowed its laws to lapse however none but the greatest dangers can counterbalance that of changing the public order and the sacred power of the laws should never be arrested save when the existence of the country is at stake in these rare and obvious cases provision is made for the public security by a particular act entrusting it to him who is most worthy this commitment may be carried out in either of two ways according to the nature of the danger if increasing the activity of the government is a sufficient remedy power is concentrated in the hands of one or two of its members in this case the change is not in the authority of the laws but only in the form of administering them if on the other hand the peril is of such a  0  kind that the paraphernalia of the laws are an obstacle to their preservation the method is to nominate a supreme ruler who shall silence all the laws and suspend for a moment the sovereign authority in such a case there is no doubt about the general will and it is clear that the peoples first intention is that the state shall not perish thus the suspension of the legislative authority is in no sense its abolition the magistrate who silences it cannot make it speak he dominates it but cannot represent it he can do anything except make laws the first method was used by the roman senate when in a consecrated formula it charged the consuls to provide for the safety of the republic the second was employed when one of the two consuls nominated a dictator  a custom rome borrowed from alba during the first period of the republic recourse was very often had to the dictatorship because the state had not yet a firm enough basis to be able to maintain itself by the strength of its constitution alone as the state of morality then made superfluous many of the precautions which would have been necessary at other times there was no fear that a dictator would abuse his authority or try to keep it beyond his term of office on the contrary so much power appeared to be burdensome to him who was clothed with it and he made all speed to lay it down as if taking the place of the laws had been too troublesome and too perilous a position to retain it is therefore the danger not of its abuse but of its cheapening that makes me attack the indiscreet use of this supreme magistracy in the earliest times for as long as it was freely employed at elections dedications and purely formal functions there was danger of its becoming less formidable in time of need and of men growing accustomed to regarding as empty a title that was used only on occasions of empty ceremonial towards the end of the republic the romans having grown more circumspect were as unreasonably sparing in the use of the dictatorship as they had formerly been lavish it is easy to see that their fears were without   0 foundation that the weakness of the capital secured it against the magistrates who were in its midst that a dictator might in certain cases defend the public liberty but could never endanger it and that the chains of rome would be forged not in rome itself but in her armies the weak resistance offered by marius to sulla and by pompey to cæsar clearly showed what was to be expected from authority at home against force from abroad this misconception led the romans to make great mistakes such for example as the failure to nominate a dictator in the catilinarian conspiracy for as only the city itself with at most some province in italy was concerned the unlimited authority the laws gave to the dictator would have enabled him to make short work of the conspiracy which was in fact stifled only by a combination of lucky chances human prudence had no right to expect instead the senate contented itself with entrusting its whole power to the consuls so that cicero in order to take effective action was compelled on a capital point to exceed his powers and if in the first transports of joy his conduct was approved he was justly called later on to account for the blood of citizens spilt in violation of the laws such a reproach could never have been levelled at a dictator but the consuls eloquence carried the day and he himself roman though he was loved his own glory better than his country and sought not so much the most lawful and secure means of saving the state as to get for himself the whole honour of having done so  he was therefore justly honoured as the liberator of rome and also justly punished as a lawbreaker however brilliant his recall may have been it was undoubtedly an act of pardon however this important trust be conferred it is important that its duration should be fixed at a very brief period incapable of being ever prolonged in the crises which lead to its adoption the state is either soon lost or soon saved and the present need passed the dictatorship becomes either tyrannical or idle at rome where     dictators held office for six months only most of them abdicated before their time was up if their term had been longer they might well have tried to prolong it still further as the decemvirs did when chosen for a year the dictator had only time to provide against the need that had caused him to be chosen he had none to think of further projects chapter vii the censorship as the law is the declaration of the general will the censorship is the declaration of the public judgment public opinion is the form of law which the censor administers and like the prince only applies to particular cases the censorial tribunal so far from being the arbiter of the peoples opinion only declares it and as soon as the two part company its decisions are null and void it is useless to distinguish the morality of a nation from the objects of its esteem both depend on the same principle and are necessarily indistinguishable there is no people on earth the choice of whose pleasures is not decided by opinion rather than nature right mens opinions and their morality will purge itself men always love what is good or what they find good it is in judging what is good that they go wrong this judgment therefore is what must be regulated he who judges of morality judges of honour and he who judges of honour finds his law in opinion the opinions of a people are derived from its constitution although the law does not regulate morality it is legislation that gives it birth when legislation grows weak morality degenerates but in such cases the judgment of the censors will not do what the force of the laws has failed to effect from this it follows that the censorship may be useful for the preservation of morality but can never be so for its restoration set up censors while the laws are vigorous as soon as they have lost their vigour all hope is     gone no legitimate power can retain force when the laws have lost it the censorship upholds morality by preventing opinion from growing corrupt by preserving its rectitude by means of wise applications and sometimes even by fixing it when it is still uncertain the employment of seconds in duels which had been carried to wild extremes in the kingdom of france was done away with merely by these words in a royal edict as for those who are cowards enough to call upon seconds this judgment in anticipating that of the public suddenly decided it but when edicts from the same source tried to pronounce duelling itself an act of cowardice as indeed it is then since common opinion does not regard it as such the public took no notice of a decision on a point on which its mind was already made up i have stated elsewhere  that as public opinion is not subject to any constraint there need be no trace of it in the tribunal set up to represent it it is impossible to admire too much the art with which this resource which we moderns have wholly lost was employed by the romans and still more by the lacedæmonians a man of bad morals having made a good proposal in the spartan council the ephors neglected it and caused the same proposal to be made by a virtuous citizen what an honour for the one and what a disgrace for the other without praise or blame of either certain drunkards from samos  polluted the tribunal of the ephors the next day a public edict gave samians permission to be filthy an actual punishment would not have been so severe as such an impunity when sparta has pronounced on what is or is not right greece makes no appeal from her judgments     chapter viii civil religion at first men had no kings save the gods and no government save theocracy they reasoned like caligula and at that period reasoned aright it takes a long time for feeling so to change that men can make up their minds to take their equals as masters in the hope that they will profit by doing so from the mere fact that god was set over every political society it followed that there were as many gods as peoples two peoples that were strangers the one to the other and almost always enemies could not long recognise the same master two armies giving battle could not obey the same leader national divisions thus led to polytheism and this in turn gave rise to theological and civil intolerance which as we shall see hereafter are by nature the same the fancy the greeks had for rediscovering their gods among the barbarians arose from the way they had of regarding themselves as the natural sovereigns of such peoples but there is nothing so absurd as the erudition which in our days identifies and confuses gods of different nations as if moloch saturn and chronos could be the same god as if the phœnician baal the greek zeus and the latin jupiter could be the same as if there could still be anything common to imaginary beings with different names if it is asked how in pagan times where each state had its cult and its gods there were no wars of religion i answer that it was precisely because each state having its own cult as well as its own government made no distinction between its gods and its laws political war was also theological the provinces of the gods were so to speak fixed by the boundaries of nations the god of one people had no right over another the gods of the pagans were not jealous gods they shared among themselves the empire of the world even moses and the hebrews sometimes lent themselves to this view by speaking of the god of israel it is true they regarded as     powerless the gods of the canaanites a proscribed people condemned to destruction whose place they were to take but remember how they spoke of the divisions of the neighbouring peoples they were forbidden to attack is not the possession of what belongs to your god chamos lawfully your due said jephthah to the ammonites we have the same title to the lands our conquering god has made his own  here i think there is a recognition that the rights of chamos and those of the god of israel are of the same nature but when the jews being subject to the kings of babylon and subsequently to those of syria still obstinately refused to recognise any god save their own their refusal was regarded as rebellion against their conqueror and drew down on them the persecutions we read of in their history which are without parallel till the coming of christianity  every religion therefore being attached solely to the laws of the state which prescribed it there was no way of converting a people except by enslaving it and there could be no missionaries save conquerors the obligation to change cults being the law to which the vanquished yielded it was necessary to be victorious before suggesting such a change so far from men fighting for the gods the gods as in homer fought for men each asked his god for victory and repayed him with new altars the romans before taking a city summoned its gods to quit it and in leaving the tarentines their outraged gods they regarded them as subject to their own and compelled to do them homage they left the vanquished their gods as they left them their laws a wreath to the jupiter of the capitol was often the only tribute they imposed     finally when along with their empire the romans had spread their cult and their gods and had themselves often adopted those of the vanquished by granting to both alike the rights of the city the peoples of that vast empire insensibly found themselves with multitudes of gods and cults everywhere almost the same and thus paganism throughout the known world finally came to be one and the same religion it was in these circumstances that jesus came to set up on earth a spiritual kingdom which by separating the theological from the political system made the state no longer one and brought about the internal divisions which have never ceased to trouble christian peoples as the new idea of a kingdom of the other world could never have occurred to pagans they always looked on the christians as really rebels who while feigning to submit were only waiting for the chance to make themselves independent and their masters and to usurp by guile the authority they pretended in their weakness to respect this was the cause of the persecutions what the pagans had feared took place then everything changed its aspect the humble christians changed their language and soon this socalled kingdom of the other world turned under a visible leader into the most violent of earthly despotisms however as there have always been a prince and civil laws this double power and conflict of jurisdiction have made all good polity impossible in christian states and men have never succeeded in finding out whether they were bound to obey the master or the priest several peoples however even in europe and its neighbourhood have desired without success to preserve or restore the old system but the spirit of christianity has everywhere prevailed the sacred cult has always remained or again become independent of the sovereign and there has been no necessary link between it and the body of the state mahomet held very sane views and linked his political system well together and as long as the form of his government continued under the caliphs who succeeded him that government was indeed one and so far good but the arabs having grown prosperous lettered civilised slack and cowardly were conquered by     barbarians the division between the two powers began again and although it is less apparent among the mahometans than among the christians it none the less exists especially in the sect of ali and there are states such as persia where it is continually making itself felt among us the kings of england have made themselves heads of the church and the czars have done the same but this title has made them less its masters than its ministers they have gained not so much the right to change it as the power to maintain it they are not its legislators but only its princes wherever the clergy is a corporate body  it is master and legislator in its own country there are thus two powers two sovereigns in england and in russia as well as elsewhere of all christian writers the philosopher hobbes alone has seen the evil and how to remedy it and has dared to propose the reunion of the two heads of the eagle and the restoration throughout of political unity without which no state or government will ever be rightly constituted but he should have seen that the masterful spirit of christianity is incompatible with his system and that the priestly interest would always be stronger than that of the state it is not so much what is false and terrible in his political theory as what is just and true that has drawn down hatred on it  i believe that if the study of history were developed from this point of view it would be easy to refute the contrary opinions of bayle and warburton one of whom holds that religion can be of no use to the body politic while the other on the contrary maintains that christianity is its strongest support we should demonstrate to the former     that no state has ever been founded without a religious basis and to the latter that the law of christianity at bottom does more harm by weakening than good by strengthening the constitution of the state to make myself understood i have only to make a little more exact the too vague ideas of religion as relating to this subject religion considered in relation to society which is either general or particular may also be divided into two kinds the religion of man and that of the citizen the first which has neither temples nor altars nor rites and is confined to the purely internal cult of the supreme god and the eternal obligations of morality is the religion of the gospel pure and simple the true theism what may be called natural divine right or law the other which is codified in a single country gives it its gods its own tutelary patrons it has its dogmas its rites and its external cult prescribed by law outside the single nation that follows it all the world is in its sight infidel foreign and barbarous the duties and rights of man extend for it only as far as its own altars of this kind were all the religions of early peoples which we may define as civil or positive divine right or law there is a third sort of religion of a more singular kind which gives men two codes of legislation two rulers and two countries renders them subject to contradictory duties and makes it impossible for them to be faithful both to religion and to citizenship such are the religions of the lamas and of the japanese and such is roman christianity which may be called the religion of the priest it leads to a sort of mixed and antisocial code which has no name in their political aspect all these three kinds of religion have their defects the third is so clearly bad that it is waste of time to stop to prove it such all that destroys social unity is worthless all institutions that set man in contradiction to himself are worthless the second is good in that it unites the divine cult with love of the laws and making country the object of the citizens adoration teaches them that service done to the state is service done to its tutelary god it is a form of theocracy in which there can be no pontiff save the prince and no priests save the magistrates to die for     ones country then becomes martyrdom violation of its laws impiety and to subject one who is guilty to public execration is to condemn him to the anger of the gods sacer estod on the other hand it is bad in that being founded on lies and error it deceives men makes them credulous and superstitious and drowns the true cult of the divinity in empty ceremonial it is bad again when it becomes tyrannous and exclusive and makes a people bloodthirsty and intolerant so that it breathes fire and slaughter and regards as a sacred act the killing of every one who does not believe in its gods the result is to place such a people in a natural state of war with all others so that its security is deeply endangered there remains therefore the religion of man or christianity—not the christianity of today but that of the gospel which is entirely different by means of this holy sublime and real religion all men being children of one god recognise one another as brothers and the society that unites them is not dissolved even at death but this religion having no particular relation to the body politic leaves the laws in possession of the force they have in themselves without making any addition to it and thus one of the great bonds that unite society considered in severalty fails to operate nay more so far from binding the hearts of the citizens to the state it has the effect of taking them away from all earthly things i know of nothing more contrary to the social spirit we are told that a people of true christians would form the most perfect society imaginable i see in this supposition only one great difficulty that a society of true christians would not be a society of men i say further that such a society with all its perfection would be neither the strongest nor the most lasting the very fact that it was perfect would rob it of its bond of union the flaw that would destroy it would lie in its very perfection every one would do his duty the people would be lawabiding the rulers just and temperate the magistrates upright and incorruptible the soldiers would scorn death there would be neither vanity nor luxury so far so good but let us hear more     christianity as a religion is entirely spiritual occupied solely with heavenly things the country of the christian is not of this world he does his duty indeed but does it with profound indifference to the good or ill success of his cares provided he has nothing to reproach himself with it matters little to him whether things go well or ill here on earth if the state is prosperous he hardly dares to share in the public happiness for fear he may grow proud of his countrys glory if the state is languishing he blesses the hand of god that is hard upon his people for the state to be peaceable and for harmony to be maintained all the citizens without exception would have to be good christians if by ill hap there should be a single selfseeker or hypocrite a catiline or a cromwell for instance he would certainly get the better of his pious compatriots christian charity does not readily allow a man to think hardly of his neighbours as soon as by some trick he has discovered the art of imposing on them and getting hold of a share in the public authority you have a man established in dignity it is the will of god that he be respected very soon you have a power it is gods will that it be obeyed and if the power is abused by him who wields it it is the scourge wherewith god punishes his children there would be scruples about driving out the usurper public tranquillity would have to be disturbed violence would have to be employed and blood spilt all this accords ill with christian meekness and after all in this vale of sorrows what does it matter whether we are free men or serfs the essential thing is to get to heaven and resignation is only an additional means of doing so if war breaks out with another state the citizens march readily out to battle not one of them thinks of flight they do their duty but they have no passion for victory they know better how to die than how to conquer what does it matter whether they win or lose does not providence know better than they what is meet for them only think to what account a proud impetuous and passionate enemy could turn their stoicism set over against them those generous peoples who were devoured by ardent love of glory and of their country imagine your christian republic face to face with sparta or rome the pious   0 christians will be beaten crushed and destroyed before they know where they are or will owe their safety only to the contempt their enemy will conceive for them it was to my mind a fine oath that was taken by the soldiers of fabius who swore not to conquer or die but to come back victorious—and kept their oath christians would never have taken such an oath they would have looked on it as tempting god but i am mistaken in speaking of a christian republic the terms are mutually exclusive christianity preaches only servitude and dependence its spirit is so favourable to tyranny that it always profits by such a régime true christians are made to be slaves and they know it and do not much mind this short life counts for too little in their eyes i shall be told that christian troops are excellent i deny it show me an instance for my part i know of no christian troops i shall be told of the crusades without disputing the valour of the crusaders i answer that so far from being christians they were the priests soldiery citizens of the church they fought for their spiritual country which the church had somehow or other made temporal well understood this goes back to paganism as the gospel sets up no national religion a holy war is impossible among christians under the pagan emperors the christian soldiers were brave every christian writer affirms it and i believe it it was a case of honourable emulation of the pagan troops as soon as the emperors were christian this emulation no longer existed and when the cross had driven out the eagle roman valour wholly disappeared but setting aside political considerations let us come back to what is right and settle our principles on this important point the right which the social compact gives the sovereign over the subjects does not we have seen exceed the limits of public expediency  the subjects     then owe the sovereign an account of their opinions only to such an extent as they matter to the community now it matters very much to the community that each citizen should have a religion that will make him love his duty but the dogmas of that religion concern the state and its members only so far as they have reference to morality and to the duties which he who professes them is bound to do to others each man may have over and above what opinions he pleases without it being the sovereigns business to take cognisance of them for as the sovereign has no authority in the other world whatever the lot of its subjects may be in the life to come that is not its business provided they are good citizens in this life there is therefore a purely civil profession of faith of which the sovereign should fix the articles not exactly as religious dogmas but as social sentiments without which a man cannot be a good citizen or a faithful subject  while it can compel no one to believe them it can banish from the state whoever does not believe them—it can banish him not for impiety but as an antisocial being incapable of truly loving the laws and justice and of sacrificing at need his life to his duty if any one after publicly recognising these dogmas behaves as if he does not believe them let him be punished by death he has committed the worst of all crimes that of lying before the law the dogmas of civil religion ought to be few simple and exactly worded without explanation or commentary the existence of a mighty intelligent and beneficent divinity possessed of foresight and providence the life to come the happiness of the just the punishment of the wicked the sanctity of the social contract and the laws these are its positive dogmas its negative dogmas i confine to one intolerance which is a part of the cults we have rejected those who distinguish civil from theological intolerance     are to my mind mistaken the two forms are inseparable it is impossible to live at peace with those we regard as damned to love them would be to hate god who punishes them we positively must either reclaim or torment them wherever theological intolerance is admitted it must inevitably have some civil effect  and as soon as it has such an effect the sovereign is no longer sovereign even in the temporal sphere thenceforth priests are the real masters and kings only their ministers now that there is and can be no longer an exclusive national religion tolerance should be given to all religions that tolerate others so long as their dogmas contain nothing contrary to the duties of citizenship but whoever dares to say outside the church is no salvation ought to be driven from the state unless the state is the church and the prince the pontiff such a dogma is good only in a theocratic government in any other it is fatal the reason for which henry iv is said to have embraced the roman religion ought to make every honest man leave it and still more any prince who knows how to reason     chapter ix conclusion now that i have laid down the true principles of political right and tried to give the state a basis of its own to rest on i ought next to strengthen it by its external relations which would include the law of nations commerce the right of war and conquest public right leagues negotiations treaties etc but all this forms a new subject that is far too vast for my narrow scope i ought throughout to have kept to a more limited sphere         a discourse which won the prize at the academy of dijon in    0 on this question proposed by the academy has the restoration of the arts and sciences had a purifying effect upon morals barbarus hic ego sum qui non intelligor illis—ovid          preface the following pages contain a discussion of one of the most sublime and interesting of all moral questions it is not concerned however with those metaphysical subtleties which of late have found their way into every department of literature and from which even our academic curricula are not always free we have now to do with one of those truths on which the happiness of mankind depends i foresee that i shall not readily be forgiven for having taken up the position i have adopted setting myself up against all that is nowadays most admired i can expect no less than a universal outcry against me nor is the approbation of a few sensible men enough to make me count on that of the public but i have taken my stand and i shall be at no pains to please either intellectuals or men of the world there are in all ages men born to be in bondage to the opinions of the society in which they live there are not a few who today play the freethinker and the philosopher who would if they had lived in the time of the league have been no more than fanatics no author who has a mind to outlive his own age should write for such readers a word more and i have done as i did not expect the honour conferred on me i had since sending in my discourse so altered and enlarged it as almost to make it a new work but in the circumstances i have felt bound to publish it just as it was when it received the prize i have only added a few notes and left two alterations which are easily recognisable of which the academy possibly might not have approved the respect gratitude and even justice i owe to that body seemed to me to demand this acknowledgment         a discourse on the moral effects of the arts and sciences decipimur specie recti—horace the question before me is whether the restoration of the arts and sciences has had the effect of purifying or corrupting morals which side am i to take that gentlemen which becomes an honest man who is sensible of his own ignorance and thinks himself none the worse for it i feel the difficulty of treating this subject fittingly before the tribunal which is to judge of what i advance how can i presume to belittle the sciences before one of the most learned assemblies in europe to commend ignorance in a famous academy and reconcile my contempt for study with the respect due to the truly learned i was aware of these inconsistencies but not discouraged by them it is not science i said to myself that i am attacking it is virtue that i am defending and that before virtuous men—and goodness is even dearer to the good than learning to the learned what then have i to fear the sagacity of the assembly before which i am pleading that i acknowledge is to be feared but rather on account of faults of construction than of the views i hold just sovereigns have never hesitated to decide against themselves in doubtful cases and indeed the most advantageous situation in which a just claim can be is that of being laid before a just and enlightened arbitrator who is judge in his own case to this motive which encouraged me i may add another which finally decided me and this is that as i have upheld the cause of truth to the best of my natural abilities whatever my apparent success there is one reward which cannot fail me that reward i shall find in the bottom of my heart   0 the first part it is a noble and beautiful spectacle to see man raising himself so to speak from nothing by his own exertions dissipating by the light of reason all the thick clouds in which he was by nature enveloped mounting above himself soaring in thought even to the celestial regions like the sun encompassing with giant strides the vast extent of the universe and what is still grander and more wonderful going back into himself there to study man and get to know his own nature his duties and his end all these miracles we have seen renewed within the last few generations europe had relapsed into the barbarism of the earliest ages the inhabitants of this part of the world which is at present so highly enlightened were plunged some centuries ago in a state still worse than ignorance a scientific jargon more despicable than mere ignorance had usurped the name of knowledge and opposed an almost invincible obstacle to its restoration things had come to such a pass that it required a complete revolution to bring men back to common sense this came at last from the quarter from which it was least to be expected it was the stupid mussulman the eternal scourge of letters who was the immediate cause of their revival among us the fall of the throne of constantine brought to italy the relics of ancient greece and with these precious spoils france in turn was enriched the sciences soon followed literature and the art of thinking joined that of writing an order which may seem strange but is perhaps only too natural the world now began to perceive the principal advantage of an intercourse with the muses that of rendering mankind more sociable by inspiring them with the desire to please one another with performances worthy of their mutual approbation the mind as well as the body has its needs those of the body are the basis of society those of the mind its ornaments so long as government and law provide for the security and wellbeing of men in their common life the arts literature and the sciences less despotic though perhaps more     powerful fling garlands of flowers over the chains which weigh them down they stifle in mens breasts that sense of original liberty for which they seem to have been born cause them to love their own slavery and so make of them what is called a civilised people necessity raised up thrones the arts and sciences have made them strong powers of the earth cherish all talents and protect those who cultivate them  civilised peoples cultivate such pursuits to them happy slaves you owe that delicacy and exquisiteness of taste which is so much your boast that sweetness of disposition and urbanity of manners which make intercourse so easy and agreeable among you—in a word the appearance of all the virtues without being in possession of one of them it was for this sort of accomplishment which is by so much the more captivating as it seems less affected that athens and rome were so much distinguished in the boasted times of their splendour and magnificence and it is doubtless in the same respect that our own age and nation will excel all periods and peoples an air of philosophy without pedantry an address at once natural and engaging distant equally from teutonic clumsiness and italian pantomime these are the effects of a taste acquired by liberal studies and improved by conversation with the world what happiness would it be for those who live among us if our external appearance were always a true mirror of our hearts if decorum were but virtue if the maxims we professed were the rules of our conduct and if real philosophy were inseparable from the title of a philosopher but so many good qualities too seldom go together virtue rarely appears in so much pomp and state richness of apparel may proclaim the man of fortune     and elegance the man of taste but true health and manliness are known by different signs it is under the homespun of the labourer and not beneath the gilt and tinsel of the courtier that we should look for strength and vigour of body external ornaments are no less foreign to virtue which is the strength and activity of the mind the honest man is an athlete who loves to wrestle stark naked he scorns all those vile trappings which prevent the exertion of his strength and were for the most part invented only to conceal some deformity before art had moulded our behaviour and taught our passions to speak an artificial language our morals were rude but natural and the different ways in which we behaved proclaimed at the first glance the difference of our dispositions human nature was not at bottom better then than now but men found their security in the ease with which they could see through one another and this advantage of which we no longer feel the value prevented their having many vices in our day now that more subtle study and a more refined taste have reduced the art of pleasing to a system there prevails in modern manners a servile and deceptive conformity so that one would think every mind had been cast in the same mould politeness requires this thing decorum that ceremony has its forms and fashion its laws and these we must always follow never the promptings of our own nature we no longer dare seem what we really are but lie under a perpetual restraint in the meantime the herd of men which we call society all act under the same circumstances exactly alike unless very particular and powerful motives prevent them thus we never know with whom we have to deal and even to know our friends we must wait for some critical and pressing occasion that is till it is too late for it is on those very occasions that such knowledge is of use to us what a train of vices must attend this uncertainty sincere friendship real esteem and perfect confidence are banished from among men jealousy suspicion fear coldness reserve hate and fraud lie constantly concealed under that uniform and deceitful veil of politeness that     boasted candour and urbanity for which we are indebted to the light and leading of this age we shall no longer take in vain by our oaths the name of our creator but we shall insult him with our blasphemies and our scrupulous ears will take no offence we have grown too modest to brag of our own deserts but we do not scruple to decry those of others we do not grossly outrage even our enemies but artfully calumniate them our hatred of other nations diminishes but patriotism dies with it ignorance is held in contempt but a dangerous scepticism has succeeded it some vices indeed are condemned and others grown dishonourable but we have still many that are honoured with the names of virtues and it is become necessary that we should either have or at least pretend to have them let who will extol the moderation of our modern sages i see nothing in it but a refinement of intemperance as unworthy of my commendation as their artificial simplicity  such is the purity to which our morals have attained this is the virtue we have made our own let the arts and sciences claim the share they have had in this salutary work i shall add but one reflection more suppose an inhabitant of some distant country should endeavour to form an idea of european morals from the state of the sciences the perfection of the arts the propriety of our public entertainments the politeness of our behaviour the affability of our conversation our constant professions of benevolence and from those tumultuous assemblies of people of all ranks who seem from morning till night to have no other care than to oblige one another such a stranger i maintain would arrive at a totally false view of our morality where there is no effect it is idle to look for a cause but here the effect is certain and the depravity actual our minds have been corrupted in proportion as the arts and sciences have improved will it be said that this is a misfortune peculiar to the present age no gentlemen     the evils resulting from our vain curiosity are as old as the world the daily ebb and flow of the tides are not more regularly influenced by the moon than the morals of a people by the progress of the arts and sciences as their light has risen above our horizon virtue has taken flight and the same phenomenon has been constantly observed in all times and places take egypt the first school of mankind that ancient country famous for its fertility under a brazen sky the spot from which sesostris once set out to conquer the world egypt became the mother of philosophy and the fine arts soon she was conquered by cambyses and then successively by the greeks the romans the arabs and finally the turks take greece once peopled by heroes who twice vanquished asia letters as yet in their infancy had not corrupted the disposition of its inhabitants but the progress of the sciences soon produced a dissoluteness of manners and the imposition of the macedonian yoke from which time greece always learned always voluptuous and always a slave has experienced amid all its revolutions no more than a change of masters not all the eloquence of demosthenes could breathe life into a body which luxury and the arts had once enervated it was not till the days of ennius and terence that rome founded by a shepherd and made illustrious by peasants began to degenerate but after the appearance of an ovid a catullus a martial and the rest of those numerous obscene authors whose very names are enough to put modesty to the blush rome once the shrine of virtue became the theatre of vice a scorn among the nations and an object of derision even to barbarians thus the capital of the world at length submitted to the yoke of slavery it had imposed on others and the very day of its fall was the eve of that on which it conferred on one of its citizens the title of arbiter of good taste what shall i say of that metropolis of the eastern empire which by its situation seemed destined to be the capital of the world that refuge of the arts and sciences when they were banished from the rest of europe more perhaps by wisdom than barbarism the most profligate debaucheries the most abandoned villainies the most atrocious crimes plots murders and assassinations form     the warp and woof of the history of constantinople such is the pure source from which have flowed to us the floods of knowledge on which the present age so prides itself but wherefore should we seek in past ages for proofs of a truth of which the present affords us ample evidence there is in asia a vast empire where learning is held in honour and leads to the highest dignities in the state if the sciences improved our morals if they inspired us with courage and taught us to lay down our lives for the good of our country the chinese should be wise free and invincible but if there be no vice they do not practise no crime with which they are not familiar if the sagacity of their ministers the supposed wisdom of their laws and the multitude of inhabitants who people that vast empire have alike failed to preserve them from the yoke of the rude and ignorant tartars of what use were their men of science and literature what advantage has that country reaped from the honours bestowed on its learned men can it be that of being peopled by a race of scoundrels and slaves contrast with these instances the morals of those few nations which being preserved from the contagion of useless knowledge have by their virtues become happy in themselves and afforded an example to the rest of the world such were the first inhabitants of persia a nation so singular that virtue was taught among them in the same manner as the sciences are with us they very easily subdued asia and possess the exclusive glory of having had the history of their political institutions regarded as a philosophical romance such were the scythians of whom such wonderful eulogies have come down to us such were the germans whose simplicity innocence and virtue afforded a most delightful contrast to the pen of an historian weary of describing the baseness and villainies of an enlightened opulent and voluptuous nation such had been even rome in the days of its poverty and ignorance and such has shown itself to be even in our own times that rustic nation whose justly renowned courage not even adversity could conquer and whose fidelity no example could corrupt      it is not through stupidity that the people have preferred other activities to those of the mind they were not ignorant that in other countries there were men who spent their time in disputing idly about the sovereign good and about vice and virtue they knew that these useless thinkers were lavish in their own praises and stigmatised other nations contemptuously as barbarians but they noted the morals of these people and so learnt what to think of their learning  can it be forgotten that in the very heart of greece there arose a city as famous for the happy ignorance of its inhabitants as for the wisdom of its laws a republic of demigods rather than of men so greatly superior their virtues seemed to those of mere humanity sparta eternal proof of the vanity of science while the vices under the conduct of the fine arts were being introduced into athens even while its tyrant was carefully collecting together the works of the prince of poets was driving from her walls artists and the arts the learned and their learning the difference was seen in the outcome athens became the seat of politeness and taste the country of orators and philosophers the elegance of its buildings equalled that of its language on every side might be seen marble and canvas animated by the hands of the most skilful artists from athens we derive those astonishing performances which will serve as models to every corrupt age the picture of lacedæmon is not so highly coloured there the neighbouring nations used to say men were born virtuous their native air seeming     to inspire them with virtue but its inhabitants have left us nothing but the memory of their heroic actions monuments that should not count for less in our eyes than the most curious relics of athenian marble it is true that among the athenians there were some few wise men who withstood the general torrent and preserved their integrity even in the company of the muses but hear the judgment which the principal and most unhappy of them passed on the artists and learned men of his day i have considered the poets says he and i look upon them as people whose talents impose both on themselves and on others they give themselves out for wise men and are taken for such but in reality they are anything sooner than that from the poets continues socrates i turned to the artists nobody was more ignorant of the arts than myself nobody was more fully persuaded that the artists were possessed of amazing knowledge i soon discovered however that they were in as bad a way as the poets and that both had fallen into the same misconception because the most skilful of them excel others in their particular jobs they think themselves wiser than all the rest of mankind this arrogance spoilt all their skill in my eyes so that putting myself in the place of the oracle and asking myself whether i would rather be what i am or what they are know what they know or know that i know nothing i very readily answered for myself and the god that i had rather remain as i am none of us neither the sophists nor the poets nor the orators nor the artists nor i know what is the nature of the true the good or the beautiful but there is this difference between us that though none of these people know anything they all think they know something whereas for my part if i know nothing i am at least in no doubt of my ignorance so the superiority of wisdom imputed to me by the oracle is reduced merely to my being fully convinced that i am ignorant of what i do not know thus we find socrates the wisest of men in the judgment of the god and the most learned of all the athenians in the opinion of all greece speaking in praise of ignorance     were he alive now there is little reason to think that our modern scholars and artists would induce him to change his mind no gentlemen that honest man would still persist in despising our vain sciences he would lend no aid to swell the flood of books that flows from every quarter he would leave to us as he did to his disciples only the example and memory of his virtues that is the noblest method of instructing mankind socrates had begun at athens and the elder cato proceeded at rome to inveigh against those seductive and subtle greeks who corrupted the virtue and destroyed the courage of their fellowcitizens culture however prevailed rome was filled with philosophers and orators military discipline was neglected agriculture was held in contempt men formed sects and forgot their country to the sacred names of liberty disinterestedness and obedience to law succeeded those of epicurus zeno and arcesilaus it was even a saying among their own philosophers that since learned men appeared among them honest men had been in eclipse before that time the romans were satisfied with the practice of virtue they were undone when they began to study it what would the great soul of fabricius have felt if it had been his misfortune to be called back to life when he saw the pomp and magnificence of that rome which his arm had saved from ruin and his honourable name made more illustrious than all its conquests ye gods he would have said what has become of those thatched roofs and rustic hearths which were formerly the habitations of temperance and virtue what fatal splendour has succeeded the ancient roman simplicity what is this foreign language this effeminacy of manners what is the meaning of these statues paintings and buildings fools what have you done you the lords of the earth have made yourselves the slaves of the frivolous nations you have subdued you are governed by rhetoricians and it has been only to enrich architects painters sculptors and stageplayers that you have watered greece and asia with your blood even the spoils of carthage are the prize of a fluteplayer romans romans make haste to demolish those amphitheatres break to pieces those     statues burn those paintings drive from among you those slaves who keep you in subjection and whose fatal arts are corrupting your morals let other hands make themselves illustrious by such vain talents the only talent worthy of rome is that of conquering the world and making virtue its ruler when cyneas took the roman senate for an assembly of kings he was not struck by either useless pomp or studied elegance he heard there none of that futile eloquence which is now the study and the charm of frivolous orators what then was the majesty that cyneas beheld fellow citizens he saw the noblest sight that ever existed under heaven a sight which not all your riches or your arts can show an assembly of two hundred virtuous men worthy to command in rome and to govern the world but let pass the distance of time and place and let us see what has happened in our own time and country or rather let us banish odious descriptions that might offend our delicacy and spare ourselves the pains of repeating the same things under different names it was not for nothing that i invoked the manes of fabricius for what have i put into his mouth that might not have come with as much propriety from louis the twelfth or henry the fourth it is true that in france socrates would not have drunk the hemlock but he would have drunk of a potion infinitely more bitter of insult mockery and contempt a hundred times worse than death thus it is that luxury profligacy and slavery have been in all ages the scourge of the efforts of our pride to emerge from that happy state of ignorance in which the wisdom of providence had placed us that thick veil with which it has covered all its operations seems to be a sufficient proof that it never designed us for such fruitless researches but is there indeed one lesson it has taught us by which we have rightly profited or which we have neglected with impunity let men learn for once that nature would have preserved them from science as a mother snatches a dangerous weapon from the hands of her child let them know that all the secrets she hides are so many evils from which she protects them and that the very difficulty they find in acquiring knowledge is not the least of her bounty towards them men are perverse   0 but they would have been far worse if they had had the misfortune to be born learned how humiliating are these reflections to humanity and how mortified by them our pride should be what it will be asked is uprightness the child of ignorance is virtue inconsistent with learning what consequences might not be drawn from such suppositions but to reconcile these apparent contradictions we need only examine closely the emptiness and vanity of those pompous titles which are so liberally bestowed on human knowledge and which so blind our judgment let us consider therefore the arts and sciences in themselves let us see what must result from their advancement and let us not hesitate to admit the truth of all those points on which our arguments coincide with the inductions we can make from history the second part an ancient tradition passed out of egypt into greece that some god who was an enemy to the repose of mankind was the inventor of the sciences  what must the egyptians among whom the sciences first arose have thought of them and they beheld near at hand the sources from which they sprang in fact whether we turn to the annals of the world or eke out with philosophical investigations the uncertain chronicles of history we shall not find for human knowledge an origin answering to the idea we are pleased to entertain of it at present astronomy was born of superstition eloquence of ambition hatred falsehood and flattery geometry of avarice physics of an idle curiosity and even moral philosophy of human pride thus the arts and sciences owe their birth to our vices we should be less doubtful of their advantages if they had sprung from our virtues     their evil origin is indeed but too plainly reproduced in their objects what would become of the arts were they not cherished by luxury if men were not unjust of what use were jurisprudence what would become of history if there were no tyrants wars or conspiracies in a word who would pass his life in barren speculations if everybody attentive only to the obligations of humanity and the necessities of nature spent his whole life in serving his country obliging his friends and relieving the unhappy are we then made to live and die on the brink of that well at the bottom of which truth lies hid this reflection alone is in my opinion enough to discourage at first setting out every man who seriously endeavours to instruct himself by the study of philosophy what a variety of dangers surrounds us what a number of wrong paths present themselves in the investigation of the sciences through how many errors more perilous than truth itself is useful must we not pass to arrive at it the disadvantages we lie under are evident for falsehood is capable of an infinite variety of combinations but the truth has only one manner of being besides where is the man who sincerely desires to find it or even admitting his good will by what characteristic marks is he sure of knowing it amid the infinite diversity of opinions where is the criterion  by which we may certainly judge of it again what is still more difficult should we even be fortunate enough to discover it who among us will know how to make right use of it if our sciences are futile in the objects they propose they are no less dangerous in the effects they produce being the effect of idleness they generate idleness in their turn and an irreparable loss of time is the first prejudice which they must necessarily cause to society to live without doing some good is a great evil as well in the political as in the moral world and hence every useless citizen should be regarded as a pernicious person tell me then illustrious philosophers of whom we learn the     ratios in which attraction acts in vacuo and in the revolution of the planets the relations of spaces traversed in equal times by whom we are taught what curves have conjugate points points of inflexion and cusps how the soul and body correspond like two clocks without actual communication what planets may be inhabited and what insects reproduce in an extraordinary manner answer me i say you from whom we receive all this sublime information whether we should have been less numerous worse governed less formidable less flourishing or more perverse supposing you had taught us none of all these fine things reconsider therefore the importance of your productions and since the labours of the most enlightened of our learned men and the best of our citizens are of so little utility tell us what we ought to think of that numerous herd of obscure writers and useless littérateurs who devour without any return the substance of the state useless do i say would god they were society would be more peaceful and morals less corrupt but these vain and futile declaimers go forth on all sides armed with their fatal paradoxes to sap the foundations of our faith and nullify virtue they smile contemptuously at such old names as patriotism and religion and consecrate their talents and philosophy to the destruction and defamation of all that men hold sacred not that they bear any real hatred to virtue or dogma they are the enemies of public opinion alone to bring them to the foot of the altar it would be enough to banish them to a land of atheists what extravagancies will not the rage of singularity induce men to commit the waste of time is certainly a great evil but still greater evils attend upon literature and the arts one is luxury produced like them by indolence and vanity luxury is seldom unattended by the arts and sciences and they are always attended by luxury i know that our philosophy fertile in paradoxes pretends in contradiction to the experience of all ages that luxury contributes to the splendour of states but without insisting on the necessity of sumptuary laws can it be denied that rectitude of morals is essential to the duration of empires and that luxury is diametrically opposed to such rectitude     let it be admitted that luxury is a certain indication of wealth that it even serves if you will to increase such wealth what conclusion is to be drawn from this paradox so worthy of the times and what will become of virtue if riches are to be acquired at any cost the politicians of the ancient world were always talking of morals and virtue ours speak of nothing but commerce and money one of them will tell you that in such a country a man is worth just as much as he will sell for at algiers another pursuing the same mode of calculation finds that in some countries a man is worth nothing and in others still less than nothing they value men as they do droves of oxen according to them a man is worth no more to the state than the amount he consumes and thus a sybarite would be worth at least thirty lacedæmonians let these writers tell me however which of the two republics sybaris or sparta was subdued by a handful of peasants and which became the terror of asia the monarchy of cyrus was conquered by thirty thousand men led by a prince poorer than the meanest of persian satraps in like manner the scythians the poorest of all nations were able to resist the most powerful monarchs of the universe when two famous republics contended for the empire of the world the one rich and the other poor the former was subdued by the latter the roman empire in its turn after having engulfed all the riches of the universe fell a prey to peoples who knew not even what riches were the franks conquered the gauls and the saxons england without any other treasures than their bravery and their poverty a band of poor mountaineers whose whole cupidity was confined to the possession of a few sheepskins having first given a check to the arrogance of austria went on to crush the opulent and formidable house of burgundy which at that time made the potentates of europe tremble in short all the power and wisdom of the heir of charles the fifth backed by all the treasures of the indies broke before a few herringfishers let our politicians condescend to lay aside their calculations for a moment to reflect on these examples let them learn for once that money though it buys everything else cannot buy morals and citizens what then is the precise point in dispute about luxury     it is to know which is most advantageous to empires that their existence should be brilliant and momentary or virtuous and lasting i say brilliant but with what lustre a taste for ostentation never prevails in the same minds as a taste for honesty no it is impossible that understandings degraded by a multitude of futile cares should ever rise to what is truly great and noble even if they had the strength they would want the courage every artist loves applause the praise of his contemporaries is the most valuable part of his recompense what then will he do to obtain it if he have the misfortune to be born among a people and at a time when learning is in vogue and the superficiality of youth is in a position to lead the fashion when men have sacrificed their taste to those who tyrannise over their liberty and one sex dare not approve anything but what is proportionate to the pusillanimity of the other  when the greatest masterpieces of dramatic poetry are condemned and the noblest of musical productions neglected this is what he will do he will lower his genius to the level of the age and will rather submit to compose mediocre works that will be admired during his lifetime than labour at sublime achievements which will not be admired till long after he is dead let the famous voltaire tell us how many nervous and masculine beauties he has sacrificed to our false delicacy and how much that is great and noble that spirit of gallantry which delights in what is frivolous and petty has cost him it is thus that the dissolution of morals the necessary consequence of luxury brings with it in its turn the corruption of taste further if by chance there be found     among men of average ability an individual with enough strength of mind to refuse to comply with the spirit of the age and to debase himself by puerile productions his lot will be hard he will die in indigence and oblivion this is not so much a prediction as a fact already confirmed by experience yes carle and pierre vanloo the time is already come when your pencils destined to increase the majesty of our temples by sublime and holy images must fall from your hands or else be prostituted to adorn the panels of a coach with lascivious paintings and you inimitable pigal rival of phidias and praxiteles whose chisel the ancients would have employed to carve them gods whose images almost excuse their idolatry in our eyes even your hand must condescend to fashion the belly of an ape or else remain idle we cannot reflect on the morality of mankind without contemplating with pleasure the picture of the simplicity which prevailed in the earliest times this image may be justly compared to a beautiful coast adorned only by the hands of nature towards which our eyes are constantly turned and which we see receding with regret while men were innocent and virtuous and loved to have the gods for witnesses of their actions they dwelt together in the same huts but when they became vicious they grew tired of such inconvenient onlookers and banished them to magnificent temples finally they expelled their deities even from these in order to dwell there themselves or at least the temples of the gods were no longer more magnificent than the palaces of the citizens this was the height of degeneracy nor could vice ever be carried to greater lengths than when it was seen supported as it were at the doors of the great on columns of marble and graven on corinthian capitals as the conveniences of life increase as the arts are brought to perfection and luxury spreads true courage flags the virtues disappear and all this is the effect of the sciences and of those arts which are exercised in the privacy of mens dwellings when the goths ravaged greece the libraries only escaped the flames owing to an opinion that was set on foot among them that it was best to leave the enemy with a possession so calculated to divert their attention from military exercises     and keep them engaged in indolent and sedentary occupations charles the eighth found himself master of tuscany and the kingdom of naples almost without drawing sword and all his court attributed this unexpected success to the fact that the princes and nobles of italy applied themselves with greater earnestness to the cultivation of their understandings than to active and martial pursuits in fact says the sensible person who records these characteristics experience plainly tells us that in military matters and all that resemble them application to the sciences tends rather to make men effeminate and cowardly than resolute and vigorous the romans confessed that military virtue was extinguished among them in proportion as they became connoisseurs in the arts of the painter the engraver and the goldsmith and began to cultivate the fine arts indeed as if this famous country was to be for ever an example to other nations the rise of the medici and the revival of letters has once more destroyed this time perhaps for ever the martial reputation which italy seemed a few centuries ago to have recovered the ancient republics of greece with that wisdom which was so conspicuous in most of their institutions forbade their citizens to pursue all those inactive and sedentary occupations which by enervating and corrupting the body diminish also the vigour of the mind with what courage in fact can it be thought that hunger and thirst fatigues dangers and death can be faced by men whom the smallest want overwhelms and the slightest difficulty repels with what resolution can soldiers support the excessive toils of war when they are entirely unaccustomed to them with what spirits can they make forced marches under officers who have not even the strength to travel on horseback it is no answer to cite the reputed valour of all the modern warriors who are so scientifically trained i hear much of their bravery in a days battle but i am told nothing of how they support excessive fatigue how they stand the severity of the seasons and the inclemency of the weather a little sunshine or snow or the want of a few superfluities is enough to cripple and destroy one of our finest armies in a few days intrepid     warriors permit me for once to tell you the truth which you seldom hear of your bravery i am fully satisfied i have no doubt that you would have triumphed with hannibal at cannæ and at trasimene that you would have passed the rubicon with cæsar and enabled him to enslave his country but you never would have been able to cross the alps with the former or with the latter to subdue your own ancestors the gauls a war does not always depend on the events of battle there is in generalship an art superior to that of gaining victories a man may behave with great intrepidity under fire and yet be a very bad officer even in the common soldier a little more strength and vigour would perhaps be more useful than so much courage which after all is no protection from death and what does it matter to the state whether its troops perish by cold and fever or by the sword of the enemy if the cultivation of the sciences is prejudicial to military qualities it is still more so to moral qualities even from our infancy an absurd system of education serves to adorn our wit and corrupt our judgment we see on every side huge institutions where our youth are educated at great expense and instructed in everything but their duty your children will be ignorant of their own language when they can talk others which are not spoken anywhere they will be able to compose verses which they can hardly understand and without being capable of distinguishing truth from error they will possess the art of making them unrecognisable by specious arguments but magnanimity equity temperance humanity and courage will be words of which they know not the meaning the dear name of country will never strike on their ears and if they ever hear speak of god  it will be less to fear than to be frightened of him i would as soon said a wise man that my pupil had spent his time in the tennis court as in this manner for there his body at least would have got exercise i well know that children ought to be kept employed and that idleness is for them the danger most to be feared but what should they be taught this is undoubtedly an     important question let them be taught what they are to practise when they come to be men  not what they ought to forget our gardens are adorned with statues and our galleries with pictures what would you imagine these masterpieces of art thus exhibited to public admiration represent the great men who have defended their country or the still greater men who have enriched it by their virtues far from it they are the images of every perversion of heart and mind carefully selected from ancient mythology and presented to the early curiosity of our children doubtless that they may have before their eyes the representations of vicious actions even before they are able to read     whence arise all those abuses unless it be from that fatal inequality introduced among men by the difference of talents and the cheapening of virtue this is the most evident effect of all our studies and the most dangerous of all their consequences the question is no longer whether a man is honest but whether he is clever we do not ask whether a book is useful but whether it is wellwritten rewards are lavished on with and ingenuity while virtue is left unhonoured there are a thousand prizes for fine discourses and none for good actions i should be glad however to know whether the honour attaching to the best discourse that ever wins the prize in this academy is comparable with the merit of having founded the prize a wise man does not go in chase of fortune but he is by no means insensible to glory and when he sees it so ill distributed his virtue which might have been animated by a little emulation and turned to the advantage of society droops and dies away in obscurity and indigence it is for this reason that the agreeable arts must in time everywhere be preferred to the useful and this truth has been but too much confirmed since the revival of the arts and sciences we have physicists geometricians chemists astronomers poets musicians and painters in plenty but we have no longer a citizen among us or if there be found a few scattered over our abandoned countryside they are left to perish there unnoticed and neglected such is the condition to which we are reduced and such are our feelings towards those who give us our daily bread and our children milk i confess however that the evil is not so great as it might have become the eternal providence in placing salutary simples beside noxious plants and making poisonous animals contain their own antidote has taught the sovereigns of the earth who are its ministers to imitate its wisdom it is by following this example that the truly great monarch to whose glory every age will add new lustre drew from the very bosom of the arts and sciences the very fountains of a thousand lapses from rectitude those famous societies which while they are depositaries of the dangerous trust of human knowledge are yet the sacred guardians of morals by the attention   0 they pay to their maintenance among themselves in all their purity and by the demands which they make on every member whom they admit these wise institutions confirmed by his august successor and imitated by all the kings of europe will serve at least to restrain men of letters who all aspiring to the honour of being admitted into these academies will keep watch over themselves and endeavour to make themselves worthy of such honour by useful performances and irreproachable morals those academies also which in proposing prizes for literary merit make choice of such subjects as are calculated to arouse the love of virtue in the hearts of citizens prove that it prevails in themselves and must give men the rare and real pleasure of finding learned societies devoting themselves to the enlightenment of mankind not only by agreeable exercises of the intellect but also by useful instructions an objection which may be made is in fact only an additional proof of my argument so much precaution proves but too evidently the need for it we never seek remedies for evils that do not exist why indeed must these bear all the marks of ordinary remedies on account of their inefficacy the numerous establishments in favour of the learned are only adapted to make men mistake the objects of the sciences and turn mens attention to the cultivation of them one would be inclined to think from the precautions everywhere taken that we are overstocked with husbandmen and are afraid of a shortage of philosophers i will not venture here to enter into a comparison between agriculture and philosophy as they would not bear it i shall only ask what is philosophy what is contained in the writings of the most celebrated philosophers what are the lessons of these friends of wisdom to hear them should we not take them for so many mountebanks exhibiting themselves in public and crying out here here come to me i am the only true doctor one of them teaches that there is no such thing as matter but that everything exists only in representation another declares that there is no other substance than matter and no other god than the world itself a third tells you that there are no such things as virtue and vice and that moral good and evil     are chimeras while a fourth informs you that men are only beasts of prey and may conscientiously devour one another why my great philosophers do you not reserve these wise and profitable lessons for your friends and children you would soon reap the benefit of them nor should we be under any apprehension of our own becoming your disciples such are the wonderful men whom their contemporaries held in the highest esteem during their lives and to whom immortality has been attributed since their decease such are the wise maxims we have received from them and which are transmitted from age to age to our descendants paganism though given over to all the extravagances of human reason has left nothing to compare with the shameful monuments which have been prepared by the art of printing during the reign of the gospel the impious writings of leucippus and diagoras perished with their authors the world in their days was ignorant of the art of immortalising the errors and extravagancies of the human mind but thanks to the art of printing  and the use we make of it the pernicious reflections of hobbes and spinoza will last for ever go famous writings of which the ignorance and rusticity of our forefathers would have been incapable go to our descendants along with those still more pernicious works which reek of the corrupted manners of the present age let them together convey to posterity a faithful history of the progress and     advantages of our arts and sciences if they are read they will leave not a doubt about the question we are now discussing and unless mankind should then be still more foolish than we they will lift up their hands to heaven and exclaim in bitterness of heart almighty god thou who holdest in thy hand the minds of men deliver us from the fatal arts and sciences of our forefathers give us back ignorance innocence and poverty which alone can make us happy and are precious in thy sight but if the progress of the arts and sciences has added nothing to our real happiness if it has corrupted our morals and if that corruption has vitiated our taste what are we to think of the herd of textbook authors who have removed those impediments which nature purposely laid in the way to the temple of the muses in order to guard its approach and try the powers of those who might be tempted to seek knowledge what are we to think of those compilers who have indiscreetly broken open the door of the sciences and introduced into their sanctuary a populace unworthy to approach it when it was greatly to be wished that all who should be found incapable of making a considerable progress in the career of learning should have been repulsed at the entrance and thereby cast upon those arts which are useful to society a man who will be all his life a bad versifier or a thirdrate geometrician might have made nevertheless an excellent clothier those whom nature intended for her disciples have not needed masters bacon descartes and newton those teachers of mankind had themselves no teachers what guide indeed could have taken them so far as their sublime genius directed them ordinary masters would only have cramped their intelligence by confining it within the narrow limits of their own capacity it was from the obstacles they met with at first that they learned to exert themselves and bestirred themselves to traverse the vast field which they covered if it be proper to allow some men to apply themselves to the study of the arts and sciences it is only those who feel themselves able to walk alone in their footsteps and to outstrip them it belongs only to these few to raise monuments to the glory of the human understanding but if we are desirous that nothing should be above their genius nothing should be     beyond their hopes this is the only encouragement they require the soul insensibly adapts itself to the objects on which it is employed and thus it is that great occasions produce great men the greatest orator in the world was consul of rome and perhaps the greatest of philosophers lord chancellor of england can it be conceived that if the former had only been a professor at some university and the latter a pensioner of some academy their works would not have suffered from their situation let not princes disdain to admit into their councils those who are most capable of giving them good advice let them renounce the old prejudice which was invented by the pride of the great that the art of governing mankind is more difficult than that of instructing them as if it was easier to induce men to do good voluntarily than to compel them to it by force let the learned of the first rank find an honourable refuge in their courts let them there enjoy the only recompense worthy of them that of promoting by their influence the happiness of the peoples they have enlightened by their wisdom it is by this means only that we are likely to see what virtue science and authority can do when animated by the noblest emulation and working unanimously for the happiness of mankind but so long as power alone is on one side and knowledge and understanding alone on the other the learned will seldom make great objects their study princes will still more rarely do great actions and the peoples will continue to be as they are mean corrupt and miserable as for us ordinary men on whom heaven has not been pleased to bestow such great talents as we are not destined to reap such glory let us remain in our obscurity let us not covet a reputation we should never attain and which in the present state of things would never make up to us for the trouble it would have cost us even if we were fully qualified to obtain it why should we build our happiness on the opinions of others when we can find it in our own hearts let us leave to others the task of instructing mankind in their duty and confine ourselves to the discharge of our own we have no occasion for greater knowledge than this virtue sublime science of simple minds are such     industry and preparation needed if we are to know you are not your principles graven on every heart need we do more to learn your laws than examine ourselves and listen to the voice of conscience when the passions are silent this is the true philosophy with which we must learn to be content without envying the fame of those celebrated men whose names are immortal in the republic of letters let us instead of envying them endeavour to make between them and us that honourable distinction which was formerly seen to exist between two great peoples that the one knew how to speak and the other how to act aright     a discourse on a subject proposed by the academy of dijon what is the origin of inequality among men and is it authorised by natural law non in depravatis sed in his quæ bene secundum naturam se habent considerandum est quid sit naturale aristotle politics bk i ch   we should consider what is natural not in things which are depraved but in those which are rightly ordered according to nature         dedication to the republic of geneva most honourable magnificent and sovereign lords convinced that only a virtuous citizen can confer on his country honours which it can accept i have been for thirty years past working to make myself worthy to offer you some public homage and this fortunate opportunity supplementing in some degree the insufficiency of my efforts i have thought myself entitled to follow in embracing it the dictates of the zeal which inspires me rather than the right which should have been my authorisation having had the happiness to be born among you how could i reflect on the equality which nature has ordained between men and the inequality which they have introduced without reflecting on the profound wisdom by which both are in this state happily combined and made to coincide in the manner that is most in conformity with natural law and most favourable to society to the maintenance of public order and to the happiness of individuals in my researches after the best rules common sense can lay down for the constitution of a government i have been so struck at finding them all in actuality in your own that even had i not been born within your walls i should have thought it indispensable for me to offer this picture of human society to that people which of all others seems to be possessed of its greatest advantages and to have best guarded against its abuses if i had had to make choice of the place of my birth i should have preferred a society which had an extent proportionate to the limits of the human faculties that is to the possibility of being well governed in which every person being equal to his occupation no one should be obliged to commit to others the functions with which he was entrusted a state in which all the individuals being     well known to one another neither the secret machinations of vice nor the modesty of virtue should be able to escape the notice and judgment of the public and in which the pleasant custom of seeing and knowing one another should make the love of country rather a love of the citizens than of its soil i should have wished to be born in a country in which the interest of the sovereign and that of the people must be single and identical to the end that all the movements of the machine might tend always to the general happiness and as this could not be the case unless the sovereign and the people were one and the same person it follows that i should have wished to be born under a democratic government wisely tempered i should have wished to live and die free that is so far subject to the laws that neither i nor anybody else should be able to cast off their honourable yoke the easy and salutary yoke which the haughtiest necks bear with the greater docility as they are made to bear no other i should have wished then that no one within the state should be able to say he was above the law and that no one without should be able to dictate so that the state should be obliged to recognise his authority for be the constitution of a government what it may if there be within its jurisdiction a single man who is not subject to the law all the rest are necessarily at his discretion and if there be a national ruler within and a foreign ruler without however they may divide their authority it is impossible that both should be duly obeyed or that the state should be well governed i should not have chosen to live in a republic of recent institution however excellent its laws for fear the government being perhaps otherwise framed than the circumstances of the moment might require might disagree with the new citizens or they with it and the state run the risk of overthrow and destruction almost as soon as it came into being for it is with liberty as it is with those solid and succulent foods or with those generous wines which are well adapted to nourish and fortify robust constitutions that are used to them but ruin and intoxicate weak and delicate constitutions to which they are not suited peoples once accustomed to masters are not     in a condition to do without them if they attempt to shake off the yoke they still more estrange themselves from freedom as by mistaking for it an unbridled license to which it is diametrically opposed they nearly always manage by their revolutions to hand themselves over to seducers who only make their chains heavier than before the roman people itself a model for all free peoples was wholly incapable of governing itself when it escaped from the oppression of the tarquins debased by slavery and the ignominious tasks which had been imposed upon it it was at first no better than a stupid mob which it was necessary to control and govern with the greatest wisdom in order that being accustomed by degrees to breathe the healthgiving air of liberty minds which had been enervated or rather brutalised under tyranny might gradually acquire that severity of morals and spirit of fortitude which made it at length the people of all most worthy of respect i should then have sought out for my country some peaceful and happy republic of an antiquity that lost itself as it were in the night of time which had experienced only such shocks as served to manifest and strengthen the courage and patriotism of its subjects and whose citizens long accustomed to a wise independence were not only free but worthy to be so i should have wished to choose myself a country diverted by a fortunate impotence from the brutal love of conquest and secured by a still more fortunate situation from the fear of becoming itself the conquest of other states a free city situated between several nations none of which should have any interest in attacking it while each had an interest in preventing it from being attacked by the others in short a republic which should have nothing to tempt the ambition of its neighbours but might reasonably depend on their assistance in case of need it follows that a republican state so happily situated could have nothing to fear but from itself and that if its members trained themselves to the use of arms it would be rather to keep alive that military ardour and courageous spirit which are so proper among freemen and tend to keep up their taste for liberty than from the necessity of providing for their defence i should have sought a country in which the right of   0 legislation was vested in all the citizens for who can judge better than they of the conditions under which they had best dwell together in the same society not that i should have approved of plebiscita like those among the romans in which the rulers in the state and those most interested in its preservation were excluded from the deliberations on which in many cases its security depended and in which by the most absurd inconsistency the magistrates were deprived of rights which the meanest citizens enjoyed on the contrary i should have desired that in order to prevent selfinterested and illconceived projects and all such dangerous innovations as finally ruined the athenians each man should not be at liberty to propose new laws at pleasure but that this right should belong exclusively to the magistrates and that even they should use it with so much caution the people on its side be so reserved in giving its consent to such laws and the promulgation of them be attended with so much solemnity that before the constitution could be upset by them there might be time enough for all to be convinced that it is above all the great antiquity of the laws which makes them sacred and venerable that men soon learn to despise laws which they see daily altered and that states by accustoming themselves to neglect their ancient customs under the pretext of improvement often introduce greater evils than those they endeavour to remove i should have particularly avoided as necessarily illgoverned a republic in which the people imagining themselves in a position to do without magistrates or at least to leave them with only a precarious authority should imprudently have kept for themselves the administration of civil affairs and the execution of their own laws such must have been the rude constitution of primitive governments directly emerging from a state of nature and this was another of the vices that contributed to the downfall of the republic of athens but i should have chosen a community in which the individuals content with sanctioning their laws and deciding the most important public affairs in general assembly and on the motion of the rulers had established honoured tribunals carefully distinguished the several departments     and elected year by year some of the most capable and upright of their fellowcitizens to administer justice and govern the state a community in short in which the virtue of the magistrates thus bearing witness to the wisdom of the people each class reciprocally did the other honour if in such a case any fatal misunderstandings arose to disturb the public peace even these intervals of blindness and error would bear the marks of moderation mutual esteem and a common respect for the laws which are sure signs and pledges of a reconciliation as lasting as sincere such are the advantages most honourable magnificent and sovereign lords which i should have sought in the country in which i should have chosen to be born and if providence had added to all these a delightful situation a temperate climate a fertile soil and the most beautiful countryside under heaven i should have desired only to complete my felicity the peaceful enjoyment of all these blessings in the bosom of this happy country to live at peace in the sweet society of my fellowcitizens and practising towards them from their own example the duties of friendship humanity and every other virtue to leave behind me the honourable memory of a good man and an upright and virtuous patriot but if less fortunate or too late grown wise i had seen myself reduced to end an infirm and languishing life in other climates vainly regretting that peaceful repose which i had forfeited in the imprudence of youth i should at least have entertained the same feelings in my heart though denied the opportunity of making use of them in my native country filled with a tender and disinterested love for my distant fellowcitizens i should have addressed them from my heart much in the following terms my dear fellowcitizens or rather my brothers since the ties of blood as well as the laws unite almost all of us it gives me pleasure that i cannot think of you without thinking at the same time of all the blessings you enjoy and of which none of you perhaps more deeply feels the value than i who have lost them the more i reflect on your civil and political condition the less can i conceive that the nature of human affairs could admit of a better in all other governments when there is a question of ensuring the greatest good of the state     nothing gets beyond projects and ideas or at best bare possibilities but as for you your happiness is complete and you have nothing to do but enjoy it you require nothing more to be made perfectly happy than to know how to be satisfied with being so your sovereignty acquired or recovered by the sword and maintained for two centuries past by your valour and wisdom is at length fully and universally acknowledged your boundaries are fixed your rights confirmed and your repose secured by honourable treaties your constitution is excellent being not only dictated by the profoundest wisdom but guaranteed by great and friendly powers your state enjoys perfect tranquillity you have neither wars nor conquerors to fear you have no other master than the wise laws you have yourselves made and these are administered by upright magistrates of your own choosing you are neither so wealthy as to be enervated by effeminacy and thence to lose in the pursuit of frivolous pleasures the taste for real happiness and solid virtue nor poor enough to require more assistance from abroad than your own industry is sufficient to procure you in the meantime the precious privilege of liberty which in great nations is maintained only by submission to the most exorbitant impositions costs you hardly anything for its preservation may a republic so wisely and happily constituted last for ever for an example to other nations and for the felicity of its own citizens this is the only prayer you have left to make the only precaution that remains to be taken it depends for the future on yourselves alone not to make you happy for your ancestors have saved you that trouble but to render that happiness lasting by your wisdom in its enjoyment it is on your constant union your obedience to the laws and your respect for their ministers that your preservation depends if there remains among you the smallest trace of bitterness or distrust hasten to destroy it as an accursed leaven which sooner or later must bring misfortune and ruin on the state i conjure you all to look into your hearts and to hearken to the secret voice of conscience is there any among you who can find throughout the universe a more upright more enlightened and more honourable body than your magistracy do not all its members set you an     example of moderation of simplicity of manners of respect for the laws and of the most sincere harmony place therefore without reserve in such wise superiors that salutary confidence which reason ever owes to virtue consider that they are your own choice that they justify that choice and that the honours due to those whom you have dignified are necessarily yours by reflexion not one of you is so ignorant as not to know that when the laws lose their force and those who defend them their authority security and liberty are universally impossible why therefore should you hesitate to do that cheerfully and with just confidence which you would all along have been bound to do by your true interest your duty and reason itself let not a culpable and pernicious indifference to the maintenance of the constitution ever induce you to neglect in case of need the prudent advice of the most enlightened and zealous of your fellowcitizens but let equity moderation and firmness of resolution continue to regulate all your proceedings and to exhibit you to the whole universe as the example of a valiant and modest people jealous equally of their honour and of their liberty beware particularly as the last piece of advice i shall give you of sinister constructions and venomous rumours the secret motives of which are often more dangerous than the actions at which they are levelled a whole house will be awake and take the first alarm given by a good and trusty watchdog who barks only at the approach of thieves but we hate the importunity of those noisy curs which are perpetually disturbing the public repose and whose continual illtimed warnings prevent our attending to them when they may perhaps be necessary and you most honourable and magnificent lords the worthy and revered magistrates of a free people permit me to offer you in particular my duty and homage if there is in the world a station capable of conferring honour on those who fill it it is undoubtedly that which virtue and talents combine to bestow that of which you have made yourselves worthy and to which you have been promoted by your fellowcitizens their worth adds a new lustre to your own while as you have been chosen by men capable of governing others to govern themselves i cannot but     hold you as much superior to all other magistrates as a free people and particularly that over which you have the honour to preside is by its wisdom and its reason superior to the populace of other states be it permitted me to cite an example of which there ought to have existed better records and one which will be ever near to my heart i cannot recall to mind without the sweetest emotions the memory of that virtuous citizen to whom i owe my being and by whom i was often instructed in my infancy in the respect which is due to you i see him still living by the work of his hands and feeding his soul on the sublimest truths i see the works of tacitus plutarch and grotius lying before him in the midst of the tools of his trade at his side stands his dear son receiving alas with too little profit the tender instructions of the best of fathers but if the follies of youth made me for a while forget his wise lessons i have at length the happiness to be conscious that whatever propensity one may have to vice it is not easy for an education with which love has mingled to be entirely thrown away such my most honourable and magnificent lords are the citizens and even the common inhabitants of the state which you govern such are those intelligent and sensible men of whom under the name of workmen and the people it is usual in other nations to have a low and false opinion my father i own with pleasure was in no way distinguished among his fellowcitizens he was only such as they all are and yet such as he was there is no country in which his acquaintance would not have been coveted and cultivated even with advantage by men of the highest character it would not become me nor is it thank heaven at all necessary for me to remind you of the regard which such men have a right to expect of their magistrates to whom they are equal both by education and by the rights of nature and birth and inferior only by their own will by that preference which they owe to your merit and for giving you can claim some sort of acknowledgment on your side it is with a lively satisfaction i understand that the greatest candour and condescension attend in all your behaviour towards them on that gravity which becomes the ministers of the law and that you so well     repay them by your esteem and attention the respect and obedience which they owe to you this conduct is not only just but prudent as it happily tends to obliterate the memory of many unhappy events which ought to be buried in eternal oblivion it is also so much the more judicious as it tends to make this generous and equitable people find a pleasure in their duty to make them naturally love to do you honour and to cause those who are the most zealous in the maintenance of their own rights to be at the same time the most disposed to respect yours it ought not to be thought surprising that the rulers of a civil society should have the welfare and glory of their communities at heart but it is uncommonly fortunate for the peace of men when those persons who look upon themselves as the magistrates or rather the masters of a more holy and sublime country show some love for the earthly country which maintains them i am happy in having it in my power to make so singular an exception in our favour and to be able to rank among its best citizens those zealous depositaries of the sacred articles of faith established by the laws those venerable shepherds of souls whose powerful and captivating eloquence are so much the better calculated to bear to mens hearts the maxims of the gospel as they are themselves the first to put them into practice all the world knows of the great success with which the art of the pulpit is cultivated at geneva but men are so used to hearing divines preach one thing and practise another that few have a chance of knowing how far the spirit of christianity holiness of manners severity towards themselves and indulgence towards their neighbours prevail throughout the whole body of our ministers it is perhaps given to the city of geneva alone to produce the edifying example of so perfect a union between its clergy and men of letters it is in great measure on their wisdom their known moderation and their zeal for the prosperity of the state that i build my hopes of its perpetual tranquillity at the same time i notice with a pleasure mingled with surprise and veneration how much they detest the frightful maxims of those accursed and barbarous men of whom history furnishes us with more than one example who in order     to support the pretended rights of god that is to say their own interests have been so much the less greedy of human blood as they were more hopeful their own in particular would be always respected i must not forget that precious half of the republic which makes the happiness of the other and whose sweetness and prudence preserve its tranquillity and virtue amiable and virtuous daughters of geneva it will be always the lot of your sex to govern ours happy are we so long as your chaste influence solely exercised within the limits of conjugal union is exerted only for the glory of the state and the happiness of the public it was thus the female sex commanded at sparta and thus you deserve to command at geneva what man can be such a barbarian as to resist the voice of honour and reason coming from the lips of an affectionate wife who would not despise the vanities of luxury on beholding the simple and modest attire which from the lustre it derives from you seems the most favourable to beauty it is your task to perpetuate by your insinuating influence and your innocent and amiable rule a respect for the laws of the state and harmony among the citizens it is yours to reunite divided families by happy marriages and above all things to correct by the persuasive sweetness of your lessons and the modest graces of your conversation those extravagancies which our young people pick up in other countries whence instead of many useful things by which they might profit they bring home hardly anything besides a puerile air and a ridiculous manner acquired among loose women but an admiration for i know not what socalled grandeur and paltry recompenses for being slaves which can never come near the real greatness of liberty continue therefore always to be what you are the chaste guardians of our morals and the sweet security for our peace exerting on every occasion the privileges of the heart and of nature in the interests of duty and virtue i flatter myself that i shall never be proved to have been mistaken in building on such a foundation my hopes of the general happiness of the citizens and the glory of the republic it must be confessed however that with all these advantages it will not shine with that lustre by which the eyes of most men are dazzled a puerile and     fatal taste for which is the most mortal enemy of happiness and liberty let our dissolute youth seek elsewhere light pleasures and long repentances let our pretenders to taste admire elsewhere the grandeur of palaces the beauty of equipages sumptuous furniture the pomp of public entertainments and all the refinements of luxury and effeminacy geneva boasts nothing but men such a sight has nevertheless a value of its own and those who have a taste for it are well worth the admirers of all the rest deign most honourable magnificent and sovereign lords to receive and with equal goodness this respectful testimony of the interest i take in your common prosperity and if i have been so unhappy as to be guilty of any indiscreet transport in this glowing effusion of my heart i beseech you to pardon me and to attribute it to the tender affection of a true patriot and to the ardent and legitimate zeal of a man who can imagine for himself no greater felicity than to see you happy most honourable magnificent and sovereign lords i am with the most profound respect your most humble and obedient servant and fellowcitizen j j rousseau chambéry june             preface of all human sciences the most useful and most imperfect appears to me to be that of mankind and i will venture to say the single inscription on the temple of delphi contained a precept more difficult and more important than is to be found in all the huge volumes that moralists have ever written i consider the subject of the following discourse as one of the most interesting questions philosophy can propose and unhappily for us one of the most thorny that philosophers can have to solve for how shall we know the source of inequality between men if we do not begin by knowing mankind and how shall man hope to see himself as nature made him across all the changes which the succession of place and time must have produced in his original constitution how can he distinguish what is fundamental in his nature from the changes and additions which his circumstances and the advances he has made have introduced to modify his primitive condition like the statue of glaucus which was so disfigured by time seas and tempests that it looked more like a wild beast than a god the human soul altered in society by a thousand causes perpetually recurring by the acquisition of a multitude of truths and errors by the changes happening to the constitution of the body and by the continual jarring of the passions has so to speak changed in appearance so as to be hardly recognisable instead of a being acting constantly from fixed and invariable principles instead of that celestial and majestic simplicity impressed on it by its divine author we find in it only the frightful contrast of passion mistaking itself for reason and of understanding grown delirious it is still more cruel that as every advance made by the human species removes it still farther from its primitive state the more discoveries we make the more we deprive     ourselves of the means of making the most important of all thus it is in one sense by our very study of man that the knowledge of him is put out of our power it is easy to perceive that it is in these successive changes in the constitution of man that we must look for the origin of those differences which now distinguish men who it is allowed are as equal among themselves as were the animals of every kind before physical causes had introduced those varieties which are now observable among some of them it is in fact not to be conceived that these primary changes however they may have arisen could have altered all at once and in the same manner every individual of the species it is natural to think that while the condition of some of them grew better or worse and they were acquiring various good or bad qualities not inherent in their nature there were others who continued a longer time in their original condition such was doubtless the first source of the inequality of mankind which it is much easier to point out thus in general terms than to assign with precision to its actual causes let not my readers therefore imagine that i flatter myself with having seen what it appears to me so difficult to discover i have here entered upon certain arguments and risked some conjectures less in the hope of solving the difficulty than with a view to throwing some light upon it and reducing the question to its proper form others may easily proceed farther on the same road and yet no one find it very easy to get to the end for it is by no means a light undertaking to distinguish properly between what is original and what is artificial in the actual nature of man or to form a true idea of a state which no longer exists perhaps never did exist and probably never will exist and of which it is nevertheless necessary to have true ideas in order to form a proper judgment of our present state it requires indeed more philosophy than can be imagined to enable any one to determine exactly what precautions he ought to take in order to make solid observations on this subject and it appears to me that a good solution of the following problem would be not unworthy of the aristotles and plinys of the present age what experiments would have to be made   0 to discover the natural man and how are those experiments to be made in a state of society so far am i from undertaking to solve this problem that i think i have sufficiently considered the subject to venture to declare beforehand that our greatest philosophers would not be too good to direct such experiments and our most powerful sovereigns to make them such a combination we have very little reason to expect especially attended with the perseverance or rather succession of intelligence and goodwill necessary on both sides to success these investigations which are so difficult to make and have been hitherto so little thought of are nevertheless the only means that remain of obviating a multitude of difficulties which deprive us of the knowledge of the real foundations of human society it is this ignorance of the nature of man which casts so much uncertainty and obscurity on the true definition of natural right for the idea of right says burlamaqui and more particularly that of natural right are ideas manifestly relative to the nature of man it is then from this very nature itself he goes on from the constitution and state of man that we must deduce the first principles of this science we cannot see without surprise and disgust how little agreement there is between the different authors who have treated this great subject among the more important writers there are scarcely two of the same mind about it not to speak of the ancient philosophers who seem to have done their best purposely to contradict one another on the most fundamental principles the roman jurists subjected man and the other animals indiscriminately to the same natural law because they considered under that name rather the law which nature imposes on herself than that which she prescribes to others or rather because of the particular acceptation of the term law among those jurists who seem on this occasion to have understood nothing more by it than the general relations established by nature between all animated beings for their common preservation the moderns understanding by the term law merely a rule prescribed to a moral being that is to say intelligent free and considered in his relations to other beings consequently confine the jurisdiction of natural law to man as the only animal endowed with     reason but defining this law each after his own fashion they have established it on such metaphysical principles that there are very few persons among us capable of comprehending them much less of discovering them for themselves so that the definitions of these learned men all differing in everything else agree only in this that it is impossible to comprehend the law of nature and consequently to obey it without being a very subtle casuist and a profound metaphysician all which is as much as to say that mankind must have employed in the establishment of society a capacity which is acquired only with great difficulty and by very few persons even in a state of society knowing so little of nature and agreeing so ill about the meaning of the word law it would be difficult for us to fix on a good definition of natural law thus all the definitions we meet with in books setting aside their defect in point of uniformity have yet another fault in that they are derived from many kinds of knowledge which men do not possess naturally and from advantages of which they can have no idea until they have already departed from that state modern writers begin by inquiring what rules it would be expedient for men to agree on for their common interest and then give the name of natural law to a collection of these rules without any other proof than the good that would result from their being universally practised this is undoubtedly a simple way of making definitions and of explaining the nature of things by almost arbitrary conveniences but as long as we are ignorant of the natural man it is in vain for us to attempt to determine either the law originally prescribed to him or that which is best adapted to his constitution all we can know with any certainty respecting this law is that if it is to be a law not only the wills of those it obliges must be sensible of their submission to it but also to be natural it must come directly from the voice of nature throwing aside therefore all those scientific books which teach us only to see men such as they have made themselves and contemplating the first and most simple operations of the human soul i think i can perceive in it two principles prior to reason one of them deeply interesting     us in our own welfare and preservation and the other exciting a natural repugnance at seeing any other sensible being and particularly any of our own species suffer pain or death it is from the agreement and combination which the understanding is in a position to establish between these two principles without its being necessary to introduce that of sociability that all the rules of natural right appear to me to be derived—rules which our reason is afterwards obliged to establish on other foundations when by its successive developments it has been led to suppress nature itself in proceeding thus we shall not be obliged to make man a philosopher before he is a man his duties toward others are not dictated to him only by the later lessons of wisdom and so long as he does not resist the internal impulse of compassion he will never hurt any other man nor even any sentient being except on those lawful occasions on which his own preservation is concerned and he is obliged to give himself the preference by this method also we put an end to the timehonoured disputes concerning the participation of animals in natural law for it is clear that being destitute of intelligence and liberty they cannot recognise that law as they partake however in some measure of our nature in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed they ought to partake of natural right so that mankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes it appears in fact that if i am bound to do no injury to my fellowcreatures this is less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings and this quality being common both to men and beasts ought to entitle the latter at least to the privilege of not being wantonly illtreated by the former the very study of the original man of his real wants and the fundamental principles of his duty is besides the only proper method we can adopt to obviate all the difficulties which the origin of moral inequality presents on the true foundations of the body politic on the reciprocal rights of its members and on many other similar topics equally important and obscure if we look at human society with a calm and disinterested eye it seems at first to show us only the violence     of the powerful and the oppression of the weak the mind is shocked at the cruelty of the one or is induced to lament the blindness of the other and as nothing is less permanent in life than those external relations which are more frequently produced by accident than wisdom and which are called weakness or power riches or poverty all human institutions seem at first glance to be founded merely on banks of shifting sand it is only by taking a closer look and removing the dust and sand that surround the edifice that we perceive the immovable basis on which it is raised and learn to respect its foundations now without a serious study of man his natural faculties and their successive development we shall never be able to make these necessary distinctions or to separate in the actual constitution of things that which is the effect of the divine will from the innovations attempted by human art the political and moral investigations therefore to which the important question before us leads are in every respect useful while the hypothetical history of governments affords a lesson equally instructive to mankind in considering what we should have become had we been left to ourselves we should learn to bless him whose gracious hand correcting our institutions and giving them an immovable basis has prevented those disorders which would otherwise have arisen from them and caused our happiness to come from those very sources which seemed likely to involve us in misery   quem te deus esse   jussit et humanâ quâ parte locatus es in re   disce   persius satire iii          a dissertation on the origin and foundation of the inequality of mankind it is of man that i have to speak and the question i am investigating shows me that it is to men that i must address myself for questions of this sort are not asked by those who are afraid to honour truth i shall then confidently uphold the cause of humanity before the wise men who invite me to do so and shall not be dissatisfied if i acquit myself in a manner worthy of my subject and of my judges i conceive that there are two kinds of inequality among the human species one which i call natural or physical because it is established by nature and consists in a difference of age health bodily strength and the qualities of the mind or of the soul and another which may be called moral or political inequality because it depends on a kind of convention and is established or at least authorised by the consent of men this latter consists of the different privileges which some men enjoy to the prejudice of others such as that of being more rich more honoured more powerful or even in a position to exact obedience it is useless to ask what is the source of natural inequality because that question is answered by the simple definition of the word again it is still more useless to inquire whether there is any essential connection between the two inequalities for this would be only asking in other words whether those who command are necessarily better than those who obey and if strength of body or of mind wisdom or virtue are always found in particular individuals in proportion to their power or wealth a question fit perhaps to be discussed by slaves in the hearing of their masters but highly unbecoming to reasonable and free men in search of the truth     the subject of the present discourse therefore is more precisely this to mark in the progress of things the moment at which right took the place of violence and nature became subject to law and to explain by what sequence of miracles the strong came to submit to serve the weak and the people to purchase imaginary repose at the expense of real felicity the philosophers who have inquired into the foundations of society have all felt the necessity of going back to a state of nature but not one of them has got there some of them have not hesitated to ascribe to man in such a state the idea of just and unjust without troubling themselves to show that he must be possessed of such an idea or that it could be of any use to him others have spoken of the natural right of every man to keep what belongs to him without explaining what they meant by belongs others again beginning by giving the strong authority over the weak proceeded directly to the birth of government without regard to the time that must have elapsed before the meaning of the words authority and government could have existed among men every one of them in short constantly dwelling on wants avidity oppression desires and pride has transferred to the state of nature ideas which were acquired in society so that in speaking of the savage they described the social man it has not even entered into the heads of most of our writers to doubt whether the state of nature ever existed but it is clear from the holy scriptures that the first man having received his understanding and commandments immediately from god was not himself in such a state and that if we give such credit to the writings of moses as every christian philosopher ought to give we must deny that even before the deluge men were ever in the pure state of nature unless indeed they fell back into it from some very extraordinary circumstance a paradox which it would be very embarrassing to defend and quite impossible to prove let us begin then by laying facts aside as they do not affect the question the investigations we may enter into in treating this subject must not be considered as historical truths but only as mere conditional and hypothetical reasonings rather calculated to explain the nature     of things than to ascertain their actual origin just like the hypotheses which our physicists daily form respecting the formation of the world religion commands us to believe that god himself having taken men out of a state of nature immediately after the creation they are unequal only because it is his will they should be so but it does not forbid us to form conjectures based solely on the nature of man and the beings around him concerning what might have become of the human race if it had been left to itself this then is the question asked me and that which i propose to discuss in the following discourse as my subject interests mankind in general i shall endeavour to make use of a style adapted to all nations or rather forgetting time and place to attend only to men to whom i am speaking i shall suppose myself in the lyceum of athens repeating the lessons of my masters with plato and xenocrates for judges and the whole human race for audience o man of whatever country you are and whatever your opinions may be behold your history such as i have thought to read it not in books written by your fellowcreatures who are liars but in nature which never lies all that comes from her will be true nor will you meet with anything false unless i have involuntarily put in something of my own the times of which i am going to speak are very remote how much are you changed from what you once were it is so to speak the life of your species which i am going to write after the qualities which you have received which your education and habits may have depraved but cannot have entirely destroyed there is i feel an age at which the individual man would wish to stop you are about to inquire about the age at which you would have liked your whole species to stand still discontented with your present state for reasons which threaten your unfortunate descendants with still greater discontent you will perhaps wish it were in your power to go back and this feeling should be a panegyric on your first ancestors a criticism of your contemporaries and a terror to the unfortunates who will come after you     the first part important as it may be in order to judge rightly of the natural state of man to consider him from his origin and to examine him as it were in the embryo of his species i shall not follow his organisation through its successive developments nor shall i stay to inquire what his animal system must have been at the beginning in order to become at length what it actually is i shall not ask whether his long nails were at first as aristotle supposes only crooked talons whether his whole body like that of a bear was not covered with hair or whether the fact that he walked upon all fours with his looks directed toward the earth confined to a horizon of a few paces did not at once point out the nature and limits of his ideas on this subject i could form none but vague and almost imaginary conjectures comparative anatomy has as yet made too little progress and the observations of naturalists are too uncertain to afford an adequate basis for any solid reasoning so that without having recourse to the supernatural information given us on this head or paying any regard to the changes which must have taken place in the internal as well as the external conformation of man as he applied his limbs to new uses and fed himself on new kinds of food i shall suppose his conformation to have been at all times what it appears to us at this day that he always walked on two legs made use of his hands as we do directed his looks over all nature and measured with his eyes the vast expanse of heaven if we strip this being thus constituted of all the supernatural gifts he may have received and all the artificial faculties he can have acquired only by a long process if we consider him in a word just as he must have come from the hands of nature we behold in him an animal weaker than some and less agile than others but taking him all round the most advantageously organised of any i see him satisfying his hunger at the first oak and slaking his thirst at the first brook finding his bed at the foot of the tree which afforded him a repast and with that all his wants supplied     while the earth was left to its natural fertility and covered with immense forests whose trees were never mutilated by the axe it would present on every side both sustenance and shelter for every species of animal men dispersed up and down among the rest would observe and imitate their industry and thus attain even to the instinct of the beasts with the advantage that whereas every species of brutes was confined to one particular instinct man who perhaps has not any one peculiar to himself would appropriate them all and live upon most of those different foods which other animals shared among themselves and thus would find his subsistence much more easily than any of the rest accustomed from their infancy to the inclemencies of the weather and the rigour of the seasons inured to fatigue and forced naked and unarmed to defend themselves and their prey from other ferocious animals or to escape them by flight men would acquire a robust and almost unalterable constitution the children bringing with them into the world the excellent constitution of their parents and fortifying it by the very exercises which first produced it would thus acquire all the vigour of which the human frame is capable nature in this case treats them exactly as sparta treated the children of her citizens those who come well formed into the world she renders strong and robust and all the rest she destroys differing in this respect from our modern communities in which the state by making children a burden to their parents kills them indiscriminately before they are born the body of a savage man being the only instrument he understands he uses it for various purposes of which ours for want of practice are incapable for our industry deprives us of that force and agility which necessity obliges him to acquire if he had had an axe would he have been able with his naked arm to break so large a branch from a tree if he had had a sling would he have been able to throw a stone with so great velocity if he had had a ladder would he have been so nimble in climbing a tree if he had had a horse would he have been himself so swift of foot give civilised man time to gather all his machines about him and he will no doubt easily beat the savage but if you would see a still more     unequal contest set them together naked and unarmed and you will soon see the advantage of having all our forces constantly at our disposal of being always prepared for every event and of carrying ones self as it were perpetually whole and entire about one hobbes contends that man is naturally intrepid and is intent only upon attacking and fighting another illustrious philosopher holds the opposite and cumberland and puffendorf also affirm that nothing is more timid and fearful than man in the state of nature that he is always in a tremble and ready to fly at the least noise or the slightest movement this may be true of things he does not know and i do not doubt his being terrified by every novelty that presents itself when he neither knows the physical good or evil he may expect from it nor can make a comparison between his own strength and the dangers he is about to encounter such circumstances however rarely occur in a state of nature in which all things proceed in a uniform manner and the face of the earth is not subject to those sudden and continual changes which arise from the passions and caprices of bodies of men living together but savage man living dispersed among other animals and finding himself betimes in a situation to measure his strength with theirs soon comes to compare himself with them and perceiving that he surpasses them more in adroitness than they surpass him in strength learns to be no longer afraid of them set a bear or a wolf against a robust agile and resolute savage as they all are armed with stones and a good cudgel and you will see that the danger will be at least on both sides and that after a few trials of this kind wild beasts which are not fond of attacking each other will not be at all ready to attack man whom they will have found to be as wild and ferocious as themselves with regard to such animals as have really more strength than man has adroitness he is in the same situation as all weaker animals which notwithstanding are still able to subsist except indeed that he has the advantage that being equally swift of foot and finding an almost certain place of refuge in every tree he is at liberty to take or leave it at every encounter and thus to fight or fly as he chooses add to this that it does not appear that any animal naturally makes war on   0 man except in case of selfdefence or excessive hunger or betrays any of those violent antipathies which seem to indicate that one species is intended by nature for the food of another this is doubtless why negroes and savages are so little afraid of the wild beasts they may meet in the woods the caraibs of venezuela among others live in this respect in absolute security and without the smallest inconvenience though they are almost naked francis corréal tells us they expose themselves freely in the woods armed only with bows and arrows but no one has ever heard of one of them being devoured by wild beasts but man has other enemies more formidable against which he is not provided with such means of defence these are the natural infirmities of infancy old age and illness of every kind melancholy proofs of our weakness of which the two first are common to all animals and the last belongs chiefly to man in a state of society with regard to infancy it is observable that the mother carrying her child always with her can nurse it with much greater ease than the females of many other animals which are forced to be perpetually going and coming with great fatigue one way to find subsistence and another to suckle or feed their young it is true that if the woman happens to perish the infant is in great danger of perishing with her but this risk is common to many other species of animals whose young take a long time before they are able to provide for themselves and if our infancy is longer than theirs our lives are longer in proportion so that all things are in this respect fairly equal though there are other rules to be considered regarding the duration of the first period of life and the number of young which do not affect the present subject in old age when men are less active and perspire little the need for food diminishes with the ability to provide it as the savage state also protects them from gout and rheumatism and old age is of all ills that which human aid can least alleviate they cease to be without others perceiving that they are no more and almost without perceiving it themselves with respect to sickness i shall not repeat the vain and false declamations which most healthy people pronounce     against medicine but i shall ask if any solid observations have been made from which it may be justly concluded that in the countries where the art of medicine is most neglected the mean duration of mans life is less than in those where it is most cultivated how indeed can this be the case if we bring on ourselves more diseases than medicine can furnish remedies the great inequality in manner of living the extreme idleness of some and the excessive labour of others the easiness of exciting and gratifying our sensual appetites the too exquisite foods of the wealthy which overheat and fill them with indigestion and on the other hand the unwholesome food of the poor often bad as it is insufficient for their needs which induces them when opportunity offers to eat voraciously and overcharge their stomachs all these together with sitting up late and excesses of every kind immoderate transports of every passion fatigue mental exhaustion the innumerable pains and anxieties inseparable from every condition of life by which the mind of man is incessantly tormented these are too fatal proofs that the greater part of our ills are of our own making and that we might have avoided them nearly all by adhering to that simple uniform and solitary manner of life which nature prescribed if she destined man to be healthy i venture to declare that a state of reflection is a state contrary to nature and that a thinking man is a depraved animal when we think of the good constitution of the savages at least of those whom we have not ruined with our spirituous liquors and reflect that they are troubled with hardly any disorders save wounds and old age we are tempted to believe that in following the history of civil society we shall be telling also that of human sickness such at least was the opinion of plato who inferred from certain remedies prescribed or approved by podalirius and machaon at the siege of troy that several sicknesses which these remedies gave rise to in his time were not then known to mankind and celsus tells us that diet which is now so necessary was first invented by hippocrates being subject therefore to so few causes of sickness man in the state of nature can have no need of remedies and still less of physicians nor is the human race in this     respect worse off than other animals and it is easy to learn from hunters whether they meet with many infirm animals in the course of the chase it is certain they frequently meet with such as carry the marks of having been considerably wounded with many that have had bones or even limbs broken yet have been healed without any other surgical assistance than that of time or any other regimen than that of their ordinary life at the same time their cures seem not to have been less perfect for their not having been tortured by incisions poisoned with drugs or wasted by fasting in short however useful medicine properly administered may be among us it is certain that if the savage when he is sick and left to himself has nothing to hope but from nature he has on the other hand nothing to fear but from his disease which renders his situation often preferable to our own we should beware therefore of confounding the savage man with the men we have daily before our eyes nature treats all the animals left to her care with a predilection that seems to show how jealous she is of that right the horse the cat the bull and even the ass are generally of greater stature and always more robust and have more vigour strength and courage when they run wild in the forests than when bred in the stall by becoming domesticated they lose half these advantages and it seems as if all our care to feed and treat them well serves only to deprave them it is thus with man also as he becomes sociable and a slave he grows weak timid and servile his effeminate way of life totally enervates his strength and courage to this it may be added that there is still a greater difference between savage and civilised man than between wild and tame beasts for men and brutes having been treated alike by nature the several conveniences in which men indulge themselves still more than they do their beasts are so many additional causes of their deeper degeneracy it is not therefore so great a misfortune to these primitive men nor so great an obstacle to their preservation that they go naked have no dwellings and lack all the superfluities which we think so necessary if their skins are not covered with hair they have no need of such covering in warm climates and in cold countries they soon     learn to appropriate the skins of the beasts they have overcome if they have but two legs to run with they have two arms to defend themselves with and provide for their wants their children are slowly and with difficulty taught to walk but their mothers are able to carry them with ease an advantage which other animals lack as the mother if pursued is forced either to abandon her young or to regulate her pace by theirs unless in short we suppose a singular and fortuitous concurrence of circumstances of which i shall speak later and which would be unlikely to exist it is plain in every state of the case that the man who first made himself clothes or a dwelling was furnishing himself with things not at all necessary for he had till then done without them and there is no reason why he should not have been able to put up in manhood with the same kind of life as had been his in infancy solitary indolent and perpetually accompanied by danger the savage cannot but be fond of sleep his sleep too must be light like that of the animals which think but little and may be said to slumber all the time they do not think selfpreservation being his chief and almost sole concern he must exercise most those faculties which are most concerned with attack or defence either for overcoming his prey or for preventing him from becoming the prey of other animals on the other hand those organs which are perfected only by softness and sensuality will remain in a gross and imperfect state incompatible with any sort of delicacy so that his senses being divided on this head his touch and taste will be extremely coarse his sight hearing and smell exceedingly fine and subtle such in general is the animal condition and such according to the narratives of travellers is that of most savage nations it is therefore no matter for surprise that the hottentots of the cape of good hope distinguish ships at sea with the naked eye at as great a distance as the dutch can do with their telescopes or that the savages of america should trace the spaniards by their smell as well as the best dogs could have done or that these barbarous peoples feel no pain in going naked or that they use large quantities of piemento with their food and drink the strongest european liquors like water hitherto i have considered merely the physical man let     us now take a view of him on his metaphysical and moral side i see nothing in any animal but an ingenious machine to which nature hath given senses to wind itself up and to guard itself to a certain degree against anything that might tend to disorder or destroy it i perceive exactly the same things in the human machine with this difference that in the operations of the brute nature is the sole agent whereas man has some share in his own operations in his character as a free agent the one chooses and refuses by instinct the other from an act of freewill hence the brute cannot deviate from the rule prescribed to it even when it would be advantageous for it to do so and on the contrary man frequently deviates from such rules to his own prejudice thus a pigeon would be starved to death by the side of a dish of the choicest meats and a cat on a heap of fruit or grain though it is certain that either might find nourishment in the foods which it thus rejects with disdain did it think of trying them hence it is that dissolute men run into excesses which bring on fevers and death because the mind depraves the senses and the will continues to speak when nature is silent every animal has ideas since it has senses it even combines those ideas in a certain degree and it is only in degree that man differs in this respect from the brute some philosophers have even maintained that there is a greater difference between one man and another than between some men and some beasts it is not therefore so much the understanding that constitutes the specific difference between the man and the brute as the human quality of freeagency nature lays her commands on every animal and the brute obeys her voice man receives the same impulsion but at the same time knows himself at liberty to acquiesce or resist and it is particularly in his consciousness of this liberty that the spirituality of his soul is displayed for physics may explain in some measure the mechanism of the senses and the formation of ideas but in the power of willing or rather of choosing and in the feeling of this power nothing is to be found but acts which are purely spiritual and wholly inexplicable by the laws of mechanism however even if the difficulties attending all these     questions should still leave room for difference in this respect between men and brutes there is another very specific quality which distinguishes them and which will admit of no dispute this is the faculty of selfimprovement which by the help of circumstances gradually develops all the rest of our faculties and is inherent in the species as in the individual whereas a brute is at the end of a few months all he will ever be during his whole life and his species at the end of a thousand years exactly what it was the first year of that thousand why is man alone liable to grow into a dotard is it not because he returns in this to his primitive state and that while the brute which has acquired nothing and has therefore nothing to lose still retains the force of instinct man who loses by age or accident all that his perfectibility had enabled him to gain falls by this means lower than the brutes themselves it would be melancholy were we forced to admit that this distinctive and almost unlimited faculty is the source of all human misfortunes that it is this which in time draws man out of his original state in which he would have spent his days insensibly in peace and innocence that it is this faculty which successively producing in different ages his discoveries and his errors his vices and his virtues makes him at length a tyrant both over himself and over nature  it would be shocking to be obliged to regard as a benefactor the man who first suggested to the oroonoko indians the use of the boards they apply to the temples of their children which secure to them some part at least of their imbecility and original happiness savage man left by nature solely to the direction of instinct or rather indemnified for what he may lack by faculties capable at first of supplying its place and afterwards of raising him much above it must accordingly begin with purely animal functions thus seeing and feeling must be his first condition which would be common to him and all other animals to will and not to will to desire and to fear must be the first and almost the only operations of his soul till new circumstances occasion new developments of his faculties whatever moralists may hold the human understanding     is greatly indebted to the passions which it is universally allowed are also much indebted to the understanding it is by the activity of the passions that our reason is improved for we desire knowledge only because we wish to enjoy and it is impossible to conceive any reason why a person who has neither fears nor desires should give himself the trouble of reasoning the passions again originate in our wants and their progress depends on that of our knowledge for we cannot desire or fear anything except from the idea we have of it or from the simple impulse of nature now savage man being destitute of every species of intelligence can have no passions save those of the latter kind his desires never go beyond his physical wants the only goods he recognises in the universe are food a female and sleep the only evils he fears are pain and hunger i say pain and not death for no animal can know what it is to die the knowledge of death and its terrors being one of the first acquisitions made by man in departing from an animal state it would be easy were it necessary to support this opinion by facts and to show that in all the nations of the world the progress of the understanding has been exactly proportionate to the wants which the peoples had received from nature or been subjected to by circumstances and in consequence to the passions that induced them to provide for those necessities i might instance the arts rising up in egypt and expanding with the inundation of the nile i might follow their progress into greece where they took root afresh grew up and towered to the skies among the rocks and sands of attica without being able to germinate on the fertile banks of the eurotas i might observe that in general the people of the north are more industrious than those of the south because they cannot get on so well without being so as if nature wanted to equalise matters by giving their understandings the fertility she had refused to their soil but who does not see without recurring to the uncertain testimony of history that everything seems to remove from savage man both the temptation and the means of changing his condition his imagination paints no pictures his heart makes no demands on him his few     wants are so readily supplied and he is so far from having the knowledge which is needful to make him want more that he can have neither foresight nor curiosity the face of nature becomes indifferent to him as it grows familiar he sees in it always the same order the same successions he has not understanding enough to wonder at the greatest miracles nor is it in his mind that we can expect to find that philosophy man needs if he is to know how to notice for once what he sees every day his soul which nothing disturbs is wholly wrapped up in the feeling of its present existence without any idea of the future however near at hand while his projects as limited as his views hardly extend to the close of day such even at present is the extent of the native caribeans foresight he will improvidently sell you his cottonbed in the morning and come crying in the evening to buy it again not having foreseen he would want it again the next night the more we reflect on this subject the greater appears the distance between pure sensation and the most simple knowledge it is impossible indeed to conceive how a man by his own powers alone without the aid of communication and the spur of necessity could have bridged so great a gap how many ages may have elapsed before mankind were in a position to behold any other fire than that of the heavens what a multiplicity of chances must have happened to teach them the commonest uses of that element how often must they have let it out before they acquired the art of reproducing it and how often may not such a secret have died with him who had discovered it what shall we say of agriculture an art which requires so much labour and foresight which is so dependent on others that it is plain it could only be practised in a society which had at least begun and which does not serve so much to draw the means of subsistence from the earth—for these it would produce of itself—but to compel it to produce what is most to our taste but let us suppose that men had so multiplied that the natural produce of the earth was no longer sufficient for their support a supposition by the way which would prove such a life to be very advantageous for the human race let us suppose that without forges or workshops the instruments of husbandry had dropped from the sky into the hands of     savages that they had overcome their natural aversion to continual labour that they had learnt so much foresight for their needs that they had divined how to cultivate the earth to sow grain and plant trees that they had discovered the arts of grinding corn and of setting the grape to ferment—all being things that must have been taught them by the gods since it is not to be conceived how they could discover them for themselves—yet after all this what man among them would be so absurd as to take the trouble of cultivating a field which might be stripped of its crop by the first comer man or beast that might take a liking to it and how should each of them resolve to pass his life in wearisome labour when the more necessary to him the reward of his labour might be the surer he would be of not getting it in a word how could such a situation induce men to cultivate the earth till it was regularly parcelled out among them that is to say till the state of nature had been abolished were we to suppose savage man as trained in the art of thinking as philosophers make him were we like them to suppose him a very philosopher capable of investigating the sublimest truths and of forming by highly abstract chains of reasoning maxims of reason and justice deduced from the love of order in general or the known will of his creator in a word were we to suppose him as intelligent and enlightened as he must have been and is in fact found to have been dull and stupid what advantage would accrue to the species from all such metaphysics which could not be communicated by one to another but must end with him who made them what progress could be made by mankind while dispersed in the woods among other animals and how far could men improve or mutually enlighten one another when having no fixed habitation and no need of one anothers assistance the same persons hardly met twice in their lives and perhaps then without knowing one another or speaking together let it be considered how many ideas we owe to the use of speech how far grammar exercises the understanding and facilitates its operations let us reflect on the inconceivable pains and the infinite space of time that the first invention of languages must have cost to these reflections add what preceded and then judge how many     thousand ages must have elapsed in the successive development in the human mind of those operations of which it is capable i shall here take the liberty for a moment of considering the difficulties of the origin of languages on which subject i might content myself with a simple repetition of the abbé condillacs investigations as they fully confirm my system and perhaps even first suggested it but it is plain from the manner in which this philosopher solves the difficulties he himself raises concerning the origin of arbitrary signs that he assumes what i question viz that a kind of society must already have existed among the first inventors of language while i refer therefore to his observations on this head i think it right to give my own in order to exhibit the same difficulties in a light adapted to my subject the first which presents itself is to conceive how language can have become necessary for as there was no communication among men and no need for any we can neither conceive the necessity of this invention nor the possibility of it if it was not somehow indispensable i might affirm with many others that languages arose in the domestic intercourse between parents and their children but this expedient would not obviate the difficulty and would besides involve the blunder made by those who in reasoning on the state of nature always import into it ideas gathered in a state of society thus they constantly consider families as living together under one roof and the individuals of each as observing among themselves a union as intimate and permanent as that which exists among us where so many common interests unite them whereas in this primitive state men had neither houses nor huts nor any kind of property whatever every one lived where he could seldom for more than a single night the sexes united without design as accident opportunity or inclination brought them together nor had they any great need of words to communicate their designs to each other and they parted with the same indifference the mother gave suck to her children at first for her own sake and afterwards when habit had made them dear for theirs but as soon as they were strong enough to go in search of their own food they forsook her of their own accord and as they had hardly   0 any other method of not losing one another than that of remaining continually within sight they soon became quite incapable of recognising one another when they happened to meet again it is farther to be observed that the child having all his wants to explain and of course more to say to his mother than the mother could have to say to him must have borne the brunt of the task of invention and the language he used would be of his own device so that the number of languages would be equal to that of the individuals speaking them and the variety would be increased by the vagabond and roving life they led which would not give time for any idiom to become constant for to say that the mother dictated to her child the words he was to use in asking her for one thing or another is an explanation of how languages already formed are taught but by no means explains how languages were originally formed we will suppose however that this first difficulty is obviated let us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the vast space which must lie between a pure state of nature and that in which languages had become necessary and admitting their necessity let us inquire how they could first be established here we have a new and worse difficulty to grapple with for if men need speech to learn to think they must have stood in much greater need of the art of thinking to be able to invent that of speaking and though we might conceive how the articulate sounds of the voice came to be taken as the conventional interpreters of our ideas it would still remain for us to inquire what could have been the interpreters of this convention for those ideas which answering to no sensible objects could not be indicated either by gesture or voice so that we can hardly form any tolerable conjectures about the origin of this art of communicating our thoughts and establishing a correspondence between minds an art so sublime that far distant as it is from its origin philosophers still behold it at such an immeasurable distance from perfection that there is none rash enough to affirm it will ever reach it even though the revolutions time necessarily produces were suspended in its favour though prejudice should be banished from our academies or condemned to silence and     those learned societies should devote themselves uninterruptedly for whole ages to this thorny question the first language of mankind the most universal and vivid in a word the only language man needed before he had occasion to exert his eloquence to persuade assembled multitudes was the simple cry of nature but as this was excited only by a sort of instinct on urgent occasions to implore assistance in case of danger or relief in case of suffering it could be of little use in the ordinary course of life in which more moderate feelings prevail when the ideas of men began to expand and multiply and closer communication took place among them they strove to invent more numerous signs and a more copious language they multiplied the inflections of the voice and added gestures which are in their own nature more expressive and depend less for their meaning on a prior determination visible and movable objects were therefore expressed by gestures and audible ones by imitative sounds but as hardly anything can be indicated by gestures except objects actually present or easily described and visible actions as they are not universally useful—for darkness or the interposition of a material object destroys their efficacy—and as besides they rather request than secure our attention men at length bethought themselves of substituting for them the articulate sounds of the voice which without bearing the same relation to any particular ideas are better calculated to express them all as conventional signs such an institution could only be made by common consent and must have been effected in a manner not very easy for men whose gross organs had not been accustomed to any such exercise it is also in itself still more difficult to conceive since such a common agreement must have had motives and speech seems to have been highly necessary to establish the use of it it is reasonable to suppose that the words first made use of by mankind had a much more extensive signification than those used in languages already formed and that ignorant as they were of the division of discourse into its constituent parts they at first gave every single word the sense of a whole proposition when they began to distinguish subject and attribute and noun and verb which was itself no common effort of genius substantives were at first only     so many proper names the present infinitive was the only tense of verbs and the very idea of adjectives must have been developed with great difficulty for every adjective is an abstract idea and abstractions are painful and unnatural operations every object at first received a particular name without regard to genus or species which these primitive originators were not in a position to distinguish every individual presented itself to their minds in isolation as they are in the picture of nature if one oak was called a another was called b for the primitive idea of two things is that they are not the same and it often takes a long time for what they have in common to be seen so that the narrower the limits of their knowledge of things the more copious their dictionary must have been the difficulty of using such a vocabulary could not be easily removed for to arrange beings under common and generic denominations it became necessary to know their distinguishing properties the need arose for observation and definition that is to say for natural history and metaphysics of a far more developed kind than men can at that time have possessed add to this that general ideas cannot be introduced into the mind without the assistance of words nor can the understanding seize them except by means of propositions this is one of the reasons why animals cannot form such ideas or ever acquire that capacity for selfimprovement which depends on them when a monkey goes from one nut to another are we to conceive that he entertains any general idea of that kind of fruit and compares its archetype with the two individual nuts assuredly he does not but the sight of one of these nuts recalls to his memory the sensations which he received from the other and his eyes being modified after a certain manner give information to the palate of the modification it is about to receive every general idea is purely intellectual if the imagination meddles with it ever so little the idea immediately becomes particular if you endeavour to trace in your mind the image of a tree in general you never attain to your end in spite of all you can do you will have to see it as great or little bare or leafy light or dark and were you capable of seeing nothing in it but what is common to all trees it would no longer be     like a tree at all purely abstract beings are perceivable in the same manner or are only conceivable by the help of language the definition of a triangle alone gives you a true idea of it the moment you imagine a triangle in your mind it is some particular triangle and not another and you cannot avoid giving it sensible lines and a coloured area we must then make use of propositions and of language in order to form general ideas for no sooner does the imagination cease to operate than the understanding proceeds only by the help of words if then the first inventors of speech could give names only to ideas they already had it follows that the first substantives could be nothing more than proper names but when our new grammarians by means of which i have no conception began to extend their ideas and generalise their terms the ignorance of the inventors must have confined this method within very narrow limits and as they had at first gone too far in multiplying the names of individuals from ignorance of their genus and species they made afterwards too few of these from not having considered beings in all their specific differences it would indeed have needed more knowledge and experience than they could have and more pains and inquiry than they would have bestowed to carry these distinctions to their proper length if even today we are continually discovering new species which have hitherto escaped observation let us reflect how many of them must have escaped men who judged things merely from their first appearance it is superfluous to add that the primitive classes and the most general notions must necessarily have escaped their notice also how for instance could they have understood or thought of the words matter spirit substance mode figure motion when even our philosophers who have so long been making use of them have themselves the greatest difficulty in understanding them and when the ideas attached to them being purely metaphysical there are no models of them to be found in nature but i stop at this point and ask my judges to suspend their reading a while to consider after the invention of physical substantives which is the easiest part of language to invent that there is still a great way to go before the     thoughts of men will have found perfect expression and constant form such as would answer the purposes of public speaking and produce their effect on society i beg of them to consider how much time must have been spent and how much knowledge needed to find out numbers abstract terms aorists and all the tenses of verbs particles syntax the method of connecting propositions the forms of reasoning and all the logic of speech for myself i am so aghast at the increasing difficulties which present themselves and so well convinced of the almost demonstrable impossibility that languages should owe their original institution to merely human means that i leave to any one who will undertake it the discussion of the difficult problem which was most necessary the existence of society to the invention of language or the invention of language to the establishment of society but be the origin of language and society what they may it may be at least inferred from the little care which nature has taken to unite mankind by mutual wants and to facilitate the use of speech that she has contributed little to make them sociable and has put little of her own into all they have done to create such bonds of union it is in fact impossible to conceive why in a state of nature one man should stand more in need of the assistance of another than a monkey or a wolf of the assistance of another of its kind or granting that he did what motives could induce that other to assist him or even then by what means they could agree about the conditions i know it is incessantly repeated that man would in such a state have been the most miserable of creatures and indeed if it be true as i think i have proved that he must have lived many ages before he could have either desire or an opportunity of emerging from it this would only be an accusation against nature and not against the being which she had thus unhappily constituted but as i understand the word miserable it either has no meaning at all or else signifies only a painful privation of something or a state of suffering either in body or soul i should be glad to have explained to me what kind of misery a free being whose heart is at ease and whose body is in health can possibly suffer i would ask also whether a social or a natural life is most likely     to become insupportable to those who enjoy it we see around us hardly a creature in civil society who does not lament his existence we even see many deprive themselves of as much of it as they can and laws human and divine together can hardly put a stop to the disorder i ask if it was ever known that a savage took it into his head when at liberty to complain of life or to make away with himself let us therefore judge with less vanity on which side the real misery is found on the other hand nothing could be more unhappy than savage man dazzled by science tormented by his passions and reasoning about a state different from his own it appears that providence most wisely determined that the faculties which he potentially possessed should develop themselves only as occasion offered to exercise them in order that they might not be superfluous or perplexing to him by appearing before their time nor slow and useless when the need for them arose in instinct alone he had all he required for living in the state of nature and with a developed understanding he has only just enough to support life in society it appears at first view that men in a state of nature having no moral relations or determinate obligations one with another could not be either good or bad virtuous or vicious unless we take these terms in a physical sense and call in an individual those qualities vices which may be injurious to his preservation and those virtues which contribute to it in which case he would have to be accounted most virtuous who put least check on the pure impulses of nature but without deviating from the ordinary sense of the words it will be proper to suspend the judgment we might be led to form on such a state and be on our guard against our prejudices till we have weighed the matter in the scales of impartiality and seen whether virtues or vices preponderate among civilised men and whether their virtues do them more good than their vices do harm till we have discovered whether the progress of the sciences sufficiently indemnifies them for the mischiefs they do one another in proportion as they are better informed of the good they ought to do or whether they would not be on the whole in a much happier condition if they had nothing to fear or to hope from any one     than as they are subjected to universal dependence and obliged to take everything from those who engage to give them nothing in return above all let us not conclude with hobbes that because man has no idea of goodness he must be naturally wicked that he is vicious because he does not know virtue that he always refuses to do his fellowcreatures services which he does not think they have a right to demand or that by virtue of the right he truly claims to everything he needs he foolishly imagines himself the sole proprietor of the whole universe hobbes had seen clearly the defects of all the modern definitions of natural right but the consequences which he deduces from his own show that he understands it in an equally false sense in reasoning on the principles he lays down he ought to have said that the state of nature being that in which the care for our own preservation is the least prejudicial to that of others was consequently the best calculated to promote peace and the most suitable for mankind he does say the exact opposite in consequence of having improperly admitted as a part of savage mans care for selfpreservation the gratification of a multitude of passions which are the work of society and have made laws necessary a bad man he says is a robust child but it remains to be proved whether man in a state of nature is this robust child and should we grant that he is what would he infer why truly that if this man when robust and strong were dependent on others as he is when feeble there is no extravagance he would not be guilty of that he would beat his mother when she was too slow in giving him her breast that he would strangle one of his younger brothers if he should be troublesome to him or bite the arm of another if he put him to any inconvenience but that man in the state of nature is both strong and dependent involves two contrary suppositions man is weak when he is dependent and is his own master before he comes to be strong hobbes did not reflect that the same cause which prevents a savage from making use of his reason as our jurists hold prevents him also from abusing his faculties as hobbes himself allows so that it may be justly said that savages are not bad merely because they do not know what it is to be good for it is neither     the development of the understanding nor the restraint of law that hinders them from doing ill but the peacefulness of their passions and their ignorance of vice tanto plus in illis proficit vitiorum ignoratio quam in his cognitio virtutis  there is another principle which has escaped hobbes which having been bestowed on mankind to moderate on certain occasions the impetuosity of egoism or before its birth the desire of selfpreservation tempers the ardour with which he pursues his own welfare by an innate repugnance at seeing a fellowcreature suffer  i think i need not fear contradiction in holding man to be possessed of the only natural virtue which could not be denied him by the most violent detractor of human virtue i am speaking of compassion which is a disposition suitable to creatures so weak and subject to so many evils as we certainly are by so much the more universal and useful to mankind as it comes before any kind of reflection and at the same time so natural that the very brutes themselves sometimes give evident proofs of it not to mention the tenderness of mothers for their offspring and the perils they encounter to save them from danger it is     well known that horses show a reluctance to trample on living bodies one animal never passes by the dead body of another of its species there are even some which give their fellows a sort of burial while the mournful lowings of the cattle when they enter the slaughterhouse show the impressions made on them by the horrible spectacle which meets them we find with pleasure the author of the fable of the bees obliged to own that man is a compassionate and sensible being and laying aside his cold subtlety of style in the example he gives to present us with the pathetic description of a man who from a place of confinement is compelled to behold a wild beast tear a child from the arms of its mother grinding its tender limbs with its murderous teeth and tearing its palpitating entrails with its claws what horrid agitation must not the eyewitness of such a scene experience although he would not be personally concerned what anxiety would he not suffer at not being able to give any assistance to the fainting mother and the dying infant such is the pure emotion of nature prior to all kinds of reflection such is the force of natural compassion which the greatest depravity of morals has as yet hardly been able to destroy for we daily find at our theatres men affected nay shedding tears at the sufferings of a wretch who were he in the tyrants place would probably even add to the torments of his enemies like the bloodthirsty sulla who was so sensitive to ills he had not caused or that alexander of pheros who did not dare to go and see any tragedy acted for fear of being seen weeping with andromache and priam though he could listen without emotion to the cries of all the citizens who were daily strangled at his command   mollissima corda   humano generi dare se natura fatetur   quæ lacrimas dedit   juvenal satire xv         mandeville well knew that in spite of all their morality men would have never been better than monsters had not nature bestowed on them a sense of compassion to aid     their reason but he did not see that from this quality alone flow all those social virtues of which he denied man the possession but what is generosity clemency or humanity but compassion applied to the weak to the guilty or to mankind in general even benevolence and friendship are if we judge rightly only the effects of compassion constantly set upon a particular object for how is it different to wish that another person may not suffer pain and uneasiness and to wish him happy were it even true that pity is no more than a feeling which puts us in the place of the sufferer a feeling obscure yet lively in a savage developed yet feeble in civilised man this truth would have no other consequence than to confirm my argument compassion must in fact be the stronger the more the animal beholding any kind of distress identifies himself with the animal that suffers now it is plain that such identification must have been much more perfect in a state of nature than it is in a state of reason it is reason that engenders selfrespect and reflection that confirms it it is reason which turns mans mind back upon itself and divides him from everything that could disturb or afflict him it is philosophy that isolates him and bids him say at sight of the misfortunes of others perish if you will i am secure nothing but such general evils as threaten the whole community can disturb the tranquil sleep of the philosopher or tear him from his bed a murder may with impunity be committed under his window he has only to put his hands to his ears and argue a little with himself to prevent nature which is shocked within him from identifying itself with the unfortunate sufferer uncivilised man has not this admirable talent and for want of reason and wisdom is always foolishly ready to obey the first promptings of humanity it is the populace that flocks together at riots and streetbrawls while the wise man prudently makes off it is the mob and the marketwomen who part the combatants and hinder gentlefolks from cutting one anothers throats it is then certain that compassion is a natural feeling which by moderating the violence of love of self in each individual contributes to the preservation of the whole species it is this compassion that hurries us without  00 reflection to the relief of those who are in distress it is this which in a state of nature supplies the place of laws morals and virtues with the advantage that none are tempted to disobey its gentle voice it is this which will always prevent a sturdy savage from robbing a weak child or a feeble old man of the sustenance they may have with pain and difficulty acquired if he sees a possibility of providing for himself by other means it is this which instead of inculcating that sublime maxim of rational justice do to others as you would have them do unto you inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness much less perfect indeed but perhaps more useful do good to yourself with as little evil as possible to others in a word it is rather in this natural feeling than in any subtle arguments that we must look for the cause of that repugnance which every man would experience in doing evil even independently of the maxims of education although it might belong to socrates and other minds of the like craft to acquire virtue by reason the human race would long since have ceased to be had its preservation depended only on the reasonings of the individuals composing it with passions so little active and so good a curb men being rather wild than wicked and more intent to guard themselves against the mischief that might be done them than to do mischief to others were by no means subject to very perilous dissensions they maintained no kind of intercourse with one another and were consequently strangers to vanity deference esteem and contempt they had not the least idea of meum and tuum and no true conception of justice they looked upon every violence to which they were subjected rather as an injury that might easily be repaired than as a crime that ought to be punished and they never thought of taking revenge unless perhaps mechanically and on the spot as a dog will sometimes bite the stone which is thrown at him their quarrels therefore would seldom have very bloody consequences for the subject of them would be merely the question of subsistence but i am aware of one greater danger which remains to be noticed of the passions that stir the heart of man there is one which makes the sexes necessary to each other and is  0  extremely ardent and impetuous a terrible passion that braves danger surmounts all obstacles and in its transports seems calculated to bring destruction on the human race which it is really destined to preserve what must become of men who are left to this brutal and boundless rage without modesty without shame and daily upholding their amours at the price of their blood it must in the first place be allowed that the more violent the passions are the more are laws necessary to keep them under restraint but setting aside the inadequacy of laws to effect this purpose which is evident from the crimes and disorders to which these passions daily give rise among us we should do well to inquire if these evils did not spring up with the laws themselves for in this case even if the laws were capable of repressing such evils it is the least that could be expected from them that they should check a mischief which would not have arisen without them let us begin by distinguishing between the physical and moral ingredients in the feeling of love the physical part of love is that general desire which urges the sexes to union with each other the moral part is that which determines and fixes this desire exclusively upon one particular object or at least gives it a greater degree of energy toward the object thus preferred it is easy to see that the moral part of love is a factitious feeling born of social usage and enhanced by the women with much care and cleverness to establish their empire and put in power the sex which ought to obey this feeling being founded on certain ideas of beauty and merit which a savage is not in a position to acquire and on comparisons which he is incapable of making must be for him almost nonexistent for as his mind cannot form abstract ideas of proportion and regularity so his heart is not susceptible of the feelings of love and admiration which are even insensibly produced by the application of these ideas he follows solely the character nature has implanted in him and not tastes which he could never have acquired so that every woman equally answers his purpose men in a state of nature being confined merely to what is physical in love and fortunate enough to be ignorant of those excellences which whet the appetite while they  0  increase the difficulty of gratifying it must be subject to fewer and less violent fits of passion and consequently fall into fewer and less violent disputes the imagination which causes such ravages among us never speaks to the heart of savages who quietly await the impulses of nature yield to them involuntarily with more pleasure than ardour and their wants once satisfied lose the desire it is therefore incontestable that love as well as all other passions must have acquired in society that glowing impetuosity which makes it so often fatal to mankind and it is the more absurd to represent savages as continually cutting one anothers throats to indulge their brutality because this opinion is directly contrary to experience the caribeans who have as yet least of all deviated from the state of nature being in fact the most peaceable of people in their amours and the least subject to jealousy though they live in a hot climate which seems always to inflame the passions with regard to the inferences that might be drawn in the case of several species of animals the males of which fill our poultryyards with blood and slaughter or in spring make the forests resound with their quarrels over their females we must begin by excluding all those species in which nature has plainly established in the comparative power of the sexes relations different from those which exist among us thus we can base no conclusion about men on the habits of fighting cocks in those species where the proportion is better observed these battles must be entirely due to the scarcity of females in comparison with males or what amounts to the same thing to the intervals during which the female constantly refuses the advances of the male for if each female admits the male but during two months in the year it is the same as if the number of females were fivesixths less now neither of these two cases is applicable to the human species in which the number of females usually exceeds that of males and among whom it has never been observed even among savages that the females have like those of other animals their stated times of passion and indifference moreover in several of these species the individuals all take fire at once and there comes a fearful moment of universal passion tumult and disorder among them a  0  scene which is never beheld in the human species whose love is not thus seasonal we must not then conclude from the combats of such animals for the enjoyment of the females that the case would be the same with mankind in a state of nature and even if we drew such a conclusion we see that such contests do not exterminate other kinds of animals and we have no reason to think they would be more fatal to ours it is indeed clear that they would do still less mischief than is the case in a state of society especially in those countries in which morals being still held in some repute the jealousy of lovers and the vengeance of husbands are the daily cause of duels murders and even worse crimes where the obligation of eternal fidelity only occasions adultery and the very laws of honour and continence necessarily increase debauchery and lead to the multiplication of abortions let us conclude then that man in a state of nature wandering up and down the forests without industry without speech and without home an equal stranger to war and to all ties neither standing in need of his fellowcreatures nor having any desire to hurt them and perhaps even not distinguishing them one from another let us conclude that being selfsufficient and subject to so few passions he could have no feelings or knowledge but such as befitted his situation that he felt only his actual necessities and disregarded everything he did not think himself immediately concerned to notice and that his understanding made no greater progress than his vanity if by accident he made any discovery he was the less able to communicate it to others as he did not know even his own children every art would necessarily perish with its inventor where there was no kind of education among men and generations succeeded generations without the least advance when all setting out from the same point centuries must have elapsed in the barbarism of the first ages when the race was already old and man remained a child if i have expatiated at such length on this supposed primitive state it is because i had so many ancient errors and inveterate prejudices to eradicate and therefore thought it incumbent on me to dig down to their very root and show by means of a true picture of the state of  0  nature how far even the natural inequalities of mankind are from having that reality and influence which modern writers suppose it is in fact easy to see that many of the differences which distinguish men are merely the effect of habit and the different methods of life men adopt in society thus a robust or delicate constitution and the strength or weakness attaching to it are more frequently the effects of a hardy or effeminate method of education than of the original endowment of the body it is the same with the powers of the mind for education not only makes a difference between such as are cultured and such as are not but even increases the differences which exist among the former in proportion to their respective degrees of culture as the distance between a giant and a dwarf on the same road increases with every step they take if we compare the prodigious diversity which obtains in the education and manner of life of the various orders of men in the state of society with the uniformity and simplicity of animal and savage life in which every one lives on the same kind of food and in exactly the same manner and does exactly the same things it is easy to conceive how much less the difference between man and man must be in a state of nature than in a state of society and how greatly the natural inequality of mankind must be increased by the inequalities of social institutions but even if nature really affected in the distribution of her gifts that partiality which is imputed to her what advantage would the greatest of her favourites derive from it to the detriment of others in a state that admits of hardly any kind of relation between them where there is no love of what advantage is beauty of what use is wit to those who do not converse or cunning to those who have no business with others i hear it constantly repeated that in such a state the strong would oppress the weak but what is here meant by oppression some it is said would violently domineer over others who would groan under a servile submission to their caprices this indeed is exactly what i observe to be the case among us but i do not see how it can be inferred of men in a state of nature who could not easily be brought to conceive what we mean by dominion and servitude one man it is  0  true might seize the fruits which another had gathered the game he had killed or the cave he had chosen for shelter but how would he ever be able to exact obedience and what ties of dependence could there be among men without possessions if for instance i am driven from one tree i can go to the next if i am disturbed in one place what hinders me from going to another again should i happen to meet with a man so much stronger than myself and at the same time so depraved so indolent and so barbarous as to compel me to provide for his sustenance while he himself remains idle he must take care not to have his eyes off me for a single moment he must bind me fast before he goes to sleep or i shall certainly either knock him on the head or make my escape that is to say he must in such a case voluntarily expose himself to much greater trouble than he seeks to avoid or can give me after all this let him be off his guard ever so little let him but turn his head aside at any sudden noise and i shall be instantly twenty paces off lost in the forest and my fetters burst asunder he would never see me again without my expatiating thus uselessly on these details every one must see that as the bonds of servitude are formed merely by the mutual dependence of men on one another and the reciprocal needs that unite them it is impossible to make any man a slave unless he be first reduced to a situation in which he cannot do without the help of others and since such a situation does not exist in a state of nature every one is there his own master and the law of the strongest is of no effect having proved that the inequality of mankind is hardly felt and that its influence is next to nothing in a state of nature i must next show its origin and trace its progress in the successive developments of the human mind having shown that human perfectibility the social virtues and the other faculties which natural man potentially possessed could never develop of themselves but must require the fortuitous concurrence of many foreign causes that might never arise and without which he would have remained for ever in his primitive condition i must now collect and consider the different accidents which may have improved the human understanding while depraving  0  the species and made man wicked while making him sociable so as to bring him and the world from that distant period to the point at which we now behold them i confess that as the events i am going to describe might have happened in various ways i have nothing to determine my choice but conjectures but such conjectures become reasons when they are the most probable that can be drawn from the nature of things and the only means of discovering the truth the consequences however which i mean to deduce will not be barely conjectural as on the principles just laid down it would be impossible to form any other theory that would not furnish the same results and from which i could not draw the same conclusions this will be a sufficient apology for my not dwelling on the manner in which the lapse of time compensates for the little probability in the events on the surprising power of trivial causes when their action is constant on the impossibility on the one hand of destroying certain hypotheses though on the other we cannot give them the certainty of known matters of fact on its being within the province of history when two facts are given as real and have to be connected by a series of intermediate facts which are unknown or supposed to be so to supply such facts as may connect them and on its being in the province of philosophy when history is silent to determine similar facts to serve the same end and lastly on the influence of similarity which in the case of events reduces the facts to a much smaller number of different classes than is commonly imagined it is enough for me to offer these hints to the consideration of my judges and to have so arranged that the general reader has no need to consider them at all  0  the second part the first man who having enclosed a piece of ground bethought himself of saying this is mine and found people simple enough to believe him was the real founder of civil society from how many crimes wars and murders from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind by pulling up the stakes or filling up the ditch and crying to his fellows beware of listening to this impostor you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all and the earth itself to nobody but there is great probability that things had then already come to such a pitch that they could no longer continue as they were for the idea of property depends on many prior ideas which could only be acquired successively and cannot have been formed all at once in the human mind mankind must have made very considerable progress and acquired considerable knowledge and industry which they must also have transmitted and increased from age to age before they arrived at this last point of the state of nature let us then go farther back and endeavour to unify under a single point of view that slow succession of events and discoveries in the most natural order mans first feeling was that of his own existence and his first care that of selfpreservation the produce of the earth furnished him with all he needed and instinct told him how to use it hunger and other appetites made him at various times experience various modes of existence and among these was one which urged him to propagate his species—a blind propensity that having nothing to do with the heart produced a merely animal act the want once gratified the two sexes knew each other no more and even the offspring was nothing to its mother as soon as it could do without her such was the condition of infant man the life of an animal limited at first to mere sensations and hardly profiting by the gifts nature bestowed on him much less capable of entertaining a thought of forcing anything from her but difficulties soon presented themselves and  0  it became necessary to learn how to surmount them the height of the trees which prevented him from gathering their fruits the competition of other animals desirous of the same fruits and the ferocity of those who needed them for their own preservation all obliged him to apply himself to bodily exercises he had to be active swift of foot and vigorous in fight natural weapons stones and sticks were easily found he learnt to surmount the obstacles of nature to contend in case of necessity with other animals and to dispute for the means of subsistence even with other men or to indemnify himself for what he was forced to give up to a stronger in proportion as the human race grew more numerous mens cares increased the difference of soils climates and seasons must have introduced some differences into their manner of living barren years long and sharp winters scorching summers which parched the fruits of the earth must have demanded a new industry on the seashore and the banks of rivers they invented the hook and line and became fishermen and eaters of fish in the forests they made bows and arrows and became huntsmen and warriors in cold countries they clothed themselves with the skins of the beasts they had slain the lightning a volcano or some lucky chance acquainted them with fire a new resource against the rigours of winter they next learned how to preserve this element then how to reproduce it and finally how to prepare with it the flesh of animals which before they had eaten raw this repeated relevance of various beings to himself and one to another would naturally give rise in the human mind to the perceptions of certain relations between them thus the relations which we denote by the terms great small strong weak swift slow fearful bold and the like almost insensibly compared at need must have at length produced in him a kind of reflection or rather a mechanical prudence which would indicate to him the precautions most necessary to his security the new intelligence which resulted from this development increased his superiority over other animals by making him sensible of it he would now endeavour therefore to ensnare them would play them a thousand tricks and though many of them might surpass him in  0  swiftness or in strength would in time become the master of some and the scourge of others thus the first time he looked into himself he felt the first emotion of pride and at a time when he scarce knew how to distinguish the different orders of beings by looking upon his species as of the highest order he prepared the way for assuming preeminence as an individual other men it is true were not then to him what they now are to us and he had no greater intercourse with them than with other animals yet they were not neglected in his observations the conformities which he would in time discover between them and between himself and his female led him to judge of others which were not then perceptible and finding that they all behaved as he himself would have done in like circumstances he naturally inferred that their manner of thinking and acting was altogether in conformity with his own this important truth once deeply impressed on his mind must have induced him from an intuitive feeling more certain and much more rapid than any kind of reasoning to pursue the rules of conduct which he had best observe towards them for his own security and advantage taught by experience that the love of wellbeing is the sole motive of human actions he found himself in a position to distinguish the few cases in which mutual interest might justify him in relying upon the assistance of his fellows and also the still fewer cases in which a conflict of interests might give cause to suspect them in the former case he joined in the same herd with them or at most in some kind of loose association that laid no restraint on its members and lasted no longer than the transitory occasion that formed it in the latter case every one sought his own private advantage either by open force if he thought himself strong enough or by address and cunning if he felt himself the weaker in this manner men may have insensibly acquired some gross ideas of mutual undertakings and of the advantages of fulfilling them that is just so far as their present and apparent interest was concerned for they were perfect strangers to foresight and were so far from troubling themselves about the distant future that they hardly thought of the morrow if a deer was to be taken   0 every one saw that in order to succeed he must abide faithfully by his post but if a hare happened to come within the reach of any one of them it is not to be doubted that he pursued it without scruple and having seized his prey cared very little if by so doing he caused his companions to miss theirs it is easy to understand that such intercourse would not require a language much more refined than that of rooks or monkeys who associate together for much the same purpose inarticulate cries plenty of gestures and some imitative sounds must have been for a long time the universal language and by the addition in every country of some conventional articulate sounds of which as i have already intimated the first institution is not too easy to explain particular languages were produced but these were rude and imperfect and nearly such as are now to be found among some savage nations hurried on by the rapidity of time by the abundance of things i have to say and by the almost insensible progress of things in their beginnings i pass over in an instant a multitude of ages for the slower the events were in their succession the more rapidly may they be described these first advances enabled men to make others with greater rapidity in proportion as they grew enlightened they grew industrious they ceased to fall asleep under the first tree or in the first cave that afforded them shelter they invented several kinds of implements of hard and sharp stones which they used to dig up the earth and to cut wood they then made huts out of branches and afterwards learnt to plaster them over with mud and clay this was the epoch of a first revolution which established and distinguished families and introduced a kind of property in itself the source of a thousand quarrels and conflicts as however the strongest were probably the first to build themselves huts which they felt themselves able to defend it may be concluded that the weak found it much easier and safer to imitate than to attempt to dislodge them and of those who were once provided with huts none could have any inducement to appropriate that of his neighbour not indeed so much because it did not belong to him as because it could be of no use and he could not make himself master of it without exposing     himself to a desperate battle with the family which occupied it the first expansions of the human heart were the effects of a novel situation which united husbands and wives fathers and children under one roof the habit of living together soon gave rise to the finest feelings known to humanity conjugal love and paternal affection every family became a little society the more united because liberty and reciprocal attachment were the only bonds of its union the sexes whose manner of life had been hitherto the same began now to adopt different ways of living the women became more sedentary and accustomed themselves to mind the hut and their children while the men went abroad in search of their common subsistence from living a softer life both sexes also began to lose something of their strength and ferocity but if individuals became to some extent less able to encounter wild beasts separately they found it on the other hand easier to assemble and resist in common the simplicity and solitude of mans life in this new condition the paucity of his wants and the implements he had invented to satisfy them left him a great deal of leisure which he employed to furnish himself with many conveniences unknown to his fathers and this was the first yoke he inadvertently imposed on himself and the first source of the evils he prepared for his descendants for besides continuing thus to enervate both body and mind these conveniences lost with use almost all their power to please and even degenerated into real needs till the want of them became far more disagreeable than the possession of them had been pleasant men would have been unhappy at the loss of them though the possession did not make them happy we can here see a little better how the use of speech became established and insensibly improved in each family and we may form a conjecture also concerning the manner in which various causes may have extended and accelerated the progress of language by making it more and more necessary floods or earthquakes surrounded inhabited districts with precipices or waters revolutions of the globe tore off portions from the continent and made them islands it is readily seen that among men thus     collected and compelled to live together a common idiom must have arisen much more easily than among those who still wandered through the forests of the continent thus it is very possible that after their first essays in navigation the islanders brought over the use of speech to the continent and it is at least very probable that communities and languages were first established in islands and even came to perfection there before they were known on the mainland everything now begins to change its aspect men who have up to now been roving in the woods by taking to a more settled manner of life come gradually together form separate bodies and at length in every country arises a distinct nation united in character and manners not by regulations or laws but by uniformity of life and food and the common influence of climate permanent neighbourhood could not fail to produce in time some connection between different families among young people of opposite sexes living in neighbouring huts the transient commerce required by nature soon led through mutual intercourse to another kind not less agreeable and more permanent men began now to take the difference between objects into account and to make comparisons they acquired imperceptibly the ideas of beauty and merit which soon gave rise to feelings of preference in consequence of seeing each other often they could not do without seeing each other constantly a tender and pleasant feeling insinuated itself into their souls and the least opposition turned it into an impetuous fury with love arose jealousy discord triumphed and human blood was sacrificed to the gentlest of all passions as ideas and feelings succeeded one another and heart and head were brought into play men continued to lay aside their original wildness their private connections became every day more intimate as their limits extended they accustomed themselves to assemble before their huts round a large tree singing and dancing the true offspring of love and leisure became the amusement or rather the occupation of men and women thus assembled together with nothing else to do each one began to consider the rest and to wish to be considered in turn and thus a value came to be attached to public esteem whoever     sang or danced best whoever was the handsomest the strongest the most dexterous or the most eloquent came to be of most consideration and this was the first step towards inequality and at the same time towards vice from these first distinctions arose on the one side vanity and contempt and on the other shame and envy and the fermentation caused by these new leavens ended by producing combinations fatal to innocence and happiness as soon as men began to value one another and the idea of consideration had got a footing in the mind every one put in his claim to it and it became impossible to refuse it to any with impunity hence arose the first obligations of civility even among savages and every intended injury became an affront because besides the hurt which might result from it the party injured was certain to find in it a contempt for his person which was often more insupportable than the hurt itself thus as every man punished the contempt shown him by others in proportion to his opinion of himself revenge became terrible and men bloody and cruel this is precisely the state reached by most of the savage nations known to us and it is for want of having made a proper distinction in our ideas and seen how very far they already are from the state of nature that so many writers have hastily concluded that man is naturally cruel and requires civil institutions to make him more mild whereas nothing is more gentle than man in his primitive state as he is placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes and the fatal ingenuity of civilised man equally confined by instinct and reason to the sole care of guarding himself against the mischiefs which threaten him he is restrained by natural compassion from doing any injury to others and is not led to do such a thing even in return for injuries received for according to the axiom of the wise locke there can be no injury where there is no property but it must be remarked that the society thus formed and the relations thus established among men required of them qualities different from those which they possessed from their primitive constitution morality began to appear in human actions and every one before the institution of law was the only judge and avenger of     the injuries done him so that the goodness which was suitable in the pure state of nature was no longer proper in the newborn state of society punishments had to be made more severe as opportunities of offending became more frequent and the dread of vengeance had to take the place of the rigour of the law thus though men had become less patient and their natural compassion had already suffered some diminution this period of expansion of the human faculties keeping a just mean between the indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our egoism must have been the happiest and most stable of epochs the more we reflect on it the more we shall find that this state was the least subject to revolutions and altogether the very best man could experience so that he can have departed from it only through some fatal accident which for the public good should never have happened the example of savages most of whom have been found in this state seems to prove that men were meant to remain in it that it is the real youth of the world and that all subsequent advances have been apparently so many steps towards the perfection of the individual but in reality towards the decrepitude of the species so long as men remained content with their rustic huts so long as they were satisfied with clothes made of the skins of animals and sewn together with thorns and fishbones adorned themselves only with feathers and shells and continued to paint their bodies different colours to improve and beautify their bows and arrows and to make with sharpedged stones fishing boats or clumsy musical instruments in a word so long as they undertook only what a single person could accomplish and confined themselves to such arts as did not require the joint labour of several hands they lived free healthy honest and happy lives so long as their nature allowed and as they continued to enjoy the pleasures of mutual and independent intercourse but from the moment one man began to stand in need of the help of another from the moment it appeared advantageous to any one man to have enough provisions for two equality disappeared property was introduced work became indispensable and vast forests became smiling fields which man had to water with the sweat of his     brow and where slavery and misery were soon seen to germinate and grow up with the crops metallurgy and agriculture were the two arts which produced this great revolution the poets tell us it was gold and silver but for the philosophers it was iron and corn which first civilised men and ruined humanity thus both were unknown to the savages of america who for that reason are still savage the other nations also seem to have continued in a state of barbarism while they practised only one of these arts one of the best reasons perhaps why europe has been if not longer at least more constantly and highly civilised than the rest of the world is that it is at once the most abundant in iron and the most fertile in corn it is difficult to conjecture how men first came to know and use iron for it is impossible to suppose they would of themselves think of digging the ore out of the mine and preparing it for smelting before they knew what would be the result on the other hand we have the less reason to suppose this discovery the effect of any accidental fire as mines are only formed in barren places bare of trees and plants so that it looks as if nature had taken pains to keep the fatal secret from us there remains therefore only the extraordinary accident of some volcano which by ejecting metallic substances already in fusion suggested to the spectators the idea of imitating the natural operation and we must further conceive them as possessed of uncommon courage and foresight to undertake so laborious a work with so distant a prospect of drawing advantage from it yet these qualities are united only in minds more advanced than we can suppose those of these first discoverers to have been with regard to agriculture the principles of it were known long before they were put in practice and it is indeed hardly possible that men constantly employed in drawing their subsistence from plants and trees should not readily acquire a knowledge of the means made use of by nature for the propagation of vegetables it was in all probability very long however before their industry took that turn either because trees which together with hunting and fishing afforded them food did not require their attention or because they were ignorant of the use of     corn or without instruments to cultivate it or because they lacked foresight to future needs or lastly because they were without means of preventing others from robbing them of the fruit of their labour when they grew more industrious it is natural to believe that they began with the help of sharp stones and pointed sticks to cultivate a few vegetables or roots around their huts though it was long before they knew how to prepare corn or were provided with the implements necessary for raising it in any large quantity not to mention how essential it is for husbandry to consent to immediate loss in order to reap a future gain—a precaution very foreign to the turn of a savages mind for as i have said he hardly foresees in the morning what he will need at night the invention of the other arts must therefore have been necessary to compel mankind to apply themselves to agriculture no sooner were artificers wanted to smelt and forge iron than others were required to maintain them the more hands that were employed in manufactures the fewer were left to provide for the common subsistence though the number of mouths to be furnished with food remained the same and as some required commodities in exchange for their iron the rest at length discovered the method of making iron serve for the multiplication of commodities by this means the arts of husbandry and agriculture were established on the one hand and the art of working metals and multiplying their uses on the other the cultivation of the earth necessarily brought about its distribution and property once recognised gave rise to the first rules of justice for to secure each man his own it had to be possible for each to have something besides as men began to look forward to the future and all had something to lose every one had reason to apprehend that reprisals would follow any injury he might do to another this origin is so much the more natural as it is impossible to conceive how property can come from anything but manual labour for what else can a man add to things which he does not originally create so as to make them his own property it is the husbandmans labour alone that giving him a title to the produce of the ground he has tilled gives him a claim also to the land     itself at least till harvest and so from year to year a constant possession which is easily transformed into property when the ancients says grotius gave to ceres the title of legislatrix and to a festival celebrated in her honour the name of thesmophoria they meant by that that the distribution of lands had produced a new kind of right that is to say the right of property which is different from the right deducible from the law of nature in this state of affairs equality might have been sustained had the talents of individuals been equal and had for example the use of iron and the consumption of commodities always exactly balanced each other but as there was nothing to preserve this balance it was soon disturbed the strongest did most work the most skilful turned his labour to best account the most ingenious devised methods of diminishing his labour the husbandman wanted more iron or the smith more corn and while both laboured equally the one gained a great deal by his work while the other could hardly support himself thus natural inequality unfolds itself insensibly with that of combination and the difference between men developed by their different circumstances becomes more sensible and permanent in its effects and begins to have an influence in the same proportion over the lot of individuals matters once at this pitch it is easy to imagine the rest i shall not detain the reader with a description of the successive invention of other arts the development of language the trial and utilisation of talents the inequality of fortunes the use and abuse of riches and all the details connected with them which the reader can easily supply for himself i shall confine myself to a glance at mankind in this new situation behold then all human faculties developed memory and imagination in full play egoism interested reason active and the mind almost at the highest point of its perfection behold all the natural qualities in action the rank and condition of every man assigned him not merely his share of property and his power to serve or injure others but also his wit beauty strength or skill merit or talents and these being the only qualities capable of commanding respect it soon became necessary to possess or to affect them     it now became the interest of men to appear what they really were not to be and to seem became two totally different things and from this distinction sprang insolent pomp and cheating trickery with all the numerous vices that go in their train on the other hand free and independent as men were before they were now in consequence of a multiplicity of new wants brought into subjection as it were to all nature and particularly to one another and each became in some degree a slave even in becoming the master of other men if rich they stood in need of the services of others if poor of their assistance and even a middle condition did not enable them to do without one another man must now therefore have been perpetually employed in getting others to interest themselves in his lot and in making them apparently at least if not really find their advantage in promoting his own thus he must have been sly and artful in his behaviour to some and imperious and cruel to others being under a kind of necessity to illuse all the persons of whom he stood in need when he could not frighten them into compliance and did not judge it his interest to be useful to them insatiable ambition the thirst of raising their respective fortunes not so much from real want as from the desire to surpass others inspired all men with a vile propensity to injure one another and with a secret jealousy which is the more dangerous as it puts on the mask of benevolence to carry its point with greater security in a word there arose rivalry and competition on the one hand and conflicting interests on the other together with a secret desire on both of profiting at the expense of others all these evils were the first effects of property and the inseparable attendants of growing inequality before the invention of signs to represent riches wealth could hardly consist in anything but lands and cattle the only real possessions men can have but when inheritances so increased in number and extent as to occupy the whole of the land and to border on one another one man could aggrandise himself only at the expense of another at the same time the supernumeraries who had been too weak or too indolent to make such acquisitions and had grown poor without sustaining any loss because while they saw     everything change around them they remained still the same were obliged to receive their subsistence or steal it from the rich and this soon bred according to their different characters dominion and slavery or violence and rapine the wealthy on their part had no sooner begun to taste the pleasure of command than they disdained all others and using their old slaves to acquire new thought of nothing but subduing and enslaving their neighbours like ravenous wolves which having once tasted human flesh despise every other food and thenceforth seek only men to devour thus as the most powerful or the most miserable considered their might or misery as a kind of right to the possessions of others equivalent in their opinion to that of property the destruction of equality was attended by the most terrible disorders usurpations by the rich robbery by the poor and the unbridled passions of both suppressed the cries of natural compassion and the still feeble voice of justice and filled men with avarice ambition and vice between the title of the strongest and that of the first occupier there arose perpetual conflicts which never ended but in battles and bloodshed the newborn state of society thus gave rise to a horrible state of war men thus harassed and depraved were no longer capable of retracing their steps or renouncing the fatal acquisitions they had made but labouring by the abuse of the faculties which do them honour merely to their own confusion brought themselves to the brink of ruin   attonitus novitate mali divesque miserque   effugere optat opes et quæ modo voverat odit  it is impossible that men should not at length have reflected on so wretched a situation and on the calamities that overwhelmed them the rich in particular must have felt how much they suffered by a constant state of war of which they bore all the expense and in which though all risked their lives they alone risked their property besides however speciously they might disguise   0 their usurpations they knew that they were founded on precarious and false titles so that if others took from them by force what they themselves had gained by force they would have no reason to complain even those who had been enriched by their own industry could hardly base their proprietorship on better claims it was in vain to repeat i built this well i gained this spot by my industry who gave you your standing it might be answered and what right have you to demand payment of us for doing what we never asked you to do do you not know that numbers of your fellowcreatures are starving for want of what you have too much of you ought to have had the express and universal consent of mankind before appropriating more of the common subsistence than you needed for your own maintenance destitute of valid reasons to justify and sufficient strength to defend himself able to crush individuals with ease but easily crushed himself by a troop of bandits one against all and incapable on account of mutual jealousy of joining with his equals against numerous enemies united by the common hope of plunder the rich man thus urged by necessity conceived at length the profoundest plan that ever entered the mind of man this was to employ in his favour the forces of those who attacked him to make allies of his adversaries to inspire them with different maxims and to give them other institutions as favourable to himself as the law of nature was unfavourable with this view after having represented to his neighbours the horror of a situation which armed every man against the rest and made their possessions as burdensome to them as their wants and in which no safety could be expected either in riches or in poverty he readily devised plausible arguments to make them close with his design let us join said he to guard the weak from oppression to restrain the ambitious and secure to every man the possession of what belongs to him let us institute rules of justice and peace to which all without exception may be obliged to conform rules that may in some measure make amends for the caprices of fortune by subjecting equally the powerful and the weak to the observance of reciprocal obligations let us in a word instead of turning our forces against ourselves collect     them in a supreme power which may govern us by wise laws protect and defend all the members of the association repulse their common enemies and maintain eternal harmony among us far fewer words to this purpose would have been enough to impose on men so barbarous and easily seduced especially as they had too many disputes among themselves to do without arbitrators and too much ambition and avarice to go long without masters all ran headlong to their chains in hopes of securing their liberty for they had just wit enough to perceive the advantages of political institutions without experience enough to enable them to foresee the dangers the most capable of foreseeing the dangers were the very persons who expected to benefit by them and even the most prudent judged it not inexpedient to sacrifice one part of their freedom to ensure the rest as a wounded man has his arm cut off to save the rest of his body such was or may well have been the origin of society and law which bound new fetters on the poor and gave new powers to the rich which irretrievably destroyed natural liberty eternally fixed the law of property and inequality converted clever usurpation into unalterable right and for the advantage of a few ambitious individuals subjected all mankind to perpetual labour slavery and wretchedness it is easy to see how the establishment of one community made that of all the rest necessary and how in order to make head against united forces the rest of mankind had to unite in turn societies soon multiplied and spread over the face of the earth till hardly a corner of the world was left in which a man could escape the yoke and withdraw his head from beneath the sword which he saw perpetually hanging over him by a thread civil right having thus become the common rule among the members of each community the law of nature maintained its place only between different communities where under the name of the right of nations it was qualified by certain tacit conventions in order to make commerce practicable and serve as a substitute for natural compassion which lost when applied to societies almost all the influence it had over individuals and survived no longer except in some great cosmopolitan spirits who breaking     down the imaginary barriers that separate different peoples follow the example of our sovereign creator and include the whole human race in their benevolence but bodies politic remaining thus in a state of nature among themselves presently experienced the inconveniences which had obliged individuals to forsake it for this state became still more fatal to these great bodies than it had been to the individuals of whom they were composed hence arose national wars battles murders and reprisals which shock nature and outrage reason together with all those horrible prejudices which class among the virtues the honour of shedding human blood the most distinguished men hence learned to consider cutting each others throats a duty at length men massacred their fellowcreatures by thousands without so much as knowing why and committed more murders in a single days fighting and more violent outrages in the sack of a single town than were committed in the state of nature during whole ages over the whole earth such were the first effects which we can see to have followed the division of mankind into different communities but let us return to their institutions i know that some writers have given other explanations of the origin of political societies such as the conquest of the powerful or the association of the weak it is indeed indifferent to my argument which of these causes we choose that which i have just laid down however appears to me the most natural for the following reasons first because in the first case the right of conquest being no right in itself could not serve as a foundation on which to build any other the victor and the vanquished people still remained with respect to each other in the state of war unless the vanquished restored to the full possession of their liberty voluntarily made choice of the victor for their chief for till then whatever capitulation may have been made being founded on violence and therefore ipso facto void there could not have been on this hypothesis either a real society or body politic or any law other than that of the strongest secondly because the words strong and weak are in the second case ambiguous for during the interval between the establishment of a right of property or prior occupancy and that of     political government the meaning of these words is better expressed by the terms rich and poor because in fact before the institution of laws men had no other way of reducing their equals to submission than by attacking their goods or making some of their own over to them thirdly because as the poor had nothing but their freedom to lose it would have been in the highest degree absurd for them to resign voluntarily the only good they still enjoyed without getting anything in exchange whereas the rich having feelings if i may so express myself in every part of their possessions it was much easier to harm them and therefore more necessary for them to take precautions against it and in short because it is more reasonable to suppose a thing to have been invented by those to whom it would be of service than by those whom it must have harmed government had in its infancy no regular and constant form the want of experience and philosophy prevented men from seeing any but present inconveniences and they thought of providing against others only as they presented themselves in spite of the endeavours of the wisest legislators the political state remained imperfect because it was little more than the work of chance and as it had begun ill though time revealed its defects and suggested remedies the original faults were never repaired it was continually being patched up when the first task should have been to get the site cleared and all the old materials removed as was done by lycurgus at sparta if a stable and lasting edifice was to be erected society consisted at first merely of a few general conventions which every member bound himself to observe and for the performance of covenants the whole body went security to each individual experience only could show the weakness of such a constitution and how easily it might be infringed with impunity from the difficulty of convicting men of faults where the public alone was to be witness and judge the laws could not but be eluded in many ways disorders and inconveniences could not but multiply continually till it became necessary to commit the dangerous trust of public authority to private persons and the care of enforcing obedience to the deliberations of the people to the magistrate for to say that chiefs     were chosen before the confederacy was formed and that the administrators of the laws were there before the laws themselves is too absurd a supposition to consider seriously it would be as unreasonable to suppose that men at first threw themselves irretrievably and unconditionally into the arms of an absolute master and that the first expedient which proud and unsubdued men hit upon for their common security was to run headlong into slavery for what reason in fact did they take to themselves superiors if it was not in order that they might be defended from oppression and have protection for their lives liberties and properties which are so to speak the constituent elements of their being now in the relations between man and man the worst that can happen is for one to find himself at the mercy of another and it would have been inconsistent with commonsense to begin by bestowing on a chief the only things they wanted his help to preserve what equivalent could he offer them for so great a right and if he had presumed to exact it under pretext of defending them would he not have received the answer recorded in the fable what more can the enemy do to us it is therefore beyond dispute and indeed the fundamental maxim of all political right that people have set up chiefs to protect their liberty and not to enslave them if we have a prince said pliny to trajan it is to save ourselves from having a master politicians indulge in the same sophistry about the love of liberty as philosophers about the state of nature they judge by what they see of very different things which they have not seen and attribute to man a natural propensity to servitude because the slaves within their observation are seen to bear the yoke with patience they fail to reflect that it is with liberty as with innocence and virtue the value is known only to those who possess them and the taste for them is forfeited when they are forfeited themselves i know the charms of your country said brasidas to a satrap who was comparing the life at sparta with that at persepolis but you cannot know the pleasures of mine an unbroken horse erects his mane paws the ground and starts back impetuously at the sight of the bridle     while one which is properly trained suffers patiently even whip and spur so savage man will not bend his neck to the yoke to which civilised man submits without a murmur but prefers the most turbulent state of liberty to the most peaceful slavery we cannot therefore from the servility of nations already enslaved judge of the natural disposition of mankind for or against slavery we should go by the prodigious efforts of every free people to save itself from oppression i know that the former are for ever holding forth in praise of the tranquillity they enjoy in their chains and that they call a state of wretched servitude a state of peace miserriman servitutem pacem appellant  but when i observe the latter sacrificing pleasure peace wealth power and life itself to the preservation of that one treasure which is so disdained by those who have lost it when i see freeborn animals dash their brains out against the bars of their cage from an innate impatience of captivity when i behold numbers of naked savages that despise european pleasures braving hunger fire the sword and death to preserve nothing but their independence i feel that it is not for slaves to argue about liberty with regard to paternal authority from which some writers have derived absolute government and all society it is enough without going back to the contrary arguments of locke and sidney to remark that nothing on earth can be further from the ferocious spirit of despotism than the mildness of that authority which looks more to the advantage of him who obeys than to that of him who commands that by the law of nature the father is the childs master no longer than his help is necessary that from that time they are both equal the son being perfectly independent of the father and owing him only respect and not obedience for gratitude is a duty which ought to be paid but not a right to be exacted instead of saying that civil society is derived from paternal authority we ought to say rather that the latter derives its principal force from the former no individual was ever acknowledged as the father of many till his sons and daughters remained settled around him the goods of the father     of which he is really the master are the ties which keep his children in dependence and he may bestow on them if he pleases no share of his property unless they merit it by constant deference to his will but the subjects of an arbitrary despot are so far from having the like favour to expect from their chief that they themselves and everything they possess are his property or at least are considered by him as such so that they are forced to receive as a favour the little of their own he is pleased to leave them when he despoils them he does but justice and mercy in that he permits them to live by proceeding thus to test fact by right we should discover as little reason as truth in the voluntary establishment of tyranny it would also be no easy matter to prove the validity of a contract binding on only one of the parties where all the risk is on one side and none on the other so that no one could suffer but he who bound himself this hateful system is indeed even in modern times very far from being that of wise and good monarchs and especially of the kings of france as may be seen from several passages in their edicts particularly from the following passage in a celebrated edict published in      in the name and by order of louis xiv let it not therefore be said that the sovereign is not subject to the laws of his state since the contrary is a true proposition of the right of nations which flattery has sometimes attacked but good princes have always defended as the tutelary divinity of their dominions how much more legitimate is it to say with the wise plato that the perfect felicity of a kingdom consists in the obedience of subjects to their prince and of the prince to the laws and in the laws being just and constantly directed to the public good  i shall not stay here to inquire whether as liberty is the noblest faculty of man it is not degrading our very nature reducing ourselves to the level of the brutes which are mere slaves of instinct and even an affront to the author of our being to renounce without reserve the most precious of all his gifts and to bow to the necessity     of committing all the crimes he has forbidden merely to gratify a mad or a cruel master or if this sublime craftsman ought not to be less angered at seeing his workmanship entirely destroyed than thus dishonoured i will waive if my opponents please the authority of barbeyrac who following locke roundly declares that no man can so far sell his liberty as to submit to an arbitrary power which may use him as it likes for he adds this would be to sell his own life of which he is not master i shall ask only what right those who were not afraid thus to debase themselves could have to subject their posterity to the same ignominy and to renounce for them those blessings which they do not owe to the liberality of their progenitors and without which life itself must be a burden to all who are worthy of it puffendorf says that we may divest ourselves of our liberty in favour of other men just as we transfer our property from one to another by contracts and agreements but this seems a very weak argument for in the first place the property i alienate becomes quite foreign to me nor can i suffer from the abuse of it but it very nearly concerns me that my liberty should not be abused and i cannot without incurring the guilt of the crimes i may be compelled to commit expose myself to become an instrument of crime besides the right of property being only a convention of human institution men may dispose of what they possess as they please but this is not the case with the essential gifts of nature such as life and liberty which every man is permitted to enjoy and of which it is at least doubtful whether any have a right to divest themselves by giving up the one we degrade our being by giving up the other we do our best to annul it and as no temporal good can indemnify us for the loss of either it would be an offence against both reason and nature to renounce them at any price whatsoever but even if we could transfer our liberty as we do our property there would be a great difference with regard to the children who enjoy the fathers substance only by the transmission of his right whereas liberty being a gift which they hold from nature as being men their parents have no right whatever to deprive them of it as then to establish slavery it was necessary to do     violence to nature so in order to perpetuate such a right nature would have to be changed jurists who have gravely determined that the child of a slave comes into the world a slave have decided in other words that a man shall come into the world not a man i regard it then as certain that government did not begin with arbitrary power but that this is the depravation the extreme term of government and brings it back finally to just the law of the strongest which it was originally designed to remedy supposing however it had begun in this manner such power being in itself illegitimate could not have served as a basis for the laws of society nor consequently for the inequality they instituted without entering at present upon the investigations which still remain to be made into the nature of the fundamental compact underlying all government i content myself with adopting the common opinion concerning it and regard the establishment of the political body as a real contract between the people and the chiefs chosen by them a contract by which both parties bind themselves to observe the laws therein expressed which form the ties of their union the people having in respect of their social relations concentrated all their wills in one the several articles concerning which this will is explained become so many fundamental laws obligatory on all the members of the state without exception and one of these articles regulates the choice and power of the magistrates appointed to watch over the execution of the rest this power extends to everything which may maintain the constitution without going so far as to alter it it is accompanied by honours in order to bring the laws and their administrators into respect the ministers are also distinguished by personal prerogatives in order to recompense them for the cares and labour which good administration involves the magistrate on his side binds himself to use the power he is entrusted with only in conformity with the intention of his constituents to maintain them all in the peaceable possession of what belongs to them and to prefer on every occasion the public interest to his own before experience had shown or knowledge of the     human heart enabled men to foresee the unavoidable abuses of such a constitution it must have appeared so much the more excellent as those who were charged with the care of its preservation had themselves most interest in it for magistracy and the rights attaching to it being based solely on the fundamental laws the magistrates would cease to be legitimate as soon as these ceased to exist the people would no longer owe them obedience and as not the magistrates but the laws are essential to the being of a state the members of it would regain the right to their natural liberty if we reflect with ever so little attention on this subject we shall find new arguments to confirm this truth and be convinced from the very nature of the contract that it cannot be irrevocable for if there were no superior power capable of ensuring the fidelity of the contracting parties or compelling them to perform their reciprocal engagements the parties would be sole judges in their own cause and each would always have a right to renounce the contract as soon as he found that the other had violated its terms or that they no longer suited his convenience it is upon this principle that the right of abdication may possibly be founded now if as here we consider only what is human in this institution it is certain that if the magistrate who has all the power in his own hands and appropriates to himself all the advantages of the contract has none the less a right to renounce his authority the people who suffer for all the faults of their chief must have a much better right to renounce their dependence but the terrible and innumerable quarrels and disorders that would necessarily arise from so dangerous a privilege show more than anything else how much human governments stood in need of a more solid basis than mere reason and how expedient it was for the public tranquillity that the divine will should interpose to invest the sovereign authority with a sacred and inviolable character which might deprive subjects of the fatal right of disposing of it if the world had received no other advantages from religion this would be enough to impose on men the duty of adopting and cultivating it abuses and all since it has been the means of saving more blood than fanaticism has ever spilt but let us follow the thread of our hypothesis   0 the different forms of government owe their origin to the differing degrees of inequality which existed between individuals at the time of their institution if there happened to be any one man among them preeminent in power virtue riches or personal influence he became sole magistrate and the state assumed the form of monarchy if several nearly equal in point of eminence stood above the rest they were elected jointly and formed an aristocracy again among a people who had deviated less from a state of nature and between whose fortune or talents there was less disproportion the supreme administration was retained in common and a democracy was formed it was discovered in process of time which of these forms suited men the best some peoples remained altogether subject to the laws others soon came to obey their magistrates the citizens laboured to preserve their liberty the subjects irritated at seeing others enjoying a blessing they had lost thought only of making slaves of their neighbours in a word on the one side arose riches and conquests and on the other happiness and virtue in these different governments all the offices were at first elective and when the influence of wealth was out of the question the preference was given to merit which gives a natural ascendancy and to age which is experienced in business and deliberate in council the elders of the hebrews the gerontes at sparta the senate at rome and the very etymology of our word seigneur show how old age was once held in veneration but the more often the choice fell upon old men the more often elections had to be repeated and the more they became a nuisance intrigues set in factions were formed party feeling grew bitter civil wars broke out the lives of individuals were sacrificed to the pretended happiness of the state and at length men were on the point of relapsing into their primitive anarchy ambitious chiefs profited by these circumstances to perpetuate their offices in their own families at the same time the people already used to dependence ease and the conveniences of life and already incapable of breaking its fetters agreed to an increase of its slavery in order to secure its tranquillity thus magistrates having become hereditary contracted the     habit of considering their offices as a family estate and themselves as proprietors of the communities of which they were at first only the officers of regarding their fellowcitizens as their slaves and numbering them like cattle among their belongings and of calling themselves the equals of the gods and kings of kings if we follow the progress of inequality in these various revolutions we shall find that the establishment of laws and of the right of property was its first term the institution of magistracy the second and the conversion of legitimate into arbitrary power the third and last so that the condition of rich and poor was authorised by the first period that of powerful and weak by the second and only by the third that of master and slave which is the last degree of inequality and the term at which all the rest remain when they have got so far till the government is either entirely dissolved by new revolutions or brought back again to legitimacy to understand this progress as necessary we must consider not so much the motives for the establishment of the body politic as the forms it assumes in actuality and the faults that necessarily attend it for the flaws which make social institutions necessary are the same as make the abuse of them unavoidable if we except sparta where the laws were mainly concerned with the education of children and where lycurgus established such morality as practically made laws needless—for laws as a rule being weaker than the passions restrain men without altering them—it would not be difficult to prove that every government which scrupulously complied with the ends for which it was instituted and guarded carefully against change and corruption was set up unnecessarily for a country in which no one either evaded the laws or made a bad use of magisterial power could require neither laws nor magistrates political distinctions necessarily produce civil distinctions the growing equality between the chiefs and the people is soon felt by individuals and modified in a thousand ways according to passions talents and circumstances the magistrate could not usurp any illegitimate power without giving distinction to the creatures with whom he must share it besides individuals only     allow themselves to be oppressed so far as they are hurried on by blind ambition and looking rather below than above them come to love authority more than independence and submit to slavery that they may in turn enslave others it is no easy matter to reduce to obedience a man who has no ambition to command nor would the most adroit politician find it possible to enslave a people whose only desire was to be independent but inequality easily makes its way among cowardly and ambitious minds which are ever ready to run the risks of fortune and almost indifferent whether they command or obey as it is favourable or adverse thus there must have been a time when the eyes of the people were so fascinated that their rulers had only to say to the least of men be great you and all your posterity to make him immediately appear great in the eyes of every one as well as in his own his descendants took still more upon them in proportion to their distance from him the more obscure and uncertain the cause the greater the effect the greater the number of idlers one could count in a family the more illustrious it was held to be if this were the place to go into details i could readily explain how even without the intervention of government inequality of credit and authority became unavoidable among private persons as soon as their union in a single society made them compare themselves one with another and take into account the differences which they found out from the continual intercourse every man had to have with his neighbours  these differences are of several kinds but     riches nobility or rank power and personal merit being the principal distinctions by which men form an estimate of each other in society i could prove that the harmony or conflict of these different forces is the surest indication of the good or bad constitution of a state i could show that among these four kinds of inequality personal qualities being the origin of all the others wealth is the one to which they are all reduced in the end for as riches tend most immediately to the prosperity of individuals and are easiest to communicate they are used to purchase every other distinction by this observation we are enabled to judge pretty exactly how far a people has departed from its primitive constitution and of its progress towards the extreme term of corruption i could explain how much this universal desire for reputation honours and advancement which inflames us all exercises and holds up to comparison our faculties and powers how it excites and multiplies our passions and by creating universal competition and rivalry or rather enmity among men occasions numberless failures successes and disturbances of all kinds by making so many aspirants run the same course i could show that it is to this desire of being talked about and this unremitting rage of distinguishing ourselves that we owe the best and the worst things we possess both our virtues and our vices our science and our errors our conquerors and our philosophers that is to say a great many bad things and a very few good ones in a word i could prove that if we have a few rich and powerful men on the pinnacle of     fortune and grandeur while the crowd grovels in want and obscurity it is because the former prize what they enjoy only in so far as others are destitute of it and because without changing their condition they would cease to be happy the moment the people ceased to be wretched these details alone however would furnish matter for a considerable work in which the advantages and disadvantages of every kind of government might be weighed as they are related to man in the state of nature and at the same time all the different aspects under which inequality has up to the present appeared or may appear in ages yet to come according to the nature of the several governments and the alterations which time must unavoidably occasion in them might be demonstrated we should then see the multitude oppressed from within in consequence of the very precautions it had taken to guard against foreign tyranny we should see oppression continually gain ground without it being possible for the oppressed to know where it would stop or what legitimate means was left them of checking its progress we should see the rights of citizens and the freedom of nations slowly extinguished and the complaints protests and appeals of the weak treated as seditious murmurings we should see the honour of defending the common cause confined by statecraft to a mercenary part of the people we should see taxes made necessary by such means and the disheartened husbandman deserting his fields even in the midst of peace and leaving the plough to gird on the sword we should see fatal and capricious codes of honour established and the champions of their country sooner or later becoming its enemies and for ever holding their daggers to the breasts of their fellowcitizens the time would come when they would be heard saying to the oppressor of their country—   pectore si fratris gladium juguloque parentis   condere me jubeas gravidæque in viscera partu   conjugis invitâ peragam tamen omnia dextrâ   lucan i       from great inequality of fortunes and conditions from the vast variety of passions and of talents of useless and     pernicious arts of vain sciences would arise a multitude of prejudices equally contrary to reason happiness and virtue we should see the magistrates fomenting everything that might weaken men united in society by promoting dissension among them everything that might sow in it the seeds of actual division while it gave society the air of harmony everything that might inspire the different ranks of people with mutual hatred and distrust by setting the rights and interests of one against those of another and so strengthen the power which comprehended them all it is from the midst of this disorder and these revolutions that despotism gradually raising up its hideous head and devouring everything that remained sound and untainted in any part of the state would at length trample on both the laws and the people and establish itself on the ruins of the republic the times which immediately preceded this last change would be times of trouble and calamity but at length the monster would swallow up everything and the people would no longer have either chiefs or laws but only tyrants from this moment there would be no question of virtue or morality for despotism cui ex honesto nulla est spes wherever it prevails admits no other master it no sooner speaks than probity and duty lose their weight and blind obedience is the only virtue which slaves can still practise this is the last term of inequality the extreme point that closes the circle and meets that from which we set out here all private persons return to their first equality because they are nothing and subjects having no law but the will of their master and their master no restraint but his passions all notions of good and all principles of equity again vanish there is here a complete return to the law of the strongest and so to a new state of nature differing from that we set out from for the one was a state of nature in its first purity while this is the consequence of excessive corruption there is so little difference between the two states in other respects and the contract of government is so completely dissolved by despotism that the despot is master only so long as he remains the strongest as soon as he can be expelled he has no right to complain of     violence the popular insurrection that ends in the death or deposition of a sultan is as lawful an act as those by which he disposed the day before of the lives and fortunes of his subjects as he was maintained by force alone it is force alone that overthrows him thus everything takes place according to the natural order and whatever may be the result of such frequent and precipitate revolutions no one man has reason to complain of the injustice of another but only of his own illfortune or indiscretion if the reader thus discovers and retraces the lost and forgotten road by which man must have passed from the state of nature to the state of society if he carefully restores along with the intermediate situations which i have just described those which want of time has compelled me to suppress or my imagination has failed to suggest he cannot fail to be struck by the vast distance which separates the two states it is in tracing this slow succession that he will find the solution of a number of problems of politics and morals which philosophers cannot settle he will feel that men being different in different ages the reason why diogenes could not find a man was that he sought among his contemporaries a man of an earlier period he will see that cato died with rome and liberty because he did not fit the age in which he lived the greatest of men served only to astonish a world which he would certainly have ruled had he lived five hundred years sooner in a word he will explain how the soul and the passions of men insensibly change their very nature why our wants and pleasures in the end seek new objects and why the original man having vanished by degrees society offers to us only an assembly of artificial men and factitious passions which are the work of all these new relations and without any real foundation in nature we are taught nothing on this subject by reflection that is not entirely confirmed by observation the savage and the civilised man differ so much in the bottom of their hearts and in their inclinations that what constitutes the supreme happiness of one would reduce the other to despair the former breathes only peace and liberty he desires only to live and be free from labour even the ataraxia of the stoic falls far short of his profound indifference to every other object civilised man on the     other hand is always moving sweating toiling and racking his brains to find still more laborious occupations he goes on in drudgery to his last moment and even seeks death to put himself in a position to live or renounces life to acquire immortality he pays his court to men in power whom he hates and to the wealthy whom he despises he stops at nothing to have the honour of serving them he is not ashamed to value himself on his own meanness and their protection and proud of his slavery he speaks with disdain of those who have not the honour of sharing it what a sight would the perplexing and envied labours of a european minister of state present to the eyes of a caribean how many cruel deaths would not this indolent savage prefer to the horrors of such a life which is seldom even sweetened by the pleasure of doing good but for him to see into the motives of all this solicitude the words power and reputation would have to bear some meaning in his mind he would have to know that there are men who set a value on the opinion of the rest of the world who can be made happy and satisfied with themselves rather on the testimony of other people than on their own in reality the source of all these differences is that the savage lives within himself while social man lives constantly outside himself and only knows how to live in the opinion of others so that he seems to receive the consciousness of his own existence merely from the judgment of others concerning him it is not to my present purpose to insist on the indifference to good and evil which arises from this disposition in spite of our many fine works on morality or to show how everything being reduced to appearances there is but art and mummery in even honour friendship virtue and often vice itself of which we at length learn the secret of boasting to show in short how always asking others what we are and never daring to ask ourselves in the midst of so much philosophy humanity and civilisation and of such sublime codes of morality we have nothing to show for ourselves but a frivolous and deceitful appearance honour without virtue reason without wisdom and pleasure without happiness it is sufficient that i have proved that this is not by any means the original state of man but that it is merely the spirit of society and the inequality which     society produces that thus transform and alter all our natural inclinations i have endeavoured to trace the origin and progress of inequality and the institution and abuse of political societies as far as these are capable of being deduced from the nature of man merely by the light of reason and independently of those sacred dogmas which give the sanction of divine right to sovereign authority it follows from this survey that as there is hardly any inequality in the state of nature all the inequality which now prevails owes its strength and growth to the development of our faculties and the advance of the human mind and becomes at last permanent and legitimate by the establishment of property and laws secondly it follows that moral inequality authorised by positive right alone clashes with natural right whenever it is not proportionate to physical inequality a distinction which sufficiently determines what we ought to think of that species of inequality which prevails in all civilised countries since it is plainly contrary to the law of nature however defined that children should command old men fools wise men and that the privileged few should gorge themselves with superfluities while the starving multitude are in want of the bare necessities of life     appendix  a famous author reckoning up the good and evil of human life and comparing the aggregates finds that our pains greatly exceed our pleasures so that all things considered human life is not at all a valuable gift this conclusion does not surprise me for the writer drew all his arguments from man in civilisation had he gone back to the state of nature his inquiries would clearly have had a different result and man would have been seen to be subject to very few evils not of his own creation it has indeed cost us not a little trouble to make ourselves as wretched as we are when we consider on the one hand the immense labours of mankind the many sciences brought to perfection the arts invented the powers employed the deeps filled up the mountains levelled the rocks shattered the rivers made navigable the tracts of land cleared the lakes emptied the marshes drained the enormous structures erected on land and the teeming vessels that cover the sea and on the other hand estimate with ever so little thought the real advantages that have accrued from all these works to mankind we cannot help being amazed at the vast disproportion there is between these things and deploring the infatuation of man which to gratify his silly pride and vain selfadmiration induces him eagerly to pursue all the miseries he is capable of feeling though beneficent nature had kindly placed them out of his way that men are actually wicked a sad and continual experience of them proves beyond doubt but all the same i think i have shown that man is naturally good what then can have depraved him to such an extent except the changes that have happened in his constitution the advances he has made and the knowledge he has acquired we may admire human society as much as we please it will be none the less true that it necessarily   0 leads men to hate each other in proportion as their interests clash and to do one another apparent services while they are really doing every imaginable mischief what can be thought of a relation in which the interest of every individual dictates rules directly opposite to those the public reason dictates to the community in general—in which every man finds his profit in the misfortunes of his neighbour there is not perhaps any man in a comfortable position who has not greedy heirs and perhaps even children secretly wishing for his death not a ship at sea of which the loss would not be good news to some merchant or other not a house which some debtor of bad faith would not be glad to see reduced to ashes with all the papers it contains not a nation which does not rejoice at the disasters that befall its neighbours thus it is that we find our advantage in the misfortunes of our fellowcreatures and that the loss of one man almost always constitutes the prosperity of another but it is still more pernicious that public calamities are the objects of the hopes and expectations of innumerable individuals some desire sickness some mortality some war and some famine i have seen men wicked enough to weep for sorrow at the prospect of a plentiful season and the great and fatal fire of london which cost so many unhappy persons their lives or their fortunes made the fortunes of perhaps ten thousand others i know that montaigne censures demades the athenian for having caused to be punished a workman who by selling his coffins very dear was a great gainer by the deaths of his fellowcitizens but the reason alleged by montaigne being that everybody ought to be punished my point is clearly confirmed by it let us penetrate therefore the superficial appearances of benevolence and survey what passes in the inmost recesses of the heart let us reflect what must be the state of things when men are forced to caress and destroy one another at the same time when they are born enemies by duty and knaves by interest it will perhaps be said that society is so formed that every man gains by serving the rest that would be all very well if he did not gain still more by injuring them there is no legitimate profit so great that it cannot be greatly exceeded by what may be made illegitimately we always gain more by hurting     our neighbours than by doing them good nothing is required but to know how to act with impunity and to this end the powerful employ all their strength and the weak all their cunning savage man when he has dined is at peace with all nature and the friend of all his fellowcreatures if a dispute arises about a meal he rarely comes to blows without having first compared the difficulty of conquering his antagonist with the trouble of finding subsistence elsewhere and as pride does not come in it all ends in a few blows the victor eats and the vanquished seeks provision somewhere else and all is at peace the case is quite different with man in the state of society for whom first necessaries have to be provided and then superfluities delicacies follow next then immense wealth then subjects and then slaves he enjoys not a moments relaxation and what is yet stranger the less natural and pressing his wants the more headstrong are his passions and still worse the more he has it in his power to gratify them so that after a long course of prosperity after having swallowed up treasures and ruined multitudes the hero ends up by cutting every throat till he finds himself at last sole master of the world such is in miniature the moral picture if not of human life at least of the secret pretensions of the heart of civilised man compare without partiality the state of the citizen with that of the savage and trace out if you can how many inlets the former has opened to pain and death besides those of his vices his wants and his misfortunes if you reflect on the mental afflictions that prey on us the violent passions that waste and exhaust us the excessive labour with which the poor are burdened the still more dangerous indolence to which the wealthy give themselves up so that the poor perish of want and the rich of surfeit if you reflect but a moment on the heterogeneous mixtures and pernicious seasonings of foods the corrupt state in which they are frequently eaten on the adulteration of medicines the wiles of those who sell them the mistakes of those who administer them and the poisonous vessels in which they are prepared on the epidemics bred by foul air in consequence of great numbers of men being crowded together or those which are caused by our     delicate way of living by our passing from our houses into the open air and back again by the putting on or throwing off our clothes with too little care and by all the precautions which sensuality has converted into necessary habits and the neglect of which sometimes costs us our life or health if you take into account the conflagrations and earthquakes which devouring or overwhelming whole cities destroy the inhabitants by thousands in a word if you add together all the dangers with which these causes are always threatening us you will see how dearly nature makes us pay for the contempt with which we have treated her lessons i shall not here repeat what i have elsewhere said of the calamities of war but wish that those who have sufficient knowledge were willing or bold enough to make public the details of the villainies committed in armies by the contractors for commissariat and hospitals we should see plainly that their monstrous frauds already none too well concealed which cripple the finest armies in less than no time occasion greater destruction among the soldiers than the swords of the enemy the number of people who perish annually at sea by famine the scurvy pirates fire and shipwrecks affords matter for another shocking calculation we must also place to the credit of the establishment of property and consequently to the institution of society assassinations poisonings highway robberies and even the punishments inflicted on the wretches guilty of these crimes which though expedient to prevent greater evils yet by making the murder of one man cost the lives of two or more double the loss to the human race what shameful methods are sometimes practised to prevent the birth of men and cheat nature either by brutal and depraved appetites which insult her most beautiful work—appetites unknown to savages or mere animals which can spring only from the corrupt imagination of mankind in civilised countries or by secret abortions the fitting effects of debauchery and vitiated notions of honour or by the exposure or murder of multitudes of infants who fall victims to the poverty of their parents or the cruel shame of their mothers or finally by the mutilation of unhappy wretches part of whose life with their     hope of posterity is given up to vain singing or still worse the brutal jealousy of other men a mutilation which in the last case becomes a double outrage against nature from the treatment of those who suffer it and from the use to which they are destined but is it not a thousand times more common and more dangerous for paternal rights openly to offend against humanity how many talents have not been thrown away and inclinations forced by the unwise constraint of fathers how many men who would have distinguished themselves in a fitting estate have died dishonoured and wretched in another for which they had no taste how many happy but unequal marriages have been broken or disturbed and how many chaste wives have been dishonoured by an order of things continually in contradiction with that of nature how many good and virtuous husbands and wives are reciprocally punished for having been illassorted how many young and unhappy victims of their parents avarice plunge into vice or pass their melancholy days in tears groaning in the indissoluble bonds which their hearts repudiate and gold alone has formed fortunate sometimes are those whose courage and virtue remove them from life before inhuman violence makes them spend it in crime or in despair forgive me father and mother whom i shall ever regret my complaint embitters your griefs but would they might be an eternal and terrible example to every one who dares in the name of nature to violate her most sacred right if i have spoken only of those illstarred unions which are the result of our system is it to be thought that those over which love and sympathy preside are free from disadvantages what if i should undertake to show humanity attacked in its very source and even in the most sacred of all ties in which fortune is consulted before nature and the disorders of society confounding all virtue and vice continence becomes a criminal precaution and a refusal to give life to a fellowcreature an act of humanity but without drawing aside the veil which hides all these horrors let us content ourselves with pointing out the evil which others will have to remedy to all this add the multiplicity of unhealthy trades which shorten mens lives or destroy their bodies such     as working in the mines and the preparing of metals and minerals particularly lead copper mercury cobalt and arsenic add those other dangerous trades which are daily fatal to many tilers carpenters masons and miners put all these together and we can see in the establishment and perfection of societies the reasons for that diminution of our species which has been noticed by many philosophers luxury which cannot be prevented among men who are tenacious of their own convenience and of the respect paid them by others soon completes the evil society had begun and under the pretence of giving bread to the poor whom it should never have made such impoverishes all the rest and sooner or later depopulates the state luxury is a remedy much worse than the disease it sets up to cure or rather it is in itself the greatest of all evils for every state great or small for in order to maintain all the servants and vagabonds it creates it brings oppression and ruin on the citizen and the labourer it is like those scorching winds which covering the trees and plants with devouring insects deprive useful animals of their subsistence and spread famine and death wherever they blow from society and the luxury to which it gives birth arise the liberal and mechanical arts commerce letters and all those superfluities which make industry flourish and enrich and ruin nations the reason for such destruction is plain it is easy to see from the very nature of agriculture that it must be the least lucrative of all the arts for its produce being the most universally necessary the price must be proportionate to the abilities of the very poorest of mankind from the same principle may be deduced this rule that the arts in general are more lucrative in proportion as they are less useful and that in the end the most useful becomes the most neglected from this we may learn what to think of the real advantages of industry and the actual effects of its progress such are the sensible causes of all the miseries into which opulence at length plunges the most celebrated nations in proportion as arts and industry flourish the despised husbandman burdened with the taxes necessary for the support of luxury and condemned to pass his days     between labour and hunger forsakes his native field to seek in towns the bread he ought to carry thither the more our capital cities strike the vulgar eye with admiration the greater reason is there to lament the sight of the abandoned countryside the large tracts of land that lie uncultivated the roads crowded with unfortunate citizens turned beggars or highwaymen and doomed to end their wretched lives either on a dunghill or on the gallows thus the state grows rich on the one hand and feeble and depopulated on the other the mightiest monarchies after having taken immense pains to enrich and depopulate themselves fall at last a prey to some poor nation which has yielded to the fatal temptation of invading them and then growing opulent and weak in its turn is itself invaded and ruined by some other let any one inform us what produced the swarms of barbarians who overran europe asia and africa for so many ages was their prodigious increase due to their industry and arts to the wisdom of their laws or to the excellence of their political system let the learned tell us why instead of multiplying to such a degree these fierce and brutal men without sense or science without education without restraint did not destroy each other hourly in quarrelling over the productions of their fields and woods let them tell us how these wretches could have the presumption to oppose such clever people as we were so well trained in military discipline and possessed of such excellent laws and institutions and why since society has been brought to perfection in northern countries and so much pains taken to instruct their inhabitants in their social duties and in the art of living happily and peaceably together we see them no longer produce such numberless hosts as they used once to send forth to be the plague and terror of other nations i fear some one may at last answer me by saying that all these fine things arts sciences and laws were wisely invented by men as a salutary plague to prevent the too great multiplication of mankind lest the world which was given us for a habitation should in time be too small for its inhabitants what then is to be done must societies be totally abolished must meum and tuum be annihilated and must we return again to the forests to live among bears     this is a deduction in the manner of my adversaries which i would as soon anticipate as let them have the shame of drawing o you who have never heard the voice of heaven who think man destined only to live this little life and die in peace you who can resign in the midst of populous cities your fatal acquisitions your restless spirits your corrupt hearts and endless desires resume since it depends entirely on yourselves your ancient and primitive innocence retire to the woods there to lose the sight and remembrance of the crimes of your contemporaries and be not apprehensive of degrading your species by renouncing its advances in order to renounce its vices as for men like me whose passions have destroyed their original simplicity who can no longer subsist on plants or acorns or live without laws and magistrates those who were honoured in their first father with supernatural instructions those who discover in the design of giving human actions at the start a morality which they must otherwise have been so long in acquiring the reason for a precept in itself indifferent and inexplicable on every other system those in short who are persuaded that the divine being has called all mankind to be partakers in the happiness and perfection of celestial intelligences all these will endeavour to merit the eternal prize they are to expect from the practice of those virtues which they make themselves follow in learning to know them they will respect the sacred bonds of their respective communities they will love their fellowcitizens and serve them with all their might they will scrupulously obey the laws and all those who make or administer them they will particularly honour those wise and good princes who find means of preventing curing or even palliating all these evils and abuses by which we are constantly threatened they will animate the zeal of their deserving rulers by showing them without flattery or fear the importance of their office and the severity of their duty but they will not therefore have less contempt for a constitution that cannot support itself without the aid of so many splendid characters much oftener wished for than found and from which notwithstanding all their pains and solicitude there always arise more real calamities than even apparent advantages     a discourse on political economy         a discourse on political economy the word economy or œconomy is derived from οὰκός a house and νόμος law and meant originally only the wise and legitimate government of the house for the common good of the whole family the meaning of the term was then extended to the government of that great family the state to distinguish these two senses of the word the latter is called general or political economy and the former domestic or particular economy the first only is discussed in the present discourse even if there were as close an analogy as many authors maintain between the state and the family it would not follow that the rules of conduct proper for one of these societies would be also proper for the other they differ too much in extent to be regulated in the same manner and there will always be a great difference between domestic government in which a father can see everything for himself and civil government where the chief sees hardly anything save through the eyes of others to put both on an equality in this respect the talents strength and all the faculties of the father would have to increase in proportion to the size of his family and the soul of a powerful monarch would have to be to that of an ordinary man as the extent of his empire is to that of a private persons estate but how could the government of the state be like that of the family when the basis on which they rest is so different the father being physically stronger than his children his paternal authority as long as they need his protection may be reasonably said to be established by nature but in the great family all the members of which are naturally equal the political authority being purely arbitrary as far as its institution is concerned can be founded only on conventions and the magistrate can have no authority over the rest except by virtue of the laws   0 the duties of a father are dictated to him by natural feelings and in a manner that seldom allows him to neglect them for rulers there is no such principle and they are really obliged to the people only by what they themselves have promised to do and the people have therefore a right to require of them another more important difference is that since the children have nothing but what they receive from their father it is plain that all the rights of property belong to him or emanate from him but quite the opposite is the case in the great family where the general administration is established only to secure individual property which is antecedent to it the principal object of the work of the whole house is to preserve and increase the patrimony of the father in order that he may be able some day to distribute it among his children without impoverishing them whereas the wealth of the exchequer is only a means often ill understood of keeping the individuals in peace and plenty in a word the little family is destined to be extinguished and to resolve itself some day into several families of a similar nature but the great family being constituted to endure for ever in the same condition need not like the small one increase for the purpose of multiplying but need only maintain itself and it can easily be proved that any increase does it more harm than good in the family it is clear for several reasons which lie in its very nature that the father ought to command in the first place the authority ought not to be equally divided between father and mother the government must be single and in every division of opinion there must be one preponderant voice to decide secondly however lightly we may regard the disadvantages peculiar to women yet as they necessarily occasion intervals of inaction this is a sufficient reason for excluding them from this supreme authority for when the balance is perfectly even a straw is enough to turn the scale besides the husband ought to be able to superintend his wifes conduct because it is of importance for him to be assured that the children whom he is obliged to acknowledge and maintain belong to noone but himself thirdly children should be obedient to their father at first of necessity and afterwards from gratitude after having had their wants satisfied by him during one half of their lives they ought     to consecrate the other half to providing for his fourthly servants owe him their services in exchange for the provision he makes for them though they may break off the bargain as soon as it ceases to suit them i say nothing here of slavery because it is contrary to nature and cannot be authorised by any right or law there is nothing of all this in political society in which the chief is so far from having any natural interest in the happiness of the individuals that it is not uncommon for him to seek his own in their misery if the magistracy is hereditary a community of men is often governed by a child if it be elective innumerable inconveniences arise from such election while in both cases all the advantages of paternity are lost if you have but a single ruler you lie at the discretion of a master who has no reason to love you and if you have several you must bear at once their tyranny and their divisions in a word abuses are inevitable and their consequences fatal in every society where the public interest and the laws have no natural force and are perpetually attacked by personal interest and the passions of the ruler and the members although the functions of the father of a family and those of the chief magistrate ought to make for the same object they must do so in such different ways and their duty and rights are so essentially distinct that we cannot confound them without forming very false ideas about the fundamental laws of society and falling into errors which are fatal to mankind in fact if the voice of nature is the best counsellor to which a father can listen in the discharge of his duty for the magistrate it is a false guide which continually prevents him from performing his and leads him on sooner or later to the ruin of himself and of the state if he is not restrained by the most sublime virtue the only precaution necessary for the father of a family is to guard himself against depravity and prevent his natural inclinations from being corrupted whereas it is these themselves which corrupt the magistrate in order to act aright the first has only to consult his heart the other becomes a traitor the moment he listens to his even his own reason should be suspect to him nor should he follow any rule other than the public reason which is the law thus nature has made a multitude of good fathers of     families but it is doubtful whether from the very beginning of the world human wisdom has made ten men capable of governing their peers from all that has just been said it follows that public economy which is my subject has been rightly distinguished from private economy and that the state having nothing in common with the family except the obligations which their heads lie under of making both of them happy the same rules of conduct cannot apply to both i have considered these few lines enough to overthrow the detestable system which sir robert filmer has endeavoured to establish in his patriarcha a work to which two celebrated writers have done too much honour in writing books to refute it moreover this error is of very long standing for aristotle himself thought proper to combat it with arguments which may be found in the first book of his politics i must here ask my readers to distinguish also between public economy which is my subject and which i call government and the supreme authority which i call sovereignty a distinction which consists in the fact that the latter has the right of legislation and in certain cases binds the body of the nation itself while the former has only the right of execution and is binding only on individuals i shall take the liberty of making use of a very common and in some respects inaccurate comparison which will serve to illustrate my meaning the body politic taken individually may be considered as an organised living body resembling that of man the sovereign power represents the head the laws and customs are the brain the source of the nerves and seat of the understanding will and senses of which the judges and magistrates are the organs commerce industry and agriculture are the mouth and stomach which prepare the common subsistence the public income is the blood which a prudent economy in performing the functions of the heart causes to distribute through the whole body nutriment and life the citizens are the body and the members which make the machine live move and work and no part of this machine can be damaged without the painful impression being at once conveyed to the brain if the animal is in a state of health     the life of both bodies is the self common to the whole the reciprocal sensibility and internal correspondence of all the parts where this communication ceases where the formal unity disappears and the contiguous parts belong to one another only by juxtaposition the man is dead or the state is dissolved the body politic therefore is also a moral being possessed of a will and this general will which tends always to the preservation and welfare of the whole and of every part and is the source of the laws constitutes for all the members of the state in their relations to one another and to it the rule of what is just or unjust a truth which shows by the way how idly some writers have treated as theft the subtlety prescribed to children at sparta for obtaining their frugal repasts as if everything ordained by the law were not lawful it is important to observe that this rule of justice though certain with regard to all citizens may be defective with regard to foreigners the reason is clear the will of the state though general in relation to its own members is no longer so in relation to other states and their members but becomes for them a particular and individual will which has its rule of justice in the law of nature this however enters equally into the principle here laid down for in such a case the great city of the world becomes the body politic whose general will is always the law of nature and of which the different states and peoples are individual members from these distinctions applied to each political society and its members are derived the most certain and universal rules by which we can judge whether a government is good or bad and in general of the morality of all human actions every political society is composed of other smaller societies of different kinds each of which has its interests and its rules of conduct but those societies which everybody perceives because they have an external and authorised form are not the only ones that actually exist in the state all individuals who are united by a common interest compose as many others either transitory or permanent whose influence is none the less real because it is less apparent and the proper observation of whose various relations is the true knowledge of public morals and     manners the influence of all these tacit or formal associations causes by the influence of their will as many different modifications of the public will the will of these particular societies has always two relations for the members of the association it is a general will for the great society it is a particular will and it is often right with regard to the first object and wrong as to the second an individual may be a devout priest a brave soldier or a zealous senator and yet a bad citizen a particular resolution may be advantageous to the smaller community but pernicious to the greater it is true that particular societies being always subordinate to the general society in preference to others the duty of a citizen takes precedence of that of a senator and a mans duty of that of a citizen but unhappily personal interest is always found in inverse ratio to duty and increases in proportion as the association grows narrower and the engagement less sacred which irrefragably proves that the most general will is always the must just also and that the voice of the people is in fact the voice of god it does not follow that the public decisions are always equitable they may possibly for reasons which i have given not be so when they have to do with foreigners thus it is not impossible that a republic though in itself well governed should enter upon an unjust war nor is it less possible for the council of a democracy to pass unjust decrees and condemn the innocent but this never happens unless the people is seduced by private interests which the credit or eloquence of some clever persons substitutes for those of the state in which case the general will will be one thing and the result of the public deliberation another this is not contradicted by the case of the athenian democracy for athens was in fact not a democracy but a very tyrannical aristocracy governed by philosophers and orators carefully determine what happens in every public deliberation and it will be seen that the general will is always for the common good but very often there is a secret division a tacit confederacy which for particular ends causes the natural disposition of the assembly to be set at nought in such a case the body of society is really divided into other bodies the members of which acquire a general will which is good     and just with respect to these new bodies but unjust and bad with regard to the whole from which each is thus dismembered we see then how easy it is by the help of these principles to explain those apparent contradictions which are noticed in the conduct of many persons who are scrupulously honest in some respects and cheats and scoundrels in others who trample under foot the most sacred duties and yet are faithful to the death to engagements that are often illegitimate thus the most depraved of men always pay some sort of homage to public faith and even robbers who are the enemies of virtue in the great society pay some respect to the shadow of it in their secret caves in establishing the general will as the first principle of public economy and the fundamental rule of government i have not thought it necessary to inquire seriously whether the magistrates belong to the people or the people to the magistrates or whether in public affairs the good of the state should be taken into account or only that of its rulers that question indeed has long been decided one way in theory and another in practice and in general it would be ridiculous to expect that those who are in fact masters will prefer any other interest to their own it would not be improper therefore further to distinguish public economy as popular or tyrannical the former is that of every state in which there reigns between the people and the rulers unity of interest and will the latter will necessarily exist wherever the government and the people have different interests and consequently opposing wills the rules of the latter are written at length in the archives of history and in the satires of macchiavelli the rules of the former are found only in the writings of those philosophers who venture to proclaim the rights of humanity i the first and most important rule of legitimate or popular government that is to say of government whose object is the good of the people is therefore as i have observed to follow in everything the general will but to follow this will it is necessary to know it and above all to distinguish it from the particular will beginning with ones self this distinction is always very difficult to make and only the most sublime virtue can afford sufficient illumination     for it as in order to will it is necessary to be free a difficulty no less great than the former arises—that of preserving at once the public liberty and the authority of government look into the motives which have induced men once united by their common needs in a general society to unite themselves still more intimately by means of civil societies you will find no other motive than that of assuring the property life and liberty of each member by the protection of all but can men be forced to defend the liberty of any one among them without trespassing on that of others and how can they provide for the public needs without alienating the individual property of those who are forced to contribute to them with whatever sophistry all this may be covered over it is certain that if any constraint can be laid on my will i am no longer free and that i am no longer master of my own property if any one else can lay a hand on it this difficulty which would have seemed insurmountable has been removed like the first by the most sublime of all human institutions or rather by a divine inspiration which teaches mankind to imitate here below the unchangeable decrees of the deity by what inconceivable art has a means been found of making men free by making them subject of using in the service of the state the properties the persons and even the lives of all its members without constraining and without consulting them of confining their will by their own admission of overcoming their refusal by that consent and forcing them to punish themselves when they act against their own will how can it be that all should obey yet nobody take upon him to command and that all should serve and yet have no masters but be the more free as in apparent subjection each loses no part of his liberty but what might be hurtful to that of another these wonders are the work of law it is to law alone that men owe justice and liberty it is this salutary organ of the will of all which establishes in civil right the natural equality between men it is this celestial voice which dictates to each citizen the precepts of public reason and teaches him to act according to the rules of his own judgment and not to behave inconsistently with himself it is with this voice alone that political rulers should speak when they command for no sooner     does one man setting aside the law claim to subject another to his private will than he departs from the state of civil society and confronts him face to face in the pure state of nature in which obedience is prescribed solely by necessity the most pressing interest of the ruler and even his most indispensable duty therefore is to watch over the observation of the laws of which he is the minister and on which his whole authority is founded at the same time if he exacts the observance of them from others he is the more strongly bound to observe them himself since he enjoys all their favour for his example is of such force that even if the people were willing to permit him to release himself from the yoke of the law he ought to be cautious in availing himself of so dangerous a prerogative which others might soon claim to usurp in their turn and often use to his prejudice at bottom as all social engagements are mutual in nature it is impossible for any one to set himself above the law without renouncing its advantages for nobody is bound by any obligation to one who claims that he is under no obligations to others for this reason no exemption from the law will ever be granted on any ground whatsoever in a wellregulated government those citizens who have deserved well of their country ought to be rewarded with honours but never with privileges for the republic is at the eve of its fall when any one can think it fine not to obey the laws if the nobility or the soldiery should ever adopt such a maxim all would be lost beyond redemption the power of the laws depends still more on their own wisdom than on the severity of their administrators and the public will derives its greatest weight from the reason which has dictated it hence plato looked upon it as a very necessary precaution to place at the head of all edicts a preamble setting forth their justice and utility in fact the first of all laws is to respect the laws the severity of penalties is only a vain resource invented by little minds in order to substitute terror for that respect which they have no means of obtaining it has constantly been observed that in those countries where legal punishments are most severe they are also most frequent so that the cruelty of such punishments is a proof only of the multitude     of criminals and punishing everything with equal severity induces those who are guilty to commit crimes in order to escape being punished for their faults but though the government be not master of the law it is much to be its guarantor and to possess a thousand means of inspiring the love of it in this alone the talent of reigning consists with force in ones hands there is no art required to make the whole world tremble nor indeed much to gain mens hearts for experience has long since taught the people to give its rulers great credit for all the evil they abstain from doing it and to adore them if they do not absolutely hate it a fool if he be obeyed may punish crimes as well as another but the true statesman is he who knows how to prevent them it is over the wills even more than the actions of his subjects that his honourable rule is extended if he could secure that every one should act aright he would no longer have anything to do and the masterpiece of his labours would be to be able to remain unemployed it is certain at least that the greatest talent a ruler can possess is to disguise his power in order to render it less odious and to conduct the state so peaceably as to make it seem to have no need of conductors i conclude therefore that as the first duty of the legislator is to make the laws conformable to the general will the first rule of public economy is that the administration of justice should be conformable to the laws it will even be enough to prevent the state from being ill governed that the legislator shall have provided as he should for every need of place climate soil custom neighbourhood and all the rest of the relations peculiar to the people he had to institute not but what there still remains an infinity of details of administration and economy which are left to the wisdom of the government but there are two infallible rules for its good conduct on these occasions one is that the spirit of the law ought to decide in every particular case that could not be foreseen the other is that the general will the source and supplement of all laws should be consulted wherever they fail but how i shall be asked can the general will be known in cases in which it has not expressed itself must the whole nation be assembled together at every unforeseen     event certainly not it ought the less to be assembled because it is by no means certain that its decision would be the expression of the general will besides the method would be impracticable in a great people and is hardly ever necessary where the government is wellintentioned for the rulers well know that the general will is always on the side which is most favourable to the public interest that is to say most equitable so that it is needful only to act justly to be certain of following the general will when this is flouted too openly it makes itself felt in spite of the formidable restraint of the public authority i shall cite the nearest possible examples that may be followed in such cases in china it is the constant maxim of the prince to decide against his officers in every dispute that arises between them and the people if bread be too dear in any province the intendant of that province is thrown into prison if there be an insurrection in another the governor is dismissed and every mandarin answers with his head for all the mischief that happens in his department not that these affairs do not subsequently undergo a regular examination but long experience has caused the judgment to be thus anticipated there is seldom any injustice to be repaired in the meantime the emperor being satisfied that public outcry does not arise without cause always discovers through the seditious clamours which he punishes just grievances to redress it is a great thing to preserve the rule of peace and order through all the parts of the republic it is a great thing that the state should be tranquil and the law respected but if nothing more is done there will be in all this more appearance than reality for that government which confines itself to mere obedience will find difficulty in getting itself obeyed if it is good to know how to deal with men as they are it is much better to make them what there is need that they should be the most absolute authority is that which penetrates into a mans inmost being and concerns itself no less with his will than with his actions it is certain that all peoples become in the long run what the government makes them warriors citizens men when it so pleases or merely populace and rabble when it chooses to make   0 them so hence every prince who despises his subjects dishonours himself in confessing that he does not know how to make them worthy of respect make men therefore if you would command men if you would have them obedient to the laws make them love the laws and then they will need only to know what is their duty to do it this was the great art of ancient governments in those distant times when philosophers gave laws to men and made use of their authority only to render them wise and happy thence arose the numerous sumptuary laws the many regulations of morals and all the public rules of conduct which were admitted or rejected with the greatest care even tyrants did not forget this important part of administration but took as great pains to corrupt the morals of their slaves as magistrates took to correct those of their fellowcitizens but our modern governments which imagine they have done everything when they have raised money conceive that it is unnecessary and even impossible to go a step further ii the second essential rule of public economy is no less important than the first if you would have the general will accomplished bring all the particular wills into conformity with it in other words as virtue is nothing more than this conformity of the particular wills with the general will establish the reign of virtue if our politicians were less blinded by their ambition they would see how impossible it is for any establishment whatever to act in the spirit of its institution unless it is guided in accordance with the law of duty they would feel that the greatest support of public authority lies in the hearts of the citizens and that nothing can take the place of morality in the maintenance of government it is not only upright men who know how to administer the laws but at bottom only good men know how to obey them the man who once gets the better of remorse will not shrink before punishments which are less severe and less lasting and from which there is at least the hope of escaping whatever precautions are taken those who only require impunity in order to do wrong will not fail to find means of eluding the law and avoiding its penalties in this case as all particular interests unite against the general interest which is no longer that of any individual     public vices have a greater effect in enervating the laws than the laws in the repression of such vices so that the corruption of the people and of their rulers will at length extend to the government however wise it may be the worst of all abuses is to pay an apparent obedience to the laws only in order actually to break them with security for in this case the best laws soon become the most pernicious and it would be a hundred times better that they should not exist in such a situation it is vain to add edicts to edicts and regulations to regulations everything serves only to introduce new abuses without correcting the old the more laws are multiplied the more they are despised and all the new officials appointed to supervise them are only so many more people to break them and either to share the plunder with their predecessors or to plunder apart on their own the reward of virtue soon becomes that of robbery the vilest of men rise to the greatest credit the greater they are the more despicable they become their infamy appears even in their dignities and their very honours dishonour them if they buy the influence of the leaders or the protection of women it is only that they may sell justice duty and the state in their turn in the meantime the people feeling that its vices are not the first cause of its misfortunes murmurs and complains that all its misfortunes come solely from those whom it pays to protect it from such things it is under these circumstances that the voice of duty no longer speaks in mens hearts and their rulers are obliged to substitute the cry of terror or the lure of an apparent interest of which they subsequently trick their creatures in this situation they are compelled to have recourse to all the petty and despicable shifts which they call rules of state and mysteries of the cabinet all the vigour that is left in the government is used by its members in ruining and supplanting one another while the public business is neglected or is transacted only as personal interest requires and directs in short the whole art of those great politicians lies in so mesmerising those they stand in need of that each may think he is labouring for his own interest in working for theirs i say theirs on the false supposition that it is the real interest of rulers to     annihilate a people in order to make it subject and to ruin their own property in order to secure their possession of it but when the citizens love their duty and the guardians of the public authority sincerely apply themselves to the fostering of that love by their own example and assiduity every difficulty vanishes and government becomes so easy that it needs none of that art of darkness whose blackness is its only mystery those enterprising spirits so dangerous and so much admired all those great ministers whose glory is inseparable from the miseries of the people are no longer regretted public morality supplies what is wanting in the genius of the rulers and the more virtue reigns the less need there is for talent even ambition is better served by duty than by usurpation when the people is convinced that its rulers are labouring only for its happiness its deference saves them the trouble of labouring to strengthen their power and history shows us in a thousand cases that the authority of one who is beloved over those whom he loves is a hundred times more absolute than all the tyranny of usurpers this does not mean that the government ought to be afraid to make use of its power but that it ought to make use of it only in a lawful manner we find in history a thousand examples of pusillanimous or ambitious rulers who were ruined by their slackness or their pride not one who suffered for having been strictly just but we ought not to confound negligence with moderation or clemency with weakness to be just it is necessary to be severe to permit vice when one has the right and the power to suppress it is to be oneself vicious it is not enough to say to the citizens be good they must be taught to be so and even example which is in this respect the first lesson is not the sole means to be employed patriotism is the most efficacious for as i have said already every man is virtuous when his particular will is in all things conformable to the general will and we voluntarily will what is willed by those whom we love it appears that the feeling of humanity evaporates and grows feeble in embracing all mankind and that we cannot be affected by the calamities of tartary or japan in the same manner as we are by those of european nations it is necessary in some degree to confine and limit our interest     and compassion in order to make it active now as this sentiment can be useful only to those with whom we have to live it is proper that our humanity should confine itself to our fellowcitizens and should receive a new force because we are in the habit of seeing them and by reason of the common interest which unites them it is certain that the greatest miracles of virtue have been produced by patriotism this fine and lively feeling which gives to the force of selflove all the beauty of virtue lends it an energy which without disfiguring it makes it the most heroic of all passions this it is that produces so many immortal actions the glory of which dazzles our feeble eyes and so many great men whose oldworld virtues pass for fables now that patriotism is made mock of this is not surprising the transports of susceptible hearts appear altogether fanciful to any one who has never felt them and the love of ones country which is a hundred times more lively and delightful than the love of a mistress cannot be conceived except by experiencing it but it is easy to perceive in every heart that is warmed by it in all the actions it inspires a glowing and sublime ardour which does not attend the purest virtue when separated from it contrast socrates even with cato the one was the greater philosopher the other more of the citizen athens was already ruined in the time of socrates and he had no other country than the world at large cato had the cause of his country always at heart he lived for it alone and could not bear to outlive it the virtue of socrates was that of the wisest of men but compared with cæsar and pompey cato seems a god among mortals socrates instructed a few individuals opposed the sophists and died for truth but cato defended his country its liberty and its laws against the conquerors of the world and at length departed from the earth when he had no longer a country to serve a worthy pupil of socrates would be the most virtuous of his contemporaries but a worthy follower of cato would be one of the greatest the virtue of the former would be his happiness the latter would seek his happiness in that of all we should be taught by the one and led by the other and this alone is enough to determine which to prefer for no people has ever been made into a nation of philosophers but it is not impossible to make a people happy     do we wish men to be virtuous then let us begin by making them love their country but how can they love it if their country be nothing more to them than to strangers and afford them nothing but what it can refuse nobody it would be still worse if they did not enjoy even the privilege of social security and if their lives liberties and property lay at the mercy of persons in power without their being permitted or it being possible for them to get relief from the laws for in that case being subjected to the duties of the state of civil society without enjoying even the common privileges of the state of nature and without being able to use their strength in their own defence they would be in the worst condition in which freemen could possibly find themselves and the word country would mean for them something merely odious and ridiculous it must not be imagined that a man can break or lose an arm without the pain being conveyed to his head nor is it any more credible that the general will should consent that any one member of the state whoever he might be should wound or destroy another than it is that the fingers of a man in his senses should wilfully scratch his eyes out the security of individuals is so intimately connected with the public confederation that apart from the regard that must be paid to human weakness that convention would in point of right be dissolved if in the state a single citizen who might have been relieved were allowed to perish or if one were wrongfully confined in prison or if in one case an obviously unjust sentence were given for the fundamental conventions being broken it is impossible to conceive of any right or interest that could retain the people in the social union unless they were restrained by force which alone causes the dissolution of the state of civil society in fact does not the undertaking entered into by the whole body of the nation bind it to provide for the security of the least of its members with as much care as for that of all the rest is the welfare of a single citizen any less the common cause than that of the whole state it may be said that it is good that one should perish for all i am ready to admire such a saying when it comes from the lips of a virtuous and worthy patriot voluntarily and dutifully sacrificing himself for the good of his country     but if we are to understand by it that it is lawful for the government to sacrifice an innocent man for the good of the multitude i look upon it as one of the most execrable rules tyranny ever invented the greatest falsehood that can be advanced the most dangerous admission that can be made and a direct contradiction of the fundamental laws of society so little is it the case that any one person ought to perish for all that all have pledged their lives and properties for the defence of each in order that the weakness of individuals may always be protected by the strength of the public and each member by the whole state suppose we take from the whole people one individual after another and then press the advocates of this rule to explain more exactly what they mean by the body of the state and we shall see that it will at length be reduced to a small number of persons who are not the people but the officers of the people and who having bound themselves by personal oath to perish for the welfare of the people would thence infer that the people is to perish for their own need we look for examples of the protection which the state owes to its members and the respect it owes to their persons it is only among the most illustrious and courageous nations that they are to be found it is only among free peoples that the dignity of man is realised it is well known into what perplexity the whole republic of sparta was thrown when the question of punishing a guilty citizen arose in macedon the life of a man was a matter of such importance that alexander the great at the height of his glory would not have dared to put a macedonian criminal to death in cold blood till the accused had appeared to make his defence before his fellowcitizens and had been condemned by them but the romans distinguished themselves above all other peoples by the regard which their government paid to the individual and by its scrupulous attention to the preservation of the inviolable rights of all the members of the state nothing was so sacred among them as the life of a citizen and no less than an assembly of the whole people was needed to condemn one not even the senate nor the consuls in all their majesty possessed the right but the crime and punishment of a     citizen were regarded as a public calamity among the most powerful people in the world so hard indeed did it seem to shed blood for any crime whatsoever that by the lex porcia the penalty of death was commuted into that of banishment for all those who were willing to survive the loss of so great a country everything both at rome and in the roman armies breathed that love of fellowcitizens one for another and that respect for the roman name which raised the courage and inspired the virtue of every one who had the honour to bear it the cap of a citizen delivered from slavery the civic crown of him who had saved the life of another were looked upon with the greatest pleasure amid the pomp of their triumphs and it is remarkable that among the crowns which were bestowed in honour of splendid actions in war the civic crown and that of the triumphant general alone were of laurel all the others being merely of gold it was thus that rome was virtuous and became the mistress of the world ambitious rulers a herdsman governs his dogs and cattle and yet is only the meanest of mankind if it be a fine thing to command it is when those who obey us are capable of doing us honour show respect therefore to your fellowcitizens and you will render yourselves worthy of respect show respect to liberty and your power will increase daily never exceed your rights and they will soon become unlimited let our country then show itself the common mother of her citizens let the advantages they enjoy in their country endear it to them let the government leave them enough share in the public administration to make them feel that they are at home and let the laws be in their eyes only the guarantees of the common liberty these rights great as they are belong to all men but without seeming to attack them directly the illwill of rulers may in fact easily reduce their effect to nothing the law which they thus abuse serves the powerful at once as a weapon of offence and as a shield against the weak and the pretext of the public good is always the most dangerous scourge of the people what is most necessary and perhaps most difficult in government is rigid integrity in doing strict justice to all and above all in protecting the poor against the tyranny of the rich the greatest evil has     already come about when there are poor men to be defended and rich men to be restrained it is on the middle classes alone that the whole force of the law is exerted they are equally powerless against the treasures of the rich and the penury of the poor the first mocks them the second escapes them the one breaks the meshes the other passes through them it is therefore one of the most important functions of government to prevent extreme inequality of fortunes not by taking away wealth from its possessors but by depriving all men of means to accumulate it not by building hospitals for the poor but by securing the citizens from becoming poor the unequal distribution of inhabitants over the territory when men are crowded together in one place while other places are depopulated the encouragement of the arts that minister to luxury and of purely industrial arts at the expense of useful and laborious crafts the sacrifice of agriculture to commerce the necessitation of the taxfarmer by the maladministration of the funds of the state and in short venality pushed to such an extreme that even public esteem is reckoned at a cash value and virtue rated at a market price these are the most obvious causes of opulence and of poverty of public interest of mutual hatred among citizens of indifference to the common cause of the corruption of the people and of the weakening of all the springs of government such are the evils which are with difficulty cured when they make themselves felt but which a wise administration ought to prevent if it is to maintain along with good morals respect for the laws patriotism and the influence of the general will but all these precautions will be inadequate unless rulers go still more to the root of the matter i conclude this part of public economy where i ought to have begun it there can be no patriotism without liberty no liberty without virtue no virtue without citizens create citizens and you have everything you need without them you will have nothing but debased slaves from the rulers of the state downwards to form citizens is not the work of a day and in order to have men it is necessary to educate them when they are children it will be said perhaps that whoever has men to govern ought not to seek beyond     their nature a perfection of which they are incapable that he ought not to desire to destroy their passions and that the execution of such an attempt is no more desirable than it is possible i will agree further that a man without passions would certainly be a bad citizen but it must be agreed also that if men are not taught not to love some things it is impossible to teach them to love one object more than another—to prefer that which is truly beautiful to that which is deformed if for example they were early accustomed to regard their individuality only in its relation to the body of the state and to be aware so to speak of their own existence merely as a part of that of the state they might at length come to identify themselves in some degree with this greater whole to feel themselves members of their country and to love it with that exquisite feeling which no isolated person has save for himself to lift up their spirits perpetually to this great object and thus to transform into a sublime virtue that dangerous disposition which gives rise to all our vices not only does philosophy demonstrate the possibility of giving feeling these new directions history furnishes us with a thousand striking examples if they are so rare among us moderns it is because nobody troubles himself whether citizens exist or not and still less does anybody think of attending to the matter soon enough to make them it is too late to change our natural inclinations when they have taken their course and egoism is confirmed by habit it is too late to lead us out of ourselves when once the human ego concentrated in our hearts has acquired that contemptible activity which absorbs all virtue and constitutes the life and being of little minds how can patriotism germinate in the midst of so many other passions which smother it and what can remain for fellowcitizens of a heart already divided between avarice a mistress and vanity from the first moment of life men ought to begin learning to deserve to live and as at the instant of birth we partake of the rights of citizenship that instant ought to be the beginning of the exercise of our duty if there are laws for the age of maturity there ought to be laws for infancy teaching obedience to others and as the reason of each man is not left to be the sole arbiter of his duties     government ought the less indiscriminately to abandon to the intelligence and prejudices of fathers the education of their children as that education is of still greater importance to the state than to the fathers for according to the course of nature the death of the father often deprives him of the final fruits of education but his country sooner or later perceives its effects families dissolve but the state remains should the public authority by taking the place of the father and charging itself with that important function acquire his rights by discharging his duties he would have the less cause to complain as he would only be changing his title and would have in common under the name of citizen the same authority over his children as he was exercising separately under the name of father and would not be less obeyed when speaking in the name of the law than when he spoke in that of nature public education therefore under regulations prescribed by the government and under magistrates established by the sovereign is one of the fundamental rules of popular or legitimate government if children are brought up in common in the bosom of equality if they are imbued with the laws of the state and the precepts of the general will if they are taught to respect these above all things if they are surrounded by examples and objects which constantly remind them of the tender mother who nourishes them of the love she bears them of the inestimable benefits they receive from her and of the return they owe her we cannot doubt that they will learn to cherish one another mutually as brothers to will nothing contrary to the will of society to substitute the actions of men and citizens for the futile and vain babbling of sophists and to become in time defenders and fathers of the country of which they will have been so long the children i shall say nothing of the magistrates destined to preside over such an education which is certainly the most important business of the state it is easy to see that if such marks of public confidence were conferred on slight grounds if this sublime function were not for those who have worthily discharged all other offices the reward of labour the pleasant and honourable repose of old age and the crown of all honours the whole enterprise would   0 be useless and the education void of success for whereever the lesson is not supported by authority and the precept by example all instruction is fruitless and virtue itself loses its credit in the mouth of one who does not practise it but let illustrious warriors bent under the weight of their laurels preach courage let upright magistrates grown white in the purple and on the bench teach justice such teachers as these would thus get themselves virtuous successors and transmit from age to age to generations to come the experience and talents of rulers the courage and virtue of citizens and common emulation in all to live and die for their country i know of but three peoples which once practised public education the cretans the lacedemonians and the ancient persians among all these it was attended with the greatest success and indeed it did wonders among the two last since the world has been divided into nations too great to admit of being well governed this method has been no longer practicable and the reader will readily perceive other reasons why such a thing has never been attempted by any modern people it is very remarkable that the romans were able to dispense with it but rome was for five hundred years one continued miracle which the world cannot hope to see again the virtue of the romans engendered by their horror of tyranny and the crimes of tyrants and by an innate patriotism made all their houses so many schools of citizenship while the unlimited power of fathers over their children made the individual authority so rigid that the father was more feared than the magistrate and was in his family tribunal both censor of morals and avenger of the laws thus a careful and wellintentioned government vigilant incessantly to maintain or restore patriotism and morality among the people provides beforehand against the evils which sooner or later result from the indifference of the citizens to the fate of the republic keeping within narrow bounds that personal interest which so isolates the individual that the state is enfeebled by his power and has nothing to hope from his goodwill wherever men love their country respect the laws and live simply little remains to be done in order to make them happy and in     public administration where chance has less influence than in the lot of individuals wisdom is so nearly allied to happiness that the two objects are confounded iii it is not enough to have citizens and to protect them it is also necessary to consider their subsistence provision for the public wants is an obvious inference from the general will and the third essential duty of government this duty is not we should feel to fill the granaries of individuals and thereby to grant them a dispensation from labour but to keep plenty so within their reach that labour is always necessary and never useless for its acquisition it extends also to everything regarding the management of the exchequer and the expenses of public administration having thus treated of general economy with reference to the government of persons we must now consider it with reference to the administration of property this part presents no fewer difficulties to solve and contradictions to remove than the preceding it is certain that the right of property is the most sacred of all the rights of citizenship and even more important in some respects than liberty itself either because it more nearly affects the preservation of life or because property being more easily usurped and more difficult to defend than life the law ought to pay a greater attention to what is most easily taken away or finally because property is the true foundation of civil society and the real guarantee of the undertakings of citizens for if property were not answerable for personal actions nothing would be easier than to evade duties and laugh at the laws on the other hand it is no less certain that the maintenance of the state and the government involves costs and outgoings and as every one who agrees to the end must acquiesce in the means it follows that the members of a society ought to contribute from their property to its support besides it is difficult to secure the property of individuals on one side without attacking it on another and it is impossible that all the regulations which govern the order of succession will contracts c should not lay individuals under some constraint as to the disposition of their goods and should not consequently restrict the right of property but besides what i have said above of the agreement     between the authority of law and the liberty of the citizen there remains to be made with respect to the disposition of goods an important observation which removes many difficulties as puffendorf has shown the right of property by its very nature does not extend beyond the life of the proprietor and the moment a man is dead his goods cease to belong to him thus to prescribe the conditions according to which he can dispose of them is in reality less to alter his right as it appears than to extend it in fact in general although the institution of the laws which regulate the power of individuals in the disposition of their own goods belongs only to the sovereign the spirit of these laws which the government ought to follow in their application is that from father to son and from relation to relation the goods of a family should go as little out of it and be as little alienated as possible there is a sensible reason for this in favour of children to whom the right of property would be quite useless if the father left them nothing and who besides having often contributed by their labour to the acquisition of their fathers wealth are in their own right associates with him in his right of property but another reason more distant though not less important is that nothing is more fatal to morality and to the republic than the continual shifting of rank and fortune among the citizens such changes are both the proof and the source of a thousand disorders and overturn and confound everything for those who were brought up to one thing find themselves destined for another and neither those who rise nor those who fall are able to assume the rules of conduct or to possess themselves of the qualifications requisite for their new condition still less to discharge the duties it entails i proceed to the object of public finance if the people governed itself and there were no intermediary between the administration of the state and the citizens they would have no more to do than to assess themselves occasionally in proportion to the public needs and the abilities of individuals and as they would all keep in sight the recovery and employment of such assessments no fraud or abuse could slip into the management of them the state would never be involved in debt or the people overburdened with taxes or at least the knowledge     of how the money would be used would be a consolation for the severity of the tax but things cannot be carried on in this manner on the contrary however small any state may be civil societies are always too populous to be under the immediate government of all their members it is necessary that the public money should go through the hands of the rulers all of whom have besides the interests of the state their own individual interests which are not the last to be listened to the people on its side perceiving rather the cupidity and ridiculous expenditure of its rulers than the public needs murmurs at seeing itself stripped of necessaries to furnish others with superfluities and when once these complaints have reached a certain degree of bitterness the most upright administration will find it impossible to restore confidence in such a case voluntary contributions bring in nothing and forced contributions are illegitimate this cruel alternative of letting the state perish or of violating the sacred right of property which is its support constitutes the great difficulty of just and prudent economy the first step which the founder of a republic ought to take after the establishment of laws is to settle a sufficient fund for the maintenance of the magistrates and other officials and for other public expenses this fund if it consist of money is called ærarium or fisc and public demesne if it consist of lands this for obvious reasons is much to be preferred whoever has reflected on this matter must be of the opinion of bodin who looks upon the public demesne as the most reputable and certain means of providing for the needs of the state it is remarkable also that romulus in his division of lands made it his first care to set apart a third for the use of the state i confess it is not impossible for the produce of the demesne if it be badly managed to be reduced to nothing but it is not of the essence of public demesnes to be badly administered before any use is made of this fund it should be assigned or accepted by an assembly of the people or of the estates of the country which should determine its future use after this solemnity which makes such funds inalienable their very nature is in a manner changed and the revenues become so sacred that it is not only the most infamous     theft but actual treason to misapply them or pervert them from the purpose for which they were destined it reflects great dishonour on rome that the integrity of cato the censor was something so very remarkable and that an emperor on rewarding the talents of a singer with a few crowns thought it necessary to observe that the money came from his own private purse and not from that of the state but if we find few galbas where are we to look for a cato for when vice is no longer dishonourable what chiefs will be so scrupulous as to abstain from touching the public revenues that are left to their discretion and even not in time to impose on themselves by pretending to confound their own expensive and scandalous dissipations with the glory of the state and the means of extending their own authority with the means of augmenting its power it is particularly in this delicate part of the administration that virtue is the only effective instrument and that the integrity of the magistrate is the only real check upon his avarice books and auditing of accounts instead of exposing frauds only conceal them for prudence is never so ready to conceive new precautions as knavery is to elude them never mind then about account books and papers place the management of finance in honest hands that is the only way to get it faithfully conducted when public funds are once established the rulers of the state become of right the administrators of them for this administration constitutes a part of government which is always essential though not always equally so its influence increases in proportion as that of other resources is diminished and it may justly be said that a government has reached the last stage of corruption when it has ceased to have sinews other than money now as every government constantly tends to become lax this is enough to show why no state can subsist unless its revenues constantly increase the first sense of the necessity of this increase is also the first sign of the internal disorder of the state and the prudent administrator in his endeavours to find means to provide for the present necessity will neglect nothing to find out the distant cause of the new need just as a mariner when he finds the water gaining on his     vessel does not neglect while he is working the pumps to discover and stop the leak from this rule is deduced the most important rule in the administration of finance which is to take more pains to guard against needs than to increase revenues for whatever diligence be employed the relief which only comes after and more slowly than the evil always leaves some injury behind while a remedy is being found for one evil another is beginning to make itself felt and even the remedies themselves produce new difficulties so that at length the nation is involved in debt and the people oppressed while the government loses its influence and can do very little with a great deal of money i imagine it was owing to the recognition of this rule that such wonders were done by ancient governments which did more with their parsimony than ours do with all their treasures and perhaps from this comes the common use of the word economy which means rather the prudent management of what one has than ways of getting what one has not but apart from the public demesne which is of service to the state in proportion to the uprightness of those who govern any one sufficiently acquainted with the whole force of the general administration especially when it confines itself to legitimate methods would be astonished at the resources the rulers can make use of for guarding against public needs without trespassing on the goods of individuals as they are masters of the whole commerce of the state nothing is easier for them than to direct it into such channels as to provide for every need without appearing to interfere the distribution of provisions money and merchandise in just proportions according to times and places is the true secret of finance and the source of wealth provided those who administer it have foresight enough to suffer a present apparent loss in order really to obtain immense profits in the future when we see a government paying bounties instead of receiving duties on the exportation of corn in time of plenty and on its importation in time of scarcity we must have such facts before our eyes if we are to be persuaded of their reality we should hold such facts to be idle tales if they had happened in ancient times let us suppose     that in order to prevent a scarcity in bad years a proposal were made to establish public granaries would not the maintenance of so useful an institution serve in most countries as an excuse for new taxes at geneva such granaries established and kept up by a prudent administration are a public resource in bad years and the principal revenue of the state at all times alit et ditat is the inscription which stands rightly and properly on the front of the building to set forth in this place the economic system of a good government i have often turned my eyes to that of this republic rejoicing to find in my own country an example of that wisdom and happiness which i should be glad to see prevail in every other if we ask how the needs of a state grow we shall find they generally arise like the wants of individuals less from any real necessity than from the increase of useless desires and that expenses are often augmented only to give a pretext for raising receipts so that the state would sometimes gain by not being rich and apparent wealth is in reality more burdensome than poverty itself would be rulers may indeed hope to keep the peoples in stricter dependence by thus giving them with one hand what they take from them with the other and this was in fact the policy of joseph towards the egyptians but this political sophistry is the more fatal to the state as the money never returns into the hands it went out of such principles only enrich the idle at the expense of the industrious a desire for conquest is one of the most evident and dangerous causes of this increase this desire occasioned often by a different species of ambition from that which it seems to proclaim is not always what it appears to be and has not so much for its real motive the apparent desire to aggrandise the nation as a secret desire to increase the authority of the rulers at home by increasing the number of troops and by the diversion which the objects of war occasion in the minds of the citizens it is at least certain that no peoples are so oppressed and wretched as conquering nations and that their successes only increase their misery did not history inform us of the fact reason would suffice to tell us that the     greater a state grows the heavier and more burdensome in proportion its expenses become for every province has to furnish its share to the general expense of government and besides has to be at the expense of its own administration which is as great as if it were really independent add to this that great fortunes are always acquired in one place and spent in another production therefore soon ceases to balance consumption and a whole country is impoverished merely to enrich a single town another source of the increase of public wants which depends on the foregoing is this there may come a time when the citizens no longer looking upon themselves as interested in the common cause will cease to be the defenders of their country and the magistrates will prefer the command of mercenaries to that of freemen if for no other reason than that when the time comes they may use them to reduce freemen to submission such was the state of rome towards the end of the republic and under the emperors for all the victories of the early romans like those of alexander had been won by brave citizens who were ready at need to give their blood in the service of their country but would never sell it only at the siege of veii did the practice of paying the roman infantry begin marius in the jugurthine war dishonoured the legions by introducing freedmen vagabonds and other mercenaries tyrants the enemies of the very people it was their duty to make happy maintained regular troops apparently to withstand the foreigner but really to enslave their countrymen to form such troops it was necessary to take men from the land the lack of their labour then diminished the amount of provisions and their maintenance introduced those taxes which increased prices this first disorder gave rise to murmurs among the people in order to suppress them the number of troops had to be increased and consequently the misery of the people also got worse and the growing despair led to still further increases in the cause in order to guard against its effects on the other hand the mercenaries whose merit we may judge of by the price at which they sold themselves proud of their own meanness and despising the laws that protected them as well as their fellows whose bread they ate imagined themselves more honoured     in being cæsars satellites than in being defenders of rome as they were given over to blind obedience their swords were always at the throats of their fellowcitizens and they were prepared for general butchery at the first sign it would not be difficult to show that this was one of the principal causes of the ruin of the roman empire the invention of artillery and fortifications has forced the princes of europe in modern times to return to the use of regular troops in order to garrison their towns but however lawful their motives it is to be feared the effect may be no less fatal there is no better reason now than formerly for depopulating the country to form armies and garrisons nor should the people be oppressed to support them in a word these dangerous establishments have increased of late years with such rapidity in this part of the world that they evidently threaten to depopulate europe and sooner or later to ruin its inhabitants be this as it may it ought to be seen that such institutions necessarily subvert the true economic system which draws the principal revenue of the state from the public demesne and leave only the troublesome resource of subsidies and imposts with which it remains to deal it should be remembered that the foundation of the social compact is property and its first condition that every one should be maintained in the peaceful possession of what belongs to him it is true that by the same treaty every one binds himself at least tacitly to be assessed toward the public wants but as this undertaking cannot prejudice the fundamental law and presupposes that the need is clearly recognised by all who contribute to it it is plain that such assessment in order to be lawful must be voluntary it must depend not indeed on a particular will as if it were necessary to have the consent of each individual and that he should give no more than just what he pleased but on a general will decided by vote of a majority and on the basis of a proportional rating which leaves nothing arbitrary in the imposition of the tax that taxes cannot be legitimately established except by the consent of the people or its representatives is a truth generally admitted by all philosophers and jurists of any repute on questions of public right not even excepting bodin if any of them have laid down rules which     seem to contradict this their particular motives for doing so may easily be seen and they introduce so many conditions and restrictions that the argument comes at bottom to the same thing for whether the people has it in its power to refuse or the sovereign ought not to exact is a matter of indifference with regard to right and if the point in question concerns only power it is useless to inquire whether it is legitimate or not contributions levied on the people are two kinds real levied on commodities and personal paid by the head both are called taxes or subsidies when the people fixes the sum to be paid it is called subsidy but when it grants the product of an imposition it is called a tax we are told in the spirit of the laws that a capitation tax is most suited to slavery and a real tax most in accordance with liberty this would be incontestable if the circumstances of every person were equal for otherwise nothing can be more disproportionate than such a tax and it is in the observations of exact proportions that the spirit of liberty consists but if a tax by heads were exactly proportioned to the circumstances of individuals as what is called the capitation tax in france might be is would be the most equitable and consequently the most proper for freemen these proportions appear at first very easy to note because being relative to each mans position in the world their incidence is always public but proper regard is seldom paid to all the elements that should enter into such a calculation even apart from deception arising from avarice fraud and selfinterest in the first place we have to consider the relation of quantities according to which ceteris paribus the person who has ten times the property of another man ought to pay ten times as much to the state secondly the relation of the use made that is to say the distinction between necessaries and superfluities he who possesses only the common necessaries of life should pay nothing at all while the tax on him who is in possession of superfluities may justly be extended to everything he has over and above mere necessaries to this he will possibly object that when his rank is taken into account what may be superfluous to a man of inferior station is necessary for him but this is false for a grandee has two legs just like a cowherd and like him   0 again but one belly besides these pretended necessaries are really so little necessary to his rank that if he should renounce them on any worthy occasion he would only be the more honoured the populace would be ready to adore a minister who went to council on foot because he had sold off his carriages to supply a pressing need of the state lastly to no man does the law prescribe magnificence and propriety is no argument against right a third relation which is never taken into account though it ought to be the chief consideration is the advantage that every person derives from the social confederacy for this provides a powerful protection for the immense possessions of the rich and hardly leaves the poor man in quiet possession of the cottage he builds with his own hands are not all the advantages of society for the rich and powerful are not all lucrative posts in their hands are not all privileges and exemptions reserved for them alone is not the public authority always on their side if a man of eminence robs his creditors or is guilty of other knaveries is he not always assured of impunity are not the assaults acts of violence assassinations and even murders committed by the great matters that are hushed up in a few months and of which nothing more is thought but if a great man himself is robbed or insulted the whole police force is immediately in motion and woe even to innocent persons who chance to be suspected if he has to pass through any dangerous road the country is up in arms to escort him if the axletree of his chaise breaks everybody flies to his assistance if there is a noise at his door he speaks but a word and all is silent if he is incommoded by the crowd he waves his hand and every one makes way if his coach is met on the road by a wagon his servants are ready to beat the drivers brains out and fifty honest pedestrians going quietly about their business had better be knocked on the head than an idle jackanapes be delayed in his coach yet all this respect costs him not a farthing it is the rich mans right and not what he buys with his wealth how different is the case of the poor man the more humanity owes him the more society denies him every door is shut against him even when he has a right to its being opened and if ever he obtains justice it is with much greater difficulty     than others obtain favours if the militia is to be raised or the highway to be mended he is always given the preference he always bears the burden which his richer neighbour has influence enough to get exempted from on the least accident that happens to him everybody avoids him if his cart be overturned in the road so far is he from receiving any assistance that he is lucky if he does not get horsewhipped by the impudent lackeys of some young duke in a word all gratuitous assistance is denied to the poor when they need it just because they cannot pay for it i look upon any poor man as totally undone if he has the misfortune to have an honest heart a fine daughter and a powerful neighbour another no less important fact is that the losses of the poor are much harder to repair than those of the rich and that the difficulty of acquisition is always greater in proportion as there is more need for it nothing comes out of nothing is as true of life as in physics money is the seed of money and the first guinea is sometimes more difficult to acquire than the second million add to this that what the poor pay is lost to them for ever and remains in or returns to the hands of the rich and as to those who share in the government or to their dependents the whole produce of the taxes must sooner or later pass although they pay their share these persons have always a sensible interest in increasing them the terms of the social compact between these two estates of men may be summed up in a few words you have need of me because i am rich and you are poor we will therefore come to an agreement i will permit you to have the honour of serving me on condition that you bestow on me the little you have left in return for the pains i shall take to command you putting all these considerations carefully together we shall find that in order to levy taxes in a truly equitable and proportionate manner the imposition ought not to be in simple ratio to the property of the contributors but in compound ratio to the difference of their conditions and the superfluity of their possessions this very important and difficult operation is daily made by numbers of honest clerks who know their arithmetic but a plato or a montesquieu would not venture to undertake it without     the greatest diffidence or without praying to heaven for understanding and integrity another disadvantage of personal taxes is that they may be too much felt or raised with too great severity this however does not prevent them from being frequently evaded for it is much easier for persons to escape a tax than for their possessions of all impositions that on land or real taxation has always been regarded as most advantageous in countries where more attention is paid to what the tax will produce and to the certainty of recovering the product than to securing the least discomfort for the people it has been even maintained that it is necessary to burden the peasant in order to rouse him from indolence and that he would never work if he had no taxes to pay but in all countries experience confutes this ridiculous notion in england and holland the farmer pays very little and in china nothing yet these are the countries in which the land is best cultivated on the other hand in those countries where the husbandman is taxed in proportion to the produce of his lands he leaves them uncultivated or reaps just as much from them as suffices for bare subsistence for to him who loses the fruit of his labour it is some gain to do nothing to lay a tax on industry is a very singular expedient for banishing idleness taxes on land or corn especially when they are excessive lead to two results so fatal in their effect that they cannot but depopulate and ruin in the long run all countries in which they are established the first of these arises from the defective circulation of specie for industry and commerce draw all the money from the country into the capitals and as the tax destroys the proportion there might otherwise be between the needs of the husbandman and the price of his corn money is always leaving and never returning thus the richer the city the poorer the country the product of the taxes passes from the hands of the prince or his financial officers into those of artists and traders and the husbandman who receives only the smallest part of it is at length exhausted by paying always the same and receiving constantly less how could a human body subsist if it had veins and no arteries or if its arteries     conveyed the blood only within four inches of the heart chardin tells us that in persia the royal dues on commodities are paid in kind this custom which herodotus informs us prevailed long ago in the same country down to the time of darius might prevent the evil of which i have been speaking but unless intendants directors commissioners and warehousemen in persia are a different kind of people from what they are elsewhere i can hardly believe that the smallest part of this produce ever reaches the king or that the corn is not spoilt in every granary and the greater part of the warehouses not consumed by fire the second evil effect arises from an apparent advantage which aggravates the evil before it can be perceived that is that corn is a commodity whose price is not enhanced by taxes in the country producing it and which in spite of its absolute necessity may be diminished in quantity without the price being increased hence many people die of hunger although corn remains cheap and the husbandman bears the whole charge of a tax for which he cannot indemnify himself by the price of his corn it must be observed that we ought not to reason about a landtax in the same manner as about duties laid on various kinds of merchandise for the effect of such duties is to raise the price and they are paid by the buyers rather than the sellers for these duties however heavy are still voluntary and are paid by the merchant only in proportion to the quantity he buys and as he buys only in proportion to his sale he himself gives the law its particular application but the farmer who is obliged to pay his rent at stated times whether he sells or not cannot wait till he can get his own price for his commodity even if he is not forced to sell for mere subsistence he must sell to pay the taxes so that it is frequently the heaviness of the tax that keeps the price of corn low it is further to be noticed that the resources of commerce and industry are so far from rendering the tax more supportable through abundance of money that they only render it more burdensome i shall not insist on what is very evident i e that although a greater or less quantity of money in a state may give it the greater or less credit in the eye of the foreigner it makes not the least difference     to the real fortune of the citizens and does not make their condition any more or less comfortable but i must make these two important remarks first unless a state possesses superfluous commodities and abundance of money results from foreign trade only trading cities are sensible of the abundance while the peasant only becomes relatively poorer secondly as the price of everything is enhanced by the increase of money taxes also must be proportionately increased so that the farmer will find himself still more burdened without having more resources it ought to be observed that the tax on land is a real duty on the produce it is universally agreed however that nothing is so dangerous as a tax on corn paid by the purchaser but how comes it we do not see that it is a hundred times worse when the duty is paid by the cultivator himself is not this an attack on the substance of the state at its very source is it not the directest possible method of depopulating a country and therefore in the end ruining it for the worst kind of scarcity a nation can suffer from is lack of inhabitants only the real statesman can rise in imposing taxes above the mere financial object he alone can transform heavy burdens into useful regulations and make the people even doubtful whether such establishments were not calculated rather for the good of the nation in general than merely for the raising of money duties on the importation of foreign commodities of which the natives are fond without the country standing in need of them on the exportation of those of the growth of the country which are not too plentiful and which foreigners cannot do without on the productions of frivolous and all too lucrative arts on the importation of all pure luxuries and in general on all objects of luxury will answer the twofold end in view it is by such taxes indeed by which the poor are eased and the burdens thrown on the rich that it is possible to prevent the continual increase of inequality of fortune the subjection of such a multitude of artisans and useless servants to the rich the multiplication of idle persons in our cities and the depopulation of the countryside it is important that the value of any commodity and the     duties laid on it should be so proportioned that the avarice of individuals may not be too strongly tempted to fraud by the greatness of the possible profit to make smuggling difficult those commodities should be singled out which are hardest to conceal all duties should be rather paid by the consumer of the commodity taxed than by him who sells it as the quantity of duty he would be obliged to pay would lay him open to greater temptations and afford him more opportunities for fraud this is the constant custom in china a country where the taxes are greater and yet better paid than in any other part of the world the merchant himself there pays no duty the buyer alone without murmuring or sedition meets the whole charge for as the necessaries of life such as rice and corn are absolutely exempt from taxation the common people is not oppressed and the duty falls only on those who are welltodo precautions against smuggling ought not to be dictated so much by the fear of it occurring as by the attention which the government should pay to securing individuals from being seduced by illegitimate profits which first make them bad citizens and afterwards soon turn them into dishonest men heavy taxes should be laid on servants in livery on equipages rich furniture fine clothes on spacious courts and gardens on public entertainments of all kinds on useless professions such as dancers singers players and in a word on all that multiplicity of objects of luxury amusement and idleness which strike the eyes of all and can the less be hidden as their whole purpose is to be seen without which they would be useless we need be under no apprehension of the produce of these taxes being arbitrary because they are laid on things not absolutely necessary they must know but little of mankind who imagine that after they have been once seduced by luxury they can ever renounce it they would a hundred times sooner renounce common necessaries and had much rather die of hunger than of shame the increase in their expense is only an additional reason for supporting them when the vanity of appearing wealthy reaps its profit from the price of the thing and the charge of the tax as long as there are rich people in the world they will be desirous of distinguishing themselves from the poor nor can the     state devise a revenue less burdensome or more certain than what arises from this distinction for the same reason industry would have nothing to suffer from an economic system which increased the revenue encouraged agriculture by relieving the husbandman and insensibly tended to bring all fortunes nearer to that middle condition which constitutes the genuine strength of the state these taxes might i admit bring certain fashionable articles of dress and amusement to an untimely end but it would be only to substitute others by which the artificer would gain and the exchequer suffer no loss in a word suppose the spirit of government was constantly to tax only the superfluities of the rich one of two things must happen either the rich would convert their superfluous expenses into useful ones which would redound to the profit of the state and thus the imposition of taxes would have the effect of the best sumptuary laws the expenses of the state would necessarily diminish with those of individuals and the treasury would not receive so much less as it would gain by having less to pay or if the rich did not become less extravagant the exchequer would have such resources in the product of taxes on their expenditure as would provide for the needs of the state in the first case the treasury would be the richer by what it would save from having the less to do with its money and in the second it would be enriched by the useless expenses of individuals we may add to all this a very important distinction in matters of political right to which governments constantly tenacious of doing everything for themselves ought to pay great attention it has been observed that personal taxes and duties on the necessaries of life as they directly trespass on the right of property and consequently on the true foundation of political society are always liable to have dangerous results if they are not established with the express consent of the people or its representatives it is not the same with articles the use of which we can deny ourselves for as the individual is under no absolute necessity to pay his contribution may count as voluntary the particular consent of each contributor then takes the place of the general consent of the whole people for why should a people oppose the imposition     of a tax which falls only on those who desire to pay it it appears to me certain that everything which is not proscribed by law or contrary to morality and yet may be prohibited by the government may also be permitted on payment of a certain duty thus for example if the government may prohibit the use of coaches it may certainly impose a tax on them and this is a prudent and useful method of censuring their use without absolutely forbidding it in this case the tax may be regarded as a sort of fine the product of which compensates for the abuse it punishes it may perhaps be objected that those whom bodin calls impostors i e those who impose or contrive the taxes being in the class of the rich will be far from sparing themselves to relieve the poor but this is quite beside the point if in every nation those to whom the sovereign commits the government of the people were from their position its enemies it would not be worth while to inquire what they ought to do to make the people happy     printed by the temple press at letchworth in great britain   the term general will means in rousseau not so much will held by several persons as will having a general universal object this is often misunderstood but the mistake matters the less because the general will must in fact be both   learned inquiries into public right are often only the history of past abuses and troubling to study them too deeply is a profitless infatuation essay on the interests of france in relation to its neighbours by the marquis dargenson this is exactly what grotius has done   see a short treatise of plutarchs entitled that animals reason   the romans who understood and respected the right of war more than any other nation on earth carried their scruples on this head so far that a citizen was not allowed to serve as a volunteer without engaging himself expressly against the enemy and against such and such an enemy by name a legion in which the younger cato was seeing his first service under popilius having been reconstructed the elder cato wrote to popilius that if he wished his son to continue serving under him he must administer to him a new military oath because the first having been annulled he was no longer able to bear arms against the enemy the same cato wrote to his son telling him to take great care not to go into battle before taking this new oath i know that the siege of clusium and other isolated events can be quoted against me but i am citing laws and customs the romans are the people that least often transgressed its laws and no other people has had such good ones   the real meaning of this word has been almost wholly lost in modern times most people mistake a town for a city and a townsman for a citizen they do not know that houses make a town but citizens a city the same mistake long ago cost the carthaginians dear i have never read of the title of citizens being given to the subjects of any prince not even the ancient macedonians or the english of today though they are nearer liberty than any one else the french alone everywhere familiarly adopt the name of citizens because as can be seen from their dictionaries they have no idea of its meaning otherwise they would be guilty in usurping it of the crime of lèsemajesté among them the name expresses a virtue and not a right when bodin spoke of our citizens and townsmen he fell into a bad blunder in taking the one class for the other m dalembert has avoided the error and in his article on geneva has clearly distinguished the four orders of men or even five counting mere foreigners who dwell in our town of which two only compose the republic no other french writer to my knowledge has understood the real meaning of the word citizen   under bad governments this equality is only apparent and illusory it serves only to keep the pauper in his poverty and the rich man in the position he has usurped in fact laws are always of use to those who possess and harmful to those who have nothing from which it follows that the social state is advantageous to men only when all have something and none too much   to be general a will need not always be unanimous but every vote must be counted any exclusion is a breach of generality   every interest says the marquis dargenson has different principles the agreement of two particular interests is formed by opposition to a third he might have added that the agreement of all interests is formed by opposition to that of each if there were no different interests the common interest would be barely felt as it would encounter no obstacle all would go on of its own accord and politics would cease to be an art   in fact says macchiavelli there are some divisions that are harmful to a republic and some that are advantageous those which stir up sects and parties are harmful those attended by neither are advantageous since then the founder of a republic cannot help enmities arising he ought at least to prevent them from growing into sects history of

language but wait and see   i understand by this word not merely an aristocracy or a democracy but generally any government directed by the general will which is the law to be legitimate the government must be not one with the sovereign but its minister in such a case even a monarchy is a republic this will be made clearer in the following book   a people becomes famous only when its

blessed   in truth says macchiavelli there has never been in any country an extraordinary legislator who has not had recourse to god for otherwise his laws would not have been accepted there are in fact many useful truths of which a wise man may have knowledge without their having in themselves such clear reasons for their being so as to be able to convince others discourses on livy bk v ch xi rousseau quotes the italian   if there were two neighbouring peoples one of which could not do without the other it would be very hard on the former and very dangerous for the latter every wise nation in such a case would make haste to free the other from dependence the republic of thlascala enclosed by the mexican empire preferred doing without salt to buying from the mexicans or even getting it from them as a gift the thlascalans were wise enough to see the snare hidden under such liberality they kept their freedom and that little state shut up in that great empire was finally the instrument of its ruin   if the object is to give the state consistency bring the two extremes as near to each other as possible allow neither rich men nor beggars these two estates which are naturally inseparable are equally fatal to the common good from the one come the friends of tyranny and from the other tyrants it is always between them that public liberty is put up to auction the one buys and the other sells   any branch of foreign commerce says m dargenson creates on the whole only apparent advantage for the kingdom in general it may enrich some individuals or even some towns but the

importance that the form of the election of magistrates should be regulated by law for if it is left at the discretion of the prince it is impossible to avoid falling into hereditary aristocracy as

countrys oppression the choice of his detestable hero cæsar borgia clearly enough shows his hidden aim and the contradiction between the teaching of the prince and that of the discourses on livy and the history of florence shows that this profound political thinker has so far been studied only by superficial or corrupt readers the court of rome sternly prohibited his book i can well believe it for it is that court it most clearly portrays   tacitus histories i    for the best and also the shortest way of finding out what is good and what is bad is to consider what you would have wished to

dealing with the authority of the government over the members while here we are dealing with its force against the subjects its scattered members serve it as rallyingpoints for action against the people at a distance but it has no rallyingpoint for direct action on its members themselves thus the length of the lever is its weakness in the one case and its strength in the other   on the same principle it should be judged what centuries deserve the preference for human prosperity those in which letters and arts have flourished have been too much admired because the hidden object of their culture has not been fathomed and their fatal effects not taken into account idque apud imperitos humanitas vocabatur cum pars servitutis esset fools called humanity what was a part of slavery tacitus

rulers than to the wellbeing of their nations as wholes and above all of the most numerous states a hailstorm lays several cantons waste but it rarely makes a famine outbreaks and civil wars give rulers rude shocks but they are not the real ills of peoples who may even get a respite while there is a dispute as to who shall tyrannise over them their true prosperity and calamities come from

things did not prevent the people of france from prospering and multiplying in dignity ease and freedom long ago greece flourished in the midst of the most savage wars blood ran in torrents and yet the whole country was covered with inhabitants it appeared says macchiavelli that in the midst of murder proscription and civil war our republic only throve the virtue morality and independence of the citizens did more to strengthen it than all their dissensions had done to enfeeble it a little disturbance gives the soul elasticity what makes the race truly prosperous is not so much peace as liberty   the slow formation and the progress of the republic of venice in its lagoons are a notable instance of this sequence and it is most astonishing that after more than twelve hundred years existence the venetians seem to be still at the second stage which they reached with the serrar di consiglio in      as for the ancient dukes who are brought up against them it is proved whatever the squittinio della libertà veneta may say of them that they were in no sense sovereigns a case certain to be cited against my view is that of the roman republic which it will be said followed exactly the opposite course and passed from monarchy to aristocracy and from aristocracy to democracy i by no means take this view of it what romulus first set up was a mixed government which soon deteriorated into despotism from special causes the state died an untimely death as newborn children sometimes perish without reaching manhood the expulsion of the tarquins was the real period of the birth of the republic but at first it took on no constant form because by not abolishing the patriciate it left half its work undone for by this means hereditary aristocracy the worst of all legitimate forms of administration remained in conflict with democracy and the form of the government as macchiavelli has proved was only fixed on the establishment of the tribunate only then was there a true government and a veritable democracy in fact the people was then not only sovereign but also magistrate and judge the senate was only a subordinate tribunal to temper and concentrate the government and the consuls themselves though they were patricians first magistrates and absolute generals in war were in rome itself no more than presidents of the people from that point the government followed its natural tendency and inclined strongly to aristocracy the patriciate we may say abolished itself and the aristocracy was found no longer in the body of patricians as at venice and genoa but in the body of the senate which was composed of patricians and plebeians and even in the body of tribunes when they began to usurp an active function for names do not affect facts and when the people has rulers who govern for it whatever name they bear the government is an aristocracy the abuse of aristocracy led to the civil wars and the triumvirate sulla julius cæsar and augustus became in fact real monarchs and finally under the despotism of tiberius the state was dissolved roman history then confirms instead of invalidating the principle i have laid down   omnes enim et habentur et dicuntur tyranni qui potestate utuntur perpetua in ea civitate quæ libertate usa est cornelius nepos life of miltiades for all those are called and considered tyrants who hold perpetual power in a state that has known liberty it is true that aristotle nicomachean ethics book viii chapter x distinguishes the tyrant from the king by the fact that the former governs in his own interest and the latter only for the good of his subjects but not only did all greek authors in general use the word tyrant in a different sense as appears most clearly in xenophons hiero but also it would follow from aristotles distinction that from the very beginning of the world there has not yet been a single king   in nearly the same sense as this word has in the english parliament the similarity of these functions would have brought the consuls and the tribunes into conflict even had all jurisdiction been suspended   to adopt in cold countries the luxury and effeminacy of the east is to desire to submit to its chains it is indeed to bow to them far more inevitably in our case than in theirs   i had intended to do this in the sequel to this work when in dealing with external relations i came to the subject of confederations the subject is quite new and its principles have still to be laid down   provided of course he does not leave to escape his obligations and avoid having to serve his country in the hour of need flight in such a case would be criminal and punishable and would be not withdrawal but desertion   this should of course be understood as applying to a free state for elsewhere family goods lack of a refuge necessity or violence may detain a man in a country against his will and then his dwelling there no longer by itself implies his consent to the contract or to its violation   at genoa the word liberty may be read over the front of the prisons and on the chains of the galleyslaves this application of the device is good and just it is indeed only malefactors of all estates who prevent the citizen from being free in the country in which all such men were in the galleys the most perfect liberty would be enjoyed   i say in the campus martius because it was there that the comitia assembled by centuries in its two other forms the people assembled in the forum or elsewhere and then the capite censi had as much influence and authority as the foremost citizens   custodes diribitores rogatores suffragiorum   the nomination was made secretly by night as if there were something shameful in setting a man above the laws   that is what he could not be sure of if he proposed a dictator for he dared not nominate himself and could not be certain that his colleague would nominate him   i merely call attention in this chapter to a subject with which i have dealt at greater length in my letter to m dalembert   they were from another island which the delicacy of our language forbids me to name on this occasion   nonne ea quæ possidet chamos deus tuus tibi jure debentur judges xi    such is the text in the vulgate father de carrières translates do you not regard yourselves as having a right to what your god possesses i do not know the force of the hebrew text but i perceive that in the vulgate jephthah positively recognises the right of the god chamos and that the french translator weakened this admission by inserting an according to you which is not in the latin   it is quite clear that the phocian war which was called the sacred war was not a war of religion its object was the punishment of acts of sacrilege and not the conquest of unbelievers   it should be noted that the clergy find their bond of union not so much in formal assemblies as in the communion of churches communion and excommunication are the social compact of the clergy a compact which will always make them masters of peoples and kings all priests who communicate together are fellowcitizens even if they come from opposite ends of the earth this invention is a masterpiece of statesmanship there is nothing like it among pagan priests who have therefore never formed a clerical corporate body   see for instance in a letter from grotius to his brother april         what that learned man found to praise and to blame in the de cive it is true that with a bent for indulgence he seems to pardon the writer the good for the sake of the bad but all men are not so forgiving   in the republic says the marquis dargenson each man is perfectly free in what does not harm others this is the invariable limitation which it is impossible to define more exactly i have not been able to deny myself the pleasure of occasionally quoting from this manuscript though it is unknown to the public in order to do honour to the memory of a good and illustrious man who had kept even in the ministry the heart of a good citizen and views on the government of his country that were sane and right   cæsar pleading for catiline tried to establish the dogma that the soul is mortal cato and cicero in refutation did not waste time in philosophising they were content to show that cæsar spoke like a bad citizen and brought forward a doctrine that would have a bad effect on the state this in fact and not a problem of theology was what the roman senate had to judge   marriage for instance being a civil contract has civil effects without which society cannot even subsist suppose a body of clergy should claim the sole right of permitting this act a right which every intolerant religion must of necessity claim is it not clear that in establishing the authority of the church in this respect it will be destroying that of the prince who will have thenceforth only as many subjects as the clergy choose to allow him being in a position to marry or not to marry people according to their acceptance of such and such a doctrine their admission or rejection of such and such a formula their greater or less piety the church alone by the exercise of prudence and firmness will dispose of all inheritances offices and citizens and even of the state itself which could not subsist if it were composed entirely of bastards but i shall be told there will be appeals on the ground of abuse summonses and decrees the temporalities will be seized how sad the clergy however little i will not say courage but sense it has will take no notice and go its way it will quietly allow appeals summonses decrees and seizures and in the end will remain the master it is not i think a great sacrifice to give up a part when one is sure of securing all   here i am a barbarian because men understand me not   sovereigns always see with pleasure a taste for the arts of amusement and superfluity which do not result in the exportation of bullion increase among their subjects they very well know that besides nourishing that littleness of mind which is proper to slavery the increase of artificial wants only binds so many more chains upon the people alexander wishing to keep the ichthyophages in a state of dependence compelled them to give up fishing and subsist on the customary food of civilised nations the american savages who go naked and live entirely on the products of the chase have been always impossible to subdue what yoke indeed can be imposed on men who stand in need of nothing   i love said montaigne to converse and hold an argument but only with very few people and that for my own gratification for to do so by way of affording amusement for the great or of making a parade of ones talents is in my opinion a trade very illbecoming a man of honour it is the trade of all our intellectuals save one   i dare not speak of those happy nations who did not even know the name of many vices which we find it difficult to suppress the savages of america whose simple and natural mode of government montaigne preferred without hesitation not only to the laws of plato but to the most perfect visions of government philosophy can ever suggest he cites many examples striking for those who are capable of appreciating them but what of all that says he they cant run to a pair of breeches   what are we to think was the real opinion of the athenians themselves about eloquence when they were so very careful to banish declamation from that upright tribunal against whose decision even their gods made no appeal what did the romans think of physicians when they expelled medicine from the republic and when the relics of humanity left among the spaniards induced them to forbid their lawyers to set foot in america what must they have thought of jurisprudence may it not be said that they thought by this single expedient to make reparation for all the outrages they had committed against the unhappy indians   it is easy to see the allegory in the fable of prometheus and it does not appear that the greeks who chained him to the caucasus had a better opinion of him than the egyptians had of their god theutus the satyr says an ancient fable the first time he saw a fire was going to kiss and embrace it but prometheus cried out to him to forbear or his beard would rue it it burns says he everything that touches it   the less we know the more we think we know the peripatetics doubted of nothing did not descartes construct the universe with cubes and vortices and is there in all europe one single physicist who does not boldly explain the inexplicable mysteries of electricity which will perhaps be for ever the despair of real philosophers   i am far from thinking that the ascendancy which women have obtained over men is an evil in itself it is a present which nature has made them for the good of mankind if better directed it might be productive of as much good as it is now of evil we are not sufficiently sensible of what advantage it would be to society to give a better education to that half of our species which governs the other men will always be what women choose to make them if you wish then that they should be noble and virtuous let women be taught what greatness of soul and virtue are the reflections which this subject arouses and which plato formerly made deserve to be more fully developed by a pen worthy of following so great a master and defending so great a cause   pensées philosophiques diderot   such was the education of the spartans with regard to one of the greatest of their kings it is well worthy of notice says montaigne that the excellent institutions of lycurgus which were in truth miraculously perfect paid as much attention to the bringing up of youth as if this were their principal object and yet at the very seat of the muses they make so little mention of learning that it seems as if their generousspirited youth disdained every other restraint and required instead of masters of the sciences instructors in valour prudence and justice alone let us hear next what the same writer says of the ancient persians plato says he relates that the heir to the throne was thus brought up at his birth he was committed not to the care of women but to eunuchs in the highest authority and near the person of the king on account of their virtue these undertook to render his body beautiful and healthy at seven years of age they taught him to ride and go hunting at fourteen he was placed in the hands of four the wisest the most just the most temperate and the bravest persons in the kingdom the first instructed him in religion the second taught him to adhere inviolably to truth the third to conquer his passions and the fourth to be afraid of nothing all i may add taught him to be a good man but not one taught him to be learned astyages in xenophon desires cyrus to give him an account of his last lesson it was this answered cyrus one of the big boys of the school having a small coat gave it to a little boy and took away from him his coat which was larger our master having appointed me arbiter in the dispute i ordered that matters should stand as they were as each boy seemed to be better suited than before the master however remonstrated with me saying that i considered only convenience whereas justice ought to have been the first concern and justice teaches that no one should suffer forcible interference with what belongs to him he added that he was punished for his wrong decision just as boys are punished in our country schools when they forget the first aorist of τύπτω my tutor must make me a fine harangue in genere demonstrativo before he will persuade me that his school is as good as this   if we consider the frightful disorders which printing has already caused in europe and judge of the future by the progress of its evils from day to day it is easy to foresee that sovereigns will hereafter take as much pains to banish this dreadful art from their dominions as they ever took to encourage it the sultan achmet yielding to the importunities of certain pretenders to taste consented to have a press erected at constantinople but it was hardly set to work before they were obliged to destroy it and throw the plant into a well it is related that the caliph omar being asked what should be done with the library at alexandria answered in these words if the books in the library contain anything contrary to the alcoran they are evil and ought to be burnt if they contain only what the alcoran teaches they are superfluous this reasoning has been cited by our men of letters as the height of absurdity but if gregory the great had been in the place of omar and the gospel in the place of the alcoran the library would still have been burnt and it would have been perhaps the finest action of his life   see appendix p       justin hist ii   so much more does the ignorance of vice profit the one sort than the knowledge of virtue the other   egoism must not be confused with selfrespect for they differ both in themselves and in their effects selfrespect is a natural feeling which leads every animal to look to its own preservation and which guided in man by reason and modified by compassion creates humanity and virtue egoism is a purely relative and factitious feeling which arises in the state of society leads each individual to make more of himself than of any other causes all the mutual damage men inflict one on another and is the real source of the sense of honour this being understood i maintain that in our primitive condition in the true state of nature egoism did not exist for as each man regarded himself as the only observer of his actions the only being in the universe who took any interest in him and the sole judge of his deserts no feeling arising from comparisons he could not be led to make could take root in his soul and for the same reason he could know neither hatred nor the desire for revenge since these passions can spring only from a sense of injury and as it is the contempt or the intention to hurt and not the harm done which constitutes the injury men who neither valued nor compared themselves could do one another much violence when it suited them without feeling any sense of injury in a word each man regarding his fellows almost as he regarded animals of different species might seize the prey of a weaker or yield up his own to a stronger and yet consider these acts of violence as mere natural occurrences without the slightest emotion of insolence or despite or any other feeling than the joy or grief of success or failure   nature avows she gave the human race the softest hearts who gave them tears   ovid metamorphoses xi       both rich and poor shocked at their

the monarchy of spain        distributive justice would oppose this rigorous equality of the state of nature even were it practicable in civil society as all the members of the state owe it their services in proportion to their talents and abilities they ought on their side to be distinguished and favoured in proportion to the services they have actually rendered it is in this sense we must understand that passage of isocrates in which he extols the primitive athenians for having determined which of the two kinds of equality was the most useful viz that which consists in dividing the same advantages indiscriminately among all the citizens or that which consists in distributing them to each according to his deserts these able politicians adds the orator banishing that unjust inequality which makes no distinction between good and bad men adhered inviolably to that which rewards and punishes every man according to his deserts but in the first place there never existed a society however corrupt some may have become where no difference was made between the good and the bad and with regard to morality where no measures can be prescribed by law exact enough to serve as a practical rule for a magistrate it is with great prudence that in order not to leave the fortune or quality of the citizens to his discretion it prohibits him from passing judgment on persons and confines his judgment to actions only morals such as those of the ancient romans can bear censors and such a tribunal among us would throw everything into confusion the difference between good and bad men is determined by public esteem the magistrate being strictly a judge of right alone whereas the public is the truest judge of morals and is of such integrity and penetration on this head that although it may be sometimes deceived it can never be corrupted the rank of citizens ought therefore to be regulated not according to their personal merit—for this would put it in the power of the magistrate to apply the law almost arbirarily—but according to the actual services done to the state which are capable of being more exactly estimated   see p
