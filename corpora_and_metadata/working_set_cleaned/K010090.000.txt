read heaped an account of the medicinal virtues of magnesia alba etc about two years since i published a small volume of experiments and observations on various subjects which also contained some account of the diseases in which magnesia alba is particularly useful and a recommendation of that medicine in a state of calcination as preferable in many instances to the uncalcined magnesia but as the remarks on this subject are intermixed with a number of others which are only interesting to medical or philosophical readers i have been frequently requested to draw up a plain detail of the history and medicinal uses of magnesia for the use of those persons who may be purchasers of the medicine and to whom the other part of my former publication would be entirely useless  previous therefore to the recital of the virtues of magnesia it may not be improper to give a short history of the invention of this medicine and of the gradual progress by which it has arrived at the degree of estimation in which it now stands  to those mineral bodies which contain metallic earths the earlier chemists gave the name of marcasites and those earths which were capable of attracting the acid from the atmosphere and thereby forming salts were termed magnesia the first preparers of magnesia alba who procured it from the motherley of nitre or liquor remaining after the crystallization of that salt imagining it to be the proper absorbent of the nitrous acid are supposed to have given it the name of magnesia and the epithet alba appears to have been added as a distinction on account of its superior whiteness  magnesia alba was first introduced by the jesuits at rome and the preparation of it was concealed by them for some time as a nostrum but the secret at length was divulged and its use became more general in several countries on the continent it has been observed above that it was at first prepared from the motherley of nitre and it was sometimes obtained by evaporating the liquor and afterward driving off by means of a strong fire the acid with which it was combined and sometimes by precipitating the magnesia by pouring in a sufficient quantity of an alkaline lixivium  the powder thus prepared was not however pure magnesia a quantity of wood ashes and quicklime are necessary to the crystallization of nitre and in consequence the magnesia separated from the liquor remaining maining after that process contained a proportion of these substances besides as but little nitre is prepared in europe the difficulty of obtaining the liquor in sufficient quantity was an impediment to the general preparation of magnesia that excellent physician and ingenious chemist hoffman hoffman vol   p  00 was induced from the similarity between that lixivium and the brine remaining after the crystallization of sea salt to try whether magnesia might not be precipitated from the latter the experiment succeeded to his wishes and he even found the powder thus obtained to be more purgative than the other his animadversions and experiments on this preparation were published and engaged the attention of physicians to a medicine so strongly recommended by that celebrated professor dr black to whom we are obliged for many ingenious experiments tending to investigate the chemical history of magnesia rendered the process still more easy by substituting the bitter purging salt commonly known by the name of epsom salt which is prepared from the last mentioned brine instead of the brine itself thereby enabling chemists to prepare the medicine though at a distance from those places where seawater is evaporated  the process notwithstanding published by dr black was little known and in some respects defective magnesia alba was indeed sold in the shops but ill prepared coarse and adulterated scarcely any was to be met with in a tolerable state of purity except what was prepared by the late mr glass of oxford who having bestowed much attention on the subject produced it greatly superior to any at that time vended this gentleman however had not the generosity to divulge his process but carefully concealed it as a profitable nostrum  about sixteen years ago i happened to reside in the neighborhood of mr glass i had before that time frequently prepared magnesia but had never been able to make it equally fine as his though far superior to what was commonly sold my ambition was excited i wished to attain to a like degree of perfection and after many trials i arrived at the desired point and found by repeated comparisons that the magnesia which i prepared equalled that of mr glass in every respect  when i left oxford i made no other use of the discovery i had made than preparing magnesia for my own shop and freely communicating what i knew on the subject to my acquaintance after some years it occurred to me that it might be of public utility to draw up an account of the method i had made use of and to deliver it to the college of physicians who are the proper guardians of medicine in this kingdom i accordingly transmitted my process to the college who did me the honor of publishing it in their transactions vide medical transactions vol   p       some time after the publication of the volume of transactions which contained my method of preparing magnesia dr saunders a very ingenious physician in london whose extensive knowledge in chemistry has been displayed in several publications mentioned in conversation to dr percival the great improvement which magnesia was capable of receiving by calcination that by this means it might be deprived of those disagreeable qualities which occasioned flatulencies in the bowels of some tender people and had brought the medicine into a degree of disrepute my worthy friend sensible how much i was interested in every discovery on that subject communicated the information to me and on trial of this process i found the magnesia improved to the utmost of my expectation it was perfectly mild and as free from causticity after as before calcination it operated in half the dose and occasioned none of those disagreeable sensations in the bowels which often follow the use of common magnesia  from hence i was insensibly led into a train of other experiments which have been since published experiments and observations on various subjects by thomas henry london      and it is hoped may have contributed to explain the nature of magnesia and determine its medicinal properties more accurately than had hitherto been done in the course of these experiments it was observed that the calcined magnesia did not dissolve so rapidly in the vitriolic acid as the uncalcined and being desirous of comparing some other with my own and imagining i might depend on the purity of that vended under the name of mr glass who had some time before sold his process to mr delamotte who then resided as a stationer at weymouth i purchased a box from the agent for the sale of it in manchester that i might calcine it and observe whether it acquired the same or different properties from that which i had prepared  the result of these experiments and the caution with which i proceeded has been already delivered to the public and the torrent of abuse which has so plentifully flowed upon me in consequence of the discovery is notorious conscious of my own integrity i have stood undaunted at the attacks which malice and revenge suggested the unchemical doctrines the absurd inferences the glaring contradictions and illiberal language with which the publications of my antagonists abounded served only to convince the public of the badness of a cause so meanly so ungenerously defended  on the action of absorbent medicines in general when a mixture of animal and vegetable food has remained a short time in the stomach a fermentation ensues which is necessary to carry on the work of digestion but which when it becomes excessive degenerates into disease during this fermentation a considerable quantity of air is produced and the alimentary mixture gradually tends to acidity  to restrain the inordinate ferment in the stomach nature has wisely given us the saliva or spittle which ha the property of preventing it from rising to a degree injurious to health but where the saliva is either corrupted or insufficient in quantity where the tone of the stomach is so weak as to detain the aliment too long before it be pushed forward through the pylorus into the small intestines or where the nature of the aliment itself is too much disposed to ferment in all these cases the air which is of the same nature as that discharged in the fermentation of vinous liquors distends the stomach and an obnoxious and sometimes most austere acid is produced which irritates the coats of that bowel particularly that plexus of nerves which is diffused about its upper orifice and occasions pain four belchings vomiting and heartburn  as this was the most obvious kind of acrimony it became the fashion among the chemists of the seventeenth century to ascribe the origin of almost all diseases to a redundant acid and their practice consisted in giving to their patients alkaline salts and absorbent earths such as chalk calcined oyster shells crabs claws etc and these were frequently administered in cases where perhaps remedies of a very opposite kind were requisite  but when science became more founded on rational principles than on imaginary hypotheses this practice lost ground and the use of absorbents was confined to its proper bounds to the correction of acidities when obviously prevailing in the first passages and here indeed was a large field for the employment of these medicines a field which perhaps daily became more spacious as luxury more prevailed and as the increase of arts and manufactures tended to enervate the people by inducing them to lead more sedentary lives  even in this state of things inconveniences arose from the property which all the common absorbents possessed of being astringent for though they for a time corrected acidity yet they produced such a degree of costiveness as in effect rather added to the disease they were intended to cure and an absorbent earth of a different nature was a desideratum in practice  dr cadogan appears to have been the first physician who introduced the use of magnesia alba into these kingdoms in his excellent treatise on the management of children he recommended this powder as being more easily soluble in acids than the common absorbents and as a most safe and efficacious purgative the opinion of physicians was for some time suspended by the difficulty of obtaining it in a state of sufficient purity i have used my utmost endeavors to remove that difficulty and by the great improvement of calcining it which was first suggested by dr saunders the medicine is rendered much more extensively useful i am obliged to dr saunders for his permission to insert the following note dr saunders in his public lectures both on the practice of physic and chemistry has frequently recommended my process for preparing magnesia and has declared that my magnesia was the purest and most soluble of any others     it may be necessary to premise for the information of those readers who may not be acquainted with medical subjects that alkaline salts and absorbent earths when united with acids have their nature entirely changed and form salts of a different kind neither acid not alkaline which salts differ according to the different acid or alkaline employed it has been too customary to consider the action of these medicines as solely confined to the absorption and neutralization of acids in the stomach and bowels whereas when thus united they form a combination capable of being admitted into the lacteals and from thence into the circulation and thus acquire the property of acting by urine and by increasing the perspiration  on the diseases in which magnesia alba is useful during the first months after the birth of a child the state of the solids is lax and the juices thin and dilute these circumstances contribute to the more easy growth of the body yet to prevent the tone of the parts from becoming too much relaxed nature with that providential care which pervades her whole creation has given an acid to the stomach of young animals to strengthen their fibers and prevent too great a tendency to alkaline acrimony but this like her other provisions sometimes exceeds the bounds which were intended and degenerates into a disease of an opposite tendency to those it was designed to prevent from the excess of acidity in the bowels of infants the milk is coagulated and by oppressing the stomach becomes the source of many diseases the bowels are irritated and spasmodic contractions of the guts occasion severe gripings to the tender infant and as the nerves are at that period exceedingly irritable convulsions of some particular part or of the whole system are frequently the consequence green stools and sour vomitings discover this acidity in the bowels of young children so frequently that one of the best writers on the subject of their diseases attributes the origin of all infantile disorders to this cause harris de morbis infantum   children thus affected always lose their florid complexion and become pale and wan sometimes they declare the severe gripings which torment them by the most piercing cries and sometimes when their stomachs are oppressed with coagulated milk or viscid phlegm they lie in a state of stupidity refusing all nutriment their stools and what they vomit show evident signs of acidity not only in the color but the smell  under these circumstances it is too common a practice among nurses neglecting the primary cause of the disease to pour in hot cordials and often to quiet the complainings of the infant by administering opiates instead of attempting to correct and carry off the acidity which occasions the disorder remove the cause and the effect will cease to this end where the child vomits up phlegm or coagulated milk or appears oppressed with them it it may be proper to clear the stomach by giving a grain or two of ipecacuanha or a teaspoonfull of a dilute solution of emetic tartar either of which may be administered with great safety and after the operation of the vomit a small dose of magnesia may be given and repeated occasionally so as to keep the body of the child gently open it is a great recommendation of magnesia that its insipidity renders it more agreeable to infants than any other purgative and it has this advantage over all the other absorbents that it acts as an easy purgative whereas they tend to bind and render the body costive a state which should be studiously avoided during infancy for a plentiful discharge by stool is always so favorable to the health of children that we ought to be very cautious how we hastily check even the excesses which may sometimes happen in that evacuation as the loosenesses of infants are generally occasioned by some acrid stimulus in the bowels they are best cured by changing the nature of the offending matter and dislodging it from its seat the method therefore which has been proposed above should first be used before any astringents are called in to our aid  the rash commonly known by the name of the red gum and the disorder called the thrush or frog which so often affect children during the first months may in general be cured by the same treatment in the former should the body be too loose oystershell powder or shalk may supply the place of magnesia in the latter some topical application may be necessary the following ormula is very efficacious  take of eggshells cleared from the internal skin or embrane dried before the fire and reduced to a fine powder and of sugar each a quarter of an ounce of borax n grains mix them together let a small quantity of his be placed now and then on the childs tongue that e may roll it about in his mouth  it has been a common practice to give magnesia to children as a preventive and to mix it for this purpose with their food in order to correct that disposition which milk and the farinaceous aliments have to turn four this however should be done with caution for it is only the excess of acidity which is prejudicial to infants some degree of it is necessary and should we too officiously and entirely destroy what we ought only to restrain within due bounds we may create disorders of an opposite nature to those we have endeavored to prevent and instead of an acid produce an alkalescent disposition in the first passages indeed i fear that diseases have been more frequently created than obviated by the use of preventive medicines and they should only be allowed in cases where the approach to disease is manifest but when a child is in a healthy state the best means to preserve him from a superabundant acidity is to pay due attention to the regulation of his diet to give him proper exercise not to confine him too much in the foul air of hot unventilated rooms to wash his whole body every day in cold water and to rub him very well night and morning with a dry flannel taking care that his stomach be not too full at the time when this friction is performed  nor would i advise parents to rely with too much security on the virtues of this medicine where the disorders of their children are complicated or obstinate the advice of the sagacious and distinguishing practitioner will then be necessary to direct what method of treatment is to be pursued nor can i here avoid lamenting that the management of children when diseased is so often in the hands of nurses and ignorant women from an absurd notion that their diseases are not proper subjects of medical investigation when in truth there are none which require a clearer judgment a quicker penetration or a greater share of medical knowledge in the prescriber  during the period between dentition and puberty the diseases attendant on a lax fiber still continue though not so predominantly as in the former stage yet acescency is the manifest cause or at least the concomitant of many of the complaints to which children are at this time liable to this they are disposed notwithstanding the change in their diet to a more alkalescent kind by the great quantities of fruit frequently crude and unripe cakes and other sweet and greasy food with which they are too often indulged by these errors their bowels are overcharged their digestion impaired and the aliment remaining too long in the stomach becomes sour and occasions vomitings headachs and other complaints which are thought to proceed from worms and indeed are frequently attended with that disorder as the crudities thus generated in the bowels serve as a nidus for these destructive vermin here likewise magnesia may be of considerable advantage as an alkaline purgative neutralizing the offending acid and at the same time promoting its discharge by stool but if the stomach be overloaded with mucus or undigested aliment a gentle vomit ought to precede the exhibition of the magnesia  and even in a more advanced stage of life persons of weak habits and who lead sedentary lives are often afflicted with indigestion four eructations heartburn vomitings and costiveness these disorders very frequently attend women during their state of pregnancy and are sometimes almost instantly removed by the use of magnesia doctor watson medical observations and inquiries vol   p     has published the case of a pregnant woman who was afflicted with such severe vomitings as to bring on convulsions hiccoughing and violent pain at her stomach what she brought up was acid and so very acrimonious as to inflame and excoriate her mouth and throat and the great uneasiness she felt at her stomach upon swallowing any liquor that had the least degree of acrimony or was more than lukewarm made it probable that the internal surface of the stomach was affected in the same manner in this desperate situation after variety of remedies had been tried in vain the stomach was washed with unsalted mutton broth till the liquor was discharged without any acid taste her pain was by this means abated but in about two hours was apparently returning with the same violence as before this ingenious physician then directed a dram of magnesia to be given in mutton broth and to be repeated as often as her pain returned without any regard to the quantity the whole might amount to supposing her pain to continue severe the first dose relieved her and in three days she took three ounces of magnesia and in the next three days two ounces more by which time all her symptoms were removed it is remarkable in this case that an excessive purging was not the consequence of taking so large a quantity of magnesia where there was so much acid to neutralize it  in bilious habits where there is generally a disposition in the stomach contrary to acidity magnesia is usually esteemed to be improper taken alone but i am dubious whether this opinion is well founded and many reasons for these doubts may be deduced from some experiments which have been recited in a former work henrys experiments and observations p    and seq by these experiments it appears that magnesia though remarkably septic to animal flesh retards the putrefaction of bile and restores sweetness to it when actually putrid that these last effects are still more strongly produced by the calcined magnesia which also powerfully resists the corruption of flesh that some of the other absorbents prove antiseptic to bile and consequently that the opinion of the universal septic property of the absorbent class of medicines and of the impropriety of prescribing them in fevers of a putrescent type may admit of some exceptions for as the bile is by many supposed to be the great source of putrid diseases ought not the antiseptics which are prescribed in these cases to be such as more particularly impede the corruption of this fluid rather than that of flesh   however where putrid bile is to be corrected and discharged by stool very good purposes may perhaps be answered by taking the magnesia joined with a sufficient quantity of acid to neutralize it while in a state of effervescence or by swallowing the magnesia and the acid one immediately after the other so as to produce the fermentation in the stomach for thus the fixed air with which the magnesia abounds being let loose may powerfully correct the tendency to putridity in the contents of the primae viae and at the same time evacuate them downwards  it is probable magnesia may be of service in diseases of the skin several authors have attributed cutaneous eruptions and indeed the ancient chemists as has been before observed ascribed almost all disorders to the presence of an acid in the blood whilst others absolutely deny that an acid can be admitted into the lacteals or if admitted exist in the blood in a state of acidity in these cases however if an acid acrimony abounds in the stomach and bowels with a costive habit and pale complexion magnesia will be a useful corrector and entering the circulation in the form of a mild neutral salt may act as an excellent alterative or where there is no suspicion of acidity in the stomach an equal quantity of cream of tartar may be mixed with the magnesia  having thus given a cursory detail of the medicinal properties of magnesia in its natural state i shall now proceed to consider it in a state of calcination  magnesia alba etc on the medicinal virtues of calcined magnesia though in the preceding chapter notice has been taken of the good effects arising from the fixed air of the magnesia being let loose in the stomach by drinking some acid beverage immediately after the powder in diseases of a putrid tendency yet in disorders of a different type and in persons of flatulent habits the discharge of this air by the acid of the stomach often occasions uneasy sensations in the bowels inflating and distending them overmuch inducing griping pains and above all a sense of debility or sinking which is not easily described in order to obviate these inconveniences i was induced by the reasons mentioned in chapter first to deprive the magnesia of this part of its composition by calcination by this process it lost seven twelfths of its weight and though it produced no effervescence with acids yet it had not acquired any degree of acrimony to the taste and when thirty grains of it were diluted with a few spoonsful and swallowed it occasioned no uneasy sensation in my stomach nor sense of heat in my throat proved nearly as aperient as a double quantity of uncalcined magnesia and operated without the least griping  thus magnesia alba is not only divested of the disagreeable qualities which have been alluded to but acquires new properties which render it likely to answer some very important practical purposes  calcareous earths alkaline salts and magnesia being deprived of their air attract it from every substance with which it has a smaller degree of affinity the two former becoming highly caustic by the loss of their air cannot be administered but in very small doses but calcined magnesia being absolutely divested of air though not rendered acrimonious and being able to absorb a large quantity of this elastic vapor may act more powerfully than the whole tribe of carminatives yet essentially differs from them in many respects they contain a large quantity of air magnesia in this state is entirely free from it aromatics may be apt to ferment and increase acidities the calcined magnesia is incapable of effervescence and corrects an acescent disposition in the gastric juices the former constipate the belly the latter is laxative  from this property of magnesia when calcined of absorbing air it occurred to me that it would of all others be the most proper purgative for patients laboring under the stone who might be taking the lixivium saponarium or soap ley having the advantage over all the vegetable purgatives which abound with air and consequently have a tendency to render the caustic alkali mild and inert i even flattered myself that it might coincide in promoting the efficacy of that powerful solvent of the human calculus doctor macbrides theory that the lixivium acts by depriving the calculus of its fixed air appears to be well founded and mr chittick in the exhibition of his nostrum which notwithstanding all his arts to disguise it is now known to have been the soap ley kept his patients from every kind of diet abounding with air we may therefore venture to recommend it though not as a lithontriptic being insoluble in water yet as an assistant to the lixivium by absorbing a part of that air in the primae viae which would otherwise be attracted by the caustic alkali and thereby render it incapable of acting on the calculus  in all the diseases attended with an acescent disposition in the first passages in which magnesia has in another place been recommended the calcined powder may be given with superior advantages as it will not produce any of those inconveniences which have been attributed to that medicine when uncalcined besides that it will act in a threefold capacity viz as an absorbent of air and of acidity and also as an easy purgative i know several who could never bear to take the common magnesia with whom the calcined perfectly agrees this medicine has been very serviceable in flatulent cholics and even in gouty habits joined with some warm aromatic it has been found useful in correcting the very great flatulency which so much afflicts persons of this constitution and the cayenne pepper appears to be the most proper addition to it on account of the small quantity of this spice that is necessary to make the magnesia gratefully warm to the stomach hypochondriacs and those persons who from leading studious and sedentary lives labor under obstinate costiveness and obstructions of the bowels have generally recourse for the cure of these complaints to warm aloetic purgatives and with propriety where their habits are not too full and disposed to inflammation but in these cases the use of such medicines frequently induces piles and inflammatory irritation whereas the calcined magnesia succeeds much better correcting the acidity which is so prevalent in such patients and removing constipation without occasioning the disagreeable consequences of more stimulating medicines  the calcined magnesia appears in general to be a preferable medicine for children to the uncalcined it is an agreeable circumstance that so much smaller a dose of the former is necessary as it operates in half the quantity that is requisite of the latter and proves an effectual corrector of the flatulencies which give so much disturbance to the tender bowels of infants i have administered it to children of but few days old with safety and success nor have i ever observed any disagreeable consequences from its use  my ingenious friend dr lettsom lettsoms medical memoirs p     et seq has related the case of a woman aged    who was seized with convulsive twitchings in the left side accompanied with a most acute pain under the short ribs shooting toward the region of the stomach she had labored under this disease for about two years before her admission into the dispensary in aldersgate street the fits attacked her two or three times a day and generally continued from half an hour to three hours during the paroxysms she suffered the most excruciating torture till at length nature being exhausted she sunk into a state of stupefaction in some of the fits a spontaneous vomiting terminated them sooner but no particular matter was ejected  besides bleeding blistering and laxative medicines she had tried a great variety of remedies in vain dr lettsom from the frequent eructations of wind joined with the other symptoms judiciously concluded that flatulence in the stomach and bowels principally excited this direful disease and that besides opiates to quiet the convulsive motions it was necessary to absorb the superabundant air that seemed detached in these viscera and sometimes distended them sensibly to the touch  an emetic was prescribed to be taken every week and in order to absorb the fixed air which might be accumulated in the intestines and to correct acidity she was directed to take four ounces of lime water and also two drachms of calcined magnesia three times a day and one dram of the paregoric elixir was exhibited once a day at least  by the use of these medicines and due attention to her diet she experienced ease the first week the fits gradually diminished in violence and in frequency and n two months nearly subsided at which time the elixir was omitted she continued to take calcined magnesia and limewater for a week afterward and since she was discharged from the hospital the doctor assures us that her health has remained uninterrupted without the use of any medicine  calcined magnesia is a medicine very well adapted to counteract the costiveness occasioned by the use of the bath tunbridge and bristol waters and may be a convenient substitute for the saline purging waters being taken in small doses washed down with a large draught of pure water or in cases where acidity does not prevail in the stomach of lemonade or any acidulated liquor  as a preparative for the smallpox few medicines can be given to infants preferable to calcined magnesia and from its antiseptic property or power of resisting the putrefaction of flesh and of bile it seems well deserving the attention of practitioners as a purgative in putrid diseases  general directions relative to the doses of magnesia the following general directions may be useful in respect to the doses of calcined magnesia but it is to be remembered that a double quantity of the uncalcined magnesia will be requisite to produce the same effects  a child during the month may take from three to six grains of calcined magnesia and the dose may be repeated at proper intervals till a sufficient number of stools be obtained  children during the time they are cutting their teeth may take five ten or twenty grains of the calcined powder in proportion as it is intended to act as a purgative or only as an alterative as they advance in years the dose must be increased accordingly  the doses for adults as well as for children must differ greatly according to their different constitutions or the degree of acidity in their stomachs it may be proper therefore to begin with smaller doses and to increase them if necessary in general twenty or thirty grains will be sufficient to procure a gentle purging for an adult person who is easily moved but much larger doses may be necessary for the more robust while acidity prevails in the stomach and occasions costiveness heartburn and vomiting the dose is only to be regulated by the effects which the medicine produces  the magnesia is much more agreeable when mixed well with the vehicle in which it is taken to this end only such a quantity of water should be added to it at first as may be necessary to reduce it to a paste which should be rubbed till it be quite smooth and then gradually diluted  water sweetened with sugar milk and water or almond milk are proper liquids in which to mix the powder to children it may be given mixed with their food in such a manner as not to be perceived by them  as most people are now provided with scales and weights for weighing gold it may be proper to mention the proportions which these weights bear to those used by the apothecaries two pennyweights are equal to   0 grains or two drachms and the grain weights each of which contain as many grains as there are round marks on the surface are exactly similar to those by which medicines are weighed the money weights which are marked with the names of the several coins bear the following proportions viz that marked one guinea contains     grains or   grains above two drachms that marked  0s  d sixtyfour grains and a half or four and half grains above one dram etc so that the quantities of magnesia to be given may thus be accurately determined  but where weights are wanting the quantity may be measured in a teaspoon one of a moderate size contains about six grains upon a level with the edge of the spoon and when headed up about twenty grains  the end
