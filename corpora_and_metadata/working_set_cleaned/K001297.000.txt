an essay on the gout with an account of the nature and qualities of the bath waters  intended for the benefit of richard tennison esquire  by geo cheyne m d and f r s  the third edition  dublin reprinted by and for george grierson at the two bibles in essexstreet       advertisement to the reader this small treatise was originally intended for a private paper of instructions to the gentleman whose name it bears to direct him how to manage himself under the gout it is indeed an abstract of a larger one on the same subject which has lain by me these seven years which yet i have not had leisure or humor to finish several copies of this having got abroad and the pitiful condescendence of pyrating booksellers even to such trifles as these have constrained me to let it come out in print as it is to prevent its coming out from them the gentlemen of the profession may easily perceive by the grossness of the philosophy and the low detail of the pharmacy it was not designed for them if any shall think fit to dispute or criticize on the doctrine here laid down they may do it securely as if the author were as much dead as these his labors will shortly be i hope i know the value of time and pains and the vanity of all human speculations better than to employ them in defending such trifles all i undertake for them is that the facts may be depended upon for their truth and the method and medicines for their efficacy toward the end in the circumstances proposed if any person under them shall either amuse himself by reading this paper or lighten his gain by following its directions i shall have obtained all i proposed by it  as to the account of the bath waters given here it came naturally in the way of my subject and is such as the observations i have made suggested to me i scarce know and have taken no notice of what others may have written or observed on these waters nor indeed had it been possible for me in my present situation being without my books and confined to bounds by the nature of my design i have often observed with admiration the wisdom and goodness of providence in furnishing so wonderful an antidote to almost all the chronical distempers of an english constitution and climate which are chiefly owing to errors of diet or rather as a sacred writer expresses it to idleness and fullness of bread the rankness of the soil the richness of the provisions the living so much on flesh meats the inconstancy of the weather and the indulging in sedentary amusements or speculative studies directly leading thereto to remedy all which kind heaven has provided bath waters as the most sovereign restorative in all the weaknesses of the concoctive powers  bath july      the contents the introduction page     that the reason why of two persons in all other circumstances the same the one has the gout the other is free from it is that the small vessels of the gouty person in their original conformation are narrower and more stiff than those of the other p     that the cause of an acquired gout in the first person or those born of sound parents is the abundance of tartarous urinous or other salts introduced into the blood by the food p     hence we learn the reason why on the first attacks of the gout in otherwise healthy people the humors generally fall on the joints of the limbs p     hence we may likewise see the reason why the first fits enrage and remit once in twenty four hours why the whole fit lasts fourteen days and lastly why the accesses and remissions of those broken with the gout happen only in fourteen days and why the whole duration in such is made up of several such accesses and remissions p     hence we may discover the reason why gouty persons are people of good natural parts large feeders and longlived p     hence we may conclude that a fit of the gout is an effort of nature to throw off this abundance of salts through the more stiff and narrow strainers or we may consider it as a crisis of a putrid fever where the noxious humor is discharged on some of the muscles or joints ibid   hence we may discover the vanity of all pretenders to an universal and certain remedy for the gout p     hence there can be but two direct ways of treating the gout one by widening the capacities of the small vessels the other by lessening the quantity of the salts p     the difference between hereditary and acquired gouts p    0 from hence is concluded the necessity of a much more strict management in an hereditary than in an acquired gout p      the advantages of labor and exercise in the gout to which however two conditions must be added   that it be not too violent   that a moderate diet be joined to it ibid    two ways of lessening the quantity of salts in the blood the first by a vegetable diet and the inconveniences thereof cornaros diet recommended p       the other way is by evacuations in the intervals and by a gentle slow perspiration in the fits p       the secondary methods of relieving the gout are two   dilution by proper liquids such as bath and german spaa water or other chalybeat waters dwarf alder tea trifoil tea light quick green tea small spicy bitters on water and the like p         strengthners of the instruments of digestion the peruvian bark especially where its virtues and qualities are explained p       the advantages of mercurial medicines in the gout considered a salivation will banish the gout for some time but then it tears and rends the small fibers whereby the future fits become more painful and obstinate p       the method by which one is to treat himself under the fit in its beginning middle and end p       opiats not to be given in the gout but in the last extremity with two ways of ordering forms of such medicines p       the manner of treating the gouty after the pain is over stomach purgers first then asses milk is recommended and lastly spaa or bath waters with aromatic bitters p     0 rhubarb recommended as an excellent preservative from the gout taken in the intervals of the fits with the reasons thereof p       the manner of using rhubarb with other succedaneous purgatives in case of its disagreeing p       sulphur and its flowers recommended as the most noble of all medicines for the cure of the gout with the reasons thereof its nature and qualities and the manner of using it p       several dilutors recommended especially a weak decoction of the bark of the root of sarsa with observations on rosellis drops and the famous pox doctors medicines p       drinking freely of light clear spring water of great use after intemperance in gouty persons p       bath waters the best of all dilutors in the gout the nature cause and original principles of bath waters to wit steel and sulphur aethiops mineral recommended the diseases where it is proper and the manner of using it p       that there is a greater proportion of steel in bath waters than is discoverable by the senses or common experiments a comparison between these and the other european hot waters with the manner how bath waters are generated p  0    the reasons why the bath are such an excellent remedy in the gout and other chronical distempers p       bathing in the hot baths in the intervals of the gout recommended p       the nature of contraction and relaxation of animal fibers and how bath waters come to cure both p     0 the other chronical cases and disorders whereof the bath water is an absolute cure or a powerful relief bath recommended as the fittest place in britain for weak tender people to spend their lives in with the reasons thereof p       the necessity of preparing the body before and after a course of bath waters as also of joining specific medicines with them in chronical cases p       the quantity of bath waters to be drunk daily that a less quantity ought to be drunk daily than is usual and a longer time allowed for drinking them of the afternoon and night doses p  0    a comparison between gouty chalkstones and gravelstones that those who are severely treated by the gout seldom fail to have the stone or gravel the cause of the stone and gravel in general cyprianus his observation on those who drink malt liquors that the methods that cure the gout will prevent the gravels increasing p       how the gout in the head is to be treated p       after what manner the gout in the stomach is to be treated p       how the gout in the guts is to be treated p       the difference between humorous and a nervous gout that white wind is better than red in the fit and red better than white in the intervals but that nothing but inveterate custom makes either necessary p  0    of cold bathing in general its use to strengthen after a fit of the gout p       of nervous distempers in general and of the nervous gout in particular of the nature of nervous and elastick fibers of hypocondriac hysteric and nervous disorders p     0 the method of treating nervous gouts and other nervous distempers vomits preferred to purges in weak nerves the bark recommended in all such cases but with some limitations p       the only difficulty grounded on any probability against the bark answered the true state of the distinction between vernal and autumnal agues p  0    of the true and infallible cure of the genuine sciatica or hip gout a detail the whole methods and medicines with the reasons of their virtue and efficacy in this case p       of topics or outward applications in a fit of the gout and of symptomatic gouts p       temperance and abstemiousness recommended as the only cure or certain relief in the gout p  0    some short observations concerning the due method of treating the gout etc theories of the distemper as far as is consistent with giving the reason of my opinions for after having laid down two propositions which will be found the principles of my reasoning through this discourse i proceed to the observations themselves  prop   of two men having all other circumstances alike as near as may be of the same parents born healthy of the same stature complexion diet air exercise etc it seems to me impossible to assign a solid reason why the one should be afflicted with the gout the other be absolutely free from it but this that the capillaries smallest vessels of the gouty person must be in their natural make conformation narrower and more tense stiff than those of the other who is free from the gout in respect of their common stature and size for thereby the crude and gross humors which are confined or pass with pain in the gouty person will easily flee off by perspiration and the other drains of the body in the person free from the gout  prop   the cause of an acquired gout in the first person or in those born of sound parents seems to me to be the abundance of tartarous urinous or other salts introduced into the blood by the food salts seem neither to perish nor to be begotten but to be constant and incorruptible parts of animal and vegetable bodies the delicacy and flavor of flesh and fish is entirely owing to their abounding with a fine soft oily or urinous salt as is evident in venison and wild fowl wines of all kinds have a greater or lesser quantity of tartar in them and other strong liquors abound in their peculiar salts in proportion to their strength spirits are nothing but a great quantity of vegetable salts crowded together in a little water and oil these salts received in abundance but neither sufficiently broke by the digestive powers nor driven out of the habit by due exercise but by their plenty and nearness uniting in greater clusters must necessarily form obstructions and give pain when by the force of the circulation they are thrust through narrower and stiffer capillaries small vessels nothing either received or bred within the body besides these salts can account for this difference  coroll   hence we may learn the reason why on the first attacks of the gout in otherwise healthy people the humors generally fall on the joints of the limbs because in the joints the smallest vessels are more compressed by the larger heads or protuberancy of the bones and are thereby rendered narrower and more readily obstructed these obstructions fall on the joints of the limbs because of the greater length of these small vessels between the heart the origin of the motion of all the fluids and these joints their other extremity whereby the quickness of the circulation diminishing obstructions are there more readily formed  coroll   hence likewise we may see the reason why the first fits of otherwise healthy persons enrage and remit once in four and twenty hours the when it begins to enrage access being at sunset and the when it begins to be easier remission about daybreak why the whole fit in such lasts about fourteen days and lastly why the particular accesses and remissions of persons advanced in years and broken with the gout happen only once in fourteen days and why the whole duration of the fit is made up of several such accesses and remissions in equal times in the first stages of the gout the fluids being less sizy and glutinous their salts and siziness are sooner broken and dissolved by the action of the solids in the circulation and are thereby sooner brought into a condition to be carried off by perspiration which makes an access and a remission the greater weight and grossness of the air which hinders perspiration at sunset beyond what it is at daybreak together with the particular degree of siziness seems to determine the times the greater degree of siziness in the fluids of people advanced in years and broken with the gout lengthens out the duration of these accesses and remissions and the precise period of fourteen days seems to arise from the special nature of the siziness of the fluids and its resemblance to that of a regular intermittent fever the whole duration of whose fits put together sydenham has observed already to be equal to fourteen days but the particular explication of all these things would require more room than can be allowed them in the bounds i have prescribed to my self my friend if he pleases may consult bellini on this head  coroll   hence we may discover the reason of the common observation that gouty persons are people of good natural parts large feeders and longlivd because the fibers of the smallest vessels being more stiff and springy than ordinary the circulation is brisker more full and free whereby the that is eating digesting and evacuating etc natural functions are more readily and regularly performed and therein the best health and truest sensations consist strong health requires liberal supplies and both together lengthen our life  coroll   from these also we may discover what a fit of the gout is to wit an effort of nature to throw off this abundance of salts through more stiff and narrow secretory ducts strainers salts of all kinds are more or less caustic burning the urinous most of all as is evident from spanish flies and that unextinguishable substance called the phospheros so readily and plentifully to be had from human urine the reason of which may be from their pointed figure piercing more readily by its being besmeared with a light oil or from their greater attractive force or from some other quality not yet or perhaps never to be discovered what is certain is this that persons of a large appetite as gouty persons generally are feeding plentifully of flesh and fish and drinking liberally of generous wines or other strong liquors and using either too little or too much exercise must necessarily overstock their blood with these fixed and incorruptible parts of animal and vegetable bodies which in their nature being hard and burning cannot fail first to raise a tumult and fever and then to give violent pain as they are driven out of the habit through more stiff and narrow small vessels by the force of the circulation so that a fit of the gout may be considered as a crisis of a putrid fever wherein the noxious humor is thrown upon some of the muscles or joints of the body  coroll   hence we may discover the vanity of the pretenders to a certain and universal remedy for the gout for unless a remedy could be found which at once could change and newmould the solid parts of human bodies alter the nature and qualities of animal and vegetable bodies and destroy parts that are in their own nature fixed and permanent it is impossible it should be certain and universal and how possible such a remedy is i leave every one to judge  coroll   hence it is evident there can be only two direct ways of treating the gout with any prospect of success the one is by stretching and widening the capacities of the small vessels and slackning relaxing their fibers the other is by lessening the quantity of the salts introduced into the fluids by the food these being the two antidotes or opposites to the two fundamental causes of acquired gouts  gouts the latter is produced in a person otherwise sound from ignorance or negligence of the exact rules of living for though there be a natural configuration of parts that disposes one man more than another to the gout yet there might be a method of diet ordered which should prevent it the former is a stain taint compounded perhaps of scurvy stone and pox transmitted to the patient with the principles of life together with a disposition in this taint to unite it self to any malignity introduced into the habit through excesses  coroll hence we may observe the necessity of a much more strict and careful management in hereditary gouts than what is necessary in acquired ones in the first the gouty humor is ingraind and transubstantiated into the solids and other principles of life and impossible to be rooted out by human art and industry the most that can be done is to lessen and relieve the symptoms whereas in acquired gouts the noxious humor being more confined to the fluids a proper diet due exercise and a few wellchosen remedies may go a great way if not to a perfect cure yet to make life tolerably easy under them  gouty person can safely undertake for his health wisely managed exercise seems that alone which can best answer one part of the first intention viz the widening the capacities of the small vessels labor or exercise assists the gouty three different ways first as it increases the intine mtion motion of the parts of the fluids among themselves so that their salts by their collision striking one against another are broken and made less that they may pass more readily through the small vessels secondly as it adds a new and foreign force to the blood and thereby promotes its circulation from the heart through the small vessels driving some of the grosser parts of the fluids through them which in the ordinary course of the circulation would not pass so freely and thereby opening their obstructions and enlarging their capacities thirdly as it increases the natural perspiration the action of the muscles in labor and exercise and the spring of the solids by their multiplied efforts squeezing the strainers of all their contents but to make labor and exercise as useful as they may be two cautions must be added to them first that they be not too violent in respect of the patient for too violent exercise will necessarily either spend the spirits whereby the digestions and circulation will be impaired and so a regular gout be brought into an irregular one or by shaking all the gouty salts at once upon the extremities a regular fit will be forced out which in less violent exercise might have been spent by perspiration secondly that moderation in eating and drinking be joined to it for commonly gouty persons are large feeders and exercise emptying the stomach the guts and small vessels if the appetite be satisfied to its craving the evil is rather increased than diminished thereby  gout the first is by a total abstinence from or a great abstemiousness in flesh fish and strong liquors which introduce those salts into human fluids but this course is never to be undertaken but with great caution and in the last extremity for these two reasons first because an entire vegetable diet weakens all the digestive powers and all the functions of life impoverishes the whole mass of the fluids impairs the strength and dispirits the man and thereby necessarily begets the worst kind of hysterical and hypocondriacal disorders and all their black and dismal consequences at least till the body has been long accustomed to it which is a disease far worse than the gout it self and to which the gout only brings the patient in its last and fatal stages secondly because this diet once entered upon is never after to be changed under the danger of certain death or the most violent enraging of all the gouty symptoms for a vegetable diet as has been just now hinted weakening the digestive powers and all the functions of life etc the patient can never after be brought to bear with a free way of living without the hazard of certain death or a violent enraging of the gouty symptoms as is too plain from many vid the life of the p of conde fatal instances if any diet is ever to be tried in the gout it is to be ordered in cornaros method that is by living on the white foods eating flesh and fish of the lightest digestion and drinking generous unmixed wines both of them in small and constantly equal quantities in weight and measure under the craving of the appetite and proportioned for the mere support of life  sydenham otherwise a most accurate observer of nature and a most judicious practitioner has been the occasion i think of a great mistake in the management of the gout by forbidding almost all evacuations either in the fit or in the intervals for fear of weakening the constitution there are two seasons to wit spring and fall when the periodical fits of regular gouts commonly happen which i consider as cardinal and critical discharges under general and mechanical influences for purifying the blood and discharging the gouty salts in which nature is no more to be disturbed in its operations i mean as to purging for even then a gentle slow constant and uniform perspiration and breathing sweat may be promoted not only safely but with great advantage than in the monthly purgations of the sex but in light flying touches of the gout out of these seasons and in the intervals of the fits gentle warm stomachick purgers will be an excellent remedy to send these a going to lessen the fits and lengthen the intervals a person out of the pain and inflammation of the fits and in their intervals except his natural disposition to breed another fit is to all intentions of medicines the same as a well person and all medicines levelled against other diseases incident to human bodies may be as safely administered to a gouty regard being had to his particular constitution as to any other person wherefore the general and direct methods of relieving the gout are in the fits a gentle uniform continued perspiration and breathing sweat in the intervals labor or exercise and gentle stomachick purgers  gout are principally these two first dilution by proper liquors secondly strengthners of the instruments of the digestion nothing is more likely to thin the blood to dissolve and break the salts and keep them at a distance from running into clusters than proper diluters as we see in fevers rheumatisms and other inflammatory distempers for this reason among others it is that bath and german spaw waters and all other mineral chalybeat waters dwarfelder tea trifoil tea light quick green tea small spicy bitters on water and such like drunk freely blood warm on an empty stomach become so useful in intervals of the gout water is the universal dissolvent of salts of all sorts and being replenished with the spicy bitter and active parts of other bodies it strengthens the stomach and bowels breaks and dissolves the salts cleanses the insides of the vessels from the foulness that constantly adheres to them and carries it out of the body by increased perspiration and urine  gout if the digestions be true and good the parts of the chyle be made sufficiently small and the circulation be full and complete all which are the common effects of stomachick medicines the salts will be less the obstructions of the small vessels fewer and the impurities of the fluids will more easily pass by perspiration and the other drains of the body and so the fits of the gout become more easy and less frequent among all the strengthners of the digestions i would recommend a strong infusion of the jesuits bark in generous claret as being the coolest bitter the most powerful strengthner of relaxed fibers in the instruments of digestion and the greatest antidote of the urinous salts especially if joined with chalybeats and some qualifiers of its mawkish and nauseous taste the bark has the same effect on the coats and fibers of the vessels that oak bark has on raw leather and the same effects on the fluids to prevent their coagulation and to render them uniform that the testaceous powders have on vinegar or as they have on milk to prevent its curdling but more especially as it produces such wonders on the solids and fluids in intermittent fevers to the state and condition of both which the solids and fluids of gouty persons bear so near a resemblance as has been observed in coroll   wherever the bark is proper i recommend the glans quercina or acorn as of the same class of medicines and in some cases of relaxation exceeding the other it is cool and easily digested but they do best united all bitter and spicy medicines have more or less of the same quality but heat the body more and brace the fibers less  mercury by its weight and its constantly forming it self in little spheres or perhaps from its greater attractive force throughout all its possible divisions seems to offer fairest of any internal medicine for breaking the gouty salts for relaxing the fibers and enlarging the capacities of the small vessels and the fact is that by a full and free salivation gouty people have been freed from all its symptoms for several years but it is also matter of fact and experience that a full and free salivation does so break rend and tear all the smallest tenderest and finest vessels and fibers that the body becomes in a worse state in respect of the future fits than it would have been in several years time under the common symptoms for though a salivation may open all the obstructions of the small vessels cleanse their insides from the foulness that cleaves to them purify the blood and break its saline impurities yet by its great weight and the excessive force it adds to the blood rending and tearing the finest vessels and fibers when the gouty person comes to his former diet and the other circumstances of living and the fluids become thereby loaded with their salts they stick more obstinately to the joints than if the parts had been subdued and broken by regular fits of the gout so that a salivation though it banish the fits for some time yet when the blood is replenished again with gouty salts the habit is reduced to a worse condition in respect of the future fits than if they had never been interrupted and indeed it is observable that after a full or repeated salivation the man is seldom or ever the same as to the quickness of sensation or the usage of the most beautiful animal faculties but there is an absolute necessity of having recourse to mercurial vomits and purges when the gout becomes fixed to and permanent in a place as also when it is dispersed all over the habit like a rheumatism these active medicines must first render the humors fluid which gum guajac with diaphoretick antimony persisted in will afterward carry off i come now to consider the gouty person under two different circumstances first under a regular fit and secondly in the intervals  madera wine water boiled with a few spicy seeds mixed with these wines water gruel with some wine or hartshorndrink with cinnamon and little or no flesh meat will succeed best during all the time of the fever after the fit is distinctly formed the milder cordial and stomachick medicines which promote a gentle breathing sweat i mean in the more compounded and tedious fits of the gout chiefly in persons advanced in years such as gascoin powder goa stone bezoar sir walter rawleighs cordial diascordium confection of alkermes and the like washed down with clear bloodwarm sackwhey in every draught of which ten or fifteen drops of spirit of hartshorn has been first poured with flannel on the parts and much lying a bed such a method and such medicines i say will best forward the fit toward the decline the stronger warmer spicy and stomachick medicines such as serpentary root casamunair zedoary old venice treacle electuarium de ovo and such like with a few grains of camphir and salt of vipers and a good stomach bitter on wine to wash them down will finish this affair strengthen the bowels and prevent the recoil of the gouty humor on them and here it may be taken notice of that as the fever that ushers in the gout is so will the fit be if the fever is short and sharp the fit will be so likewise in regular gouts if it be feeble long and lingering the fit will be such also in the management of the foregoing method and medicines two cautions are to be minded first that during the whole fit liquors may be more freely and safely indulged than solid foods for repletion from solid foods in a fit of the gout might be of fatal consequence by rendering a regular fit of the gout irregular whereas fluids will certainly pass either by perspiration sweating or urine secondly the cordial medicines are always to be regulated by their lightness on and agreeableness to the stomach of the patient for whatever makes him sick will more or less draw in the gouty humor on the stomach and by their not rendering him more hot and restless than the gout it self would naturally make him for if they produce an agreeable sensation on the stomach and do not inflame they will necessarily procure coolness and quiet  opiats may be safely given in a fit of the gout to procure rest and alleviate pain in the general it is the safest side not to administer any kind of opiats in the fits because they constantly pall the appetite and leave a nauseating and perhaps a reaching on the stomach the readiest way to bring the gout there but in extremities when the patient has been many days without rest and the pain becomes intolerable all other means failing or equally dangerous opiats may be so qualified and their mischievous effects so bridled by joining spicy nervous and stomach medicines to them that they may become an excellent remedy thus liquid laudanum with tincture of castor of snakeweed of diambra of saffron sal volatile compound spirit of lavender hysteric water and some agreeable simple water some of these mixed in a due proportion and proper dose will not only procure rest and ease pain but answer all the other intentions in the cure of a fit of the gout thus also london laudanum with old venice treacle or mythridate serpentary root and unscented species of diambra made into a bolus with any agreeable syrup and cautioned as before will produce the same effect  gouty humor this premised especially after long and severe fits which have impaired the strength and wasted the muscular flesh i should advise asses milk with pearl half a pint or a pint in the morning early and five or six a clock in the afternoon to lengthen out the morning sleep to pulp up the exhausted muscles to cool and refresh the parched fibers and keep the body soluble which asses milk commonly does and to keep up the appetite which the milk commonly palls and to prevent its too cooling effects on the stomach a light bitter made of gentian cinnamon and orange peel only the last double of the other two infused in sherry or white wine and taken two hours before meals may be used most conveniently this course might be continued for two or three weeks after which i should order a course of bath or german spaw waters with steel riding a light whitefood diet and generous wines drunk temperately  gouty the methods both general and particular i have touched upon i come now to recommend some special medicines which have been found useful in this case it is certain that great abstinence from flesh fish and wines would prevent the fluids from being overloaded with gouty salts it is also certain that if the food be carried out before it is digested it will be pretty near the same thing as if the quantity carried out had not been taken down now if a medicine can be found that without weakening the stomach and bowels shall carry off the greater part of the food before it is quite robbed of its salts it cannot fail to be of great use in the intervals of the gout for this purpose i would recommend fine rhubarb taken regularly once twice or oftener a week in such a dose as to procure two or three motions for these reasons first because it is an excellent stomach bitter as is evident from its taste and from the sharp appetite it gives those that take it frequently secondly because it is one of the noblest astringents hitherto known as is evident from its cure of fluxes and intestine haemorrhages and from the tightness it leaves on the bowels thirdly because it requires neither diet nor keeping warm nor any other particular management and yet taken frequently and regularly it will carry off any proportion of the food one pleases and so reduce the dier as near as needs be to cornaros which in article xiii has been shown to be of so excellent use in the gout i knew a noble lord of great worth and much gout who by taking from the hands of a quack a dram of rhubarb tinged with cochineal to disguise it every morning for the space of six weeks lived in health for four years after without any symptom of it  take gentian and zedoary of each a dram serpentary root and unscented species of diambra of each half a dram cochineal and saffron of each a scruple orange peel an ounce infuse in a quart of mountain in a warm place twenty four hours strain and to the liquor add three ounces of the best rhubarb salt of wormwood a dram and half set in a warm sand heat twelve hours and then strain a second time of this four spoonfuls every night or every other night as occasion required i have found an excellent remedy in this and other chronical cases where no preparations of rhubarb will agree with the constitution as there are many such then elixir salutis tincture of hiera picra a solution of gum guajac or the scottish pills might take place but that all the preparations of aloes are apt to throw out both gout and piles however in this matter there is great variety out of which every one may fit themselves with what is most agreeable to their own constitution which if they use regularly and frequently they cannot fail to prevent violent fits of the gout and perhaps most other both acute and chronical distempers  sulphur as one of the best remedies in the intervals of the gout it is but in little use at present in physic except in the itch and the piles and yet in the whole extent of the materia medica i know not a more safe and more active medicine its wonderful efficacy and particular manner of operating in these common cases might i think have encouraged its trial in other chronical cases especially considering the facility of its working and the little trouble it gives in taking it its principal qualities are these   the parts of sulphur and those of light and fire act mutually upon one another more powerfully than those of other bodies it is to their sulphur that bodies owe reflecting and refracting virtues from whence its inflammability proceeds vide sir isaac newtons treatise of light and colors   edit in english toward the end the particles of sulphurous bodies receive and retain those of light and fire more strongly than any other bodies and the rays of light and particles of fire separate move and turn the parts of sulphurous bodies into fire and flame   the parts of sulphurous bodies are very small even smaller than those of water it self whereby it comes to pass that they will enter those small vessels where water it self our best and most universal diluent cannot come this is evident from hence that water will not dissolve sulphur and that no moisture will stick to fat substances or the feathers of water fowl as also from its cure of all cutaneous foulness which it could never effectuate but by entering all those smallest vessels which scarce any other medicine can enter and lastly by its dissolving the sizy juices of the smallest internal glands when obstructed particularly those of the lungs mesentery and rectum as in the humorous asthma scrophula and piles   sulphurous bodies will readily unite with and destroy the effects of all saline particles but especially those of the acid kind and in this their great energy seems to consist sulphur yields the most piercing active and agreeable acid in the world such as spirit of sulphur gas of sulphur and the like   the fat and oily parts of sulphur like other fat and unctuous bodies are the lightest the most coherent and the most springy of all bodies these two last qualities are most manifest from the artificial sulphur made of oil of turpentine and spirit of vitriol the strongest glue and the most penetrating acid duly digested and carefully managed which in all respects is the same with natural sulphur no body denies says tournefort in his voyage to the levant page     part i english edit that sulphur is only a fat substance fixed by an acid spirit the sulphur which is artificially made and the analysis of common sulphur put this truth out of all dispute for the sea water being fat by the oil of the sea fish continually corrupting there and bitter and saltish from its saline rocks produces in proper nests natural sulphur and sir isaac newton says in his last edition of his optics page     by dissolving flower of brimstone in oil of turpentine and distilling the solution it is found that sulphur is composed of an inflammable thick oil or fat bitumen an acid salt a very thick earth and a little metal the three first were found not much unequal to one another the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to be worth the considering join all these qualities together and you have one of the most admirable remedies in the world for all intentions in the cure of the gout by its agreeable taste and lightness on the stomach especially when washed down with any milky vehicle its tenacity ropiness and elasticity the smallness of its parts their efficacy in destroying the mischief of all saline particles with their natural warmth joined to the activity of its acid salt making it a kind of natural soap it enters the small vessels where no other diluent hitherto known can come cleanses their insides from the foulness that sticks to them imbibes and retains all the gouty salts and carries them out of the body by perspiration softens smooths and relaxes the parched and stiffend fibers and by leaving some of its oily parts on their surfaces sheaths and defends them from the points of the salts afterward introduced and the fact is from repeated trials i can recommend sulphur as a most powerful remedy in the intervals of the gout for i have known half a dram of powdered sulphur or flowers of brimstone taken regularly twice a day in a spoonful of milk prevent the fit for many years and lessen both its pain and duration when it happened for it moved the body gently once or twice a day i have in my possession testimonies under the hands of some treated and tended by my self and of others of undoubted credit witnessing to the great success of this medicine in the intervals of the gout nothing hitherto discovered i believe equals it obstinately persisted in  gout by diluting and breaking its salts and carrying them off by perspiration and urine and certainly rosellis drops perhaps the tinctura metallorum somehow altered which were said to work gently by stool and sweat in the hands of a prudent and knowing physician had been an admirable remedy as answering both the intentions mentioned in the intervals of the fits and even in the fits themselves it had not been without its use always excepting the vernal and autumnal regular fits had he dealt with recent gouts and firm constitutions only that which i would particularly recommend here is a weak decoction of the bark of sarsa root in the bark the virtues of the plants chiefly consist for being replenished with most part of if not all the juicecirculating vessels it contains all its salts and most active parts and being spungy and tender it is thereby more easily digested and where roots are most in use the bark of the root is more eminently useful for the reasons assigned as also because toward the end of the autumn when roots are gathered the cold has already driven the juices into their bark and this may be one reason why the famous poxdoctor succeeds in some cases when mismanagd mercurial treatments have failed his dietdrink chiefly consists of a decoction of the bark of this root his pill is mercurial perhaps the arcanum corallinum or panacaea and these two persisted in for so long a time must necessarily sweeten the tainted juices and expel the entangled and grosser mercurial parts which clustering together could not perform the circulation but were retained within the habit by former mismanagd salivations and thereby rendered ineffectual to the cure especially if to these be added the low and starving diet he prescribes for i have heard of a famous seacommander who effectually cured the first stages of venereal distempers by living twenty days on water gruel only in which a little cream of tartar had been first dissolved and higher degrees of the same by the like diet continued twice the time with a little milk drunk freely blood warm every morning which i have known wonderfully relieve gouty persons when drunk all the winter between the cardinal fits and even cows milk warm taken for breakfast and supper has been of great service to those gouty persons who drink not much wine for those who drink wine freely have too hot and sour stomachs to deal in milk  gout it is well known that warm water alone drunk in a morning fasting freely and at meals from its heat its dilution and cleansing qualities has been a sovereign remedy in restoring decayed appetites and strengthening weak digestions when other more pompous medicines have failed lower very justly observes that persons that have drunk beyond the rules of temperance may be much relieved from the ill effects of it by exposing themselves to the free air to cool the blood and to force off the liquors by urine i am of opinion were there neither sin nor shame in it as there are eminently both a gouty person ought to avoid intemperance as he would avoid the bite of a snake or mad dog but since such accidents do happen let the gouty person after the excess either in meat or drink swill down as much fair water as his stomach will bear before he go to bed whereby he will reap these advantages first either the contents of the stomach will be thrown upwards and he freed from a great part of the load or secondly both meat and drink will be much diluted and the labor and expense of spirits in digestion much saved and thirdly the gouty salts will thereby be dissolved and distancd from one another and so be more readily carried off by the free perspiration sweating and urine which ensue  bath waters with chalybeats and warm bitters and a frequent and regular use of stomach purgers will be found to succeed best in gouty as well as other chronical cases the learned have been divided and much perplexed about the heat of bath waters i have always endeavored to account to my self for it from the common experiment of mixing filings of steel and powder of sulphur working them into a paste with water and putting them in a cellar under a cock dropping water slowly and regularly the paste will ferment to such a degree that the water running from it shall be of the same heat and virtue with the bath waters though not so pleasant nor so well fitted to human bodies this is a common experiment and these are the only natural bodies known which meeting together will produce heat in water without artificial fires tournefort in the place before mentioned says its certain that filings of iron steeped in common water will grow considerably warm and much more so in sea water and if you mingle therewith some sulphur powdered you will see this mixture really burn sir isaac newton in his last edition of his optics page     says that even the gross body of sulphur powdered and with an equal weight of iron filings and a little water made into a paste acts upon the iron and in five or six hours grows too hot to be touched and emits a flame that the heat of the bath waters is owing to a principle within themselves is evident from their retaining it longer than any other water heated to the same degree will wherefore there can be no necessity of having recourse to vulcanos or subterraneous fires to account for this appearance there are no burning mountains known in this our northern climate and it is pretty hard to conceive how fires should have burned so long under ground without a vent or any other remarkable sign the sulphur in the bath waters is evident to the senses swimming in large clusters on the tops of the baths mixed with earth and some vegetable substances wherewith the guides commonly gild silver and is found an excellent remedy in scurvies leprosies ringworms and other foulnesses of the skin the steel is manifested by the bluish tincture given to the water from the pump by an infusion of nutgall it is true this tincture is neither so deep nor is it to be had from the water in any short time after it comes hot from the pump thereby to manifest any great quantity of steel in the composition such as can have the full proportion to the experiment now mentioned but to set this in a clearer light let us put together these considerations first that upon distillation of bath water there remains little in the bottom of the glass but the common calx or sea salt that is found in the distillation of spring water if we except some sand or earth that is forced up by the violence of the pump wherefore the bath waters not being impregnated with any quantity of a saline mixture can retain nothing in their own proper substance but the lightest parts of the steel and sulphur secondly that this water is as fully impregnated with sulphur as it can bear has been already shown and that there must be a greater proportion of steel in bath water than is manifested to the senses or discovered by any experiment hitherto made is evident from its healing effects which no known medicine but steel can bring about or account for none but those who have seen it can believe the wonderful efficacy it has in most chronical cases what but steel in a few weeks can make the blood from a white bluish or tallow hue resisting the knife like glue swimming in its serum like an island amidst the ocean look all of a piece of a scarlet color and a due proportion between its nourishing and its watery parts nothing but steel can make a pale ashcolored countenance hollow and deep eyes no appetite little strength and less sleep eat and drink and sleep look gay and sleek like the best health thousands of such instances may be seen every season at these healthful springs thirdly the effects of sulphur in bridling the sensible appearances and operations of most active medicines is very well known instances of which in natural bodies are antimony and native cinnabar in artificial ones aethiops mineral and cinnabar of antimony in all which the mercury is so bridled up by the sulphur that none of their sensible operations and appearances are felt while they produce the most wonderful changes on animal bodies i cannot pass over aethiops mineral without pressing its more universal use than for ought i know it has yet had in common practice it is one of the most certain and universal alteratives if dosd sufficiently and long enough persisted in of all the dispensatory it radically extirpates the itch the piles scorbutic and scrophulous ulcers all cutaneous foulnesses all inflammations and fluxions of the eyes all internal ulcers rheumatisms white swellings sharp humors in the stomach and guts and almost all distempers arising from sizy juices i say it cures these if art can do it for some of these like hereditary gouts are so transubstantiated into the solids that nothing but a new conformation of parts can cure them it may be given almost to half an ounce a day especially with interspersed mercurial purges without trouble or any sensible operation and continued for a twelvemonth if one pleases the finest sulphur and fittest to make aethiops of is common sulphur powdered and boiled seven or eight times in spring water whereby it becomes as light on the stomach as prepared pearl and as effectual in the cases mentioned as the celebrated sulphur of aix la chappelle waters but to return to the business  bath waters derive their heat from a principle within themselves since no natural body but sulphur and iron can produce such a degree of heat as is in them since nothing but steel can produce those wonderful cures on human bodies which bath waters do since sulphur will lock up and bridle the sensible appearances and effects of the most active bodies and yet not destroy their healthful and medical virtues it is plain that bath waters must owe their heat to a mixture of steely and sulphurous particles and their healthful effects to a greater proportion of steel than is sensible or easily discoverable by any experiment hitherto made joined to a light sulphur whose virtues and efficacy in all chronical cases we have already shown the mountains which surround the place which every body now knows to be but the nests of minerals and the receptacles of the waters which feed the springs which mountains are continued even to the sea confirm this opinion the manner i conceive thus the dews drilling and dropping through the cranies of the mountains fall upon a bed of iron oar and are there as fully impregnated with chalybeat particles as such water can bear and gently owzing down upon a nest of sulphur and there fermenting to such a degree that requiring more room they bubble up at the foot of the mountains with their sulphurous spoils and furnish out this healing and balsamic fluid all hot waters seem chiefly to consist of these two principles and to differ only as the sulphur or steel predominates in them where the sulphur predominates they are hotter more nauseous and more purgative of the three hot european waters of note the aix la chapelle bourbon and bath the first abounds more eminently in sulphur which makes its heat nauseousness and purgative faculty so great that few weak stomachs can bear its heat and nauseousness and fewer weak constitutions the violence of its purging the bourbon are of a middle nature between the aix la chapelle and the bath waters and are less hot nauseous and purgative than the aix la chapelle but more than the bath waters the bath partake less of the sulphur and more of the steel than either of these two and are by far the most pleasant of a milky taste never purge except they be drunk either too fast or in too great quantities and always mend the appetite and raise the spirits the weakest hot waters are but of little use except in the lowest cases and in hectic or consumptive constitutions but for medical uses the weaker hot waters may be made pretty near equal to the stronger by evaporation as to the sulphurous principle as the stronger may be brought down to the weaker by dilution as i have experienced though nature be always the wisest and most perfect operator but neither the same proportion of steel nor sulphur nor heat indifferently fit all constitutions generally the strength  i e the quantity of steel and sulphur of the same hot waters is in proportion to their heat and therefore to fit the same waters to weaker constitutions they need only be drunk proportionably cooler  bath waters having such an origin and such qualities must needs be an excellent remedy in the gout and other chronical cases for these reasons   because of their warmth just suited to the wants of nature and a little above the heat of human bodies sufficient to introduce a foreign warmth and motion to cold and decayed bowels and fluids whereby the natural warmth and slow circulation is increased and enlivened   this with its agreeable taste and milky softness makes it sit so easily on the stomach and become so excellent a vehicle to wash into the blood other proper and specific medicines without that nauseousness and fret on the spirits which all other hot waters hitherto known or that chillyness and damp which all cold mineral waters give whereby they are rendered useless or hurtful in some low and nervous cases to these add   their chalybeat principle so peculiarly locked up in sulphur that the patient reaps all the benefit and healthful effects of the best preparations of this medicine and what are not two such powerful medicines combined able to effect without the nauseous taste and frequent disorders upon the stomach that every other way of giving steel produces   the sulphur united with the steel makes it a natural kind of soap for cleansing the insides of the vessels from the foulness that cleaves to them and for opening the obstructions of the small vessels but   that which together with the others makes it specific in the gout is its relaxing quality whereby it softens and supples the rigid and stiff fibers so as the gouty humors may pass freely by perspiration much more might be said of this wonderful remedy provided by the hand of nature to relieve the miseries of human life but this the innumerable crowds of cripples of all sorts and those other persons made miserable by chronical distempers sent thence every year cured or relieved do witness more convincingly than either philosophy or rhetoric can  first is concerning bathing in the intervals of the gout the only reason given for this difficulty is lest the gouty humor should be driven inwards upon the bowels but this seems to me a mere groundless jealousy for in regular gouts when the fit is over it is to be supposed that the gouty fluid or matter is mostly or altogether spent and the fluids in a healthy sound condition and therefore it might be as reasonably doubted if in the intervals of two putrid fevers of which many have had more than two in their lifetime a person might safely bath there is no question but that a gouty person may both as safely bath and take any medicine for any incident disease as any other person regard being had to his particular constitution and it is matter of fact that those who have been crippld by the fixing of the gouty salts upon the joints or disabld by the tenderness of the parts have been extremely relieved by a long course of drinking and bathing in these hot waters which by relaxing the fibers dissolving the sizy humors diluting the gouty salts and making them pass by perspiration have restored them to the use of their limbs  fibers as in the gout and rheumatism and yet contract and brace relaxed fibers as in the palsy and wasted limbs that the matter of fact is so is past all doubt in these and many other cases of contraction and relaxation but to clear up this we need only to consider what contraction and relaxation are since all the fluids of the body are contained in vessels contraction can arise from nothing but from the blood and other fluids or whatever is the cause of muscular motion their being retained and obstructed by their siziness or from some external injury in the substance of the muscle it self whereby it becomes fuller and firmer and so acts as upon its office of contraction relaxation upon the other hand is an obstruction of the nerves or vessels of the fluids before they arrive at the muscles as is seen in palsies and the nervous atrophy of the limbs so that in both cases obstructions are the cause both of contraction and relaxation wherefore whatever medicine can dissolve the siziness of the fluids open the obstructions of the small vessels make the perspiration full and free and brace the fibers will both contract relaxations and relax contractions and that these are some of the effects of bath waters has i think been made sufficiently appear  gout bath waters may be useful in the answer will be obvious from the account now laid down to wit that they must be beneficial in all cases where steel or sulphur is that is in almost all chronical cases whatsoever in acute and inflammatory cases in all cases attended with a strong quick pulse no mineral water nor chalybeat medicine can be proper but in all other cases excepting those only attended with a bleeding or haemorrhage they are not only safe but exceedingly beneficial more particularly their wonderful efficacy has been often experienced in cachexies scurvies in the stone rheumatism and jaundice in hypocondriacal and hysterical affections in vapors and melancholy in palsies epilepsies and other cephalic and nervous distempers in disorders of the stomach and bowels obstructions of the liver and gallbladder in green and breeding sicknesses in barrenness and weakness after childbirth in obstructions of the monthly purgations and all other peculiar diseases of the sex and truly if a person afflicted with a low broken or tender constitution suffering under the tedious pains and inquietudes of any of the lingering distempers now mentioned where the viscera or bowels are yet sound would know the fittest place in britain to spend their lifetime with the greatest ease and pleasure take all the advantages of the place together the agreeableness of the waters to the stomach the certainty of their procuring a good appetite when it fails and the no less certain consequence thereupon freedom and cheerfulness of spirits the regular way of living the excellency of the provisions the warmness cleanness and neatness of the housing the convenience of the free fresh and open air of the neighboring downs for exercise the easiness of the amusements and the advantage of what conversation one desires i say taking all these advantages together i can affirm from near twenty years experience without suspicion of flattery or fear of contradiction that bath is the place  bath waters without a previous cleansing of the stomach and bowels lest they wash into the blood through the lacteals by the perpetual dilution of the bath waters those impurities which constantly cleave to them nor that they ought to expect a perfect cure of a long breeding and lingering distemper without the assistance of those other medicines which are reckoned specific in the case and to which the bath waters are so pleasant and so assistant a vehicle for it is but prudence to bring all the forces one can raise against so potent and so formidable an enemy as a chronical distemper  bath waters which it is convenient to drink daily that being to be varied according to some circumstances of the patient and the nature of the distemper strong full and large bodies bear more waters than tender thin and lesser ones the younger more than the elder those of strong and firm than those of weak and relaxed nerves those who labor under the gravel and rheumatism than those who are disordered in the alimentary passages or are subject to scorbutic or nervus weaknesses and the like but in general it were to be wished that people who come to bath for their healths drunk less daily than they commonly do and allowed more time for a chronical distemper i think it may be safely advanced that any quantity greater than an english quart in a morning drunk in two hours time half a pint every half hour is more than what is reasonable for drinking in this proportion all the rest of the day at meals to wit in the afternoon and going to bed they must take down no less than five pounds in about sixteen hours viz two pounds in the morning a pint and an half with wine at dinner half a pound in the afternoon and as much at supper and at going to bed this every body must see is fully sufficient to answer all the intentions of drinking mineral waters a greater quantity than this will serve only to distend and relax the alimentary passages to force its way through the largest and most patent tubes and to propagate the circulation through the branches and inosculations of the larger arteries and veins where the least foulness and fewest obstructions can happen so that it will scarce ever reach the finest capillary vessels in which alone the danger lies and the late ingenious and learned doctor james keill page    tent am medicophysic jac keill has made it evident that the most expeditious way of altering the whole mass of the blood by mineral waters is by small and frequent draughts in most cases a pint in a morning is sufficient and in low constitutions and disorders in the alimentary passages tending to vomiting and purging half a pint is enough and whatever quantity is to be drunk it is always best to take it in small quantities and at good distances provided it come within the compass of the morning what is drunk at meals though cold yet being fresh and not altogether drained of its principles and virtues contributes near as much to the cure as that which is taken in the morning the afternoon and evenings draughts are more arbitrary and must depend upon the observation of the patient as he finds them agreeable to his stomach and sit easily or not where too great quantities have not been swallowed down in a morning they are very proper provided they be in proportion to the mornings quantity and never taken under four or five hours after dinner and that at night not under two or three hours after supper these times being the most proper to assist the digestion and carry off the remains of the food but the truth is as nothing is more necessary in a course of these waters than setting out right at first so nothing requires more the experience and judgment of a physician than the accommodating the previous preparations the quantities to be drunk and the medicines to be taken with them to the distemper and the constitution of the patient for these once settled the rest generally goes on successfully  gouts when the original constitution is broken and impaired the parts subdued and full of gouty salts the force of the circulation by age and frequent fits weakened and continued only through the inosculations of the great vessels the humor recoils inwardly upon the bowels and this is called an irregular gout while it is in any joint or any muscular part it is still esteemed regular though the nearer it comes to those outward parts the least remote from the heart and bowels the nearer it comes to an irregular one and so consequently to its last and fatal stages to which it seldom comes unattended for it generally brings the stone along with it of which it may not be amiss to make this one observation to wit  gouty persons and the gravel stones found in the bladders of such as were afflicted with this distemper perhaps the stones found sometimes in the gallbladder but of this i can affirm nothing are to all their essential qualities the same they have both the same color taste and smell they yield both the same principles and produce the same appearances when treated chymically they have both the same internal texture of parts as far as can be known and even the same outward shape when unbroken and unconfined by hard substances and they generally happen to one and the same person at least it seldom comes to pass that any one is much troubled with the gout but he has the stone at last and this shows that they are both owing to the same conformation of parts and other general causes it is true some have suffered violently by the stone who never had the gout but this may be owing to a special hereditary narrowness and stiffness of the urinary passages in respect of the other vessels and a particular unhappy texture of parts as it happens to some other organs in other persons for fat people have smaller vessels in proportion to their stature than lean but in the general it is pretty constant that those who suffer long under severe fits of the gout seldom escape the stone dr cyprianus the late ingenious cutter for the stone had observed that those who only drunk malt liquor were seldom ever violently afflicted with that distemper and among many hundreds he had cut he had never found one who had only drunk ale or beer whether this was owing to the lesser quantity of salts in those liquors than in wine or to the slipperiness they induce upon the bowels and other vessels or to both i will not here take upon me to determine but i believe the fact is both in the stone and acquired gouts that those who only drink malt liquors without wine or spirits are seldom violently afflicted with either and for the same reasons it comes to pass that the gouts and gravels of the sex are seldom so severe as in men they generally drinking less wine and feeding less of fish and flesh meats and that in the gouts both of men and women who drink no wine nor spirits any little proper medicine has entirely kept off the pain and prevented the fits i know an ancient gentleman formerly treated pretty roughly by the gout who drinking only malt liquors has for several years with certain success entirely kept off the pains and fits of the gout by taking only every morning regularly a pint of warm white wind whey to encourage perspiration which when he neglects to do they as certainly return we may therefore conclude   that since the gout and gravel stones are as to their essential qualities much the same and since it is hardly possible to account for the breeding of the stone but from a particular narrowness and stiffness of the urinary vessels and an abundance of such salts in the fluids it is highly probable that the gout must proceed from the same general causes and this is some kind of confirmation of the two first propositions laid down in the beginning of this discourse   the same method and medicines that have been deduced from the first two propositions for relieving gouty persons in the intervals of the fits will likewise serve for preventing the increase of the stone and gravel as we are certain they do from the best experience and practice in this case i will now go on with my purpose and consider an irregular gout fixed on these three great instruments of human life the head the stomach and guts  gout has seized on the head it is to be treated as any other violent headache or as an inflammation on the brain or its membranes by bleeding at the arm or jugular cupping on the back blistering between the shoulders but especially on the ancles to give the gouty humor a vent downwards in young and strong constitutions mercurial and antimonial vomits will do wonders though they are seldom to be ventured upon in any constitution above forty the intention here to be had in view as in all other irregular gouts is to expel the gouty humor outwardly upon the muscles or joints and to fix it there wherefore in order to carry it to as great a distance from the noble organs as may be a free passage is to be opened to it on the limbs by blistering the ancles and wrists and to promote its conveyance thither gentle stomach purgers are to be poured down continually two or three spoonfuls every third hour till the effect is obtained and for this end i recommend principally tincture of hiera picra with compound spirit of lavender and a few drops of tincture of snakeweed and tincture of diambra as being one of the most powerful expellents and an excellent strengthner of the stomach and bowels its common mischief is little to be minded here for the forcing blood or the piles will carry the gouty humor along with it and these disorders are but trifles in respect of an irregular gout this method will either spend the gouty humor or turn it to a regular fit but here care is to be taken that the medicines be not too hot especially in young sanguine complexions lest an inflammation on the brain or its membranes should turn to a phrenzy or fever but there is less danger of this because the gout in the head seldom happens to the younger except through much and long intemperance  gout in the stomach is a common and less dangerous case for the gout seldom comes on and goes off without touching there by the way in the slight touches of it any little stomach purge will set it a packing but it is more obstinate toward the decline of life when it settles in a constant pain nauseating and kecking in the stomach vomits are reckoned dangerous in the gout lest they should derive the humor on the stomach but there can be room for no such a suspicion here wherefore upon the first seizure of the stomach a vomit is instantly to be administered and repeated according to the occasion of the case after that hiera picra as is before cautioned and qualified with a hot sinapism or blister oh the ancles and last of all the highest cordials and most generous wines may be freely indulged without fear of inflammation among the cordials i would recommend the electuarium de ovo as containing camphir the most constant and active diaphoretic and the most useful one for that purpose and some other of the richest cordials after all this management should the gout still continue in the stomach and become habitual which it seldom does after such a method taken in time nothing but a long course of the bath waters with steel bitters and gentle stomach purgers a regular diet and proper exercise can effectually cure it  gout in the guts on its first seizure may be easily treated as a bilious cholic only the opiats commonly and justly given in the cholic are not here to be used but in the last extremity but this distemper ought to be treated altogether in the manner prescribed in the former section about the gout in the stomach  gout and one which has not hitherto been much considered for as the cholic or asthma is so the gout may be divided into the humorous and nervous though this distinction depends more upon the complexion of the patient than the abstracted nature of the distemper the humorous gout happens only to people of grosser habits more robust constitutions and more stiff and springy fibers and is the gout which i have been hitherto treating all i can further add to what has been said is that under the fit white wines are more eligible than red because those part more readily with their spirits and are less astringent than these and for the same reason in the intervals the red is preferable to the white though neither of them in either case be useful or necessary but because custom or habit which it is not safe to alter suddenly has made them so for in all the ottoman empire where little flesh meat and no wine is used and in spain where they use them very moderately and among the wild mountaineers in the northern countries and the lower rank of the people in every country where they can procure neither there is little or no gout rubbing the part affected with a soft hand or warm napkin as strongly as the patient can bear it is the ready way to make the humor perspire in the fit and cold bathing and rubbing with a flesh brush morning and night are some of the most certain outward means to bring strength and nourishment into it in the intervals  gout in a clearer light because a groundless jealousy of the danger of its throwing the gout inwardly has made it universally disused nothing made a greater noise upon its first restoration and nothing could have sunk lower in its reputation since than cold bathing and it will always happen so in things fitted to the vulgar capacity when they are universally prescribed without distinction and without choice those who know how greatly foulness and uncleanliness promote epidemical pestilential and infectious distempers can only tell what cleanness contributes to health the eastern people whose laziness in other things is owing to their climate have found cold bathing and ablution so necessary to their health that they have made it a part of their religion as it is a precept of a religion of a nobler extract from whence they borrowed it if the modern doctrine be true as i really think it is that the smallest fibers or those of the last division in animal bodies be not open and pervious but solid then it may be affirmed that warm water i mean pure element endud with no medical principle by the active power of its heat must necessarily relax such fibers and that cold water from the nitre which produces its coldness must necessarily contract them the tumor of the gout like other inflammatory swellings is owing to an obstruction or to the gouty humors flowing faster by the arteries than it can be received by the veins the smallest or capillary vessels are thereby extended and stretched beyond their natural power of restitution so that when the gouty humor is spent by perspiration or driven into the veins by the successive strokes of the circulation the obstruction removed and the pain entirely gone off the vessels continue thus widend and stretched beyond their power of restitution for a long time after and this is the sole cause of the long and tedious weakness on the part after the fit is over which would yet continue longer did not the coolness and pressure of the ambient air and the now sufferable weight of the clothing give the first impulses to the fibers toward their contracting themselves again now nothing in nature can so readily or so certainly bring this about as bathing in cold water for the nitre in the water which is the cause of its coolness and also the uniform equal pressure upon the part which arises from its gravity and fluidity concur to communicate to the fibers a strong and lasting impulse toward restoring themselves to their natural state of contraction and the gouty humor now being spent and the obstruction entirely removed as is supposed how can any such humor be translated upon another part by cold bathing more than if the person had never had the gout now to make this remedy still more effectual after a previous course of cold bathing cold pumping on the part by the force of a pump or the fall of water from a height may be conveniently used the wonderful efficacy of which is no less certain here than it is in white swellings on the joints where i think it is a never failing remedy i am very well informed of the case of a very considerable person who for many years before being tormented with constant and uninterrupted pains of the gout summer and winter by daily bathing in a tub of cold water has for these several years bypast brought them to regular and periodical fits at the cardinal and critical seasons only and of no longer duration than usual i know also an ingenious physician who after a fit of the gout goes daily into the cold bath till the part has recovered its natural strength which constantly happens in much less time than it would do otherwise and many others who are considerably strengthened and preserved from catching cold by cold bathing in the intervals of the gout though this practice is very cautiously to be gone about by the old and weak  nervous or flying gout both which i take to be the same and to differ from the windy gout which is nothing but a hypochondriacal or hysterical symptom is owing to the weakness softness or relaxation of the nerves of those persons who labor under it all the solids of the body are made up of small threads or filaments of different natures and textures they are divided into the fleshy the nervous the membranous and the bony and make up the solid substance of the whole animal body but all of them agree in a greater or lesser degree of springiness or elasticity and it is observable that some of the most perfect springy bodies are made of animal and vegetable substances such as ivory ebony and whalebone wherein the general nature of elasticity consists or what is the particular cause of the eminent springiness of animal fibers is as hard to explain as conceive which notwithstanding is the noblest instrument of all the actions and functions of an animated body all the attempts hitherto made to discover the particular nature of a contractile and distractile animal fiber to me seem insufficient and conjectural lewenhoeck has discovered by his glasses that the smallest fiber of an elephant is not bigger than that of the smallest insect and if the modern system of generation be just to wit that an animal or plant comes from another lesser one then growth is nothing but the unfolding the original membranes and fibers and the length of every fiber is the same in the youngest as in the full grown animal or plant so growth and motion both that is the whole business of the animal life is owing to the springiness of these fibers the best resemblance i can make of them is that of a long hair or small twisted gut which when stretched to any length beyond its natural state will restore it self again to its former dimensions and in this contraction and restitution of an animal fiber the greatest mysteries of the whole structure consist as there are some people who have hard gross stiff hair with a strong spring so there are others who have soft fine weak hair with a feeble spring and generally speaking as the hair is so the threads filaments and fibers of the body are those whose fibers are soft fine weak and of a feeble spring are generally said to be of weak nerves and liable to nervous distempers and here we may observe the difference between more tense and stiffer fibers and more springy and elastick ones all the fibers of the body are in a state of distension as is evident from the gaping lips of wounds two persons may have fibers of the same degree of springiness and elasticity and yet in their natural state and original formation the fibers of the one may be more stretched bent and distracted and consequently more stiff and tense than those of the other whereby the more stiff or tense fibers making a greater resistance and being with more difficulty stretched and widend will give more pain when a gross fluid passes through them than less stiff or tense fibers will which gives an account why of two persons both of them of weak nerves the one should have the gout the other be free from it persons of weak nerves must necessarily have less strength a weaker pulse and digestion a slower and more imperfect circulation of the fluids and a less free and perfect perspiration and if they happen to indulge in strong meats and generous wines they must become subject to hysteric hypochondriac and cephalic disorders but if together with weak nerves a greater degree of tensity or stiffness be joined under the same circumstances they will be liable to gouty together with the forementioned disorders but by reason of the natural weakness and less original springiness of their nervous fibers the fits of these gouts will be less painful and more constant  coroll from this account of the nervous gout and other nervous distempers it is plain all evacuations except the most gentle must be prejudicial in them gentle vomits as they cleanse the stomach and bowels and principally as they free the nerves from all extraneous bodies and increase the perspiration by the violent convulsions and contractions of the internal muscles and membranes blisters as they open the obstructions of the small vessels by their external and thin the sizy juices by their internal efficacy i say both these evacuations may not only safely but with great advantage be used in nervous cases but all violent purges and excessive bleedings are religiously to be abstained from as increasing the original weakness purges in people of weak nerves in chronical cases carry off a great part of the nourishment of almost three days vomits on the contrary carry off only those crudities that send up to the head and nervous system the noxious fumes and vapors that cause their misery purges relax and weaken the fibers of a natural and necessary function to wit those of digestion whereas vomits can but weaken the action of muscular fibers less used strong in themselves and not so necessary to concoction as is evident from monsieur chiracs experiment about vomiting purges carry off little but what would otherwise pass off in time by the natural course of the peristaltic motion and generally leave behind them what wants the inverted motion as they found it whereas vomits pump up those crudities that nature it self would gladly so to speak throw up by the same organs the same way nature tends lastly four and acid humors lodged in the stomach and guts must necessarily weaken both more than either gentle vomits or purges possibly can with this difference though that a very gentle natural or artificial purging continued for any long time in persons of weak nerves shall both weaken the person and waste the muscular flesh whereas you shall find after several months daily vomiting in a seavoyage a day or twos refreshment ashore restores the person to a greater degree of alacrity and strength than before whence it comes to pass that persons of weak nerves are so much relieved and raised by vomits and on the contrary so much sunk and depressed by rough and strong purges in chronical cases what farther is to be expected in such cases is to be done by a regular and strict diet fitted to the mere necessities of nature strengthners of the digestive faculties and here the bark and steel claim the first place as being the most certain strengthners of weak nerves gentle and constant exercise as encouraging the perspiration aromatic and spicy bitters volatile and attenuating medicines and whatever may be thought fit to nourish comfort and support the animal functions  bark as being absolutely necessary to the subject i treat it may not be amiss to remove one objection against it and the only one i have ever heard or read made with any show of reason i have taken as much of it my self and as often and have prescribed it as freely as any of my age i believe and never observed it either in my self or others do any hurt except when it has been injudiciously and improperly prescribed and that in continued acute cases only the objection is that it often leaves behind it a bad habit a scorbutic cachectic or hectic constitution bad lungs liver or stomach or some of the great viscera spoiled or corrupted but the mistake in this objection lies here to wit that few constitutions break and seldom any of these great organs become vitiated but they begin with an intermittent or periodical fever and these i have constantly observed to be of that kind and approaching that season which sydenham most judiciously distinguishes from vernal ones and calls autumnal agues and are indeed symptomatical only arising from beginning obstructions in the whole habit or in these greater viscera where all nature is at work and the whole organs labor and struggle to thin the sizy fluids and to open the obstructed bowels but not being able to bring about this end nature succumbs after every feverish fit thus excited into a worse state and even here too the bark does all its proper office in quenching to wit the violent paroxysms of the fever which only can endanger the life of the patient and allows time for other medicines to act but when the habit is already broken and the great viscera already unsound it cannot be blamed that it does not restore these nothing like that being expected from it or ascribed to it when the bark has extinguished the feverish fits which threaten death to the patient a reprieve is obtained in which by deobstruent and attenuating medicines health and life may be secured in relaxed nerves of the primaeviae in almost all sorts of nervous and cephalic diseases depending on these in all gouty disorders in the alimentary passages in all nervous gouts in all intermittent and periodical distempers or pains whatsoever it is preferable to any thing hitherto used only in very cold stomachs and constitutions i have found a decoction of the indian bark by some called elatherium to be yet more effectual and strengthening as it will also more readily remove the periodical disorders of such but the peruvian bark i never found did any hurt but in acute continued cases where it runs into violent purgings and in the monthly purgations of the sex which sometimes it will obstruct and therefore it ought not to be given without steel which ought also to be added when it is given in chronical cases it were to be wished only in these cases it gave the same relief the second and succeeding times it does the first  mercurial vomits and purges were absolutely necessary to dislodge it but there is one species of the gout which miserably torments its subjects and yet yields not to that or very rarely to any of the methods in use i mean the gout on the hipjoint when fixed and constant commonly called the sciatica and yet treated after the manner i am to explain never fails of a perfect cure the foundation of the method i had from the late most learned and eminent physician doctor archibald pitcairn he having communicated it to me under no restriction of secrecy i think my self obliged to publish it to the world for the benefit of the afflicted i have used it with great success these several years and i think have improved it in several particulars of the management and so never fail of a perfect cure if the distemper is a genuine sciatica though of many years standing and after having baffled all other attempts it consists in taking from one two three drams to half an ounce according to the strength of the patients stomach of the aetherial oil of turpentine that which comes off between the spirit and oil in drawing off the common oil of turpentine in triple the quantity of virgin honey in a morning fasting for four five six or eight days at farthest intermitting a day now and then as the patients occasions require or his stomach suffers by it in drinking after it is down large draughts of sack whey to settle it on the stomach and carry it into the blood and lastly in taking a proper dose of matthews pills every night that day the medicine is swallowed this course never fails to remove the violence of the pain and to leave only a weakness en the part to remove the grosser remains and strengthen the weakened part i order a dram or two drams of flower of brimstone for some time twice a day in a tea cup full of milk if through great intemperance or a violent cold the patient relapses i order the repetition of the former medicines for a day or two which commonly sets it a packing and lastly to strengthen the primaeviae and enliven the spirits i advise bath or spaw waters with steel and bitters with volatiles and perhaps pumping on the part affected which never fails to perfect the cure in a genuine sciatica and i hope it may be of some use to have a method of cure for this distemper so plainly laid down so effectual in it self so easy to the patient and so restorative of his constitution in general in respect of those tortures and the nauseous load of medicines the afflicted are forced to go through in common practice the great efficacy of this course consists in the aetherial oil it has been common to prescribe a few drops of the oil of turpentine in cold rheumatisms and fixed pains on the joints but this seldom proves effectual in the sciatica whereas this aetherial oil having all the penetration of the spirit together with the softness and detergency of the finest balsam but chiefly being of such lightness that any quantity of it may be given that can stay on the stomach or be kept down by frequent draughts of any soft liquor especially sackwhey which by its milkiness uniting readily with the aetherial oil penetrates into the least and finest vessels and the most secret recesses of the animal economy opens their obstructions dissolves the glutinous gellies in the joints cleanses the insides of the tubes and makes all pass by perspiration the rule whereby to accommodate the dose to the patient is to order it so that it may not be so much as to recoil upwards to prevent which a large quantity of sackwhey is ordered and it seldom moves above once downwards but lest it should go farther in the subsequent doses the pills take place  topics or outward applications to ease or relieve the part affected in a fit of the gout they are dangerous unless discreetly managed in the frequently mentioned cardinal fits of spring and autumn when through ignorance or neglect of the methods hitherto laid down they shall happen regular i would by no means encourage any such outward application of what kind soever hitherto discovered except in the very last extremities  pain in the regular gouts at those seasons these fits are not to be tampered with in any manner but in the way formerly directed for the habit being loaded with the gouty humor and salts must be allowed a time to discharge it self and drive them out of the body otherwise life must be endangered by a putrid or malignant fever and these being the seasons when the humors naturally undergo some alterations if the gout be thrown upon the extreme parts nature must not be disturbed in her operations but whatever is to be done is to be directed to encourage and fortify her in her own way and to assist her to expel the last breathings of this humor upon the parts most remote from the head and heart the two sources of the motion of all the fluids which has been the intention of all the methods and medicines prescribed in this treatise for thus the blood will be purified the spirits relieved from their oppression the joints rendered pliable and all the natural functions set at liberty when these fits are over any thing that is just and probable and attended with no danger for lessening the future fits and lengthening their intervals may be tried but in the fits falling out  these seasons in the tedious and lingering fits of those broken with age and habitual gouts a well chosen outward application may be safely and successfully used especially if at the same time gentle stomachic purges be administered or a blister on the ancles or wrists be opened to let out what may be repelled by the topic and thereby to secure the noble organs for let pretenders brag what they will i know of no outward application hitherto discovered but what by its sluggishness stops the natural perspiration or by its activity counteracts the direction of the circulation and consequently repels the humor in some degree or other but by thus opening a way for the humors to pass elsewhere the part affected may be much relieved by proper applications fuller and bates give the forms of some and doctor pitcairn was exceeding fond of and held as a great secret that which himself has published in the last edition of his treatises which is made of two ounces of white arsenick and six ounces of livelime stone put into four quarts of boiling water set in a warm place twenty four hours stoups of this applied warm to the part he had found ectual and safe that which i would rather recommend is stoups of a decoction  butterbur ground pine or camomel flowers or any aromatic bitter plant in milk or a pultis of the head of a sackwhey posset or any such soft and active application to moisten soften relax and open at first and toward the decline of the fit a mithridate or venice treacle plaster the emplastrum stomachicum magistrale or the like to strengthen warm and comfort especially if with these last a stomachic warm purge be joined as to symptomatic gouts there can be no place for them in the doctrine hitherto laid down for on the supposition that the gout is owing to a particular texture and conformation of parts where that texture and conformation of parts is and the materials for forming the gouty humor is supplied there the gout must necessarily be without the concurrence of any other distemper and where these are not there it cannot be let the person be subjected to what other distemper soever and if a person be subjected to two distempers in the cure of the one due regard is to be had to the cure of the other what has been said is all i intend at present on this subject  rich the lazy the voluptuous who suffer most by the gout i mean acquired gouts and those hereditary ones enraged by luxury so those only who have spent their lifetime under its tortures best can tell what astonishing miseries wealth and vice bring upon human kind when the gouty humor has seized upon all the noble principles of life when it has broken subdued and obstructed all the fine pipes and slender passages in whose openness and soundness all the exquisite sensations all the delicate usages of the animal faculties consist when nothing but pain and melancholy frightful ideas horrible dreams and black despair remain who would not have parted with the richest delicacies the most delicious wines and the most enticing vices for a plain simple diet an useful laborious life freedom from pain and a good conscience temperance only divine innocent indolent and joyous temperance can cure or effectually relieve the gout for let us or our brethren the quacks brag what we will  tollere nodosam nescit medicina
