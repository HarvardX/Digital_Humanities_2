of great northumberland every thing about me is so like a dream that i am frighted to think i am awake  o how weary i am of this dress if i had known half that i should have suffered in it all the fairies in the world should not have persuaded me to put it on  if i resided here in this disguise the month of the kings hunting i was to break the spell i was born under and my life was to be happy  so the fairy told me  yet the time expires tomorrow and nothing has happened to me but vexation and disappointment i must once more see this powerful yet decrepit being who though invisible is always within my call  this ring which she gave me convenes her if i take it off and touch it thrice she appears  once  twice  thrice   elfina comes forward and touches her emm o fairy my situation is such as i can bear no longer   elf patience for it ends tomorrow   emm tomorrow  tomorrow is a thousand years  when the horse has all he can bear a feather will break his back   elf what is the matter   emm matter why in the first place i have lived almost a month in a court    elf that your sorrow   emm that my sorrow yes  i that have always lived in my fathers principality fair northumberland where a noble simplicity of manners showed the heart to be open and undersigning have by your persuasion and assistance left it for a place where hypocrisy is avowed by the name of good breeding where the most shameful licentiousness is justified as gallantry dissimulation and perfidy as address and good management where selfinterest is professed as the first principle of wisdom and virtue and public spirit derided as extravagance and superstition   elf but your dress was your defense   emm o it is my dress that exposes me to more than half that i suffer when one of my own sex is in company i am comparatively happy but how unfit for a womans ear is the conversation of men when it is not restrained by knowing that a woman is present i begin to fear that i should hot have thought so well even of those men i have been used to converse with if they had appeared to me as they appear to each other  the friendship and confidence of these lords of the creation have almost robbed me a weak woman of my allegiance  i am frighted at the thought of living among them   elf fear not vices you detest   emm fear not but what must i hope o fairy if i have implicitly followed your instructions if i have hidden them in my breast from every friend and even from good northumberland my father let me no longer suffer the anguish of suspense   elf persevere believe confide   emm but i have yet found no object worthy of my love   elf you must find and know it not such the fates ordained thy lot  emm i know the mystery of my fate  that the happiness of my life depends upon my seeing and making a

morrow    elf soft  unhallowed feet are nigh  florimond    emm o that wretch haunts me like my shadow to rally me for what he calls my virtue seems to be his supreme delight he is proud of his own insensibility to what gives me pain the confusion he throws me into he considers as a test of his own abilities and accomplishments and as vanity is his predominant passion he is so assiduous to secure the enjoyment of his superiority that i can scarce escape him one hour in a day   elf he shall work thee woe and weal as tomorrow shall reveal  emm but how where  dear dear fairy    elf ha ha ha how and where must still perplex ye and in kindness i must vex ye  ha ha ha  elfina disappears emm gone  mystery perplexity and distress she sports too with my anxiety i almost wish i had not trusted her but it is too late  here comes florimond and my torment begins   enter florimond singing flor ha my little gondibertus have i found you  what all alone peeping about egad i was in hopes there had been a wench in the case and that i might have given thee joy of thy reformation   emm sir i chose to be alone solitude is sometimes not only useful but pleasant   flor why it is a fine moonlight evening indeed  but what the devil   emm i have sufficient subject for meditation sir and i hoped that as there is a ball at the castle tonight you would have been better engaged than to watch my privacy   flor what better engaged than to raise such a recruit for the beau monde as thou art  come come thou shall not thus steal away from good company to thyself   emm sir upon my word i am fit company for none but myself at present   flor pshaw  what always muzzy with a dismal countenance as long as a taylors bill come cheer up boy i have news for thee   emm for me sir alarmed   flor aye to divert thee i mean that is all   emm what is it any thing uncommon then   flor no faith not very uncommon neither though perhaps thou may make a wonder of it  it is only an heiress that is just run away with a young fellow   emm that indeed is not so uncommon as might be wished but who is she is she of any fashion   flor yes faith she is of some fashion northumberlands fair daughter emmeline that is all    emm oh    flor what thy virtue is shocked at the licent ousness of the age ha ha ha  or art thou a lover of the fair emmelines hey   emm aside what shall i say my confusion will certainly betray me  twas only a sudden pain shot cross my bread  but what particulars do you hear   flor why it seems she got leave of her father to follow him hither and it is just accidentally discovered that she left his castle the next day though she has not been here yet   emm well but why do you therefore conclude that she is gone off with a man   flor why only because the duke of kents son edgar disappeared upon the same pretense just at the same time and both have been missing ever since   emm and is this sufficient to authorize a positive assertion to the prejudice of a reputation which hitherto not slander itself has presumed to stain   flor ha ha ha not slander itself has presumed to stain ha ha ha mimicking her   emm aside o my heart what new insult am i doomed to suffer  you will excuse me sir if upon this occasion i take the liberty to tell you that your mirth is rather illtimed and    flor sir  do you know this fair lady that you are so much disposed to become her knight errant   emm aside i must be cautious or my zeal may discover me sir though i should not know her it is my point of honor never to suffer the reputation of the absent to be wantonly sported away upon mere circumstances and surmise   flor your point of honor  why to be sure all this is very fine but i will tell you a secret my dear  as unstained as you may think the fair emmelines reputation there is a certain humble servant of yours that shall be nameless who has some small reason to think that a certain piece of brittle ware which she had the keeping of may be a little cracked  or so   emm asidea wretch who never saw me but in this disguise  you are well acquainted with her then   flor why  i am    emm and pray what kind of woman is she   flor why she is a pretty  upon my word a very pretty wench   emm but is she tall or short or brown or fair   flor you have never seen her you say   emm no more than i do this moment   flor aside then i may venture  why she is fair tall and slender has a fine neck a very fine neck her limbs remarkably well turned her leg and ancle the finest i ever saw    emm distressed and confounded oh   flor aye  i thought i should set you a longing but come she is not to be had at present it seems so no more of her   emm i cannot so easily dismiss her as you may imagine and yet perhaps you may mistake the reason   flor very likely faith but what is it   emm why i am astonished that you make so light of what has happened to her whether you consider it as the loss of a mistress or whether as a misfortune to a woman you must be supposed to have loved and to whom you must have had obligations of the strongest and most tender kind one of these lights you must see it in   flor why my dear as to that i am extremely easy about losing her for between you and i  i could spare her i must indeed confess that i was very fond of her once but faith the obligations were all on her side  it is among ourselves   emm aside o my heart what a monstrous compound of vanity and lies is this  how so pray sir   flor why i used to meet her in her fathers park night after night at the risk of my life and egad what with the danger and what with the fatigue i grew tired of her and to tell you the truth provided her another lover to make good my retreat it is among ourselves   emm well said  and who was that sir   flor the very same edgar that she is now run away with i thought it would be a pretty thing for him for he is one of your fighting fellows that is never so happy as when he is in danger  but i am sorry he has been so indiscreet   emm pray sir  excuse me  i dont pretend to question the truth of what you say but there are some difficulties in the story that i should be glad to have cleared up  if you was so much in the lady emmelines good graces and had as you say no dislike to her person how came you not to think of marrying her such an alliance i presume would not have dishonored you  i shall confound him now aside   flor marrying her egad she knew a trick worth two othat i would have married her and i told her so my dear florimond says she  her arm was then lying negligently cross my shoulder thus  and she looked archly at me thus  my dear florimond says she why should you and i that have now only the power of making each other happy suffer a doting old priest to give us the power of making each other miserable if you were to be my husband you might cease to be my lover and then says she with a most roguish leer perhaps i might be tempted to take another you would tyrannize i should rebel you would enjoy nothing but the hope of breaking my heart and i should enjoy nothing but the hope of breaking yours   emm aside still still i draw upon myself more confusion  but why then did she run away with edgar that must ruin her schemes both of interest and pleasure   flor nay how the devil can i tell that   emmeline walks apart confused and embarrassd flor what in your reveries  thou art now musing on some vartuous love like an ever faithful lovyer tell death  ha ha ha  come come pshaw dont be a fool some kind wench now would cure you  egad what think you of elfrida  come along well call at her apartment perhaps she is dressing and we shall be admitted to her toilet upon my soul a fine figure of a woman a little masculine that is all but take my word for it a delicious morsel for all that  hark ye  if you are not sheepish she will not be coy it is among ourselves  i tell you as a friend faith i dont love to monopolize  i will just tickle up her fancy a little and leave you together come    emm pray sir    flor i will faith   emm i must insist    flor nay nay come along come along   lays hold of her emm sir i must absolutely be excused at present   flor why what a plague is it now that thou have taken into thy head   emm sir i have an affair that at present requires me to be alone which i cannot farther explain than    flor say no more say no more aside egad i have guessed it now  a challenge  why there is light enough for two people to cut one anothers throats by to be sure  i will away  well my dear if i must leave you to the dew and the moonshine i must but do you hear  faith i will to elfrida  will you follow me if you dont stay too long you will find an attendrissement that you may be obliged to your humble servant for that is all  it is among ourselves  adieu exit   emm why fare thee well thou  wretch without a name  what will what can become of me what is it that prompts this fool whom as i never knew i never could provoke to wrong me thus is it a sacrifice to his vanity or is it mere wantonness and sport  pray heaven this fairy dont deceive me  what shall i do  i must see her and take her counsel in this new distress  she takes off her ring and touches it thrice but the fairy does not appear ha  sure i dream  forlorn deserted  this perfidious goblin  again i touch it once  and twice  and thrice  and yet she is not here  o i could  but though i see her not she may be near me to hear and punish the complaints which her unkindness forces from me  to whom can i now ease my heart  o sacred friendship  but here i have no friend elfrida  yes she indeed as if by some secret sympathy claims my confidence and my heart tells me she deserves it  yes i will trust her with my secret she will be a witness for me against this slander and assist me with her advice exit   the scene changes to edgar s apartment and discovers him at a toilet dressing in the character of elfrida a woman attending edgar here give me the ribbons  get you gone  i will call you when i want you   woman aside this lady has the strangest humors   exit edgar was ever man in such ridiculous distress i am sure i never knew any thing like it since i was edgar the son of kent here have i had a young tempting girl fiddlefaddling about me these two hours to dress me forsooth  with an officious handiness so provoking that no virtue under that of a stockfish could endure it patiently yet an old woman upon these occasions i cannot bear and in short i can no longer bear a young one  it is my fate they say to be miserable if i dont get acquainted with the finest girl in england without wishing for her and i was told by a little goblin that started up before me after it had led me under the appearance of a jack of lantern into a wood that if i could spend the kings hunting month here in this disguise all would be right but how my being in petticoats should make me less likely to love a fine girl i cannot conceive a fine girl indeed may be less likely to love me but as to myself it is high time for me to get into breeches that i may get out of temptation here they flock about me  one sits down just before me and without any ceremony ties her garter  another gets me to adjust her tucker  i am the witness of so many pranks and the confidant of so many secrets then i have my hours of mortification too i am tormented by a swarm of profligate fops who try to debauch every woman they see with as little concern as they take snuff wretches who are as destitute of love as they are of virtue and have as little enjoyment as they have understanding and here i am obliged to mince and pish and fie  and affect to blush  sdeath when i am bursting with indignation and long to knock em down  i will bear it no longer   elfina suddenly appears from under the toilet and places herself before him edgar ha what again   elf again   edgar art thou my good or evil genius tell me   elf as you think me you shall find me   edgar i will think thee then my good genius for i would fain find thee so   elf you must trust me too or else    edgar trust you  look at the figure i make here and then judge if i have not trusted you   elf but your virtue must be tried   edgar tried  by what new torments would you try it have i not suffered the two worst things in nature temptation and suspense have not i    elf no  you have not persevered all is lost if you give out   edgar resolve my doubts then torment me no longer with suspense let me be certain of the event and i will be an anchorite in spite of this habit and all its works a month longer   elf well  observe me then and learn   edgar eagerly what shall i learn   elf patience edgar  fare thee well ha ha ha a machine rises under her and carries her away   edgar derided and forsaken  i doubt this is one of the wanton and mischievous elves that tantalize poor mortals for their own diversion however as i have played in the farce so long i will not stop in the last scene    enter woman woman maam here is my lord trifle has sent his compliments to your laaship and begs to know whether he shall have the honor of waiting upon your laaship to the ball   edgar recovering his female attitude and accent my compliments am much obliged to his lordship but am engaged   woman yes maam   edgar harkye    woman maam   edgar has gondibert called here this evening   woman no maam   edgar nor sent   woman no maam exit   edgar there is a man now who might atone for the vices of the whole sex i am so anxious to recommend myself to him even in this disguise and feel such a reluctance to do any thing that may disgust him even while he thinks me a woman that when he is present i labor to make my manner suit with my appearance i know not how by a kind of involuntary effort how strange is the rapidity with which some minds unite   enter woman woman maam there is count florimond   edgar did not i tell you    woman yes maam and i told him  but he said he knew your laaship was at home and that he must see you   edgar must see me   woman yes maam and though i told him your laaship was adressing yet he would follow me  o lord he is the strangest man  he is here an please your laaship    enter florimond edgar aside what a farce must i now act pray heaven it has not a tragical catastrophe   flor my dear goddess   edgar lard how can you be so monstrous rude  bursting into ones dressing room  and putting one into such flurries    he fumbles at pinning on a breastknot flor that your heart beats in concert with mine  the dear toilet is not more the altar of beauty than of love  permit me the honor maam of assisting to place that envied ornament on your bosom   edgar lard sir  i beg  not for the world  you quite confound me    flor pressing my life my angel    catches him hastily round the waist and endeavors to kiss him upon which edgar gives him a smart blow on the ear edgar nay then there is no expedient    flor retreating backward maam    edgar stamps and florimond starts and retreats farther back at the same time emmeline as gondibert appears at the door flor i protest maam  frighted   edgar sternly and i protest sir    flor maam i beg    edgar and i beg sir    flor turning and seeing gondibert o  maam your most humble servant going   emm aside to flor sir  i am under very great obligations to you  but i would not have you tickle up her fancy any more upon my account    flor duce take you  i wish you had been as near her as i was   is going but again stops and adjusts his wig by a pocket mirror edgar to emmeline recovering himself and adjusting his dress lord sir  i am in such a flurry  i i i i am very sorry i should have been provoked to any thing so unbecoming the delicacy of my sex   flor upon my soul so am i too  sir your humble servant exit   emm you have no reason to apologize for your indignation madam though your blow was something spirited i must confess   edg i am in such confusion sir  and he has made me such a figure  to treat me with indecent familiarities   emm dear madam compose yourself and think no more of him he has not been much better company to me than he has to you i will assure you   edgar lord sir you surprise me  pray what impertinence has he been guilty of to you   emm he has been filling my ears with scandal madam a subject which seems to be equally suitable both to his abilities and disposition he has been telling me that edgar    edgar who sir hastily   emm edgar madam the son of the earl of kent    edgar what of him sir  what scandal has he spread of edgar    emm aside ha so interested  she loves him sure   edgar let me conjure you sir if this wretch has said any thing to dishonor edgar you would tell it to me   emm aside it must be so  your very earnestness forbids me madam   edgar i know i am moved and you must think it strange   emm surprised at the masculine tone and manner into which his earnestness involuntarily betrays him strange indeed    edgar perhaps it is stranger still than you can think   emm your manner madam    edgar no matter  forms and modes become trifles too small for notice when they stand in competition with a friends good name   emm aside her love is to distraction  she frights me and is not to be trusted    edgar let me conjure you  tell me    emm i cannot tell you madam   edgar cannot   emm i ought not  trust me there are reasons  let it suffice that in the story i have heard a ladys honor is as much concerned as edgars that the slander cannot interest you more than me that i will do my utmost to make it is falsehood so notorious that it cannot be believed and i entreat that as you tender your peace you would as yet enquire no farther  i know myself not proof against your importunity and therefore you will excuse me if having no other way i save myself by flight exit   edgar runs out after her but returns edgar curse on this cumbersome habit i cannot overtake him was ever any thing so vexatious i have been defamed by some scandalous falsehood and i must do my honor justice  i can at a small expense of dissimulation get that wretch florimond to repeat to me all that he has told to gondibert i will do it  and i will as yet lie in ambush under this disguise to make sure of my blow   exit emmeline as gondibert reenters emm she is gone  what can i or what ought i to do if i had told her the story i must have discovered myself to convince her it could not be true but who knows what a jealous woman might have thought upon finding the very person who is said to have gone off with her lover in so strange a disguise  yet she will certainly contrive to hear it from florimond and then good heaven what will she suffer if i do not convince her that it is false  i must i will trust her  i have no other chance to save her but by making a discovery which if i had really gone off with edgar it is certain i should not have made especially to her but i must not intrude upon her now i will plant myself where i may intercept her before she can see florimond and trust to generous friendship for the event exit   end of the first act act ii scene i the terrace at windsor castle enter florimond with a letter flor aye  she was obliged to be angry because that fool gondibert appeared just in the critical minute at the door  pox take him  i might have known it was not natural by her overdoing it  it was indeed overdone with a vengeance but now she is in the pannicks lest i should resent it now she has something to say  and  if i am disengaged  she will be glad to meet me upon the terrace if i should humble her now and not meet her  but that would be cruel i will however take some state upon me  i will look a little formal it may save me some trouble in my future advances  here she comes   enter edgar still disguised as elfrida florimond receives him with an air of negligent haughtiness and makes a formal bow edgar sir i hope you will not take any advantage of my weakness    flor turning from her weakness pox on you  your weakness dont lie in your arm i am sure othat   edgar following or suppose sir that whatever reason i may have for desiring this meeting  what airs the wretch gives himself aside  i say sir that you would not suppose  i cannot contain myself    aside flor poor soul what confusion i will relax a little of my severity aside madam i will suppose nothing but that you have given me another opportunity of hearing your commands   edgar i think sir you was telling gondibert a certain affair between you and edgar and a lady and something that by his manner of telling it i could not very well understand   flor aside aye  a very good introduction  a lovestory is a most excellent prelude to a lovescene  i perceive we are to adjourn  why madam a certain fair lady called emmeline has thought fit to make edgar as happy as any man can be made except him madam whom you shall please to honor with the same favor  upon my soul she is a fine creature   edgar sir your compliments really put me so out of countenance  that i shall blush to death    flor your blushes are so becoming madam that    edgar give me leave sir to entreat that you would at present spare my confusion and tell me all the particulars of that affair which have come to your knowledge   flor aye  she wants a luscious description now aside why madam i presume that edgar being fired with the charms of emmeline first gazed languishingly upon her caught her eyes the first time they were casually turned upon him when in a soft confusion she hastily turned her look downward and blushed he took her hand first pressing it gently in his own then raising it to his lips then madam i presume he might proceed to    edgar sir  i shall certainly be out of patience and knock him down aside  sir if you have any desire to oblige me  or have any expectations sir of favors  not sir that i    flor my dear angel keep me no longer in suspense let me know your commands that i may fulfill the condition of  pressing   edgar drawing back hold sir  you must then without farther delay or interruption give me a direct answer to a few short questions   flor why madam it shall then be in your own way   edgar first then sir are you acquainted with edgar the young heir of kent   flor why madam to proceed implicitly as you direct i believe there are few persons who know more of that gentleman than your humble servant   edgar aside matchless impudence  and pray sir what kind of a youth is he   flor aside i see by her curiosity she dont know him  why madam the youth is a a a rather soft  a green youth madam as we say    edgar sir these are terms that i do not perfectly comprehend and therefore i beg you would be more explicit   flor why then explicitly madam he is upon my soul a shallow fellow  a very shallow fellow faith  it is among ourselves   edgar he is   flor he is indeed madam  the poor devil has some awkward good nature and i have a kindness for him but between you and i he will never be so much a man of honor as i could wish him    edgar forgetting his feminine character and running up to him how villain    flor frighted and drawing back maam    edgar aside what have i done he draws himself again into form to think of villainy in people that by their rank are set up as examples to others quite transports me out of myself  heigh ho  it has quite overcome me   affects to be faint and takes out a smelling bottle flor aside what a terrible virago it is  may i presume madam to lend you my hand   approaching cautiously edgar it is over sir   i am so subject to flurries  and my poor nerves are so shattered  i am extremely obliged to you for this character of edgar  to have been guilty of any thing base    flor very base i assure you madam   edgar sir  assuming a fierce masculine air but instantly correcting himself   flor maam  starting back fore gad she is mad  and upon my soul in my opinion damnably mischievous aside    edgar give me leave sir  as well as i am able  to ask you what in particular has  but i see company coming  if we walk this way we shall avoid them   flor aside avoid them  heaven forbid  perhaps madam another time    edgar sir i shall die if my curiosity is not gratified   flor madam  at present i am    edgar sir i beg  for my reputation that we may not be surpised together while i am in this disorder   flor by no means madam  let us part this moment  if you will go off one way i will go the other   edgar o not for the world  to be seen to part hastily upon being observed together would be the subject of eternal scandal  let me

interest in edgar appear to him but love  and if it had been so how must i have been hurt by what he had to tell me  but he is not less interested in the lady  so he said  sure then he is to emmeline what he thought edgar was to me  let me then repay his generous kindness let me discover not only what but who i am to convince him that the tale is false which if true must destroy his peace going up to emmeline  you need not shun me sir i have now nothing to ask that you would wish to conceal i have only to request that you would forgive me for having violated your injunction not to satisfy the curiosity you had raised i am apprized of your kind your generous motive and it has inspired my breast with all that it is possible i should feel for you a grateful and ardent friendship   emm your love madam i make no doubt is fixed on a much nobler and more deserving object  edgar i presume    edgar my connection with edgar sir is indeed in some sense the reason why your merit cannot make an impression which i am not ashamed to say it might otherwise have done and yet sir let me confess that i am not affected by the story of his disappearing with emmeline as you might reasonably imagine because i know for certain that it cannot be true   emm hastily ha that it cannot be true    edgar i now owe your friendship a discovery if indeed it is a discovery which i was prompted by mere regard to myself to have made before i think there is a connection between you and emmeline that    emm there is indeed a connection madam  a secret which you convince me it is now in vain to affect to hide    edgar let me then claim it  but let me first as a pledge of that friendship which i hope shall end but with our lives give for your secret mine    emm do then nor keep me longer in suspense for still the more we talk the more i am perplexed aside what can her secret be   edgar why then in the first place sir  i am  a man    emm aside with great emotion which she labors to conceal a man  good heaven what will become of me   edgar and now let me at once embrace you as a friend punctilios and forms no longer part us    as edgar advances eagerly to emmeline she hides her face and appears in great confusion edgar hastily what ails my friend   emm o you have ruined all my pleasing project  prevented  but no matter    edgar this is amazing for heavens sake what do you mean  you was not sure enamoured of my person    emm o no  you still mistake    edgar then tell me my mistake for we may now converse on even terms our hearts may now be opened to each other without the forms and the reserve prescribed in friendships with the softer sex   emm o still you wander wide and wider still  i cannot speak    edgar you must  there is a secret which but now your heart was ready to reveal    emm and then i thought it known  but now    edgar now my warm heart has claimed you for my friend    emm and now to tell it is impossible  i cannot tell it  and if i could you would not find the friendship that you hope   edgar looks earnestly at her wondering and embarrassd aside i sicken at his sight  oh my heart   edgar i am all perplexity and wonder  your color comes and goes like a sick girls  she becomes more confused as he marks her confusion  you tremble  heavens he faints  he catches her in his arms and discovers her breast by all my wonder and my joy a woman  how lovely her confusion  o let my bosom warm thee back to life look up and trust the honor of my love you shall not whisper what you would conceal nor will i seem to know it   she recovers emm o let me hide me from myself  my sex thus known  in this disguise where shall my conscious blushes find a veil  who are you tell me that i may hide me from your sight for ever   edgar o no  on that condition let me never be known   emm yet tell me  trust me    edgar trust thee yes with my life i would trust thee thy friend  o know me by a softer name  is kents young heir that edgar you have heard so falsely and so wantonly traduced   emm still wonders crowd on wonders   edgar i dream myself or this is all enchantment   emm so might you think indeed if more you knew me   edgar let me then know thee more whom now i know as the most fair and gentle of thy sex whom yet i saw and loved without desire  my pledge of happiness  may i be thine  but yet i rave  thy fate was not like edgars    emm spare me  thy words have power which yet thou know not   edgar o take me from the rack my thoughts grow wild  there is indeed a maid whose fate i have heard was such as mine  that emmeline  o heaven that emmeline in whom i thought thy interest love  o yes it must it shall  thou thou art she   emm leave me or i shall die with my confusion    edgar let me support thee hide thee in my breast where thou shall breathe thy answer in a sigh  art thou not emmeline my fated love   emm if emmeline be thy fated love  i am    edgar still let me clasp thee close and closer still calm all the tumults of thy feeling mind and sooth thee into confidence by love   emm no let me now retire for in this dress i cannot bear to see myself or you   edgar yet stay  forgive the violence i do you  my fame and yours are wantonly traduced it is fit that we do justice to them both and punish the traducer   emm he is not worth resentment   edgar he is for others sakes though not his own  i have a thought would emmeline but join    emm tell me then quickly   edgar send him a challenge in behalf of emmeline as gondibert and meet him not as gondibert but emmeline i will take care to be present not as elfrida but edgar he will then be selfconvicted as a liar by knowing neither of the persons he has defamed and we may farther punish him as we please   emm well i will try at this but now dismiss me she breaks from his hand and runs off   edgar farewell my love  how has the hand of heaven vouchsafed to guide me through all the mazes of my fate to bliss even my revenge my justice rather upon that wretch whose very folly is envenomed shall be complete  but a mind so base can never be brave  suppose he should not come  he is here   enter florimond seeing edgar he stops short flor gad take me  this damned madwoman is certainly fated to be my death   edgar advances toward him he draws back and looks frighted edgar sir i am so shocked when i reflect upon the indecorums that my passions have made me guilty of to you

against me i beseech you to let me know it  looking about perhaps we had better change our ground some villain may be taking aim at me as i stand   edgar you need not be under such apprehensions sir it is a matter of no consequence  it is only that gondibert is to send you a challenge for the liberty you have taken with lady emmeline that is all    flor oh if it is only an intention of gondibert to cut my throat to be sure that is a matter of no consequence  a bloodyminded ruffian aside   edgar why sir to my certain knowledge gondibert knows no more of a sword than a girl of eighteen and has not a grain more courage   flor taking courage why as to that madam    edgar as to that sir i am confident it would make no difference to you but as i know he will not fight and only presumes upon an insolent opinion that count florimonds courage is as questionable as his own    flor blustering how madam   edgar lard sir if you are so violent i shall certainly fall into my tremors  i shall
