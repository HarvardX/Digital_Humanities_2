the two shoemakers jack brown and james stock were two lads apprenticed at nearly the same time to mr williams a shoemaker in a small town in oxfordshire they were pretty near the same age but of very different characters and dispositions  brown was eldest son to a farmer in good circumstances who gave the usual apprentice fee with him being a wild giddy boy whom his father could not well manage or instruct in farming he thought it better to send him out to learn a trade at a distance than to let him idleabout at home for jack always preferred birdsnesting and marbles to any other employment and would trifle away half the day when his father thought he was at school with any boys he could meet with who were as idle as himself and never could be prevailed upon to do or to learn any thing while a game at taw could be had for love or money all this time his little brothers much younger than himself were beginning to follow the plough or to carry the corn to mill as soon as they were able to mount a carthorse  jack however who was a lively boy and did not naturally want either sense or goodnature might have turned out well enough if he had not had the misfortune to be his mothers favorite she concealed and forgave all his faults  to be sure he was a little wild the would say but he would not make the worse man for that for jack had a good spirit of his own and she would not have it broke and so make a mope of the boy the farmer for a quiet life as it is called gave up all these points to his wife and with them gave up the future virtue and happiness of his child he was a laborious and industrious man but he had no religion he thought only of the gains and advantages of the present day and never took the future into the account his wife managed him entirely and as she was really notable he did not trouble his head about any thing farther if she had been careless in her dairy he would have stormed and sworn but as she only ruined one child by indulgence and almost broke the hearts of the rest by unkindness he gave himself little concern about the matter the cheese certainly was good and that indeed is a great point but she was neglectful of her children and a tyrant to her servants her husbands substance indeed was not wasted but his happiness was not consulted his house it is true was not dirty but it was the abode of fury illtemper and covetousness and the farmer though he did not care for drink was too often driven to the publickhouse in an evening because his own was neither neither quiet nor comfortable the mother was always scolding and the children were always crying  jack however notwithstanding his idleness picked up a little reading and writing but never would learn to cast an account that was too much labor his mother was desirous he should continue at school not so much for the sake of his learning which she had not sense enough to value but to save her darling from the fatigue of labor for if he had not gone to school she knew he must have gone to work and she thought the former was the least tiresome of the two indeed this foolish woman had such an opinion of his genius that she used from a child to think he was too wise for any thing but a person and hoped she should live to see him one she did not wish to see her son a minister because she loved either learning or goodness but because she thought it would make jack a gentleman and set him above his brothers  farmer brown still hoped that though jack was likely to make but an idle and ignorant farmer yet he might make no bad tradesman when he should be removed from the indulgences of a fathers house and from a silly mother whose fondness kept him back in every thing this woman was enraged when she found that so fine a scholar as she took jack to be was to be put apprentice to a shoemaker the farmer however for the first time in his life would have his own way but being a worldly man and too apt to mind only what is falsely called the main chance instead of being careful to look out for a sober prudent and religious master for his son he left all that to accident as if it had been a thing of little or no consequence this is a very common fault and fathers who are guilty of it are in a great measure answerable for the future sins and errors of their children when they grow up in the world and set up for themselves if a man gives his son a good education a good example and a good master it is indeed possible that the son may not turn out well but it does not often happen and when it does the father has no blame resting on him and it is a great point toward a mans comfort to have his conscience quiet in that respect however god may think fit to overruled events  the farmer however took care to desire his friends to inquire for a shoemaker who had good business and was a good workman and the mother did not forget to put in her word and desired that it might be one who was not too strict for jack had been brought up tenderly was a meek boy and could not bear to be contradicted in any thing and this is the common notion of meekness among people who know no better  mr williams was recommended to the farmer as being the best shoemaker in the town in which he lived and far from a strict master and without farther enquiries to mr williams he went  james stock who was the son of an honest labourer in the next village was bound out by the parish in consideration of his father having so numerous a family that he was not able to put him out himself james was in every thing the very reverse of his new companion he was a modest industrious pious youth and though so poor and the child of a labourer was a much better scholar than jack who was a wealthy farmers son his father had it is true been able to give him but very little schooling for he was obliged to be put to work when quite a child when very young he used to run of errands for mr thomas the curate of the parish a very kindhearted young gentleman who boarded next door to his fathers cottage he used also to rub down and saddle his horse and do any other little job for him in the most civil obliging manner all this so recommended him to the clergyman that he would often send for him in of an evening after he had done his days work in the field and condescended to teach him himself to write and cast accounts as well as to instruct him in the principles of his religion it was not merely out of kindness for the little goodnatured services james did him that he showed him this favor but also for his readiness in the catechism and his devout behavior at church  the first thing that drew the ministers attention to this boy was the following  he had frequently given him halfpence and pence for holding his horse and carrying him to water before he was big enough to be further useful to him on christmas day he was surprised to see james at church reading out of a handsome new prayer book he wondered how he came by it for he knew there was nobody in the parish likely to have given it to him for at that time there were no sunday schools and the father could not afford it he was sure  well james said he as he saw him when they came out you made a good figure at church today it made you look like a man and a christian not only to have so handsome a book but to be so ready in all parts of the service how came you by that book james owned modestly that he had been a whole year saving up the money by single halfpence all of which had been of the ministers own giving and that in all that time he had not spent a single farthing on his own diversions my dear boy said good mr thomas i am much mistaken if thou do not turn out well in the world for two reasons  first from thy saving turn and selfdenying temper and next because thou did devote the first eighteenpence thou wast ever worth in the world to so good a purpose  james bowed and blushed and from that time mr thomas began to take more notice of him and to instruct him as i said above as james grew soon able to do him more considerable service he would now and then give him sixpence this he constantly saved till it became a little sum with which he bought shoes and stockings well knowing that his poor father with a hard family and low wages could not buy them for him as to what little money he earned himself by his daily labor in the field he constantly carried it to his mother every saturday night to buy bread for the family which was a pretty help to them  as james was not overstout in his make his father thankfully accepted the offer of the parish officers to bind his son out to a trade this good man however had not like farmer brown the liberty of choosing a master for his son or he would carefully have enquired if he was a proper man to have the care of youth but williams the shoemaker was already fixed on by those who were to put the boy out and if he wanted a master it must be him or none for the overseers had a better opinion of williams than he deserved and thought it would be the making of the boy to go to him the father knew that beggars must not be choosers so he fitted out james for his new place having indeed little to give him besides his blessing  the worthy mr thomas however kindly gave him an old coat and waistcoat which his mother who was a neat and notable woman contrived to make up for him herself without a farthing expense and when it was turned and made fit for his size it made him a very handsome suit for sundays and lasted him a couple of years  and here let me stop to remark what a pity it is that poor women so seldom are able or willing to do these sort of little handy jobs themselves and that they do not oftener bring up their daughters to be more useful in family work they are great losers by it every way not only as they are disqualifying their girls from making good wives hereafter but they are losers in point of present advantage for gentlefolks could much oftener afford to give a poor boy a jacket or a waistcoat if it was not for the expense of making it which adds very much to the cost to my certain knowledge many poor women would often get an old coat or bit of coarse new cloth given them to fit out a boy if the mothers or sisters were known to be able to cut it out to advantage and to make it decently themselves but halfacrown for the making a bit of kersey which costs but a few shillings is more than many very charitable gentry can afford to give  so they often give nothing at all when they see the mothers so little able to turn it to advantage it is hoped they will take this hint kindly as it is meant for their good  but to return to our two young shoemakers they were both now settled at mr williamss who as he was known to be a good workman had plenty of business he had sometimes two or three journeymen but no apprentices but jack and james  jack who with all his faults was a keen smart boy took to learn the trade quick enough but the difficulty was to make him stick two hours together to his work at every noise he heard in the street down went the work  the last one way the upper leather another the sole dropped on the ground and the thread he dragged after him all the way up the street if a blind fiddler a ballad singer a mountebank a dancing bear or a drum were heard at a distance  out ran jack  nothing could stop him and not a stitch more could he be prevailed on to do that day every duty every promise was forgot for the present pleasure  he could not resist the smallest temptation  he never stopped for a moment to consider whether a thing was right or wrong but whether he liked it or disliked it and as his illjudging mother took care to send him privately a good supply of pocketmoney that deadly bane to all youthful virtue he had generally a few pence ready to spend and to indulge in the present diversion whatever it was and what was still worse even than spending his money he spent his time too or rather his masters time of this he was continually reminded by james to whom he always answered what have you to complain about it is nothing to you or any one else i spend nobodys money but my own  that may be replied the other but you cannot say it is your own time that you spend he insisted upon it that it was but james fetched down their indentures and there showed him that he had solemnly bound himself by that instrument not to waste his masters property now quoth james thy own time is a very valuable part of thy masters property to this he replied every ones time was his own and he should not sit moping all day over his last  for his part he thanked god he was no parish prentice  james did not resent this piece of foolish impertinence as some silly lads would have done nor fly out into a violent passion for even at this early age he had begun to learn of him who was meek and lowly of heart and therefore when he was reviled he reviled not again on the contrary he was so very kind and gentle that even jack vain and idle as he was could not help loving him though he took care never to follow his advice  jacks fondness for his boyish and silly diversions in the street soon produced the effects which might naturally be expected and the same idleness which led him to fly out into the town at the sound of a fiddle or the sight of  puppetshow soon led him to those places where all these fiddles and shows naturally lead i mean the alehouse the acquaintance picked up in the street was carried on at the greyhound and the idle pastimes of the boy soon led to the destructive vices of the man  as he was not an illtempered youth nor naturally much given to drink a sober and prudent master who had been steady in his management and regular in his own conduct who had recommended good advice by a good example might have made something of jack but i am sorry to say that mr williams though a good workman and not a very hard or severe master was neither a sober nor a steady man  so far from it that he spent much more time at the greyhound than at home there was no order either in his shop or family he left the chief care of the business to his two young apprentices and being but a worldly man he was at first disposed to show favor to jack much more than to james because he had more money and his father was better in the world than the father of poor james  at first therefore he was disposed to consider james as a sort of drudge who was to do all the menial work of the family and he did not care how little he taught him of his trade with mrs williams the matter was still worse she constantly called him away from the business of his trade to wash the house nurse the child turn the spit or run of errands and here i must remark that though parish apprentices are bound in duty to be submissive to both master and mistress and always to make themselves as useful as they can in a family and to be civil and humble yet on the other hand it is the duty of masters always to remember that if they are paid for instructing them in their trade they ought conscientiously to instruct them in it and not to employ them the greater part of their time in such household or other drudgery as to deprive them of the opportunity of acquiring their trade  mr williams soon found out that his favorite jack would be of little use to him in the shop for though he worked well enough he did not care how little he did nor could he be of the least use to his master in keeping an account or writing out a bill upon occasion for as he never could be made to learn to cipher he did not know addition from multiplication  one day one of the customers called at the shop in a great hurry and desired his bill might be made out that minute mr williams having taken a cup too much made several attempts to put down a clear account but the more he tried the less he found himself able to do it james who was sitting at his last rose up and with great modesty asked his master if he would please to give him leave to make out the bill saying that though but a poor scholar he would do his best rather than keep the gentleman waiting williams gladly accepted his offer and confused as his head was with liquor he yet was able to observe with what neatness dispatch and exactness the account was drawn out from that time he no longer considered james as a drudge but as one fitted for the higher employments of the trade and he was now regularly employed to manage the accounts with which all the customers were so well pleased that it contributed greatly to raise him in his masters esteem for there were now never any of those blunders or false charges for which the shop had before been so famous  james went on in a regular course of industry and soon became the best workman mr williams had but there were many things in the family which he greatly disapproved some of the journeymen used to swear drink and sing very licentios songs all these things were a great grief to his sober mind he complained to his master who only laughed at him and indeed as williams did the same himself he put it out of his own power to correct his servants if he had been so disposed james however used always to reprove them with great mildness indeed but with great seriousness also this but still more his own excellent example produced at length very good effects on such of the men as were not quite hardened in sin  what grieved him most was the manner in which the sunday was spent the master lay in bed all the morning nor did the mother or her children ever go to church except there was some new finery to be shown or a christening to be attended the towns people were coming to the shop all the morning for work which should have been sent home the night before had not the master been at the alehouse and what wounded james to the very soul was that the master expected the two apprentices to carry home shoes to the country customers on the sunday morning which he wickedly thought was a saving of time as it prevented their hindering their work on the saturday these shameful practices greatly afflicted poor james he begged his master with tears in his eyes to excuse him but he only laughed at his squeamish conscience as he called it  jack did not dislike this part of the business and generally after he had delivered his parcel wasted good part of the day in nutting playing at fives or dropping in at the publichouse any thing was better than going to church  james on the other hand when he was compelled sorely against his conscience to carry home any goods of a sunday morning always got up as soon as it was light knelt down and prayed heartily to god to forgive him a sin which it was not in his power to avoid he took care not to lose a moment by the way but as he was taking his walk with the utmost speed to leave his shoes with the customers he spent his time in endeavoring to keep up good thoughts in his mind and praying that the day might come when his conscience might be delivered from this grievous burden he was now particularly thankful that mr thomas had formerly taught him so many psalms and chapters which he used to repeat in these walks with great devotion  he always got home before the rest of the family was up dressed himself very clean and went twice to church and as he greatly disliked the company and practices of his masters house particularly on the sabbath day he preferred spending his evening alone reading his bible which i forgot to say the worthy clergyman had given him when he left his native village sunday evening which is to some people such a burden was to james the highest holiday he had formerly learnt a little how to sing a psalm of the clerk of his own parish and this was now become a very delightful part of his evening exercise and as will simpson one of the journeymen by james advice and example was now beginning to be of a more serious way of thinking he often asked him to sit an hour with him when they read the bible and talked it over together in a manner very pleasant and improving and as will was a famous singer a psalm or two sung together was a very innocent pleasure  jamess good manners and civility to the customers drew much business to the shop and his skill as a workman was so great that every one desired his shoes might be made by james williams grew so very idle and negligent that he now totally neglected his affairs and to hard drinking added deep gaming all jamess care both of the shop and the accounts could not keep things in any tolerable order he represented to his master that they were growing worse and worse and exhorted him if he valued his credit as a tradesman his comfort as a husband and father his character as a master and his soul as a christian to turn over a new leaf williams swore a great oath that he would not be restrained in his pleasures to please a canting parish prentice nor to humor a parcel of squalling brats  that let people say what they would of him they should never say he was a hypocrite and as long as they could not call him that he did not care what else they called him  in a violent passion he immediately went to the greyhound where he now spent not only every evening which he had long done but good part of the day and night also his wife was very dressy extravagant and fond of company and spent at home as fast as her husband did abroad so that all the neighbors said if it had not been for james his master must have broke long ago but they were sure he could not hold it much longer  as jack brown sung a good song and played many diverting tricks williams liked his company and often allowed him to make one at the greyhound where he would laugh heartily at his stories so that every one thought jack was much the greater favorite  so he was a companion in frolic and foolery and pleasure as it is called but he would not trust him with an inch of leather or sixpence in money no no  when business was to be done or trust was to be reposed james was the man the idle and the drunken never trust one another if they have common sense they like to laugh and sing and riot and drink together but when they want a friend a counselor a help in business or in trouble they go farther afield and williams while he would drink with jack would trust james with untold gold and even was foolishly tempted to neglect his business the more from knowing that he hd one who was taking care of it  in spite of all jamess care and diligence however things were growing worse and worse the more james saved the more his master and mistress spent one morning just as the shop was opened and james had set every body to their respective work and he himself was settling the business for the day he found that his master was not yet come from the greyhound as this was now become a common case he only grieved but did not wonder at it while he was indulging sad thoughts on what would be the end of all this in ran the tapster from the greyhound out of breath and with a look of terror and dismay desired james would step over to the publichouse with him that moment for that his master wanted him  james went immediately surprised at this unusual message when he got into the kitchen of the publichouse which he now entered for the first time in his life though it was just opposite the house in which he lived he was shocked at the beastly disgusting appearance of every thing he beheld there was a table covered with tankards punchbowls broken glasses pipes and dirty gresy packs of cards and all over wet with liquor the floor was strewed with broken earthen cups odd cards and an eo table shivered to pieces in a quarrel behind the table stood a crowd of dirty fellows with matted locks hollow eyes and faces smeared with tobacco james made his way after the tapster through this wretched looking crew to a settle which stood in the chimney corner not a word was uttered but the silent horror seemed to denote something more than a mere common drunken bout  what was the dismay of james when he saw his miserable master stretched out on the settle in all the agonies of death he had fallen into a fit after having drank hard best part of the night and seemed to have but a few minutes to live in his frightful countenance was displayed the dreadful picture of sin and death for he struggled at once under the guilt of intoxication and the pangs of a dying man he recovered his senses for a few moments and called out to ask if his faithful servant was come james went up to him took him by his cold hand but was too much moved to speak oh james james cried he in a broken voice pray for me comfort me james spoke kindly to him but was too honest to give him false comfort as is too often done by mistaken friends in these dreadful moments  james said he i have been a bad master to you  you would have saved my soul and body but i would not let you  i have ruined my wife my children and my own soul take warning oh take warning by my miserable end said he to his stupefied companions but none were able to attend to him but james who bid him lift up his heart to god and prayed heartily for him himself oh said the dying man it is too late too late for me  but you have still time said he to the halfdrunken terrified crew around him where is jack jack brown came forward but was too much frightened to speak o wretched boy said he i fear i shall have the ruin of thy soul as well as my own to answer for stop short  take warning  now in the days of thy youth o james james thou do not pray for me death is dreadful to the wicked  o the sting of death to a guilty conscience  here he lifted up his ghastly eyes in speechless horror grasped hard the hand of james gave a deep hollow groan and closed his eyes never to open them but in an awful eternity  this was death in all its honors the gay companions of his sinful pleasures could not stand the sight all slunk away like guilty thieves from their late favorite friend  no one was left to assist him but his two apprentices brown was not so hardened but that he shed many tears for his unhappy master and even made some hasty resolutions of amendment which were too soon forgotten  while brown stepped home to call the workmen to come and assist in removing their poor master james staid alone with the corpse and employed those awful moments in indulging the most serious thoughts and prayed heartily to god that so terrible a lesson might not be thrown away upon him but that he might be enabled to live in a constant state of preparation for death the resolutions he made at this moment as they were not made in his own strength but in an humble reliance on gods gracious help were of use to him as long as he lived and if ever he was for a moment tempted to say or do a wrong thing the remembrance of his poor dying masters last agonies and the dreadful words he uttered always instantly checked him  when williams was buried and his affairs came to be enquired into they were found to be in a sad condition his wife indeed was the less to be pitied as she had contributed her full share to the common ruin james however did pity her and by his skill in accounts his known honesty and the trust the creditors put in his word things came to be settled rather better than mrs williams expected  both brown and james were now within a month or two of being out of their time the creditors as was said before employed james to settle his late masters accounts which he did in a manner so creditable to his abilities and his honesty that they proposed to him to take the shop himself he assured them it was utterly out of his power for want of money as the creditors had not the least fear of being repaid if it should please god to spare his life they generously agreed among themselves to advance him a small sum of money without any security but his bond for this he was to pay a very reasonable interest and to return the whole in a given number of years james shed tears of gratitude at this testimony to his character and could hardly be prevailed on to accept their kindness so great was his dread of being in debt  he took the remainder of the lease from his mistress and in settling affairs with her took care to make every thing as advantageous to her as possible he never once allowed himself to think how unkind she had been to him he only saw in her the needy widow of his deceased master and the distressed mother of an infant family and was heartily sorry it was not in his power to contribute to their support it was not only his duty but his delight to return good for evil  for he was a christian  james stock was now by the blessing of god on his own earnest endeavors master of a considerable shop and was respected by the whole town for his prudence honesty and piety how he behaved in his new station and also what befell his comrade brown must be the subject of another book and i hope my readers will look forward with some impatience for some further account of this worthy young man in the mean time other apprentices will do well to follow so praiseworthy an example and to remember that the respectable master of a large shop and a profitable business was raised to that creditable situation without money friends or connections from the low beginning of a parish prentice by sobriety industry the fear of god and an obedience to the divine principles of the christian religion  part ii the apprentice turned master the first part of this history left off with the dreadful sudden death of williams the idle shoemaker who died in a drunken fit at the greyhound it also showed how james stock hisfaithful apprentice by his honest and upright behavior so gained the love and respect of his late masters creditors that they set him up in business though he was not worth a shilling of his own such is the power of a good character and when we last parted from him he had just got possession of his masters shop  this sudden prosperity was a time of trial for james who as he was now become a creditable tradesman i shall hereafter think proper to call mr james stock i say this sudden rise in life was a time of trial for we hardly know what we are ourselves till we become our own masters there is indeed always a reasonable hope that a good servant will not make a bad master and that a faithful apprentice will prove an honest tradesman but the heart of man is deceitful and some folks who seem to behave very well while they are under subjection no sooner get a little power than their heads are turned and they grow prouder than those who are gentlemen born they forget at once that they were lately poor and dependent themselves so that one would think that with their poverty they had lost their memory too i have known some who had suffered most hardships in their early days become the most hard and oppressive in their turn so that they seem to forget that fine considerate reason which god gives to the children of israel why they should be merciful to their servants remembering says he that thou thyself wast a bondsman  young mr stock did not so forget himself he had indeed the only sure guard from falling into this error it was not from any easiness in his natural disposition for that only just serves to make folks goodnatured when they are pleased and patient when they have nothing to vex them james went upon higher ground he brought his religion into all his actions he did not give way to abusive language because he knew it was a sin he did not use his apprentices ill because he knew he had a master in heaven  he knew he owed his present happy situation to the kindness of the creditors but did he grow easy and careless because he had such friends no indeed he worked with double diligence in order to get out of debt and to let these friends see he did not abuse their kindness such behavior as this is the greatest encouragement in the world to rich people to lend a little money it creates friends and it keeps them  his shoes and boots were made in the best manner this got him business he set out with a rule to tell no lies and deceive no customers this secured his business he had two reasons for not promising to send home goods when he knew he should not be able to keep his word the first because he knew a lie was a sin the next because it was a folly there is no credit sooner worn out than that which is got by false pretenses after a little while no one is deceived by them falsehood is so soon found out that i believe most tradesmen are the poorer for it in the long run deceit is the worst part of a shopkeepers stock in trade  james was now at the head of a family this is a serious situation said he to himself one fine summers evening as he stood leaning over the half door of his shop to enjoy a little fresh air i am now master of a family my cares are doubled and so are my duties i see the higher one gets in life the more one has to answer for let me now call to mind the sorrow i used to feel when i was made to carry work home on a sunday by an ungodly master and let me now keep the resolutions i then formed  so what his heart found right to do he resolved to do quickly and he set out at first as he meant to go on the sunday was truly a day of rest at mr stocks he would not allow a pair of shoes to be given out on that day to oblige the best customer he had and what did he lose by it why nothing for when the people were once used to it they liked saturday night just as well but had it been otherwise he would have given up his gains to his conscience  showing how mr stock behaved to his apprentices when he got up in the world so far as to have apprentices he thought himself as accountable for their behavior as if they had been his children he was very kind to them and had a cheerful merry way of talking to them so that the lads who had seen too much of swearing reprobate masters were very fond of him they were never afraid of speaking to him they told him all their little troubles and considered their master as their best friend for they said they would do any thing for a good word and a kind look as he did not swear at them when they had been guilty of a fault they did not lie to him to conceal it and thereby make one fault two but though he was very kind he was very watchful also for he did not think neglect any part of kindness he brought them to a very pretty method which was on a sunday evening to divert themselves with writing out half a dozen texts of scripture in a pretty copybook with gilt covers you may have the same at any of the stationers they do not cost above four pence and will last nearly a year  when the boys carried him their books he justly commended him whose texts were written in the fairest hand and now my boys said he let us see which of you will learn your texts best in the course of the week he who ds shall choose for next sunday thus the boys soon got many psalms and chapters by heart almost without knowing how they came by them he taught them how to make a practical use of what they learnt for said he it will answer little purpose to learn texts if we do not try to live up to them one of the boys being apt to play in his absence and to run back again to his work when he heard his masters step he brought him to a sense of his fault by the last sundays text which happened to be the  th of ephesians he showed him what was meant by being obedient to his master in singleness of heart as unto christ and explained to him with so much kindness what it was not to work with eyeservice as men pleasers but doing the will of god from the heart that the lad said he should never forget it and it did more toward curing him of idleness than the soundest horsewhipping would have done  how mr stock got out of debt stocks behavior was very regular and he was much beloved for his kind and peaceable temper he had also a good reputation for skill in his trade and his industry was talked of through the whole town so that he had soon more work than he could possibly do he paid all his dealers to the very day and took care to carry his interest money to the creditors the moment it became due in two or three years he was able to begin to pay off a small part of the principal his reason for being so eager to pay money as soon as it became due was this  he had observed tradesmen and especially his old master put of the day off payment as long as they could even though they had the means in their power this deceived them for having money in their pockets they forgot it belonged to the creditor and not to themselves and so got to fancy they were rich when they were really poor this false notion led them to indulge in idle expenses whereas if they had paid regularly they would have had this one temptation the less a young tradesman when he is going to spend money should at least ask himself whether this money is his own or his creditors this little question might help to prevent many a bankruptcy  a true christian always goes heartily to work to find out what is his besetting sin and when he has found it which he easily may if he looks sharp against this sin he watches narrowly now i know it is the fashion among some folks and a bad fashion it is to fancy that good people have no sin but this only shows their ignorance it is not true that good man st paul knew better see romans vii  and when men do not own their sins it is not because there is no sin in their hearts but because they are not anxious to search for it nor humble to confess it nor penitent to mourn over it but this was not the case with james stock examine yourselves truly said he is no bad part of the catechism he began to be afraid that his desire of living creditably and without being a burden to any one might under the mask of honesty and independence lead him into pride and covetousness he feared that the bias of his heart lay that way so instead of being proud of his sobriety instead of bragging that he never spent his money idly nor went to the alehouse instead of boasting how hard he worked and how he denied himself he strove in secret that even these good qualities might not grow out of a wrong root the following event was of use to him in the way of indulging any disposition to covetousness  one evening as he was standing at the door of his shop a poor dirty boy without stockings and shoes came up and asked him for a bit of broken victuals for he had eaten nothing all day in spite of his dirt and rags he was a very pretty lively civil spoken boy and mr stock could not help thinking he knew something of his face he fetched him out a good piece of bread and cheese and while the boy was devouring it asked him if he had no parents and why he went about in that vagabond manner daddy has been dead some years said the boy he died in a fit over at the greyhound mammy says he used to live at this shop and then we did not want for clothes nor victuals neither stock was melted almost to tears on finding this dirty beggarboy was tommy williams the son of his old master he blessed god on comparing his own happy condition with that of this poor destitute child but he was not proud at the comparison and while he was thankful for his own prosperity he pitied the helpless boy  where have you been living of late said he to him for i understand you all went home to your mothers friends  so we did sir said the boy but they are grown tired of maintaining us because they said that mammy spent all the money which should have gone to buy victuals for us on snuff and drams and so they have sent us back to this place which is daddys parish  and where do you live here said mr stock  o sir we are all put into the parish poorhouse  and does your mother do any thing to help to maintain you  no sir for mammy says she was not brought up to work like poor folks and she would rather starve than spin or knit so she lies abed all the morning and sends us about to pick up what we can a bit of victuals or a few halfpence  and have you any money in your pocket now  yes sir i have got three halfpence which i have begged today  then as you were so very hungry how came you not to buy a roll at that bakers over the way  because sir i was going to lay it out in tea for mammy for i never lay out a farthing for myself indeed mammy says she will have her tea twice a day if we beg or starve for it  can you read my boy said mr stock a little sir and say my prayers too  and can you say your catechism  i have almost forgot it all sir though i remember about honoring my father and mother and that makes me still carry the halfpence home to mammy instead of buying cakes  who taught you these good things  one jemmy stock sir who was a parish prentice to my daddy he taught me one question out of the catechism every night and always made me say my prayers to him before i went to bed he told me i should go to the wicked place if i did not fear god so i am still afraid to tell lies like the other boys poor jemmy gave me a piece of gingerbread every time i learnt well but i have no friend now jemmy was very good to me though mammy did nothing but beat him  mr stock was too much moved to carry on the discourse he did not make himself known to the boy but took him over to the bakers shop as they walked along he could not help repeating aloud a verse or two of that beautiful hymn so deservedly the favorite of all children  not more than others i deserve yet god has given me more for i have food while others starve or beg from door to door the little boy looked up in his face saying why sir that is the very hymn which jemmy stock gave me a penny for learning stock made no answer but put a couple of threepenny loaves into his hand to carry home and told him to call on him again at such a time in the following week  how mr stock continued to be charitable without any expense stock had abundant subject for meditation that night he was puzzled what to do with the boy while he was carrying on his trade upon borrowed money he did not think it right to give any part of that money to assist the idle or even to help the distressed i must be just said he before i am generous still he could not bear to see this fine boy given up to certain ruin he did not think it safe to take him into his shop in his present ignorant unprincipled state at last he hit upon this thought i work for myself twelve hours in the day why shall i not work one hour or two for this boy in the evening it will be but for a year and i shall then have more right to do what i please my money will then be my own i shall have paid my debts  so he began to put his resolution in practice that very night sticking to his old notion of not putting off till tomorrow what should be done today and it was thought he owed much of his success in life as well as his growth in goodness to this little saying i am young and healthy said he one hours work more will do me no harm i will set aside all i get by these overhours and put the boy to school i have not only no right to punish this child for the sins of his father but i consider that though god hated those sins he made them be instruments for my advancement  tommy williams called at the time appointed in the mean time mr stocks maid had made him a tidy little suit of clothes out of an old coat of her masters she had also knit him a pair of stockings and mr stock made him sit down in the shop while he himself fitted him with a pair of new shoes the maid having washed and dressed him mr stock took him by the hand and walked along with him to the parish poorhouse to find his mother they found her dressed in ragged filthy finery standing at the door where she passed most of her time quarrelling with half a dozen women as idle and dirty as herself when she saw tommy so neat and welldressed she fell acrying for joy she said it put her in mind of old times for tommy always used to be dressed like a gentleman so much the worse said mr stock if you had not begun by making him look like a gentleman you needed not have ended by making him look like a beggar oh jem said she for though it was four years since she had seen him she soon recollected him fine times for you set a beggar on horseback  you know the proverb i shall beat tommy well for finding you out and exposing me to you  instead of entering into any dispute with this bad woman or praising himself at her expense or putting her in mind of her past ill behavior to him or reproaching her with the bad use she had made of her prosperity he mildly said to her mrs williams i am sorry for your misfortunes i am come to relieve you of part of your burden i will take tommy off your hands i will give him a years board and schooling and by that time i shall see what he is fit for i will promise nothing but if the boy turns out well i will never forsake him i shall make but one bargain with you which is that he must not come to this place to hear all this railing and swearing nor shall he keep company with these pilfering idle children you are welcome to go and see him when you please but here he must not come  the foolish woman burst out acrying saying she should lose her poor dear tommy for ever mr stock might give her the money he intended to pay at the school for nobody could do so well by him as his own mother the truth was she wanted to get these new clothes into her clutches which would all have been pawned at the dramshop before the week was out this mr stock well knew from crying she fell to scolding and swearing she told him he was an unnatural wretch that wanted to make a child despise his own mother because she was poor she even went so far as to say she would not part from him she said she hated your godly people they had no bowels of compassion but tried to set men women and children against their own flesh and blood  mr stock now almost lost his patience and for one moment a thought came across him to strip the boy carry back the clothes and leave him to his unnatural mother why said he should i work overhours and wear out my strength for this wicked woman but he soon checked this thought by reflecting on the patience and long suffering of god with rebellious sinners this cured his anger in a moment and he mildly reasoned with her on her folly and blindness in opposing the good of her child  one of the neighbors who stood by said what a fine thing it was for the boy but some people were born to be lucky she wished mr stock would take a fancy to her child he should have him soon enough mrs williams now began to be frightened lest mr stock should take the woman at her word and sullenly consented to let the boy go from envy and malice not from prudence and gratitude and tommy was sent to school that very night his mother crying and roaring instead of thanking god for such a blessing  and here i cannot forbear telling a very goodnatured thing of will simpson one of the workmen bytheby it was that very young fellow who was reformed by stocks good example when he was an apprentice and who used to sing with him on a sunday evening when they got out of the way of williamss junketing will coming home early one evening was surprised to find his master at work by himself long after the usual time he begged so heartily to know the reason that stock owned the truth will was so struck with this piece of kindness that he snatched up a last crying out well master you shall not work by yourself however we will go snacks in maintaining tommy it shall never be said that will simpson was idling about when his master was working for charity this made the hour pass cheerfully and doubled the profits  in a year or two mr stock by gods blessing on his labors became quite clear of the world he now paid off his creditors but he never forgot his obligation to them and found many opportunities of showing kindness to them and to their children after them he now cast about for a proper wife and as he was thought a prosperous man and very welllooking besides most of the smart girls of the place with their tawdry finery used to be often parading before the shop and would even go to church in order to put themselves in his way but mr stock when he went to church had other things in his head and if ever he thought about these gay damsels at all it was with concern in seeing them so improperly tricked out so that the very means they took to please him made him dislike them  there was one betsy west a young woman of excellent character and very modest appearance he had seldom seen her out as she was employed night and day in waiting on an aged widowed mother who was both lame and blind this good girl was indeed almost truly eyes and feet to her helpless parent and mr stock used to see her through the little casement window lifting her up and feeding her with a tenderness which greatly raised his esteem for her he used to tell will simpson as they sat at work that such a dutiful daughter could hardly fail to make a faithful wife he had not however the heart to try to draw her off from her care of her sick mother the poor woman declined very fast betsy was much employed in reading or praying by her while she was awake and passed good part of the night while she slept in doing some fine works to sell in order to supply her sick mother with little niceties which their poor pittance could not afford while she herself lived on a crust  mr stock knew that betsy would have little or nothing after her mothers death as she had only a life income on the other hand mr thompson the tanner had offered him two hundred pounds with his daughter nancy but he was almost sorry that he had not in this case an opportunity of resisting his natural bias which rather lay on the side of loving money for said her putting principle and putting affection out of the question i shall do a more prudent thing by marrying betsy west who will conform to her station and is a religious humble industrious girl without a shilling that by having an idle dressy lass who will neglect my family and fill my house with company though she should have twice the fortune which nancy thompson would bring  at length poor old mrs west was released from all her sufferings at a proper time mr stock proposed marriage to betsy and was accepted all the disappointed girls in the town wondered what any body could see in such a dowdy as that had the man no eyes they thought mr stock had had more taste oh how it did provoke all the vain idle things to find that staying at home dressing plainly serving god and nursing a blind mother should do that for betsy west which all their contrivances flaunting and dancing could not do for them  he was not disappointed of meeting with a good wife in betsy as indeed those who marry on light grounds seldom are but if religious persons will for the sake of money choose partners for life who have no religion do not let them complain that they are unhappy they might have known that beforehand  tommy williams was now taken home to stocks house and bound apprentice he was always kind and attentive to his mother and every penny which will simpson or his master gave him for learning a chapter he would save to buy a bit of tea and sugar for her when the other boys laughed at him for being so foolish as to deny himself cakes and apples to give his money to her who was so bad a woman he would answer it may be so but she is my mother for all that  mr stock was much moved at the change in this boy who turned out a very good youth he resolved as god should prosper him that he would try to snatch other helpless creatures from sin and ruin for said he it is owing to gods blessing on the instructions of my good minister when i was a child that i have been saved from the broad way of destruction he still gave god the glory of every thing he did aright and when will simpson one day said to him master i wish i were half as good as you are hold william answered he gravely i once read in a book that the devil is willing enough we should appear to do good actions if he can but make us proud of them  but we must not forget our other old acquaintance mr stocks fellowprentice so you may expect a full account of the many tricks and frolicks of idle jack brown in the following part  part iii i gave a little account of jack brown and his wild tricks in the first part of this history from which i dare say you expect to hear no great good of him the second part showed how james stock from a parish apprentice became a top shoemaker you shall now hear what befell idle jack who being a farmers son had many advantages to begin life with but he who wants prudence may be said to want every thing because he turns all his advantages to no account  jack brown was just out of his time when his master williams died in that terrible druuken fit at the greyhound you know already how stock succeeded to his masters business and prospered in it jack wished very much to enter into partnership with him his father and mother too were desirous of it and offered to advance a hundred pounds with him here is a fresh proof of the power of a good character the old farmer with all his covetousness was eager to get his son into partnership with stock though the latter was not worth a shilling and even jacks mother with all her pride was eager for it for they had both sense enough to see it would be the making of jack the father knew that stock would look to the main chance and the mother that he would take the laboring oar and so her darling would have little to do  stock however young as he was was too old a bird to be caught with chaff his wisdom was an overmatch for their cunning he had a kindness for brown but would on no account enter into business with him one of these three things said he i am sure will happen if i do he will either hurt my principles my character or my trade  perhaps all and here bythebye let me drop a hint to other young men who are about to enter into partnership let them not do that in haste which they may repent at leisure next to marriage it is a tie the hardest to breath and next to that it is an engagement which ought to be entered into with the most caution many things go to the making such a connection suitable safe and pleasant there is many a rich man need not be above taking a hint in this respect from james stock the shoemaker  brown was still unwilling to part from him indeed he was too idle to look out for business so he offered stock to work with him as a journeyman but this he also mildly refused it hurt his goodnature to do so but he reflected that a young man who has his way to make in the world must not only be goodnatured he must be prudent also i am resolved said he to employ none but the most sober regular young men i can get evil communications corrupt good manners and i should be answerable for all the disorders of my own house if i knowingly took a wild drinking young fellow into it that which might be kindness to one would be injustice to many and therefore a sin in myself  browns mother was in great rage when she heard that her son had stooped so low as to make this offer she thought pride was a grand thing poor woman she did not know that it is the meanest thing in the world it was her ignorance which made her proud as is apt to be the case you meanspirited rascal said she to jack i had rather follow you to the grave as well as i love you than see you disgrace your family by working under jem stock the parish apprentice she forgot already what pains she had taken about the partnership but pride and passion have a bad memory  it is hard to say which was now uppermost in her mind her desire to be revenged on stock or to see her son make a figure she raised every shilling she could get from her husband and all she could crib from the dairy to set up jack in a showy way so the very next market day she came herself and took for him the new white house with the two little sash windows painted blue and blue posts before the door it is that house which has the old cross just before it as you turn down between the church and the greyhound it is being so near the church to be sure was no recommendation to jack but it is being so near the greyhound was and so taking one thing with the other it was to be sure no bad situation but what weighed most with the mother was that it was a much more showy shop than stocks and the house though not half so convenient was far more smart  in order to draw custom his foolish mother advised him to undersell his neighbors just at first to buy ordinary but showy goods and employ cheap workmen in short she charged him to leave no stone unturned to ruin his old comrade stock indeed she always thought with double satisfaction of jacks prosperity because she always joined to it the hope that his success would be the ruin of stock for she owned it would be the joy of her heart to bring that proud upstart to a morsel of bread she did not understand for her part why such beggars must become tradesmen it was making a velvet purse of a sows ear  stock however set out on quite another set of principles he did not allow himself always to square his own behavior to others by theirs to him he seldom asked himself what he should like to do but he had a mighty way of saying i wonder now what is my duty to do and when he was once clear in that matter he generally did it always begging gods blessing and direction so instead of setting brown at defiance instead of all that vulgar selfishness of catch he that catch can  and two of a trade can never agree  he resolved to be friendly toward him instead of joining in the laugh against brown for making his house so fine he was sorry for him because he feared he would never be able to pay such a rent so he very kindly called upon him told him there was business enough for them both and gave him many useful hints for his going on he warned him to go oftener to church and seldomer to the greyhound put him in mind how following the one and forsaking the other had been the ruin of their poor master and added the following  advice to young tradesmen buy the best goods cut the work out yourself let the eye of the master be every where employ the soberest men avoid all the low deceits of trade never lower the credit of another to raise your own make short payments keep exact accounts avoid idle company and be very strict to your word  for a short time things went on swimmingly brown was merry and civil the shop was well situated for gossip and every one who had something to say and nothing to do was welcome every idle story was first spread and every idle song first sung in browns shop every customer who came to be measured was promised that his shoes should be done first but the misfortune was if twenty came in a day the same promise was made to all so that nineteen were disappointed and of course affronted he never said no to any one it is indeed a word which it requires some honesty to pronounce by all these false promises he was thought the most obliging fellow that ever made a shoe and as he set out on the principle of underselling people took a mighty fancy to the cheap shop and it was agreed among all the young and giddy that he would beat stock hollow and that the old shop would be soon knocked up  all is not gold that glistens after a few months however folks began to be not quite so fond of the cheap shop one found out that the leather was bad another that the work was slight those who liked substantial goods went all of them to stocks for they said browns heel taps did not last a week his new boots let in water and they believed he made his soles of brown paper besides it was thought by most that his promising all and keeping his word with none hurt his business as much as any thing indeed i question putting religion out of the question if lying ever answers in the long run  brown had what is commonly called a good heart that is he had a thoughtless good nature and a sort of feeling for the moment which made him seem sorry when others were in trouble but he was not apt to put himself to any inconvenience nor to go a step out of his way nor give up any pleasure to serve the best friend he had he loved fun and those who do should always see that it be harmless and that they do not give up more for it than it is worth i am not going to say a word against innocent merriment i like it myself but what the proverb says of gold may be said of mirth it may be bought too dear if a young man finds that what he fancies is a good joke may possibly offend god hurt his neighbor afflict his parent or make a modest girl blush then let him be assured it is not fun but wickedness and he had better let it alone  jack brown then as good a heart as he had did not know what it was to deny himself any thing he was so goodnatured indeed that he never in his life refused to make one of a jolly set but he was not goodnatured enough to consider that those men whom he kept up all night roaring and laughing had wives and children at home who had little to eat and less to wear because they were keeping up the character of merry fellows at the public house  the mountebank one day he saw his fathers ploughboy come galloping up to his door in great haste this boy brought brown word that his mother was dangerously ill and that his father had sent his own best bay mare smiler that his son might lose no time but set out directly to see his mother before she died jack burst into tears lamented the danger of so fond a mother and all the people in the shop extolled his good heart  he sent back the boy directly with a message that he would follow him in half an hour as soon as the mare had baited for he well knew that his father would not thank him for any haste he might make if smiler was hurt  jack accordingly set off and rode with such speed to the next town that both himself and smiler had a mind to another bait they stopped at the star unluckily it was fairday and as he was walking about while smiler was eating her oats a bill was put into his hand setting forth that on a stage opposite the globe a mountebank was showing away and his andrew performing the finest tricks that were ever seen he read  he stood still  he went on  it will not hinder me says he smiler must rest and i shall see my poor dear mother quite as soon if i just take a peep as if i sit moping at the star  the tricks were so merry that the time seemed short and when they were over he could not forbear going into the globe and treating these choice spirits with a bowl of punch just as they were taking the last glass jack happened to say that he was the best fives player in the country that is lucky said the andrew for there is a famous match now playing in the court and you may never again have such an opportunity to show your skill brown declared he could not stay for that he had left his horse at the star and must set off on urgent business they now all pretended to call his skill in question this roused his pride and he thought another half hour could break no squares smiler had now had a good feed of corn and he would only have to push her on a little more so to it he went  he won the first game this spurred him on and he played till it was so dark they could not see a ball another bowl was called for from the winner wagers and betts now drained brown not only of all the money he had won but of all he had in his pocket so that he was obliged to ask leave to go to the house where his horse was to borrow enough to discharge his reckoning at the globe  all these losses brought his poor dear mother to his mind and he marched off with rather a heavy heart to borrow the money and to order smiler out of the stable the landlord expressed much surprise at seeing him and the ostler declared there was no smiler there that he had been rode off two hours ago by the merry andrew who said he came by order of the owner mr brown to fetch him to the globe and to pay for his feed it was indeed one of the neatest tricks the andrew ever performed for he made such a clean conveyance of smiler that neither jack nor his father ever heard of her again  it was night no one could tell what road the andrew took and it was another hour or two before an advertisement could be drawn up for apprehending the horsestealer jack had some doubts whether he should go on or return back he knew that though his father might fear his wife most yet he loved smiler best at length he took that courage from a glass of brandy which he ought to have taken from a hearty repentance and he resolved to pursue his journey he was obliged to leave his watch and silver buckles in pawn for a little old hack which was nothing but skin and bone and would hardly trot three miles an hour  he knocked at his fathers door about five in the morning the family were all up he asked the boy who opened the door how his mother was she is dead said the boy she died yesterday afternoon here jacks heart smote him and he cried aloud partly from grief but more from the reproaches of his own conscience for he found by computing the hours that had he come strait on he should have been in time to receive his mothers blessing  the farmer now called from within i hear smilers step is jack come yes father said jack in a low voice then cried the farmer run every man and boy of you and take care of the mare tom do thou go and rub her down jem run and get her a good feed of corn be sure walk her about that she may not catch cold young browu came in are you not an undutiful dog said the father you might have been here twelve hours ago your mother could not die in peace without seeing you she said it was a cruel return for all her fondness that you could not make a little haste to see her but it was always so for she had wronged her other children to help you and this was her reward brown sobbed out a few words but his father replied never cry jack for the boy told me that it was out of regard for smiler that you were not here as soon as he was and if twas your over care of her why there is no great harm done you could not have saved your poor mother and you might have hurt the mare here jacks double guilt flew into his face he knew that his father was very covetous and had lived on bad terms with his wife and also that his own unkindness to her had been forgiven by him out of love to the horse but to break to him how he had lost that horse through his own folly and want of feeling was more than jack had courage to do the old man however soon got at the truth and no words can describe his fury forgetting that his wife lay dead above stas he abused his son in a way not fit to be repeated and though his covetousness had just before found an excuse for a favorite son neglecting to visit a dying parent yet he now vented his rage against jack as an unnatural brute whom he would cut off with a shilling and bade him never see his face again  jack was not allowed to attend his mothers funeral which was a real grief to him nor would his father advance even the little money which was needful to redeem his things at the star he had now no fond mother to assist him and he set out on his return home on his borrowed hack full of grief he had the added mortification of knowing that he had also lost by his folly a little hoard of money which his mother had saved up for him  when brown got back to his own town he found that the story of smiler and the andrew had got thither before him and it was thought a very good joke at the greyhound he soon recovered his spirits as far as related to the horse but as to his behavior to his dying mother it troubled him at times to the last day of his life though he did all he could to forget it he did not however go on at all better nor did he engage in one frolic the less for what had passed at the globe his good heart continually betraying him into acts of levity and vanity  jack began at length to feel the reverse of that proverb keep your shop and your shop will keep you he had neglected his customers and they forsook him quarterday came round there was much to pay and little to receive he owed two years rent he was in arrears to his men for wages he had a long account with his currier it was in vain to apply to his father he had now no mother stock was the only true friend he had in the world and had helped him out of many petty scrapes but he knew stock would advance no money in so hopeless a case duns came fast about him he named a speedy day for payment but as soon as they were out of the house and the danger put off to a little distance he forgot every promise was as merry as ever and run the same round of thoughtless gaiety whenever he was in trouble stock did not shun him because that was the moment he thought to throw in a little good advice he one day asked im if he always intended to go on in this course no said he i am resolved byandbye to reform grow sober and go to church why i am but five and twenty man i am stout and healthy and likely to live long i can repent and grow melancholy and good at any time  oh jack said stock dont cheat thyself with that false hope what thou do intend to do do quickly did thou never read about the heart growing hardened by long indulgence in sin some folks who pretend to mean well show that they mean nothing at all by never beginning to put their good resolutions into practice which made a wise man once say that hell is paved with good intentions we cannot repent when we please it is the goodness of god which leads to repentance  michaelmasday was at hand the landlord declared he would be put off no longer but would seize for rent if it was not paid him on that day as well as for a considerable sum due to him for leather brown now began to be frightened he applied to stock to be bound for him this stock flatly refused brown now began to dread the horrors of a jail and really seemed so very contrite and made so many vows and promises of amendment that at length stock was prevailed on together with two or three of browns other friends to advance each a small sum of money to quiet the landlord brown promising to make over to them every part of his stock and to be guided in future by their advice declaring that he would turn over a new leaf and follow mr stocks example as well as his direction in every thing  stocks good nature was at last wrought upon and he raised the money the truth is he did not know the worst nor how deeply brown was involved brown joyfully set out on the very quarterday to a town at some distance to carry his landlord the money raised by the imprudent kindness of his friend at his departure stock put him in mind of the old story of smiler and the merry andrew and he promised of his own head that he would not even call at a public house till he had paid the money  he was as good as his word he very triumphantly passed by several he stopped a little under the window of one where the sounds of merriment and loud laughter caught his ear at another he heard the enticing notes of a fiddle and the light heels of the merry dancers here his heart had wellnigh failed him but the dread of a jail on the one hand and what he feared almost as much mr stocks anger on the other spurred him on and he valued himself not a little at having got the better of this temptation he felt quite happy when he found he had reached the door of his landlord without having yielded to one idle inclination  he knocked at the door the maid who opened it said her master was not at home i am sorry for it said he strutting about and with a boasting air he took out his money i want to pay him my rent he need not have been afraid of me the servant who knew her master was very much afraid of him desired him to walk in for her master would be at home in half an hour i will call again said he but no let him call on me and the sooner the better i shall be at the blue posts while he had been talking he took care to open the black leather case and to display the bank bills to the servant and then in a swaggering way he put up his money and marched off to the blue posts  he was by this time quite proud of his own resolution and having tendered the money and being clear in his own mind that it was the landlords own fault and not his that it was not paid he went to refresh himself at the blue posts in a barn belonging to this public house some strollers were just going to perform some of that singsong ribaldry by which our villages are corrupted the laws broken and that money is drawn from the poor for pleasure which is wanted by their families for bread the name of the last new song which made part of the entertainment made him think himself in high luck that he should have just that half hour to spare he went into the barn but was too much delighted with the actor who sung his favorite song to remain a quiet hearer he leaped out of the pit and got behind the two ragged blankets which served for a curtain he sung so much better than the actors themselves that they praised and admired him to a degree which awakened all his vanity he was so intoxicated with their flattery that he could do no less than invite them all to supper an invitation which they were too hungry not to accept  he did not however quite forget his appointment with his landlord but the half hour was long since past by and so says he as i know he is a mean curmudgeon who goes to bed i suppose by day light to save candle it will be too late to speak with him tonight besides let him call upon me it is his business and not mine i left word where i was to be found the money is ready and if i dont pay him tonight i can do it before breakfast  by the time these firm resolutions were made supper was ready there never was a more jolly evening ale and punch were as plenty as water the actors saw what a vain fellow was feasting them and as they wanted victuals and he wanted flattery the business was soon settled they ate and brown sung they pretended to be in raptures singing promoted drinking and every fresh glass produced a song or a story still more merry than the former before morning those who were engaged to act in another barn a dozen miles off stole away quietly brown having dropped asleep they left him to finish his nap by himself as to him his dreams were gay and pleasant and the house being quite still he slept comfortably till morning  as soon as he had breakfasted the business of the night before popped into his head he set off once more to his landlords in high spirits gaily singing by the way scraps of all the tunes he had picked up the night before from his new friends the landlord opened the door himself and reproached him with no small surliness for not having kept his word with him the evening before adding that he supposed he was come now with some more of his shallow excuses brown put on all that haughtiness which is common to people who are generally apt to be in the wrong when they catch themselves doing a right action and he looked big as some sort of people do when they have money to pay you need not have been so anxious about your money said he i was not going to break or run away the landlord knew this was the common language of those who are ready to do both brown haughtily added you shall see i am a man of my word give me a receipt the landlord had had it ready and gave it him  brown put his hand in his pocket for his black leather case in which the bills were he felt he searched he examined first one pocket then the other then both waistcoat pockets but no leather case could he find he looked terrified it was the face of real terror but the landlord conceived it to be that of guilt and abused him heartily for putting his old tricks upon him he swore he would not be imposed upon any longer the money or a jail there lay his choice  brown protested for once with great truth that he had no intention to deceive declared that he had actually brought the money and knew not what was became of it but the thing was far too unlikely to gain credit brown now called to mind that he had fallen asleep on the settle in the room where they had supped this raised his spirits for he had no doubt but the case had fallen out of his pocket he said he would step to the public house and search for it and would be back directly not one word of all this did the landlord believe so inconvenient is it to have a bad character he swore brown should not stir out of his house without a constable and made him wait while he sent for one brown guarded by the constable went back to the blue posts the landlord charging the officer not to lose sight of the culprit the caution was needless brown had not the least design of running away so firmly persuaded was he that he should find his leather case  but who can paint his dismay when no tale or tidings of the leather case could be had the master the mistress the boy and the maid of the public house all protested they were innocent his suspicions soon fell on the strollers with whom he had passed the night and he now found out for the first time that a merry evening did not always produce a happy morning he obtained a warrant and proper officers were sent in pursuit of the strollers no one however believed he had really lost any thing and as he had not a shilling left to defray the expensive treat he had given the master of the inn agreed with the other landlord in thinking this story was a trick to defraud them both and brown remained in close custody at length the officers returned who said they had been obliged to let the strollers go as they could not fix the charge on any one and they had all offered to swear before a justice that they had seen nothing of the leather case it was at length agreed that as he had passed the evening in a crowded barn he had probably been robbed there if at all and among so many who could pretend to guess at the thief  brown raved like a madman he cried tore his hair and said he was ruined for ever the abusive language of his old landlord and his new creditor at the blue posts did not lighten his sorrow his landlord would be put off no longer brown declared he could neither find bail nor raise another shilling and as soon as the forms of law were made out he was sent to the county jail  here it might have been expected that hard living and much leisure would have brought him to reflect a little on his past follies but his heart was not truly touched the chief thing which grieved him at first was his having abused the kindness of stock for to him he should appear guilty of real fraud where he had indeed been only vain idle and imprudent and it is worth while here to remark that vanity idleness and imprudence often bring a man to ruin both soul and body though silly people do not put them in the catalogue of heavy sins and those who indulge in them are often reckoned honest merry fellows with good hearts  i wish i had room to tell my readers what befell jack in his present doleful habitation and what became of him afterward i promise them however that they shall certainly know the first of next month when i hope they will not forget to inquire for the fourth part of the shoemakers or jack brown in prison  part iv jack brown in prison i hope the reader has not forgotten where the third part of this history left off last month it finished with an account how jack brown by keeping idle company when he should have been paying his debts was robbed of his pocketbook while he was asleep on the settle at the blue posts it was also told how the landlord not believing one word of his story sent him to prison for debts long due to him  brown was no sooner lodged in his doleful habitation and a little recovered from his first surprise when he sat down and wrote to his friend stock the whole history of the transaction mr stock who had long known the exceeding lightness and dissipation of his mind did not so utterly disbelieve the story as all the other creditors did to speak the truth stock was the only one among them who had good sense enough to know that a man may be completely ruined both in what relates to his property and his soul without committing old bailey crimes he well knew that idleness vanity and the love of pleasure as it is falsely called will bring a man to a morsel of bread as surely as those things which are reckoned much greater sins and that they undermine his principles as certainly though not perhaps quite so fast  stock was too angry with what had happened to answer browns letter or to seem to take the least notice of him however he kindly and secretly undertook a journey to the hardhearted old farmer browns father to intercede with him and to sec if he would do any thing for his son stock did not pretend to excuse jack or even to lessen his offenses for it was a rule of his never to disguise truth or to palliate wickedness sin was still sin in his eyes though it were committed by his best friend but though he would not soften the sin he felt tenderly for the sinner he pleaded with the old farmer on the ground that his sons idleness and other vices would gather fresh strength in a jail he told him that the loose and worthless company which he would there keep would harden him in vice and if he was now wicked he might there become irreclaimable  but all his pleas were urged in vain the farmer was not to be moved indeed he argued with some justice that he ought not to make his industrious children beggars to save one rogue from the gallows mr stock allowed the force of his reasoning though he saw the father was less influenced by this principle of justice than by resentment on account of the old story of smiler people indeed should take care that what appears in their conduct to proceed from justice does not really proceed from revenge wiser men than farmer brown often deceive themselves and fancy they act on better principles than they really do for want of looking a little more closely into their own hearts and putting down every action to its true motive when we are praying against deceit we should not forget to take selfdeceit into the account  mr stock at length wrote to poor jack not to offer him any help that was quite out of the question but to exhort him to repent of his evil ways to lay before him the sins of his past life and to advise him to convert the present punishment into a benefit by humbling himself before god he offered his interest to get his place of confinement exchanged for one of those improved prisons where solitude and labor have been made the happy instruments of bringing many to a better way of thinking and ended by saying that if ever he gave any solid signs of real amendment he would still be his friend in spite of all that was past  if mr stock had sent him a good sum of money to procure his liberty or even a trifle to make merry with his wretched companions jack would have thought him a friend indeed but to send him nothing but dry advice and a few words of empty comfort was he thought but a cheap shabby way of showing his kindness unluckily the letter came just as he was going to sit down to one of those direful merrymakings which are often carried on with brutal riot within the doleful walls of a jail on the entrance of a new prisoner who is often expected to give a feast to the rest  when his companions were heated with gin now said jack i will treat you with a sermon and a very pretty preachment it is so saying he took out mr stocks kind and pious letter and was delighted at the bursts of laughter it produced what a canting dog said one repentance indeed cried tom crew no no jack tell this hypocritical rogue that if we have lost our liberty it is only for having been jolly hearty fellows and we have more spirit than to repent of that i hope all the harm we have done is living a little too fast like honest bucks as we are aye aye said jolly george had we been such sneaking miserly fellows as stock we need not have come hither but if the ill nature of the laws has been so cruel as to clap up such fine hearty blades we are no felons however we are afraid of no jack ketch and i see no cause to repent of any sin that is not hanging matter as to those who are thrust into the condemned hole indeed and have but a few hours to live they must see the parson and hear a sermon and such stuff but i do not know what such stout young fellows as we are have to do with repentance and so jack let us have that rare new catch which you learnt of the strollers that merry night when you lost your pocketbook  brown soon gave a fresh proof of the power of evil company and of the quick progress of the heart of a sinner from bad to worse brown who always wanted principle soon grew to want feeling also he joined in the laugh which was raised against stock and told many good stories as they were called in derision of the piety sobriety and selfdenial of his old friend he lost every day somewhat of those small remains of shame and decency which he had brought with him to the prison he even grew reconciled to this wretched way of life and the want of money seemed to him the heaviest evil in the life of a jail  mr stock finding from the jailer that his letter had been treated with ridicule would not write to him any more he did not come to see him nor send him any assistance thinking it right to let him suffer that want which his vices had brought upon him but as he still hoped that the time might come when he might be brought to a sense of his own evil courses he continued to have an eye upon him by means of the jailer who was an honest kindhearted man  brown spent one part of his time in thoughtless riot and the other in gloom and sadness company kept up his spirits with his new friends he contrived to drown thought but when he was alone he began to find that a merry fellow when deprived of his companions and his liquor is often a most forlorn wretch then it is that even a merry fellow says of laughter what is it and of mirth it is madness  as he contrived however to be as little alone as possible his gaiety was commonly uppermost till that loathsome distemper called the jail fever broke out in the prison tom crew the ringleader in all their evil practices was first seized with it jack staid a little while with his comrade to assist and divert him but of assistance he could give little and the very thought of diversion was now turned into horror he soon caught the distemper and that in so dreadful a degree that his life was in great danger of those who remained in health not a soul came near him though he had shared his last farthing with them he had just sense enough to feel this cruelty poor fellow he did not know before that the friendship of the worldly is at an end when there is no more drink or diversion to be had he lay in the most deplorable condition his body tormented with a dreadful disease and his soul terrified and amazed at the approach of death that death which he thought at so great a distance and of which his comrades had assured him that a young fellow of five and twenty was in no danger poor jack i cannot help feeling for him without a shilling without a friend without one comfort respecting this world and what is far more terrible without one hope respecting the next  let not the young reader fancy that browns misery arose entirely from his altered circumstances it was not merely his being in want and sick and in a prison which made his condition so desperate many an honest man unjustly accused many a persecuted saint many a holy martyr has enjoyed sometimes more peace and content in a prison than wicked men have ever tasted in the height of their prosperity but to any such comforts poor jack had left himself no right  a christian friend generally comes forward at the very time when worldly friends forsake the wretched the other prisoners would not come near brown though he had often entertained and never offended them even his own father was not moved with his sad condition when mr stock informed him of it he answered it is no more than he deserves as he brews so he must bake he has made his own bed and let him lie in it the hard old man had ever at his tongues end some proverb of hardness or frugality which he contrived to turn in such a way as to excuse himself  we shall now see how mr stock behaved he had his favorite sayings too but they were chiefly on the side of kindness mercy or some other virtue i must not said he pretend to call myself a christian if i do not requite evil with good when he received the gaolers letter with the account of browns sad condition will simpson and tommy williams began to compliment him on his own wisdom and prudence by which he had escaped browns misfortunes he only gravely said blessed be god that i am not in the same misery it is he who has made us to differ but for his grace i might have been in no better condition now brown is brought low by the hand of god it is my time to go to him what you said will whom he cheated of your money  this is not a time to remember injuries said mr stock how can i ask forgiveness for my own sins if i withhold forgiveness from him so saying he ordered his horse and set off to see poor brown thus proving that his was a religion not of words but of deeds  stocks heart nearly failed him as he passed through the prison the groans of the sick and dying and what to such a heart as his was still more moving the brutal merriment of the healthy in such a place pierced his very soul many a silent prayer did he put up as he passed along that god would yet be pleased to touch their hearts and that now during this infectious sickness might be the accepted time the jailer observed him drop a tear and asked the cause i cannot forget said he that the most dissolute of these men is still my fellow creature the same god made them the same savior died for them how then can i hate the worst of them with my advantages they might have been much better than i am without the blessing of god on my good ministers instructions i might have been worse than the worst of these i have no cause for pride much for thankfulness let us not be highminded but fear  it would have moved a heart of stone to have seen poor miserable jack brown lying on his wretched bed his face so changed by pain poverty dirt and sorrow that he could hardly be known for that merry soul of a jack boot as he used to be proud to hear himself called his groans were so piteous that it made mr stocks heart ach he kindly took him by the hand though he knew the distemper was catching how do do jack said he do know me brown shook his head and said faintly know you aye that i do i am sure i have but one friend in the world who would come to see me in this woeful condition o james what have i brought myself to what will become of my poor soul i dare not look back for that is all sin nor forward for that is all misery and woe  mr stock spoke kindly to him but did not attempt to cheer him with false comfort as is too often done i am ashamed to see you in this dirty place says brown  as to the place jack replied the other if it has helped to bring you to a sense of your past offenses it will be no bad place for you i am heartily sorry for your distress and your sickness but if it should please god by them to open your eyes and to show you that sin is a greater evil than the prison to which it has brought you all may yet be well i had rather see you in this humble penitent state lying on this dirty bed in this dismal prison than roaring and noting at the greyhound the king of the company with handsome clothes on your back and plenty of money in your pocket  brown wept bitterly and squeezed his hand but was too weak to say much mr stock then desired the jailer to let him have such things as were needful and he would pay for them he would not leave the poor fellow till he had given him with his own hands some broth which the jailer had got ready for him and some medicines which the doctor had sent all this kindness cut brown to the heart he was just able to sob out my unnatural father leaves me to perish and my injured friend is more than a father to me stock told him that one proof he must give him of his repentance was that he must forgive his father whose provocation had been very great he then said he would leave him for the present to take some rest and desired him to lift up his heart to god for mercy dear james replied brown do you pray for me god perhaps may hear you but he will never hear the prayer of such a sinner as i have been  take care how you think so said stock to believe that god cannot forgive you would be still a greater sin than any you have yet committed against him he then explained to him in a few words as well as he was able the nature of repentance and forgiveness through a savior and warned him earnestly against unbelief and hardness of heart  poor jack grew much refreshed in body with the comfortable things he had taken and a little cheered with stocks kindness in coming so far to see and to forgive such a forlom outcast sick of an infectious distemper and locked within the walls of a prison surely said he to himself there must be some mighty power in a religion which can lead men to do such things things so much against the grain as to forgive an injury and to risk catching such a distemper but he was so weak he could not express this in words he tried to pray but he could not at length overpowered with weariness he fell asleep  when mr stock came back he was surprised to find him so much better in body but his agonies of mind were dreadful and he had now got strength to express part of the horrors which he felt james said he looking wildly it is all over with me i am a lost creature even your prayers cannot save me  dear jack replied mr stock i am no minister it does not become me to talk much to thee but i know i may venture to say whatever is in the bible as ignorant as i am i shall be safe enough while i stick to that  aye said the sick man you used to be ready enough to read to me and i would not listen or if i did it was only to make fun of what i heard and now you will not so much as read a bit of a chapter to me  this was the very point to which stock longed to bring him so he took a little bible out of his pocket which he always carried with him on a journey and read slowly verse by verse the   th chapter of isaiah when he came to the  th and  th verses poor jack cried so much that stock was forced to stop the words were let the wicked man forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord here brown stopped him saying oh it is too late too late for me  let me finish the verse said stock and you will see your error you will see that it is never too late so he read on  let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god and he will abundantly pardon here brown started up snatched the book out of his hand and cried out is that really there no no that is of your own putting in in order to comfort me let me look at the words myself  no indeed said stock i would not for the world give you unfounded comfort or put off any notion of my own for a scripture doctrine  but is it possible cried the sick man that god may really pardon me do think he can do think he will  i am sure of it said stock i dare not give thee false hopes or indeed any hopes of my own but these are gods own words and the only difficulty is to know when we are really brought into such a state as that the words may be applied to us  mr stock was afraid of saying more he would not venture out of his depth nor indeed was poor brown able to bear more discourse just now so he made him a present of the bible folding down such places as he thought might be best suited to his state and took his leave being obliged to return home that night he left a little money with the jailer to add a few comforts to the allowance of the prison and promised to return in a short time  when he got home he described the sufferings and misery of brown in a very moving manner but tommy williams instead of being properly affected at it only said indeed master i am not very sorry he is rightly served how tommy said mr stock rather sternly not sorry to see a fellow creature brought to the lowest state of misery one too whom you have known so prosperous no master i cannot say i am for mr brown used to make fun of you and laugh at you for being so godly and reading your bible  let me say a few words to you tommy said mr stock in the first place you should never watch for the time of a mans being brought low by trouble to tell of his faults next you should never rejoice at his trouble but pity him and pray for him lastly as to his ridiculing me for my rereligion if i cannot stand an idle jest i am not worthy the name of a christian he that is ashamed of me and my words  do remember what follows tommy yes master twas last sundays text  of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall judge the world  mr stock soon went back to the prison but he did not go alone he took with him mr thomas the worthy minister who had been the guide and instructor of his youth who was so kind as to go at his request and visit this forlorn prisoner when they got to browns door they found him sitting up in his bed with the bible in his hand this was a joyful sight to mr stock who secretly thanked god for it brown was reading aloud they listened it was the fifteenth of saint luke the circumstances of this beautiful parable of the prodigal son were so much like his own that the story pierced him to the soul and he stopped every minute to compare his own case with that of the prodigal he was just got to the eighteenth verse i will arise and go to my father  at that moment he spied his two friends joy darted into his eyes o dear jem said he it is not too late i will arise and go to my father my heavenly father and you sir will show me the way will not you said he to mr thomas whom he recollected i am very glad to see you in so hopeful a disposition said the good minister  o sir said brown what a place is this to receive you in o see to what i have brought myself  your condition as to this world is indeed very low replied the good divine but what are mines dungeons or galleys to that eternal hopeless prison to which your unrepented sins must soon have consigned you even in this gloomy prison on this bed of straw worn down by pain poverty and want forsaken by your worldly friends an object of scorn to those with whom you used to carouse and riot yet here i say brought thus low if you have at last found out your own vileness and your utterly undone state by sin you may still be more an object of favor in the sight of god than when you thought yourself prosperous and happy when the world smiled upon you and you passed your days and nights in envied gaiety and unchristian riot if you will but improve the present awful visitation if you do but heartily renounce and abhor your present evil courses if you even now turn to the lord your savior with lively faith deep repentance and unfeigned obedience i shall still have more hope of you than of many who are going on quite happy because quite insensible the heavy laden sinner who has discovered the iniquity of his own heart and his utter inability to help himself may be restored to gods favor and become happy though in a dungeon and be assured that he who from deep and humble contrition dares not so much as lift his eyes to heaven when with a hearty faith he sighs out lord be merciful to me a sinner shall in no wise be cast out these are the words of him who cannot lie  it is impossible to describe the selfabasement the grief the joy the shame the hope and the fear which filled the mind of this poor man a dawn of comfort at length shone on his benighted mind his humility and fear of failing back into his former sins if he should ever recover mr thomas thought were strong symptoms of a sound repentance he improved and cherished every good disposition he saw rising in his heart and particularly warned him against selfdeceit selfconfidence and hypocrisy  one day when mr thomas and mr stock came to see him they found him more than commonly affected his face was more ghastly pale than usual and his eyes were red with crying oh sir said he what a sight have i just seen jolly george as we used to call him the ringleader of all our mirth who was at the bottom of all the fun and tricks and wickedness that are carried on within these walls jolly george is just dead of the jaildistemper he taken and i left i would be carried into his room to speak to him to beg him to take warning by me and that i might take warning by him but what did i see what did i hear not one sign of repentance not one dawn of hope agony of body blasphemies on his tongue despair in his soul while i am spared and comforted with hopes of mercy and acceptance oh if all my old friends at the greyhound could but then have seen jolly george a hundred sermons about death sir dont speak so home and cut so deep as the sight of one dying sinner  brown grew gradually better in his health that is the fever mended but the distemper settled in his limbs so that he seemed likely to be a poor weakly cripple the rest of his life but as he spent much of his time in prayer and in reading such parts of the bible as mr thomas directed he improved every day in knowledge and piety and of course grew more resigned to pain and infirmity  some months after this his heardhearted father who had never been prevailed upon to see him or offer him the least relief was taken off suddenly by a fit of apoplexy and after all his threatenings he died without a will he was one of those silly superstitious men who fancy they shall die the sooner for having made one and who love the world and the things that are in the world so dearly that they dread to set about any business which may put them in mind that they are not always to live in it as by this neglect his father had not fulfilled his threat of cutting him off with a shilling jack of course went shares with his brothers in what their father left what fell to him proved to be just enough to discharge him from prison and to pay all his debts but he had nothing left his joy at being thus enabled to make restitution was so great that he thought little of his own wants he did not desire to conceal the most trifling debt nor to keep a shilling for himself  mr stock undertook to settle all his affairs there did not remain money enough after every creditor was satisfied even to pay for his removal home mr stock kindly sent his own cart for him with a bed in it made as comfortable as possible for he was too weak and lame to be removed any other way and mr stock gave the driver a particular charge to be tender and careful of him and not to drive hard nor to leave the cart a moment  mr stock would fain have taken him into his own house at least for a time so convinced was he of his sincere reformation both of heart and life but brown would not be prevailed on to be further buthensome to this generous friend he insisted on being carried to the parish workhouse which he said was a far better place than he deserved in this house mr stock furnished a small room for him and sent him every day a morsel of meat from his own dinner tommy williams begged that he might always be allowed to carry it as some atonement for his having for a moment so far forgotten his duty as rather to rejoice than sympathize in browns misfortunes he never thought of this fault without sorrow and often thanked his master for the wholesome lesson he then gave him and he was the better for it all his life  mrs stock often carried poor brown a bit of tea or basin of good broth herself he was quite a cripple and never able to walk out as long as he lived mr stock will simpson and tommy williams laid their heads together and contrived a sort of barrow on which he was often carried to church by some of his poor neighbors of which tommy was always one and he requited their kindness by reading a good book to them whenever they would call in or teaching their children to sing psalms or say the catechism  it was no small joy to him thus to be enabled to go to church whenever he was carried by the greyhound he was much moved and used to put up a prayer full of repentance for the past and praise for the present  the prodigal son this hymn was frequently sung by jack brown in the workhouse  behold the wretch whose lust and wine have wasted his estate he begs a share among the swine to taste the husks they eat i die with hunger here he cries i starve in foreign lands my fathers house has large supplies and bounteous are his hands i will go and with a mournful tongue fall down before his face father i have done thy justice wrong nor can deserve thy grace he said and hastened to his home to seek his fathers love the father saw the rebel come and all his bowels move he ran and fell upon his neck embraced and kissed his son the rebels heart with sorrow breaks for sins which he had done take off his clothes of shame and sin the father gives command dress him in garments white and clean with rings adorn his hand a day of feasting i ordain let mirth and joy abound my son was dead and lives again was lost and now is found part v a dialogue between james stock and will simpson the shoemakers as they sat at work james stock and his journeyman will simpson as i informed my readers in the second part had resolved to work together one hour every evening in order to pay for tommy williamss schooling this circumstance brought them to be a good deal together when the rest of the men were gone home now it happened that mr stock had a mighty way of endeavoring to turn all common events to some use and he thought it right on the present occasion to make the only return in his power to will simpson for his great kindness for said he if will gives up so much of his time to help me to provide for this poor boy it is the least i can do to try to turn part of that time to the purpose of promoting wills spiritual good now as the bent of stocks own mind was religious it was easy to him to lead their talk to something profitable he always took especial care however that the subject should be introduced properly cheerfully and without constraint as he well knew that great good may be sometimes done by a prudent attention in seizing proper opportunities so he knew that the cause of piety had been sometimes hurt by forcing serious subjects where there was clearly no disposition to receive them i say he had found out that two things were necessary to the promoting of religion among his friends a warm zeal to be always on the watch for occasions and a cool judgment to distinguish which was the right time and place to make use of them to know how to do good is a great matter but to know when to do it is no small one  simpson was an honest goodnatured fellow he was now become sober and rather religiously disposed but he was ignorant he did not know much of the grounds of religion or of the corruption of his own nature he was regular at church but was first drawn thither rather by his skill in psalmsinging than by any great devotion he had left off going to the greyhound and often read the bible or some other good book on the sunday evening this he thought was quite enough he thought the bible was the prettiest history book in the world and that religion was a very good thing for sundays but he did not much understand what business people had with it on working days he had left off drinking because it had brought williams to the grave and his wife to dirt and rags but not because he himself had seen the evil of sin he now considered swearing and sabbathbreaking as scandalous and indecent but he had not found out that both were to be left off because they are highly offensive to god and grieve his holy spirit as simpson was less selfconceited than most ignorant people are stock had always a good hope that when he should come to be better acquainted with the word of god and with the evil of his own heart he would become one day a good christian the great hindrance to this was that he fancied himself so already  one evening simpson had been calling to stocks mind how disorderly the house and shop where they were now sitting quietly at work had formerly been and he went on thus  will how comfortably we live now master to what we used to do in williamss time i used then never to be happy but when we were keeping it up all night but now i am as merry as the day is long i find i am twice as happy since i am grown good and sober   stock i am glad you are happy will and i rejoice that you are sober but i would not have you take too much pride in your own goodness for fear it should become a sin almost as great as some of those you have left off besides i would not have you make quite so sure that you are good   will not good master why dont you find me regular and orderly at work   stock very much so and accordingly i have a great respect for you   will i pay every one his own seldom miss church have not been drunk since williams died have handsome clothes for sundays and save a trifle every week   stock very true and very laudable it is and to all this you may add that you very generously work an hour for poor tommys education every evening without fee or reward   will well master what can a man do more if all this is not being good i dont know what is   stock all these things are very right as far as they go and you could not well be a christian without doing them but i shall make you stare perhaps when i tell you you may do all these things and many more and yet be no christian   will no christian surely master i do hope that after all i have done you will not be so unkind as to say i am no christian   stock god forbid that i should say so will i hope better things of you but come now what do you think it is to be a christian   will what why to be christened when one is a child to learn the catechism when one can read to be confirmed when one is a youth and to go to church when one is a man   stock these are all very proper things and quite necessary they make a part of a christians life but for all that a man may be exact in them all and yet not be a christian   will not be a christian ha ha ha you are very comical master   stock no indeed i am very serious will at this rate it would be a very easy thing to be a christian and every man who went through certain forms would be a good man and one man who observed these forms would be as good as another whereas if we come to examine ourselves by the word of god i am afraid there are but few comparatively whom our savior would allow to be real christians what is your notion of a christians practice   will why he must not rob nor murder nor get drunk he must avoid scandalous things and do as other decent orderly people do   stock it is easy enough to be what the world calls a christian but not to be what the bible calls so   will why master we working men are not expected to be saints and martyrs and apostles and ministers   stock we are not and yet will there are not two sorts of christianity we are called to practice the same religion which they practiced and something of the same spirit is expected in us which we reverence in them it was not saints and martyrs only to whom our savior said that they must crucify the world with its affections and lusts we are called to be holy in our measure and degree as he who has called us is holy it was not only saints and martyrs who were told that they must be likeminded with christ  that they must do all to the glory of god  that they must renounce the spirit of the world and deny themselves it was not to apostles only that christ said they must have their conversation in heaven it was not to a few holy men set apart for the altar that he said they must set their affections on things above  that they must not be conformed to the world  no it was to fishermen to publicans to farmers to daylabourers to poor tradesmen that he spoke when he told them they must love not the world nor the things of the world  that they must renounce the hidden things of dishonesty grow in grace lay up for themselves treasures in heaven   will all this might be very proper for them to be taught because they had not been bred up christians but heathens or jews and christ wanted to make them his followers that is christians but thank god we do not want to be taught all this for we are christians born in a christian country of christian parents   stock i suppose then you fancy that christianity comes to people in a christian country by nature   will i think it comes by a good education or a good example when a fellow who has got any sense sees a man cut off in his prime by drinking i think he will begin to leave it off when he sees another man respected like you master for honesty and sobriety and going to church why he will grow honest and sober and go to church that is he will see it is his advantage to be a christian   stock will what you say is the truth but it is not the whole truth you are right as far as you go but you do not go far enough the worldly advantages of piety are as you suppose in general great credit prosperity and health almost naturally attend on a religious life both because a religious life supposes a sober and industrious life and because a man who lives in a course of duty puts himself in the way of gods blessing but a true christian has a still higher aim in view and will follow religion even under circumstances when it may hurt his credit and may ruin his prosperity if it should ever happen to be the will of god that he should be brought into such a trying state   will well master to speak the truth if i go to church on sundays and follow my work in the week i must say i think that is being good   stock i agree with you that he who does both gives the best outward signs that he is good as you call it but our going to church and even reading the bible are no proofs that we are as good as we need be but rather that we do both these in order to make us better than we are we do both on sundays as means by gods blessing to make us better all the week we are to bring the fruits of that chapter or of that sermon into our daily life and try to get our inmost heart and secret thoughts as well as our daily conduct amended by them   will why sure master you will not be so unreasonable as to want a body to be religious always i cannot do that neither i am not such a hypocrite as to pretend to it   stock yes you can be so in every action of your life   will what master always to be thinking about religion   stock no far from it will much less to be always talking about it but you must be always acting under it is power and spirit   will but surely it is pretty well if i do this when i go to church or while i am saying my prayers even you master as strict as you are would not have me always on my knees nor always at church i suppose for then how would your work be carried on and how would our town be supplied with shoes   stock very true will twould be no proof of our religion to let our customers go barefoot but twould be a proof of our laziness and we should starve as we ought to do the business of the world must not only be carried on but carried on with spirit and activity we have the same authority fornot being slothful in business as we have for being fervent in spirit religion has put godliness and laziness as wide asunder as any two things in the world and what god has separated let no man pretend to join indeed the spirit of religion can have no fellowship with sloth indolence and selfindulgence but still a christian does not carry on his common trade quite like another man neither for something of the spirit which he labors to attain at church he carries with him into his worldly concerns while there are some who set up for sunday christians who have no notion that they are bound to be weekday christians too   will why master i do think if god almighty is contented with one day in seven he will not thank you for throwing him the other six into the bargain i thought he gave us them for our own use and i am sure nobody works harder all the week than you do   stock god it is true sets apart one day in seven for actual rest from labor and for more immediate devotion to his service but show me that text wherein he says thou shall love the lord thy god on sundays  thou shall keep my commandments on the sabbath day  to be carnally minded on sundays is death  cease to do evil and learn to do well one day in seven  grow in grace on the lords day  is there any such text   will no to be sure there is not for that would be encouraging sin in all the other days   stock yes just as you do when you make religion a thing for the church and not for the world there is no one lawful calling in pursuing which we may not serve god acceptably you and i may serve him while we are stitching this pair of boots farmer furrow while he is plowing yonder field betsy west over the way whilst she is nursing her sick mother neighbor incle in measuring out his tapes and ribbons i say all these may serve god just as acceptably in those employments as at church i had almost said more so   will aye indeed  how can that be now youre too much on the other side   stock because a mans trials in trade being often greater they give him fresh means of glorifying god and proving the sincerity of religion a man who mixes in business is naturally brought into continual temptations and difficulties these will lead him if he be a good man to look more to god than he perhaps would otherwise do he sees temptations on the right hand and on the left he knows that there are snares all around him this makes him watchful he feels that the enemy within is too ready to betray him this makes him humble himself while a sense of his own difficulties makes him tender to the failings of others   will then you would make one believe after all that trade and business must be sinful in itself since it brings a man into all these snares and scrapes   stock no no will trade and business dont create evil passions  they were in the heart before  only now and then they seem to lie snug a little  our concerns with the world bring them out into action a little more and thus show both others and ourselves what we really are but then as the world offers more trials on the one hand so on the other it holds out more duties if we are called to battle oftener we have more opportunities of victory every temptation resisted is an enemy subdued and he that rules his own spirit is better than he that takes a city   will i dont quite understand you master   stock i will try to explain myself there is no passion more called out by the transactions of trade than covetousness now it is impossible to withstand such a mastersin as that without carrying a good deal of the spirit of religion into ones trade   will well i own i dont yet see how i am to be religious when i am hard at work or busy settling an account i cannot do two things at once it is as if i were to pretend to make a shoe and cut out a boot at the same moment   stock i tell you both must subsist together nay the one must be the motive to the other god commands us to be industrious and if we love him the desire of pleasing him should be the main spring of our industry   will i dont see how i can be always thinking about pleasing god   stock suppose now a man had a wife and children whom he loved and wished to serve would he not be often thinking about them while he was at work and though he would not be always thinking about them yet would not the very love he bore them be a constant spur to his industry he would always be pursuing the same course from the same motive though his words and even his thoughts must often be taken up in the common transactions of life   will well i say first one then the other now for labor now for religion   stock i will show that both must go together i will suppose you were going to buy so many skins of our currier  that is quite a worldly transaction  you cannot see what a spirit of religion has to do with buying a few calves skins now i tell you it has a great deal to do with it covetousness a desire to make a good bargain may rise up in your heart selfishness a spirit of monopoly a wish to get all in order to distress others these are evil desires and must be subdued some opportunity of unfair gain offers in which there may be much sin and yet little scandal here a christian will stop short he will recollect that he who makes haste to be rich shall hardly be innocent perhaps the sin may be on the side of your dealer  he may want to overreach you  this is provoking  you are tempted to violent anger perhaps to swear  here is a fresh demand on you for a spirit of patience and moderation as there was before for a spirit of justice and selfdenial if by gods grace you get the victory over these temptations you are the better man for having been called out to them always provided that the temptations be not of your own seeking if you give way and sink under these temptations dont go and say that trade and business have made you covetous passionate and profane no no  depend upon it you were so before you would have had all these evil seeds lurking in your heart if you had been loitering about at home and doing nothing with the additional sin of idleness into the bargain when you are busy then devil often tempts you when you are idle you tempt the devil if business and the world call these evil tempers into action business and the world call that religion into action too which teaches us to resist them and in this you see the week day fruit of sundays piety it is trade and business in the week which call us to put our sunday readings praying and churchgoing into practice   will well master you have a comical way some how of coming over one i never should have thought there would have been any religion wanted in buying and selling a few calves skins but i begin to see there is a good deal in what you say and whenever i am doing a common action i will try to remember that it must be done after a godly sort   stock i hear the clock strike nine  let us leave off our work i will only observe farther that one good end of our bringing religion into our business is to put us in mind not to undertake more business than we can carry on consistently with our religion i shall never commend that mans diligence though it is often commended by the world who is not diligent about the salvation of his soul we are as much forbidden to be overcharged with the cares of life as with it is pleasures i only wish to prove to you that a discreet christain may be wise for both worlds that he may employ his hands without entangling his soul and labor for the meat that perishes without neglecting that which endures unto eternal life that he may be prudent for time while he is wise for eternity   z  the hymn o that the lord would guide my ways to keep his statutes still o that my god would give me grace to know and do his will lord send thy spirit down to write thy love upon my heart not let my tongue indulge deceit not act a liars part from vanity lord turn mine eyes let no corrupt design no covetous desires arise within this soul of mine order my footsteps by thy word and make my heart sincere let sin have no dominion lord but
