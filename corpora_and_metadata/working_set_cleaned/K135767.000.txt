an essay on slavery proving from scripture its inconsistency with humanity and religion in answer to a late publication entitled the african trade for negro slaves shown to be consistent with principles of humanity and with the laws of revealed religion  by granville sharp esquire  with an introductory preface containing the sentiments of the monthly reviewers on that publication and the opinion of several eminent writers on the subject  to which is added an elegy on the miserable state of an african slave by the celebrated and ingenious william shenstone esquire  the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed  a refuge in time of trouble psalm ix    burlington printed and sold by isaac collins mdcclxxiii  preface the following essay though wrote as the author signifies in haste is thought to have such merit as to deserve a publication  the copy was sent to one of the writers particular friends whether for his own peculiar satisfaction or the press is uncertain but as the subject is liberty so it is expected the freedom which is here taken cannot justly give him offense or be unacceptable to the public  it was designed to confute a piece wrote by thomas thompson m a some time fellow of c c c entitled the african trade for negro slaves shown to be consistent with principles of humanity and with the laws of revealed religion printed at canterbury  in order to show that the essay writer has not misrepresented the text nor is single in his observations upon it the sentiments of the monthly reviewers on that pamphlet in may      are here inserted  we must acknowledge say they that the branch of trade here under consideration is a species of traffic which we have never been able to reconcile with the dictates of humanity and much less with those of religion the principal argument in its behalf seems to be the necessity of such a resource in order to carry on the works in our plantations which we are told it is otherwise impossible to perform but this though the urgency of the case may be very great is not by any means sufficient to justify the practice there is a farther consideration which has a plausible appearance and may be thought to carry some weight it is that the merchant only purchases those who were slaves before and possibly may rather than otherwise render their situation more tolerable but it is well known that the lot of our slaves when most favorably considered is very hard and miserable besides which such a trade is taking the advantage of the ignorance and brutality of unenlightened nations who are encouraged to war with each other for this very purpose and it is to be feared are sometimes tempted to seize those of their own tribes or families that they may obtain the hoped for advantage and it is owned with regard to our merchants that upon occasion they observe the like practices which are thought to be allowable because they are done by way of reprisal for theft or damage committed by the natives we were pleased however to meet with a pamphlet on the other side of the question and we entered upon its perusal with the hopes of finding somewhat advanced which might afford us satisfaction on this difficult point the writer appears to be a sensible man and capable of discussing the argument but the limits to which he is confined render his performance rather superficial the plea he produces from the jewish law is not in our view of the matter at all conclusive the people of israel were under a theocracy in which the supreme being was in a peculiar sense their king and might therefore issue forth some orders for them which it would not be warrantable for another people who were in different circumstances to observe such for instance was the command given concerning the extirpation of the canaanites whom the sovereign arbiter of life and death might if he had pleased have destroyed by plague or famine or other of those means which we term natural causes and by which a wise providence fulfils its own purposes but it would be unreasonable to infer from the manner in which the israelites dealt with the people of canaan that any other nations have a right to pursue the same method neither can we imagine that st pauls exhortation to servants or slaves upon their conversion to continue in the state in which christianity found them affords any argument favorable to the practice here pleaded for it is no more than saying that christianity did not particularly enter into the regulations of civil society at that time that it taught persons to be contented and diligent in their stations but certainly it did not forbid them in a proper and lawful way if it was in their power to render their circumstances more comfortable upon the whole we must own that this little treatise is not convincing to us though as different persons are differently affected by the same considerations it may prove more satisfactory to others  in another place they observe since we are all brethren and god has given to all men a natural right to liberty we allow of no slavery among us unless a person forfeits his freedom by his crimes  that slavery is not consistent with the english constitution nor admissable in great britain appears evidently by the late solemn determination in the court of kings bench at westminster in the case of  somerset the negro  and why it should be revived and continued in the colonies peopled by the descendents of britain and blessed with sentiments as truly noble and free as any of their fellow subjects in the mother country is not easily conceived nor can the distinction be well founded  if natural rights such as life and liberty receive no additional strength from municipal laws nor any human legislature has power to abridge or destroy them unless the owner commits some act that amounts to a forfeiture   blackstones commentaries    if the natural liberty of mankind consists properly in a power of acting as one thinks fit without any restraint or control unless by the law of nature being a right inherent in us by birth and one of the gifts of god to man at his creation when he endued him with the faculty of free will do     if an act of parliament is controulable by the laws of god and nature   bacons abridg     and in its consequences may be rendered void for absurdity or a manifest contradiction to common reason   black com    if christianity is a part of the law of england stra reports      and christ expressly commands whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them at the same time declaring for this is the law and the prophets matt vii    and if our forefathers who emigrated from england hither brought with them all the rights liberties and privileges of the british constitution  which has of late years been often asserted and repeatedly contended for by americans why is it that the poor sooty african meets with so different a measure of justice in england and america as to be adjudged free in the one and in the other held in the most abject slavery  we are expressly restrained from making laws repugnant to and directed to fashion them as nearly as may be agreeable to the laws of england hence and because of its total inconsistency with the principles of the constitution neither in england or any of the colonies is there one law directly in favor of or enacting slavery but by a kind of sidewind admitting its existence though only founded on a barbarous custom originated by foreigners attempt its regulation how far the point litigated in  somersets case would bear a fober candid discussion before an impartial judicature in the colonies i cannot determine but for the credit of my country should hope it would meet with a like decision that it might appear and be known that liberty in america is not a partial privilege but extends to every individual in it  i might here in the language of the famous james otis esquire ask is it possible for a man to have a natural right to make a slave of himself or of his posterity what man is or ever was born free if every man is not can a father supersede the laws of nature is not every man born as free by nature as his father   american tracts by otis   there can be no prescription old enough to supersede the law of nature and the grant of god almighty who has given to every man a natural right to be free american tracts by otis    the colonists are by the law of nature free born as indeed all men are white or black no better reason can be given for the enslaving those of any color than such as baron montesquieu has humourously assigned as the foundation of that cruel slavery exercised over the poor ethiopeans which threatens one day to reduce both europe and america to the ignorance and barbarity of the darkest ages does it follow that it is right to enslave a man because he is black will short curled hair like wool instead of christians hair as it is called by those whose hearts are as hard as the nether millstone help the argument can any logical inference in favor of slavery be drawn from a flat nose a long or a short face nothing better can be said in favor of a trade that is the most shocking violation of the laws of nature has a direct tendency to diminish every idea of the inestimable value of liberty and makes every dealer in it a tyrant from the director of an african company to the petty chapman in needles and pins on the unhappy coast d         to those who think slavery founded in scripture a careful and attentive perusal of the sacred writings would contribute more than any thing to eradicate the error they will not find even the name slave once mentioned therein and applied to a servitude to be continued from parent to child in perpetuity with approbation  the term used on the occasion in the sacred text is servant and upon a fair construction of those writings there is no necessity nor can the service consistent with the whole tenor of the scripture be extended further than the generation spoken of it was never intended to include the posterity  the mistaken proverb which prevailed in that early age that the fathers had eaten four grapes and the childrens teeth were set on edge was rectified by the prophets jeremiah and ezekiel who declared to the people that they should not have occasion to use that proverb any more  behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so the soul of the son the soul that sins it shall die  the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son  the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him jer xxxi    ezekiel xviii     and  0 and the apostle peter assures us after the ascension of our savior that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fears him is accepted of him acts x    it is also remarkable that at that time an ethiopean a man of great authority acts viii    was admitted to the freedom of a christian whatever we may think of the color now as being unworthy of it  but admitting slavery to be established by scripture the command of the sovereign ruler of the universe whose eye takes in all things and who for good reasons beyond our comprehension might justly create a perpetual slavery to effect his own purposes against the enemies of his chosen people in that day cannot be pleaded now against any people on earth it is not even pretended to in justification of negro slavery nor can the sons of ethiopia with any degree of clearness be proved to have descended from any of those nations who so came under the divine displeasure as to be brought into servitude if they are and those denunciations given in the old testament were perpetual and continue in force must we not look upon it meritorious to execute them fully upon all the offspring of that unhappy people upon whom they fell without giving quarter to any  many who admit the indefensibility of slavery considering the subject rather too superficially declare it would be impolitick to emancipate those we are possessed of and say they generally behave ill when set at liberty i believe very few of the advocates for freedom think that all ought to be manumitted nay think it would be unjust to turn out those who have spent their prime of life and now require a support but many are in a fit capacity to do for themselves and the public as to these let every master or mistress do their duty and leave consequences to the disposer of events who i believe will always bless our actions in proportion to the purity of their spring but many instances might be given of negroes and mulattoes once in slavery who after they have obtained their liberty and sometimes even in a state of bondage have given striking proofs of their integrity ingenuity industry tenderness and nobility of mind of which if the limits of this little piece permitted i could mention many examples and why instances of this kind are not more frequent we may very naturally impute to the smallness of the number tried with freedom and the servility and meanness of their education whilst in slavery let us never forget that an equal if not a greater proportion of our own color behave worse with all the advantages of birth education and circumstances and we shall blush to oppose an equitable emancipation by this or the like arguments  liberty the most manly and exalting of the gifts of heaven consists in a free and generous exercise of all the human faculties as far as they are compatible with the good of society to which we belong and the most delicious part of the enjoyment of the inestimable blessing lies in a consciousness that we are free this happy persuasion when it meets with a noble nature raises the soul and rectifies the heart it gives dignity to the countenance and animates every word and gesture it elevates the mind above the little arts of deceit makes it benevolent open ingenuous and just and adds a new relish to every better sentiment of humanity blackwells court of agustus on the contrary man is bereaved of half his virtues that day when he is cast into bondage homer   the end of the christian dispensation with which we are at present favored appears in our saviors own words the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord luke iv      the editor is united in opinion with the author of the essay that slavery is contrary to the laws of reason and the principles of revealed religion and believes it alike inimical and impolitick in every state and country for as righteousness exalts a nation so sm is a reproach to any people prove xiv    hence whatever violates the purity of equal justice and the harmony of true liberty in time debases the mind and ultimately draws down the displeasure of that almighty being who is of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on iniquity habakkuk i    yet he is far from censuring those who are not under the same convictions and hopes to be understood with charity and tenderness to all every one does not see alike the same propositions who may be equally friends to truth as our education and opportunities of knowledge are various as our faces he will heartily confess to any one who shall kindly point it out any error which in this inquiry has fell from his pen there can be but one beatific point of rectitude but many paths leading to it in which persons differing in modes and nonessentials may walk with freedom to their own opinions we may much more innocently be under a mistake than continue in it after a hint given which occasions our adverting thereto for it seems a duty to investigate the way of truth and justice with our utmost ability  a much more extensive and perfect view of the subject under consideration has of late prevailed than formerly and he believes nothing is wanting but an impartial disinterested attention to make still greater advances thus by a gradual progression he hopes the name of slavery will be eradicated by the general voice of mankind in this land of liberty  the mode of manumitting negroes in new jersey is such as appears terrific and amounts almost to a prohibition because of its incumbering consequences which few prudent people choose to leave their families liable to it is much easier in several other colonies in pennsylvania a recognizance entered into in thirty pounds to indemnify the township is a complete discharge in maryland where negroes are so numerous i am informed the master or mistress may at pleasure give liberty to their slaves without the least obligation and be clear of any future burden both these are exceptionable and may be improved proper distinctions are necessary for as the freedom of all gratis might be unjust not only to the public but the slave so any clog upon the owner who gives up his right at an age when he cannot have received much or any advantage from the labor of the individual would be unreasonable the wisdom of a legislature earnestly disposed to do good will i hope be directed to surmount every little difficulty in pointing out a scheme more equal and perfect by steering a middle course and proper care being kindly taken to assist and provide for the usefulness of those deserving objects of benevolence the approbation of divine providence will i doubt not attend such laudable endeavors and crown them with success  that the legislative body of each province in america may give due attention to this important engaging subject and be blessed to frame and establish a plan worthy of the united jurisprudence wisdom and benevolence of the guardians of liberty is the sincere wish of  the editor  an essay on slavery etc areverend author mr thomas thompson m a has lately attempted to prove that the african trade for negro slaves is consistent with the principles of humanity and revealed religion  from leviticus xxv    to    he draws his principal conclusion viz that the buying and selling of slaves is not contrary to the law of nature for says he the jewish constitutions were strictly therewith consistent in all points and these are in certain cases the rule by which is determined by learned lawyers and casuists what is or is not contrary to nature i have not leisure to follow this author methodically but will nevertheless examine his ground in a general way in order to prevent any ill use that may be made of it against the important question now depending before the judges meaning i suppose the case of somerset which then depended   the reverend mr thompson s premises are not true for the jewish constitutions were not strictly consistent with the law of nature in all points as he supposes and consequently his principal conclusion thereupon is erroneous many things were formerly tolerated among the israelites merely through the mercy and forbearance of god in consideration of their extreme frailty and inability at that time to bear a more perfect system of law other laws there are in the five books besides the ceremonial laws now abrogated which are merely municipal being adapted to the peculiar polity of the israelitish commonwealth on account of its situation in the midst of the most barbarous nations whom the hebrews were at all times but too much inclined to imitate  the universal moral laws and those of natural equity are indeed every where plentifully interspersed among the peculiar laws abovementioned but they may very easily be distinguished by every sincere christian who examines them with a liberal mind because the benevolent purpose of the divine author is always apparent in those laws which are to be eternally binding for it is the reason of the law which constitutes the life of the law according to an allowed maxim of our own country ratio legis est anima legis jenk cent    and with respect to these moral and equitable laws i will readily agree with the reverend mr thompson that they are the best rule by which learned judges and casuists can determine what is or is not contrary to nature  but i will now give a few examples of laws which are in themselves contrary to nature or natural equity in order to show that mr thompson s premises are totally false  the israelites were expressly permitted by the law of moses to give a bill of divorce to their wives whenever they pleased and to marry other women and the women who were put away were also expressly permitted by the mosaic law to marry again during the lives of their former husbands  all which practices were manifestly contrary to the law of nature in its purity though not perhaps to the nature of our corrupt affections and desires for christ himself declared that from the beginning it was not so matt xix     and at the same time our lord informed the jews that moses because of the hardness of their hearts suffered them to put away their wives  neither was it according to the law of nature that the jews were permitted in their behavior and dealings to make a partial distinction between their brethren of the house of israel and strangers this national partiality was not indeed either commanded or recommended in their law  but it was clearly permitted or tolerated and probably for the same reason as the last mentioned instance  thou shall not lend upon usury to thy brother etc  unto a stranger thou may lend upon usury etc deuteronomy xxiii     again  of a foreigner thou may exact that is whatsoever has been lent as appears by the preceding verses but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release deuteronomy xv    now all these laws were contrary to the law of nature or natural equity whatever mr thompson may think and were certainly annulled or rather superseded as it were by the more perfect doctrines of universal benevolence taught by christ himself who came not to destroy but to fulfill the law  in the law of moses we also read thou shall not avenge or bear grudge against the children of thy people but thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself leviticus xix     the jews accordingly thought themselves sufficiently justified if they confined this glorious perfection of charity viz the loving others as themselves to the persons mentioned in the same verse viz the children of their own people for they had no idea that so much love could possibly be due to any other sort of neighbors or brethren but christ taught them by the parable of the good samaritan that all strangers whatever even those who are declared enemies as were the samaritans to the jews are to be esteemed our neighbors or brethren whenever they stand in need of our charitable assistance  the jewish institution indeed as mr thompson remarks permitted the use of bondservants but did not permit the bondage of brethren strangers only could be lawfully retained as bondmen  of the heathen or more agreeably to the hebrew word  of the nations that are round about you of them shall ye buy bond men and bond maids moreover of the children of strangers that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy etc   they shall be your bondmen forever levit xxv    to     this was the law i must acknowledge with respect to a stranger that was purchased but with respect to a brother or hebrew of the seed of abraham it was far otherwise as the same chapter testifies   th verse for if thy brother that dwells by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him etc this was the utmost servitude that a hebrew could lawfully exact from any of his brethren of the house of israel unless the servant entered voluntarily into a perpetual servitude and let me add that it is also the very utmost servitude that can lawfully be admitted among christians because we are bound as christians to esteem every man our brother and our neighbor which i have already proved so that this consequence which i have drawn is absolutely unavoidable the jews indeed who do not yet acknowledge the commands of christ may perhaps still think themselves justified by the law of moses in making partial distinctions between their brethren of israel and other men but it would be inexcusable in christians to do so and therefore i conclude that we certainly have no right to exceed the limits of servitude which the jews were bound to observe whenever their poor brethren were sold to them and i apprehend that we must not venture even to go so far because the laws of brotherly love are infinitely enlarged and extended by the gospel of peace which proclaims good will toward men without distinction and because we cannot be said to love our neighbors as ourselves or to do to others as we would they should do unto us  whilst we retain them against their will in a despicable servitude as slaves and private property or mere chattels  the glorious system of the gospel destroys all narrow national partiality and makes us citizens of the world by obliging us to profess universal benevolence but more especially are we bound as christians to commiserate and assist to the utmost of our power all persons in distress or captivity whatever the worshipful committee of the company of merchants trading to africa may think of it or their advocate the reverend mr thompson  charity indeed begins at home and we ought most certainly to give the preference to our own countrymen whenever we can do so without injustice but we may  not do evil that good may come though our statesmen and their political deceivers may think otherwise we must not for the sake of oldengland and its african trade or for the supposed advantage or imaginary necessities of our american colonies lay aside our christian charity which we owe to all the rest of mankind because whenever we do so we certainly deserve to be considered in no better light than as an overgrown society of robbers a mere banditti who perhaps may love one another but at the same time are at enmity with all the rest of the world is this according to the law of nature  for shame mr thompson  i have much more to communicate but no more time to write  if i had i could draw from the scriptures the most alarming examples of gods severe judgments upon the jews for tyrannizing over their brethren and expressly for exceeding the limits of servitude just now mentioned i must find time however to adopt one observation even from the reverend mr thompson p    viz this subject will grow more serious upon our hands when we consider the buying and selling negroes not as a clandestine or piratical business but as an open public trade encouraged and promoted by acts of parliament for so if being contrary to religion it must be deemed a national sin and as such may have a consequence that would be always to be dreaded may god give us grace to repent of this abominable national oppression before it is too ate  if i have vindicated the law of moses much easier can i vindicate the benevolent apostle paul from mr thompsons insinuations with respect to slavery for he did not entreat philemon to take back his servant onesimus in his former capacity as mr thompson has asserted in order to render bondage consistent with the principles of revealed religion  but st paul said expressly not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved etc so that mr thompson has notoriously wrested st pauls words  in the other texts where st paul recommends submission to servants for conscience sake he at the same time enjoins the master to entertain such a measure of brotherly love toward his servants as must be entirely subversive of the african trade and westindian slavery and though st paul recommends christian patience under servitude yet at the same time he plainly insinuates that it is inconsistent with christianity and the dignity of christs kingdom that a christian brother should be a slave can thou be made free says he to the christian servants choose it rather for he that is called of the lord being a servant is the freeman of the lord and in like manner he that is called being free is the servant of christ  ye are bought with a price be not therefore the servants of men the apostle indeed had just before recommended to his disciples to abide in the same calling wherein they were called and being servants not to care for it that is not to grieve on account of their temporal state for he was unwilling to advance any doctrine that might seem to interfere with the temporal establishments of government and the supposed rights of men yet it plainly appears by the insinuations which immediately follow that he thought it derogatory to the honor of christianity that men who are bought with the inestimable price of christs blood should be esteemed servants that is the slaves and private property of other men and had christianity been established by temporal authority in those countries where paul preached as it is at present in these kingdoms we need not doubt but that he would have urged nay compelled the masters as he did philemon by the most pressing arguments to treat their quondam slaves not now as servants but above servants  as brethren beloved  an elegy on the miserable state of an african slave by the celebrated and ingenious william shenstone esquire  see the poor native quit the lybian shores ah not in loves
